Populations of bees, spiders, ground beetles and hoverflies have declined twice as fast on land farmed for crops in the past 30 years, despite funding for more sustainable farming methods

Conservation measures over the past 30 years have failed to stop the decline of insects on British farmland, a new report shows. Populations of bees, spiders, ground beetles and hoverflies have disappeared twice as fast in areas intensely farmed for crops, according to the paper, which looked at citizen science data on more than 1,500 invertebrate species.

Although there was a push to intensify agriculture after the second world war, since the early 90s more sustainable and wildlife-friendly farming practices have emerged, with EU agri-environment funding made available for farmers to plant hedgerows and wild flowers, alongside better regulation of pesticides. However, these have not managed to stem biodiversity loss.

""In fact, for most of the taxonomic groups included in this study, declines appear to have accelerated over recent years,"" the researchers write in the paper Invertebrate Biodiversity Continues to Decline in Cropland, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

The study suggests that, despite having impact locally, wildlife-friendly farming measures have not been employed on a big enough scale to have an impact nationally. However, the scientists believe that post-Brexit changes to UK agricultural policy could help farming to achieve those goals.

Lead researcher Francesca Mancini, from the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said: ""The main message to policymakers is that despite the efforts we have put in in the last 30 years, this is just not enough. We really need to review what we've done and try to do better for the future for diversity, but also for the future of agriculture.""

Insects are crucial to ecosystems because they provide food for other creatures, pollinate crops and recycle nutrients.

The study compared areas in Britain with high and low cropland cover and found that declines are worse in areas with high cropland cover. The researchers divided Britain into 1 sq km cells that were categorised depending on how much cropland - predominantly oilseed rape and cereals such as barley - was being grown within them. They did not look at land used to graze animals.

In areas with more than 50% cropland cover, invertebrate species had disappeared from 5% of sites that were occupied in 1990, while in areas with less than 50% cropland cover, they had disappeared from 2% of sites.

Out of the six taxonomic groups examined, spiders and bees were the most negatively affected in areas with more than 50% cropland cover, showing a 7% and 4% decline respectively. Researchers suspect declines were worse before 1990, but lack sufficient data.

""They are pretty sizeable declines,"" said Mancini. ""Because of the introduction of environment schemes and the improvement of policy and practice since the 1990s, we were hoping that we would find a slowing down or trends becoming stable. But that's not the case, and things are still declining.""

The paper suggested a number of possibilities, including the general intensification of agriculture, changes to the type and efficacy of insecticides, habitat loss around cropland, and the climate crisis and other weather-related events such as drought.

In 2019, a global scientific analysis of insect decline concluded that agriculture was the main cause - in particular, the heavy use of pesticides. The mass of insects is falling by 2.5% a year, which means they could vanish within a century.

The new findings mirror those of a study last month, which showed intensive agriculture was the greatest driver of bird declines in Europe, with the use of pesticides and fertilisers most to blame, according to the data collected by thousands of citizen scientists in 28 countries - including the UK - over nearly 40 years.

""Sadly, insect declines are not surprising,"" said Prof Jane Hill from the University of York, who is president of the Royal Entomological Society and was not involved in this research. ""The findings help us to understand the patterns of insect declines, and so contribute to solving the puzzle of how to protect invertebrates and reverse declines.""

A study is under way in the water-scarce region to see if commodity farmers can use the regenerative technique of cover cropping as a way to adapt to rapidly changing weather conditions

In one of the toughest growing regions in the US, commercial farmers like Frank Machac are experimenting with a style of ancient agriculture more known for soil health than profit.

They are perhaps unlikely budding agroecologists. ""My number one concern is yield, I'm not worrying about climate change,"" said Machac, 60, a ruddy-faced straight talker with 30 years' farming experience in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV).

Machac is among a group of farmers decked in sturdy boots and faded jeans gathered around a mini weather station in a hot and muddy field of sorghum - an ancient nutritious grain grown for cattle field on commercial farms across the RGV.

The 400-acre field is part of a real-farm collaborative research project to figure out how - or if - cover cropping, a regenerative agricultural technique, can help commodity farmers become more climate resilient.

""If cover crops can make agriculture more sustainable without me losing money, then it can't hurt, but we have to get it right,"" said Machac, who currently rents 3,000 acres across Hidalgo county, Texas.

Cover crops are planted between growing periods for cash crops - grains, legumes, vegetables and fruits farmed to sell or eat - to nourish and stabilise the soil rather than leave it exposed. It's an ancient practice being heavily promoted by the US government, as a way to help 21st-century farmers mitigate and adapt to rapidly changing weather conditions.

But cover cropping poses particular challenges in this water-scarce region where around half the farmland depends exclusively on rainfall - and many are climate skeptics.

For the past two years, portable weather monitors measuring temperature, rainfall and soil moisture have been collecting data across the field which is flanked by disused oil rigs and mesquite trees. Between July and December, half was covered in iron clay cowpeas and sunn hemp, heat- and drought-tolerant nitrogen-rich legumes, while the other half was farmed as usual - with no off-season cover crop - as a side-by-side control.

It is one of four farms in four adjacent counties that are currently enrolled in the study led by Alexis Racelis, program director of the agroecology and resilient food systems program at University of Texas RGV. Racelis and his crew of international students also collect data on yield, nitrogen content, soil stability, pollinators and microbes - good and bad.

In November 2022, cattle belonging to rancher and landowner Betty Perez (who rents to Machac) were herded into the fenced research field to chomp on the legumes and fertilise the soil in their own way for about a month. The 30 or so cows and a few calves loved the cowpea, which is around 25% protein, but not so much the sunn hemp - a view shared by Machac, who found its long taproots hard (and expensive) to get rid of. ""Never again, I'll stick to cowpea!""

Perez, 71, who was recently forced to sell several cows to make ends meet after a long dry spell sent hay prices soaring, is optimistic about the benefits. ""It was an extra field of food, which I really needed ""¦ Also these fields have been farmed for so long, it's ruining the land and we're losing water because of the erosion. This is exciting, but I know a couple of years won't solve it.""

The study is already at the halfway mark (unless the funding is renewed), and this field day was an opportunity to share the results so far - positive and negative - with the participant farmers, and others considering taking part, as well as USDA officials promoting cover cropping across the region.

It's early days, but the good news so far is that cover crops prevent wind erosion, improve soil health and increase the diversity of pollinators and good microbes. The bad news is that when there's not enough rain at the right time - as happens frequently in this water-limited region, the legumes steal the scarce water which impacts the cash crop yield.

It's a mixed bag and more regionally relevant data is needed.

""The science supporting cover crops in the RGV is very underdeveloped, and we need to change that so farmers know what makes sense for them. How do we help commodity farmers transition to more sustainable techniques in the valley, where water is the number one limiting factor and where conditions are more like Costa Rica than Nebraska?"" said Racelis.

The RGV is located on a floodplain near the mouth of the Rio Grande, a hot and humid region that stretches across the southern tip of Texas and northern Tamaulipas in Mexico, where the weather is notoriously unpredictable and ultra-localised.

Thanks to the subtropical conditions and short mild winter, valley farmers can grow a wide range of fruits (citrus, melons, strawberries, tomatoes) and more than 40 vegetables (onions, peppers, asparagus, cabbage, spinach), as well as commodities like sugar cane, cotton, corn, sunflowers and sesame.

In recent weeks some fields in some farms were hit hard by hailstorms, 80mph winds and torrential rainfall - which came after a prolonged dry spell that forced some to delay planting and sell off skinny cattle.

Scientists warn that global heating will likely exacerbate weather extremes and soil erosion - a major issue due to the valley's brutal winds, over-farming and unchecked deforestation.

The valley has been getting gradually hotter since the 1980s, but temperature rise has accelerated since 2010 - mirroring global heating trends. In McAllen, the largest city in Hidalgo county, the number of very hot days, when the average temperature hits at least 100F (37.7C), has gone from zero to 26, according to National Weather Service (NWS) data comparing 1981 to 2010 with 1991 to 2020. If the trend continues, modelling suggests there could be a hundred 100F days by 2060.

Rainfall patterns are also getting more extreme - from flood to drought and back again - though there's not quite enough data to attribute this directly to global heating, according to Barry Goldsmith, a NWS meteorologist.

Drought poses a problem for all farmers, but particularly for dryland (rainfall dependent) farmers with no irrigation.

""It's dry, it's hot, it's unpredictable, this has always been one of the hardest places to farm,"" said Hunter Wilde, who farms sugar cane, corn, cotton and grains on 14,000 acres in neighbouring Willacy county.

Over the years, USDA programs encouraging farmers and ranchers to reduce environmental harms and integrate conservation into working lands have come and gone with varying success.

The latest boost comes via the Inflation Reduction Act which includes $20bn to help farmers implement climate-smart agricultural practices like cover cropping and reduced tillage, and crop rotation to improve resilience to rapidly changing climate conditions - and reduce the sector's greenhouse gas footprint.

Cover cropping was used by farmers to improve soil health in ancient China and India, the Roman empire, and by both Indigenous Americans and the founding fathers - in fact the practice was commonplace in farming globally including the US until the Green Revolution ushered in widespread use of monocrops, synthetic fertilisers and pesticides.

It's the hot new (old) thing, as cover crops sequester carbon from the atmosphere and can boost climate flexibility by absorbing excess water when it rains too much or holding onto it during drier periods.

In the RGV, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), a USDA agency, can use IRA funds to pay farmers $37 per acre to plant cover crops on up 1,000 acres through 2026 - or a smaller fee to landowners to establish cover crops with renters.

But what works in small plots or on large scale commercial farms in the midwest - where the vast majority of American research into cover crops has taken place - is not directly applicable to the very particular conditions of the RGV.

Cover crops may be easy to grow in Nebraska and Ohio where there's plenty of water and the winter freeze will kill them off. But here the water situation is so tight that cover crops can leave cash crops stunted, while the mild winter means termination requires tillage and weedkiller.

Still, most farmers want to do better, and Wilde began experimenting with cover crops eight or so years ago after watching a video by Gabe Brown, a rancher and pioneer of the American soil health movement from North Dakota.

Soon after he and his buddy Travis Johnson connected with Racelis at UT, and through trial and error figured out that only a handful of cover crops are suitable for the valley's searing summer heat - and even these need to be planted several inches under the topsoil using modified machinery most farmers don't have.

If farmers terminate the cover crop too late, it could become a weed and steal too much water; if they terminate too soon, they may lose out on nitrogen and other benefits that boost yields and help balance the books.

""It's been a long rough ride and I've not seen the benefits so far. I have a duty to take care of the land, but I also have a family to feed and can't keep haemorrhaging money,"" said Wilde, 34, whose experimental field depends on rainfall.

""The results have to show higher yields or reduced costs, that's the bottom line. I am out if this doesn't work, maybe it's just time to move onto the next thing.""

Johnson urges him to keep an open mind. Five years ago Johnson, 44, planted sunn hemp as a cover crop on one irrigated field, which has consistently produced above average yields (for different crops) ever since. Neither he nor the UT team know exactly why, but access to irrigation likely played a role.

""Pretending we can grow the same things in the same way everywhere - whether it's cash crops or cover crops - is increasingly weird and not working. We need datasets to inform farmers in geographical and climate specific ways, rather than the USDA just pushing cover crops on dry land farmers,"" said Stephanie Kasper, a crop scientist with the agroecology program.

The UT study, which is funded by the NRCS, pays farmers $70 per acre - twice what they pay farmers directly - though even that barely covers the full costs. So far, cover crops combined with livestock (prohibited for direct NRCS recipients) has produced the highest soil health scores, but it's too early to make firm recommendations.

At 26, Reece Teplicek is a rare thing in the valley, an ambitious young farmer who wants to grow the family business rather than selling out to ranchers or developers. Softly spoken and farm skinny, Teplicek is all in with the study, and has dedicated 500 acres that last season was half-covered with cowpea, sunn hemp and sorghum sudangrass, diverse cover crops, to attract diverse bugs, said Teplicek.

The sorghum in the cover crop field is smaller, due to the water guzzled by the legumes, but there are fewer weeds and pests, and more nitrogen in the soil. But the biggest benefit so far has been reduced wind erosion, which usually costs Teplicek 100 acres of crops each year. This farmland was once covered in mesquites and other drought adapted native species, but is now dotted with eroded sandy hills.

""I'm too young to know if this is climate change or normal weather patterns, but unpredictability is our biggest problem, and anyone who farms here will tell you that,"" said Teplicek, a graduate in soil and crop science. ""The more information we have the better, but if the numbers add up, I'll apply cover crops across the farm. This is a long game, it's going to take time to improve the soil.""

I haven't eaten octopus in years, yet being smart shouldn't make them exceptions. All animals need protection from unnecessary suffering

The collective noun for a group of octopuses, in case you were wondering, is a consortium - not, as some wags might tell you, a seafood buffet.

I myself don't eat octopus, and have made a lot of noise about why: they're as smart as parrots, their brain is spread over their arms, they are many millions of years older than we are - don't you know that, of all the species on Earth, only they and we share a high-resolution camera eye?

So it was with no pleasure that I read that plans for the world's first-ever commercial octopus farm appear to be progressing. A proposal has been submitted to authorities in the Canary Islands for a facility in Las Palmas that would produce 3,000 tonnes of octopus each year for export.

According to documents seen by the BBC, the company Nueva Pescanova proposes raising 1 million animals in around 1,000 communal tanks - evening out to 10 to 15 octopuses per cubic metre, or 80-120 legs.

Personally, I don't see them going quietly. Past attempts to farm octopuses have failed because (along with challenges feeding the larvae) they have proved simply too unwieldy to contain. They can squeeze themselves through any hole that can fit their beak, which is about the width of a 50p coin. They are not only dextrous, but strong, capable of opening screw-top jars and lifting heavy tank lids. They can also survive up to half an hour out of water: long enough to make a dash for it through a drainpipe.

Scientists have struggled to keep even one or two individuals in captivity without being outwitted. A proposal to house 1 million, then, reads more like one of Kafka's aphorisms than a real-life business plan (""A tank went in search of a cephalopod"").

But even if it does prove possible to farm octopuses, the question is - should we?

There isn't an obvious need. Relative to many marine species, octopuses are adapting quickly to the changing oceans, and there seems no immediate risk of overfishing. Farming would be more of a toll on the environment, causing both toxic run-off into local waters and more fish to be caught for food - plus it is inevitably more cruel.

Fishers dispatch of their octopus catch with a club to the head or a knife to the central brain: instant, but not very scalable. Nueva Pescanova proposes killing its octopuses by immersing them in water kept at -3C. A 2009 study of this ""live chilling"" of farmed turbot found it to be ""highly questionable"", causing stress and potentially severe pain before death.

Even for fish, it's an undeniably grisly process - but, of course, the reason that people are up in arms over farming of octopus, and not turbot, is because of the creatures' intelligence. It's long been understood that octopuses are among the smartest of animals, named alongside dolphins, crows and apes. In captivity, they have shown themselves capable of navigating mazes, completing complex tasks and even recognising individual humans. The Oscar-winning Netflix documentary My Octopus Teacher further impressed on audiences their exceptionalism.

Seven years after publicising my own stance on the subject, I still don't eat cephalopods. But my thinking has expanded: I am no longer sure that an animal being intelligent is a good reason not to eat it.

Even in the past decade, we've come a long way in understanding what animals are capable of - including ones we have systematically underestimated. Every new Attenborough series captures some astonishing behaviour that has never been seen before, and not just in the usual suspects, the orcas and macaws - but among fish, birds and even insects.

It's becoming increasingly obvious that the very concept of ""animal intelligence"" is fraught, judged as it is by human standards. Tool use has been a historic measure, for example - but that favours animals with hands or beaks. Only relatively recently have scientists accepted that fish invent tools, making them arguably more resourceful than animals of great dexterity.

Squid and cuttlefish may be as smart as octopuses, their close relations, but just lacking the arms to show it off. As one scientist put it last year: ""If people studied mantis shrimps the way they study octopuses, they would be really blown away at how smart they are."" It just goes to show that we privilege those species we can see ourselves in, or care enough to study.

Even our definitions of sentience can be ridiculously arbitrary: octopuses are still not included under US animal welfare laws because they are invertebrates, meaning they lack a backbone. The UK government recognised octopuses, crabs and lobsters as sentient beings in November 2021 - but with no change to fishing practices or in restaurant kitchens. The law recognises that lobsters can feel pain, but it's still not a crime to boil them alive.

It just goes to show how self-congratulatory our thinking on animal intelligence can be: favouring those species that we find exceptional, or relatable, but rarely in a way that does them any good. There are real costs to this human superiority complex for us, too, as evinced by the recent pandemic and the existential threat of the climate crisis.

I'm convinced that the path forward is not making exceptions for octopuses, and other species that we deem worthy, but prioritising an inhabitable Earth for all of us. The arc of the moral universe is surely bending towards less exploitation of living beings, less net suffering - regardless of their intelligence.

That looks like multinational corporations such as Nueva Pescanova taking responsibility for what looks more and more like cruel and polluting factory farming; governments such as the authorities in the Canary Islands rejecting such farms in their jurisdictions; and individuals eating higher-quality meat, and less of it overall - and octopus only when it's been locally caught.

A prerequisite to living sustainably is a sense of proportion; an understanding of ourselves as just another life form on the planet. We have been fortunate to enjoy a Homo sapiens supremacy for many millions of years - but, heaven forbid, should it ever be upended, I hope we know better than to look to proficiency with tools as the test of acceptable suffering.

On the Isle of Wight Hollie Fallick and Francesca Cooper are part of a movement to bring tired and depleted soil back to life - and boost food security

Hollie Fallick looks over Brading on the Isle of Wight, at a patchwork of fields bordered by ancient oaks, which stretches to the Solent. ""We still have to pinch ourselves every day,"" says the 30-year-old, as she surveys the 50 hectares (125 acres) she farms with her best friend, Francesca Cooper, 34.

The friends - who have five young children between them, were both vegan for a period, and are lifelong environmental activists - are not typical livestock farmers. And they don't practise typical farming: instead they are part of a growing global movement practising regenerative agriculture - or regen ag for short.

""Really simply, regenerative agriculture is nature-friendly farming,"" says Fallick, who says she stopped being vegan when her health suffered. ""It's thinking about the health of soil, animals, humans and how they all link together.""

On Nunwell home farm, which sits alongside land the pair manage for the Wildlife Trust and produces meat and eggs for their direct-to-consumer business, chickens peck away alongside belted Galloway cows, nomadic pigs graze on grass as well as kale and bean ""cover crops"" sown to boost nutrients in the soil.

The idea is that by following the basic principles of regen ag - not disturbing the soil, keeping it covered, maintaining living roots, growing a diverse range of crops and the use of grazing animals - they can regenerate tired and depleted soil and produce nutritious food. The work, they argue, is urgent. Up to 40% of the world's land is now degraded by industrial and harmful farming methods, according to the UN, while a recent study suggested improving soil could keep the world within the 1.5C heating target.

The pair - who make bank transfers from the quad bike, listen to regen ag podcasts while moving cattle and share ideas with likeminded farmers on WhatsApp groups - also promote their message and products in relentlessly upbeat Instagram reels. Do they see themselves as ""farmfluencers""?

""We're part of a really exciting movement, and we want to spread the word,"" says Cooper. ""And this way of farming is really sexy - I've been to plenty of other farms, and I wouldn't share them on Instagram.""

This year more than 6,500 people turned up to Groundswell - a sort of Glastonbury for regen ag farmers - which had just 400 attenders to its first event in 2016. The first Scottish Groundswell opened a month later.

""The trend is definitely on the up,"" says Alex Cherry, who worked in the City before returning to his family farm and starting Groundswell. ""There's a lot of conventional farmers who are now at least trying to adopt one or two of the principles.""

He argues that the movement's momentum is unstoppable. In the EU, reforms to the common agricultural policy (CAP) came into force in January, with the bloc's Farm to Fork strategy aiming to reduce fertiliser use by 20% and halve chemical pesticides and soil nutrient loss.

In the UK the government last year replaced CAP farm subsidies - which were based on the amount of land farmed - with environmental land management payments, which reward actions that protect the environment. In Scotland, where agriculture policy is devolved, the government's Vision for Agriculture aims for the country to become a ""global leader in sustainable and regenerative agriculture"".

Many farmers are also starting to look at their bottom line as the price of fuel and fertiliser rockets and more funding becomes available, says Martin Lines, the chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network and a third generation farmer in Cambridgeshire. A 2018 study of 20 US farms found that while those using regenerative systems experienced a drop in yields of 29%, profitability increased by 78%.

Lines says his farm has reduced fuel use by 65% and its herbicide and fungicide bill by 70% and 60% respectively. ""We're making more money,"" he says, simply. ""Ten years ago that was not the case.""

But this new breed of farmers will have to ""stack enterprises"" and fill out a lot more grant applications, he says. For example, a winter cover crop could garner payments from a water company, the government and a shepherd grazing their flock.

Among some more conventional, often older, farmers, there is resistance, he admits. Including from his own late father, who became increasingly agitated at their tractor sitting idle as they moved to a ""no-till"" system. ""The cure was to hide it,"" he says. ""Every time we weren't using it I parked on the neighbour's farm.""

The figures suggest early take-up of grants is small scale: in 2022, the year of its launch, 2,000 farmers signed up to the sustainable farming incentive scheme, which paid out £10,692,415 - just 0.44% of the overall £2.4bn farming budget.

The movement has also faced opposition, including from the environmentalist George Monbiot, who last month dismissed the claim that livestock grazing could help mitigate the impact of climate breakdown as ""climate science denial"".

Monbiot, who argues that farming should be replaced with factories growing food in labs from microbes and water using precision fermentation, has called regenerative grazing ""rebranded ranching"" and argued that small-scale farming will not produce enough food.

But regen ag farmers argue that food security can be achieved with better managed farms and eating habits - according to a 2021 UN report globally a third of food is never eaten. ""Farmers need to be producers of food not feed,"" says Lines.

Barnes Edwards, co-director of the Garlic Farm, which also farms regeneratively, argues that regen ag farmers recognise the ""hideously negative impact"" of badly managed livestock farming.

But they also argue ""it's the how, not the cow"", and say that cows pooing and trampling in diversely planted fields boosts soil health, micronutrients and attracts insects, birds and butterflies.

""Even if we don't eat them, cows can have a really helpful role in producing vegetables,"" he says.

Back on Nunwell home farm, around a battered kitchen table and holding mugs of steaming tea, Fallick and Cooper chat excitedly about their plans. They dream about producing a whole plate of food from the estate, and say they are in this for the long haul.

""Conventional farming has got us into this diversity crisis,"" says Fallick. ""Farmers have to be involved in sorting it out.""

Roughly a third of global greenhouse gas emissions are due to food systems, but Cop had avoided agreements until now

Food systems - what we eat; how we grow, ship and cook it; and how we dispose of (and sometimes waste) it - are responsible for roughly a third of global greenhouse gas emissions. But for the better part of three decades, the final agreements that emerge from the UN's yearly climate summits have left out the impact food systems have on our climate.

That changed this year in Dubai. The conference opened with a declaration on sustainable agriculture signed by more than 130 countries. For the first time ever, it featured a whole day devoted to food and agriculture and saw a food systems road map laid out by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Perhaps most strikingly, the final agreement document that was revealed at the end of the conference acknowledged sustainable agriculture as a part of responding appropriately to climate change.

The increased focus on food didn't just draw experts - it also drew big ag lobbyists eager to shape outcomes, and the final language didn't go as far as many sustainability advocates would have liked. But food was undeniably given a more prominent spot at the summit than it has been in years prior.

""It's really exciting that food is finally on the table. Now we have this ability to talk about food systems as a solution to the climate crisis in a way that we haven't ever had the chance to before,"" said Danielle Nierenberg, president of Food Tank, a non-profit thinktank.

The food system conversations at the climate summit started with a bang as the Cop28 presidency announced the Cop28 UAE Declaration on Sustainable Agriculture, Resilient Food Systems, and Climate Action, or the declaration for short. Though the declaration is not legally binding, the more than 150 countries that signed on by the end of the conference are essentially announcing their intentions to integrate food and agriculture into their climate plans.

""Countries must put food systems and agriculture at the heart of their climate ambitions, addressing both global emissions and protecting the lives and livelihoods of farmers living on the frontline of climate change,"" said Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, the UAE minister of climate change and environment and the Cop28 food systems lead.

Next, the FAO unveiled its new road map meant to outline the pathway required to bring the world's food production in line with global climate goals, in something of a parallel to the road map the International Energy Agency laid out for the energy transition in 2021. The FAO pathway emphasizes cutting methane emissions from livestock by 25% and halving food waste emissions by 2030, and recommends growing a more biodiverse range of crops than the world currently relies on.

Beyond the big announcements, the sense on the ground was that food was a bigger deal than ever. As a regular Cop attendee since Cop16 in CancÃºn, Mexico, in 2010, Nierenberg said she had seen the conversation around food shift significantly. She was particularly encouraged this year to feel like there was more interest in food from those working outside the sector. ""I think we broke down some silos. We weren't just preaching to the choir,"" she said.

Nierenberg said she walked away ""encouraged"" by the growing attention to food systems at the conference, and she appreciated that food systems were mentioned in the final agreement hammered out at the conference. But she also wished that the language in the final document had gone further.

Yvette Cabrera, a food waste expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, did too. ""One thing that a lot of food systems advocates and many of the countries that were behind the declaration wanted to see was some of the text and commitments in the declaration lifted into the final global stocktake language,"" she said.

That didn't happen. Instead, the final agreement sprinkled small mentions of food systems throughout, and largely couched conversations about food systems in the section focused on adaptation, rather than mitigation. While adaptation is ""very important, because we absolutely need to figure out what our future food system looks like, and be ready for that"", Cabrera said: ""We also need to take steps to mitigate the emissions that are happening now as well.""

Others put it more harshly. ""The glaring omission of food system transformation and agriculture emissions in the final text is a stark betrayal of urgency ""¦ We cannot afford another lost year for food and climate action,"" said Emile Frison, an expert speaking on behalf of the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems (IPES-Food).

The difference in attendees' summaries highlights the particular tightrope that always seems to accompany discussions of Cop - the line between trying to acknowledge progress that has been made, while also being realistic about how far there still is to go.

One barrier to meaningful progress that caused a buzz this year was the overrepresentation of corporate interests at the conference. Much like the fossil fuel lobbyists who argue that the world can't afford to do away with oil and gas if we want energy security, big ag lobbyists defend a current status quo that's actively heating up the planet in the name of food security.

Lobbyists were in full force at the summit in Dubai. Big meat and dairy lobbyists showed up in record numbers, with three times more agribusiness representatives present this year than last. Among their ranks were representatives from the meat supplier JBS, which has been linked to deforestation in the Amazon; the pesticide company Bayer, against the backdrop of lawsuits claiming that its weedkiller Roundup causes cancer; and the fertilizer giant Nutrien, which makes synthetic fertilizers from fossil fuels.

Amid a range of events on financing the regenerative agriculture transition and food waste reduction, there were also gatherings sponsored by the International Dairy Federation and the North American Meat Institute with titles such as How Animal Source Food Nourishes the World in Times of Climate Change.

""They're trying to convince people that, whether it's fertilizer or livestock, they're providing more solutions than they are failures or obstacles,"" said Nierenberg of agribusiness lobbyists. ""That's what the meat institute was doing in a big way - trying to change the narrative that livestock are a big contributor to climate change, even though they are responsible for at least 14% of emissions.""

While sustainable food system experts argue that there's an ""urgent need for reforms that limit corporate influence at UN climate meetings"", many still came away encouraged about the direction Cop is heading when it comes to conversations around food.

Nierenberg noted that the FAO already announced plans to build on its road map over the next two years, culminating at Cop30 in Brazil, which she said ""people are looking at as the place where we will make significant headway on how food and agriculture systems are talked about, and what ends up in the final global stocktake document"".

Cabrera hopes that the FAO road map, while not binding, might give countries a sense of how to move forward in integrating food systems into their climate goals in the meantime. She also hopes it might unlock more funding for food sector-based solutions, which currently receive only 3% of public climate finance.

For all the progress that still needs to be made, ""Frankly, I think it was a success,"" said Cabrera. ""I'm walking away feeling motivated about the final text, and also just the pure energy around food systems at Cop this year.""

Cop28 will discuss how global food production must become sustainable to stay within 1.5C

A third of the world's food production is at risk from the climate crisis, research has found - but at the same time our food systems are one of the key contributors to climate breakdown. Greenhouse gas emissions from farming and the land use change that often accompanies it, such as clearing forests and drying out wetlands to make room for crops and livestock, amount to more than a fifth of global carbon output, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

But discussions of the world's food systems, their vulnerability and their impacts, are confined to the sidelines of the annual UN climate change negotiations and given scant attention.

In part this is due to the divided nature of UN responsibilities, with food under the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which has its own summit machinery, such as the Food System Summit that took place in Rome in July. Climate is just one aspect of the threats to food systems, where economics and geopolitics traditionally play out very differently than in the climate talks.

This year promises to be different. For the first time there will be a dedicated food day, and food, agriculture and water will be the focus of at least 22 major events during the fortnight of Cop28 talks in Dubai, from 30 November to 13 December, presided over by the United Arab Emirates. There will also be a dedicated Food4Climate pavilion in ExpoCity, where the talks will be held.

For the first time, too, the FAO will outline how food systems must change for the world to stay within the globally agreed goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, beyond which the impacts of the climate crisis on food systems will rapidly become catastrophic, and in some cases potentially irreversible.

This research is expected to show that animal farming, for meat and dairy, must be reined back from its continued growth around the world, if targets to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 are to be met.

""Cops have, historically, significantly overlooked the role of farming, both as a major contributor to global climate change, as a potential solution to climate change, and also in the context of the significant impact climate change is having - and will have - on farming communities across the world,"" said Edward Davey of the World Resources Institute. If world leaders could come together to discuss commitments to looking at the link between food and climate, this would be historic, he said.

Any action would need to go far beyond a declaration, and include finance for adaptation and loss and damage to be directed towards smallholder farmers in the developing world, while farming subsidies in the west should be reformed to reduce methane emissions in particular, according to campaigners.

Davey said: ""For many countries in the wealthier parts of the world - such as the US and the EU - significant reductions in meat and dairy consumption should absolutely be part of the commitments our nations make to addressing the climate crisis. But for other, poorer nations, where rates of per capita meat and dairy consumption are often very low, the main story on food and farming is much more to do with food security, nutrition, adaptation and resilience; a dynamic which the proposed declaration addresses head on.""

It is worth noting that Sultan Al Jaber, the UAE's minister for advanced technology, as well as the chief executive of its national oil company, Adnoc, and the Cop president designate - a dual role for which he has been heavily criticised - takes a keen interest in food issues. He has told the Guardian in interviews that it is not enough to focus on the emissions from fossil fuels, and that emissions from all sectors, including agriculture and land use change, must be taken into account.

""It's not only oil and gas that contributes to climate change by the way. And you know that 30% comes from industry, another 30% comes from agriculture. We need to be a little careful here in defining the sources of carbon emissions. So we need to get the world to unite, in solidarity, against carbon emissions. We need to stay focused, laser focused on decarbonisation.""

Food experts caution that hi-tech solutions, no matter how appealing to politicians, must not be a substitute for tackling the real issue of western diets and their impact, in terms of methane from livestock production for food and dairy, and the waste and careless overuse of resources involved.

""From treating cow burps to robotic weeders, none of the false solutions on offer at Cop27 come close to stopping the industrial food production from being an engine of planetary destruction,"" said Raj Patel, food justice scholar and author of Stuffed and Starved. ""Agribusiness and governments offered a series of patented patches designed not to transform the food system, but to keep it the same.""

Campaigners will be hoping that Cop28 supplies instead a real discussion of why the current western diet, being exported around the world to developing and middle-income countries, is inherently unsustainable, and what can be done about that.

""How we farm sustainably and ensure the people that need food the most can get it, should be a major priority for leaders in Dubai,"" said Jennifer Larbie, the head of UK advocacy and campaigns at Christian Aid. ""The emissions from farming is a huge driver of the climate crisis and one which needs to be tackled at Cop28 if we are to keep global heating in check.""

Innovation in agricultural sector is needed if cities are to solve air pollution problems, say scientists

A study reveals that farming is responsible for more than a quarter of the particle pollution in UK cities.

UK agriculture created 38% of the particle pollution in Leicester, 32% in Birmingham and 25% in London in 2019, according to the study. In each case the contribution from rural agriculture was greater than all of the sources within the cities themselves.

Although low emission and clean air zones can be effective for local pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, particle pollution can linger in our air for a week or more. This allows particles to travel a long way from where they are produced. The study found that particle pollution from the rest of Europe also affected the UK, especially the south and east of England, but less so than the impact from our own farming.

Dr Jamie Kelly, who was part of the study team at University College London (UCL), said: ""We were surprised to find that ammonia from rural agricultural is so large. It is often the dominant source of particulate matter pollution in UK cities; even in cities as large as London. If the government is truly committed to addressing particulate pollution to improve public health, there need to be more ambitious measures to reduce ammonia emissions.""

Farming is the main cause of the springtime smog that affects western Europe each year. In 2014, Paris banned half of its traffic in a vain effort to control a spring smog. The health benefits from tacking agricultural ammonia are huge.

A study by Public Health England and the Met Office estimated that more than 1,600 people in the UK died early due to particle pollution in March and April 2014. The worst 10 days had an estimated 600 extra deaths and more than 1,500 extra hospital admissions. Many of these could have been avoided.

Key evidence for the new UK study comes from satellite data. Each morning and lunchtime, satellites pass over the UK and measure the ammonia beneath them. UK government estimates are about two-thirds to half those from the satellites. Areas with the greatest ammonia emissions include Northern Ireland and Norfolk.

Dr Eloise Marais from UCL said: ""Using two independent satellite instruments and a detailed model we found that ammonia from farming, in particular dairy cattle, is underestimated in the official inventories that inform policies and assess compliance with international emissions targets.""

Agricultural ammonia emissions have not reduced for more than a decade. Solving our urban air pollution problems will therefore require innovation in the countryside as much as solutions in our cities.

Farms are coming under increasing scrutiny due to their role in river pollution and in the production of gases such as methane that contribute to our climate emergency.

Less attention has been given to the role of farming in air pollution that harms our health. This impact comes from tiny particles created as ammonia from animal waste and fertiliser combines with air pollution from traffic and industry. New solutions are required from the farmers themselves.

The UK100 group of local government leaders has highlighted the opportunities for local councils to make a difference by helping farmers work together and through the tenanted farms that they own.

Exclusive: ex-officials at the Food and Agriculture Organization say its leadership censored and undermined them when they highlighted how livestock methane is a major greenhouse gas

The night before publication, Henning Steinfeld was halfway across the world dealing with panicked politicians and an outbreak of avian flu. His report, and how it would be received, was frankly the last thing on his mind.

With a small group of officials, Steinfield, head of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)'s livestock policy branch, had been working for months on a report analysing the link between the six major species of livestock and climate change, which they all knew could be explosive. ""I was very frustrated by the fact that the livestock-environment issue hadn't resonated even though people accepted in private that it was a big issue - for climate change, and also water and biodiversity,"" he said. ""But no one was interested in getting into it because I think they were afraid of what it could mean.""

Another FAO official, ""Michel Criollo"" (not his real name), remembered: ""No one wanted to go to the next step of saying agriculture is a problem for the planet and we need to mitigate it - including by potentially reducing production levels or changing things in less profitable ways.""

It was 2006. The issue of climate change was climbing the international agenda, although the bitter rows and collapsing dialogue of the Copenhagen summit were still three years in the future.

But although the link between climate change and fossil fuels was accepted and widely discussed, somehow the farming sector had managed to dodge the spotlight. Scientists were aware that the methane produced by grazing cattle - around two-thirds of livestock emissions come from cows - was a significant chunk of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases that were heating the planet's atmosphere. Still, there had been no attempt to quantify how large a chunk it might be; the scientific community was largely focused elsewhere, while politicians were finding it hard enough to cope with the political realities of reducing fossil fuel consumption.

The FAO was not the obvious candidate to jump into the breach. Founded in 1945 with the remit of ending hunger and improving nutrition by increasing agricultural - and livestock - production, it was a country-based organisation, which felt that part of its mission was to represent the industry rather than scrutinise it.

The small group of researchers who worked with Steinfeld had been discussing this issue for several years and felt the time was right to dig into it. But they knew that they would face resistance from the organisation and from beyond. ""Everyone knows that meat and other livestock products are closely connected to culture and ways of living,"" Steinfeld said, ""to traditions, beliefs, religion and identity issues that define people, and here we have something that challenges that.""

But none of them were quite prepared for the storm that broke over their heads when Livestock's Long Shadow (LLS) finally came out, cracking through the taboos. Now, for the first time, some of them have spoken to the Guardian about a period and a working culture in which, they say, they were censored, sabotaged, undermined and victimised. It is so unusual for officials working in a UN agency to allow a peek behind the scenes that almost all of them would only speak on condition of anonymity, still, to some extent, marked by the battles they fought while working at the FAO.

Livestock's Long Shadow was the first elementary lifecycle analysis for livestock and, crucially, the first tally of the meat and dairy sector's ecological cost. The report estimated that livestock were responsible for 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions - including nine percent of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, mostly due to deforestation for (pasture and) feed crops, 37% of anthropogenic methane emissions, largely from cow burps, 65% of anthropogenic nitrous oxides, overwhelmingly from manure and 64% of anthropogenic ammonia emissions.

It was a bombshell. Environmental scientists and campaign groups were rapturous, and a wave of popular documentaries such as Meat the Truth and Cowspiracy followed. But the report had sent shockwaves through the meat industry and the tremors travelled quickly.

Steinfeld remembered hearing complaints that ""the FAO has fallen into the hands of vegan activists"" and personal threats such as ""the anti-livestock people are a pest that needs to be eradicated"".

Pressure came from all sides. The big meat-producing countries - Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, Australia and the US - all complained to the FAO's higher echelons, according to Steinfeld, while protests also flooded in from ""the private sector, the large-scale meat, feed and dairy producers"".

Another FAO official ""Angus Green"" remembered the shock that the FAO would produce a report on this topic. ""People were complaining: ""˜Why do we need such a report? Livestock is so important. It's the best way to alleviate poverty for farmers in poor countries.' You can't imagine how controversial the subject of climate change in agriculture was at that time.""

Hans R Herren, a World Food Prize winner and co-chair of the UN/World Bank Global Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology (IAASTD), told the Guardian: ""It's clear that there is corridor pressure by the main agri-producers in the FAO. It's indirect because it comes from outside, but everybody knows how powerful some of those countries are. People think they have to pass on the message to whoever ""˜priced' those reports. There is a chain of pressure because the FAO, like most agencies, depends on external funds, so that's one way of exerting pressure.""

The pressure was soon to become more intense. LLS had included a line saying that livestock emissions were ""an even larger contribution [to global heating] than the transportation sector worldwide"". One of the paper's authors described the factoid as a ""slight methodological error"" that had only been inserted because of a request from the FAO press office, which ""wanted to add some hype to the report. They suggested this might be included as a statement and we didn't think about it enough.""

The line was eventually cut from the paper but the error was seized on by the report's critics. International press such as the BBC and Daily Telegraph jumped on the story with CNN, running it under the headline ""Scientist: Don't blame cows for climate change!""

The leadership at the FAO were taken by surprise by the backlash, according to sources, and the impact would be felt for the next decade, just at the moment that it became ever more important to look honestly at agriculture's planet-heating role. In a sign of the atmosphere in the FAO at this time, a fourth veteran insider, ""Mary Wagyu"", claims to have been admonished after preparing Meatless Monday leaflets for distribution in the cafeteria of an FAO heads of state food security summit in 2008. ""Remove and destroy them,"" a senior FAO executive said, according to Wagyu. ""These will not be put in people's trays.""

In 2009 a second FAO report called Livestock in the Balance was delayed for several months while the FAO's leadership tried to dilute references to harm caused by the meat industry, arguing that this had already been covered by Livestock's Long Shadow. When the research team resisted the pressure, management stepped in and manually rewrote key passages over their heads, sparking what Steinfeld called ""a mini-revolution"". About a dozen staff members involved in preparing the report withdrew their names from the paper in protest.

""We took a collective stand to defend - in our view - the professional integrity of this report,"" Steinfeld said. ""This was the first time there was visible opposition [on the livestock question]."" Steinfeld recalled being told by a senior official in the director general's office: ""Even if livestock contributes 18% to climate change, the FAO shall not say that. It's not in the interest of the FAO to highlight environmental impacts.""

The report was seen as ""very problematic and the DG's office wanted to dampen its messages,"" according to ""David Holstein"", another former official. ""The issue was [the report] presenting statements that livestock was not hunky dory. The response was, therefore, censorship.""

In the end, the second report was published with its references to environmental impacts intact.

That same year an IAASTD study called Agriculture at the crossroads by Herren was co-sponsored with the FAO. The paper outlined the environmental problems caused by livestock, singling it out as a ""major contributor"" to global heating and ""probably the largest sectoral source of water pollution"".

""The report was basically buried at the FAO,"" Herren said. He described ""huge pressure"" not to publicise the paper from funding countries such as the US and Australia - which entered ""reservations"" about the report as an annex. ""When I was invited to give a talk to the FAO plenary, the organiser told me: ""˜You're welcome to talk but you cannot mention the IAASTD report.' He didn't say why but I believe it was because the report recommended a food system transformation that was not in line with what some of the major FAO-supporting countries had in mind.""

And meanwhile the impact on the lives and careers of the rebellious researchers had been profound, according to Steinfeld. ""We were considered a difficult group and difficult individuals, and this is how others described us. We were not [with] the party line.""

Not all ex-FAO officials the Guardian spoke to agreed that the careers of colleagues who spoke out on livestock issues suffered as a result. But another FAO researcher at the time, ""Jean Charolais"", remembers the atmosphere. ""There was substantial pressure internally and there were consequences for permanent staff who worked on this, in terms of their careers. It wasn't really a healthy environment to work in,"" he said.

Several former staff members compared the power of the agribusiness lobby over FAO policy to that of the oil and gas giants on energy policy. As Green put it: ""It is all about money, similar to the fossil fuel industry.""

Between 2012 and 2019, ""the lobbyists obviously managed to influence things"", Holstein said. ""They had a strong impact on the way things were done at the FAO and there was a lot of censorship. It was always an uphill struggle getting the documents you produced past the office for corporate communications and one had to fend off a good deal of editorial vandalism. You had to accept relatively small steps forward in changing the narrative on livestock.""

Steinfeld added that meat lobby representatives and diplomats would talk to senior FAO managers and encourage them not to invest in work that dealt with environmental impacts.

The group set up an umbrella organisation - the Global Agenda for Sustainable Livestock (GASL) - to bring together NGOs, scientists, industry and governments and focus on the issue. But GASL was undermined by the FAO leadership, which suffered from ""a lot of incompetence and ignorance"" and at senior levels ""actually did not understand different greenhouse gases and sources of emissions"", according to Steinfeld.

The FAO leadership did all they could to ""obstruct and torpedo our effort"", he continued. When one minister from a Latin-American country flew to Rome in 2017 to meet the group - after offering to host a GASL meeting - Steinfeld claimed that he was picked up at the airport by a senior FAO official and, by the time he reached the organisation's headquarters, had changed his mind, and no longer wanted the meeting.

Meanwhile, livestock industry supporters had set up a rival organisation - the Livestock Global Alliance (LGA), whose declared first priority was ""to advocate for the global public good dimension of livestock"". It also reportedly sought to ""improve the image of the livestock sector, particularly in response to the FAO report on Livestock's Long Shadow"".

LGA meetings were attended by at least one FAO executive and, according to Wagyu, the group's objective was to obtain financing for industry-friendly research that could be fed back into the FAO policy-making process to influence the developing scientific consensus.

""Private companies wanted to finance the science to achieve more outcomes that were biased in the direction they wanted, and this happened,"" said Wagyu. ""All of a sudden the trickle of scientific studies going in the livestock industry's direction exploded.""

Criollo described some of the LGA proposals as ""spin-off mechanisms from industry that tried to push for certain positions"", but he said that these had not affected FAO models or data outputs.

Steinfeld, who attended some LGA meetings, said simply: ""They discussed world domination. They discussed how everything could be brought into their fold and establish the World Bank and World Organisation for Animal Health as the true world guardians of livestock and everything else should disappear.""

As well as advocacy, the counter-group's modus operandi was messaging to change the narrative on livestock. ""It was a lot about counteracting the so-called damage done by the Long Shadow, and the idea, of course, to write proposals that would be attractive to donors was also there,"" he added. The LGA has since folded.

How can methane emissions be falling if people are eating more meat?

One of the greatest concerns for environmental scientists has been the progressively falling FAO estimate of livestock's overall contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. The 18% number in 2006 was revised downwards to 14.5% in a follow-up paper, Tackling Climate Change Through Livestock, in 2013. It is now being revised downwards again to about 11.2% based on a new ""Gleam 3.0"" model.

The issue is acutely important as the FAO will present a blueprint for pegging global temperature rises to 1.5C at the next Cop in November. The latest analysis assumes a 13% reduction in its estimate of livestock emissions - from 8.1bn tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2017 (using data from 2010) to 6.19bn tonnes in 2022 (using data from 2015). This seems counter-intuitive, given that during the same period, the FAO recorded a 39% increase in global meat production.

Most of the 20 plus former and serving FAO officials and consultants spoken to in the research of this story denied that pressure from agribusiness or states had affected their estimates of livestock emissions. But nevertheless, they continued to cite 18% or 14.5% as their preferred figure.

Many scientists plot farm emissions on a very different trajectory, with one recent study concluding that greenhouse gas emissions from animal products made up 20% of the global total. One recent paper by Matthew Hayek, the assistant professor in environmental sciences at New York University, said that the FAO's use of emissions modeling - without using verifiable atmospheric data - could underestimate methane emissions from livestock by up to 47% in countries such as the US. ""Models are only estimates that need to be constantly validated - and there's been an alarming lack of validation over the now decades that this [FAO] research has been produced,"" he said.

Anne Mottet, the FAO's livestock development officer, stressed that the changing figures reflected best practices and evolving methodologies, rather than an assumed cut in livestock numbers.

""Livestock is part of the FAO's strategy on climate change and we work with governments and farmers and industry on this programme as well,"" she said. ""We can't ignore the main actors of the sector but there has been no particular pressure from them.""

As the only body overseeing global agriculture, the FAO is walking a thin line on livestock emissions, with gale force headwinds from both sides ready to batter any politician that joins in.

Although there is growing awareness of the impact that high meat and dairy consumption has on certain countries' carbon footprints, politicians are, in the main, profoundly reluctant to tackle the issue, particularly in this era of culture wars. Reducing meat and dairy consumption - even by a small amount - is scientifically proven as an effective way to reduce emissions, but almost no government will include that as part of their environmental messaging. The Netherlands, one of the few countries to have bravely announced a livestock reduction plan (although officially to reduce nitrogen - rather than methane - emissions) has seen a huge political challenge from the rightwing Farmer's Party as a result.

The UN has struggled to incorporate the farming sector in its climate summits as well. Cop27 in Egypt saw the first ever food pavilion, and the first ever mention of food in the final statement, but, as George Monbiot, an outspoken critic on this issue, has pointed out, there has never been reference to ""livestock reduction"" in any of its texts.

Monbiot noted: ""In the 20 years to 2018, global meat consumption rose by 58% ""¦ An analysis by Our World in Data shows that even if greenhouse gas pollution from every other sector were eliminated today, by 2100 food production will, on its current trajectory, bust the global carbon budget two or three times over. This is largely because of animal farming, which accounts for 57% of greenhouse gases from the food system, though it provides just 18% of the calories.""

The FAO did not respond to more than a dozen questions sent to it by the Guardian.

But Hayek said that the Guardian's investigation shed new light on a change in the FAO's framing of livestock emissions after 2006 - into an ""opportunity"" for industry rather than a problem for the planet.

He said: ""The insertion of officials and donors into rigorous data-oriented research has a potentially biasing effect. My overriding concern is that people with contrary views might not be at this organisation any more, thanks to conflicts instigated by lobbies, countries and contributing parties.""

Jennifer Jacquet, professor of environmental science at the University of Miami, added: ""It's a story as old as time, that the meat and dairy industry has enormous influence over the policy-making apparatus. It's no coincidence that industry's involvement has led to lower overall relative estimates of emissions for livestock. Industry was taken aback by Livestock's Long Shadow. It caught them on the backfoot and they had to regroup, double down and figure out how to get control of the narrative - and over the science to some degree.""

In her own research into how agribusiness reacted to Livestock's Long Shadow, Jacquet found ""clear evidence that the industry saw it as a threat and something that they needed to control. They call it ""˜a major PR problem'. It set off an industry lobbying coalition somewhat comparable to the oil and gas industry's efforts against the Kyoto Protocol, with an enormous amount of coordination aimed at infiltrating and controlling climate science and, moreover, our understanding of the problem.""

It is often said that policymaking is like sausage production in that, however delicious the results, you wouldn't want to see how they are made. But as the sacred cow of agribusiness prepares to belch again in the FAO's forthcoming emissions report, its assemblage this time around looks set to provide the scientific community with more food for thought than usual.

Once the preserve of farmers, now the dog trials, sheep shearing and food stalls are starting to appeal to everyone

One of the highlights of the Great Yorkshire Show for Bridlington farmer Geoff Riby - other than his ram winning the Beltex male champion in the sheep class competition - was watching Lorenzo the Flying Frenchman perform in the main ring at the Harrogate show ground.

Riby has exhibited at the fair since 1972 and has seen this annual event evolve from an industry trade fair promoting tractors to the sort of festival that would feature one of France's most skilled equestrians on the bill.

""Now, lots of people who visit aren't from the farming community,"" says Riby. ""Instead they have a thirst for knowledge about the countryside and food production. Education has become an important part of the show - as well as shopping and food.""

The Great Yorkshire Show is not the only event welcoming new visitors. Agricultural and county shows across the UK are reporting record attendance numbers this summer.

These annual local celebrations of livestock and produce have been handing out awards to champion farm animals and crops for hundreds of years, but these days the show is the main attraction. Many sell out before they start.

That was the case at the 2023 Great Yorkshire Show. The four-day event had 140,000 visitors, hitting its capacity of 35,000 ticket holders each day.

Last month's Royal Highland Show broke its record when 217,000 came to the three-day event to witness, among other activities, the world sheep-shearing championship and chainsaw carving demonstrations. The Royal Highland Show brought in around £40m business into the area of Ingliston in Edinburgh.

The Association of Show and Agricultural Organisations estimates that about 7 million Britons - roughly 10% of the population - visit agricultural shows every year. That's a lot of enthusiasm for sheepdog trials and locally made honey.

Riby is a member of the Yorkshire Agricultural Society and he points out that without this new audience many of the traditional shows wouldn't be financially viable. ""There aren't enough people working as farmers to make this work as an industry trade show any more,"" he says.

He worries that productive farmland is being replaced by rewilding. ""I can see a time when there will be a food shortage.""

It is anachronistic that agricultural shows are booming when the farming industry is in worldwide decline and the number of full-time British farmers has fallen by 33%. But attender demographics have changed over the decades. A 2018 study of the Royal Welsh Show found that 39% of visitors had no connection to the agriculture industry.

Perhaps it is due to the rise of farming as entertainment on YouTube, where thousands have tuned in to watch farmers go about their daily chores in recent years, or the popularity of video games such as Farming Simulator. TV shows such as Clarkson's Farm or All Creatures Great and Small have also given farming life a boost. Series two of Clarkson's Farm reached 7.6 million viewers on Amazon Prime, outstripping the audience for The Lord of the Rings.

Richard Benson, author of award-winning memoir The Farm, which was about his family's Yorkshire pig farm, has attended agricultural shows his whole life. He has been competing in them, in the meadow hay section, since 2018.

Benson thinks that these festivals benefit from newcomers who have moved to the country. ""The best local show near to me is in Bishop Wilton [near York]. It's done really well in recent years, which seems down to the committee tapping into people who've moved into the village who want to take part in local life.""

Many of the new arrivals participate in the crafts events such as jam-making and flower-growing rather than traditional farming categories.

Nina Matsunaga is chef patron at the Black Bull Inn in Cumbria. The German-Japanese chef, who moved to Sedbergh in 2014, has found taking part in food demonstrations at events such as the nearby Westmorland County Show, including one focused on cooking with game, is a good way to meet local suppliers.

""For the public they're a way of reconnecting with farmers and understanding how food is made, which is something that we as a society are largely disconnected from,"" she says. ""They encourage you to source and shop locally. People in general are more interested in how their food is reared and produced and, ultimately, they're far more health-conscious. They want ingredients that come from trusted sources.''

Benson suggests any newcomers keen to discover the agricultural show scene should look up writer Philip Larkin's 1973 poem Show Saturday - which is about the Bellingham Show in Northumberland - to get a sense of the atmosphere. ""It's just his most cheerful poem,"" he says.

""The reason I love the show is that at their heart are real communities of people coming together to say ""˜this is what we did this year',"" Benson says.

""When my hay is lined up with the others on the trestles and you watch as everybody comes up and smells it, it makes me feel like crying.

""You've spent a year or more on it, working often in the mud and cold, and then you see it giving pleasure to someone on a sunny summer day.""

This article was amended on 19 July 2023. An earlier version said that the Bellingham Show took place in Hexham, Northumberland. It takes place in Bellingham, about 16 miles north of Hexham.

From wilting wheat to stressed pollinators, US farmers and fishermen see unexpected climate effects

This week, farmers across the midwest are preparing for temperatures to reach 115F (46C) as a heat dome covers the region. After a tricky growing season - that seesawed between drought and unseasonably heavy rains - many midwestern farmers worry the extreme heat will scorch, or at least stunt, their already struggling crops.

To say it's been a hot summer would be an understatement. According to Nasa scientists, July was the hottest month ever recorded. Off the coast of Florida, surface ocean temperatures soared over 101F, bleaching coral reefs. In Arizona, Phoenix residents sweated through a record 31 consecutive days above 110F. Even animals that spend much of their time in the sky, like birds, struggled to keep cool in the sweltering heat.

Across much of the country, the food system also struggled. In Texas, farmers reported smaller yields as their corn and cotton crops struggled to survive soaring summer temperatures. In Arizona, beekeepers spotted dead honeybees outside hives. Even underwater, off the coast of Long Island, kelp farmers recorded another year of shrinking yields.

As extreme heat scorched the oceans, land and skies, it affected our food system underwater, on the ground and in the air. But the ways that it did so were unpredictable - not every crop suffered, though many certainly struggled, and not every region was affected equally. If there was any takeaway, it may have been that previous scientific models for extreme heat failed to capture the full scope of what heatwaves of this magnitude could cause - and that farmers, fishers and pollinators should be prepared to adapt to an uncertain future.

""It's really problematic if we use past disasters as the basis for which we plan for the future,"" says Erin Coughlan de Perez, a professor focused on climate risk management at Tufts University. ""The future is not going to be the same as the past.""

Land: wilting wheat and heat-stressed cattle

Extreme heat can stress many plants, including common crops, causing them to go dormant or to seed, stunting growth and disrupting pollen (and therefore fruit) development. In a study published in Nature's climate and atmospheric science journal this June, researchers found that extreme heat is now more likely to affect wheat yields in the US and China - a major wheat exporter - than historical precedents suggest.

Extreme heat ""that used to happen every 100 years, used to be a really rare, unusual disaster event, is now something that would happen every six years"" in the United States, said Coughlan de Perez, the lead author on the paper. When temperatures get too hot (above 27.8C, or about 82F), wheat photosynthesizes more slowly, and when it gets very hot (above 32.8C, or about 91F) enzymes in the plant can start to break down.

Although extreme heatwaves are becoming more common, that doesn't mean every region has become uninhabitable for every crop. Rather, the types of crops that can survive in different regions are changing. Coughlan de Perez points to data published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that shows how different crops are faring across the globe. In Texas and across much of the midwest this year, extreme heat threatened corn, cotton, sorghum and soybean crops, which were only saved by heavy rains late in the growing season. As the climate changes, farmers are considering ways to plant or harvest earlier to take advantage of milder temperatures.

Some experimental initiatives in the US are looking to develop crops with heat-resistant genes or grow plants that haven't traditionally been eaten as prolifically. At the Wheat & Rice Center for Heat Resilience, for example, researchers are studying the genes that help rice tolerate heat stress. Meanwhile, at the Experimental Farm Network, growers from across the country are breeding new crops and testing the range of certain plants to see what might grow best in a changing climate.

Extreme heat doesn't only pose a risk to crops, but to livestock as well. In late August, 22 cattle died in a Nebraska heatwave and Oklahoma ranchers reported cattle drinking twice the amount of water to survive a ""heat danger"" advisory. Even when it isn't fatal, heat stress can affect livestock's milk yield and fertility - and can also harm the people who care for those animals and farms.

Oceans: anchovies and algal blooms

Scientists who study the oceans are witnessing that kind of unpredictability underwater as well. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), the ocean absorbs 90% of the excess heat associated with global warming - meaning that heatwaves that happen on land are also happening underwater.

""The question has become not really so much whether there's a marine heatwave or not, in the north-east Pacific Ocean, but how close it comes to shore,"" said Andrew Thompson, a research fisheries biologist at Noaa's Fisheries Service. When heatwaves, like an unprecedented marine heatwave known as ""the Blob"" that dominated the US west coast from 2013 to 2016, come too close to shore, they start to affect crab, squid, salmon and other fisheries that supply much of our seafood.

But just as heat can be devastating for some crops and beneficial for others on land, so can it be for ocean life. In a paper published earlier this year about the impact of ""the Blob"" on west coast fisheries, Thompson and his co-authors found that the effects of extreme heat weren't always clearcut.

""We're seeing increased warmth unlike we've ever seen before,"" said Thompson. As a result, ""the system is responding in ways that we really wouldn't have expected based upon our past observations.""

For example, Thompson is part of a team that studies anchovies, sardines and hundreds of other fishes through the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations program. Although his team had previously seen anchovies thrive in cooler waters, they saw the anchovy population explode during the 2013-2016 marine heatwave. Today the anchovy population off the west coast is probably higher than it's been since 1950.

""The thing that's interesting to me as a fisheries scientist is the often unexpected results that are coming from the marine heatwaves. The results have been very, very nuanced,"" Thompson added. That includes ""a couple of really big, unexpected positive things that happened"".

While cod, abalone, Chinook salmon and Dungeness crab struggled during the 2013-2016 marine heatwave, market squid, shrimp and bluefin tuna fisheries did surprisingly well. On one hand, the heatwave created toxic algal blooms that forced the closure of California's Dungeness crab fishery. But on the other, it increased the range where cool-water-loving market squid could survive, creating new fishery opportunities in Oregon and Alaska.

Air: pollinators on pause

Although much of the research on climate change and food systems has so far focused on the direct effects of heat - for example, how heat exposure changes plants - Jenna Walters, a doctoral candidate at Michigan State University's Pollination Ecology Lab, says it's important to consider the indirect effects of heat too - like how changing crops will affect pollinators.

Bees pollinate about 100 commercial nut, fruit and vegetable crops. But extreme heat can affect the formation of pollen tubes, diminishing the nutritional value of flowers for the bees that would pollinate them.

""Those nutrients that the plants require for pollination and for their reproductive processes are actually the same nutrients that bees are visiting the plants for,"" said Walters, who has published papers on the effects of extreme heat on pollinators and pollen tube formation. ""The bee is going to be indirectly stressed because the plant is enduring these stressors."" Without sufficient nutrition, bees won't develop properly and may even die before reaching adulthood.

This summer, entomologists in Arizona reported a growing number of dead honeybees outside hives - a sign that the bees had closed off the hive during the worst of the heat. Scientists worry that more bees will die as temperatures rise - or focus their energy on staying cool rather than pollinating.

Walters notes that, as social species, honeybees and bumblebees have developed techniques like wing fanning, where pollinators return to the hive during heatwaves to flap their wings together and ventilate their home. But solitary bees, which make up the vast majority of bees in the world, are by definition not social, so they don't have similar measures to cope with the heat. And because they don't care for their larvae after laying their eggs, their young are especially vulnerable to extreme temperatures.

In the face of rapidly rising temperatures, Walters emphasizes the importance of deeper research on alternative pollinators. ""If you are trying to make a resilient system in agriculture or otherwise, you need to have backup plans,"" she said. ""You need to have a diversity of different pollinators present in a field so that if we're in a situation where it's too hot for mason bees, who are more effective pollinators of a certain crop, then maybe honeybees can come in and help out.""

That idea of having a backup plan may be key to supporting the entire food system through extreme heat.

""I would suggest a full basket of approaches,"" says Coughlan de Perez. While some scientists breed new crops with more heat-resilient genes, farmers can evaluate what to plant when and policymakers can adjust insurance options for farmers trying to weather the heat. Ultimately, she hopes everyone uses models, like the one she and her colleagues designed, ""to encourage thoughtful adjustments to our behavior"".

Poor pollination caused by destructive farming methods leads to loss of biodiversity and is a threat to food production, inquiry told

Fruit growers in the UK are already seeing less yield and lower-quality produce because of the loss of insects, scientists have told MPs, warning that a further loss of pollinators could have ""significant"" impacts on all crops.

As part of a parliamentary inquiry into insect decline and UK food security, Prof Simon Potts from the University of Reading told MPs at the science, innovation and technology committee that there is already good evidence of a shortfall of pollinators and a threat to food production.

He said: ""That shortfall translates not only into less yield but also lower-quality produce ""¦ With poor pollination, you're getting a shortfall in the production of nutrients, and for the farmers of course that translates into loss of profit.""

Focusing on interpreting insect-decline data, Potts' contribution referenced a study that shows a deficit in pollination for the UK's gala apples could equate to £5.7m in loss of production. This, he said, could be fixed with interventions to boost pollinators.

The study notes that bees and hoverflies are the main pollinators of apples, and are ""essential"" for global production of apples, one of the world's most important fruit crops. The study says ""direct links between insect pollination and apple quality are equivocal"", with specific mention of the number of seeds, size (which affects their marketability) and calcium levels.

Potts said there was minimal data on pollinator trends in the countries from where the UK imports many of its fruits and vegetables. ""We've got a challenge at home, absolutely ... but we have almost no data on the status and trends of pollinators and other beneficial insects in those countries that produce a huge amount of fruit and veg that comes to the UK. That, in terms of policy and practice, is a huge challenge.""

He added: ""Many of our crops - mangoes, raspberries, strawberries - are coming in from north Africa, Europe or South America. We are quite vulnerable, not only at home but also overseas.""

Insect pollination contributes more than £600m to the UK economy every year. More than 75% of all food crops require pollination, and declines have serious implications for global food security. The drivers of insect loss vary, but almost certainly include loss of habitat (driven by the expansion of agricultural land), exposure to pesticides and climate breakdown.

Research published this week revealed that conservation measures over the past 30 years have failed to stop the decline of insects on British farmland. Potts encouraged MPs to push for a new biodiverse and sustainable farming system, which he said could be be done through farming policy by way of environment land management schemes, as well as local nature recovery strategies and biodiversity net gain (BNG), both of which could include policies around insects.

Prof Dave Goulson from the University of Sussex, who was giving evidence alongside Potts, said: ""Insects are quite adaptable, and they've been around for 480m years and survived all the mass extinction events that have gone before. But, simultaneously, if their home is destroyed, there's nowhere to nest, they can't find anything to eat ""¦ When you put it all together, then we shouldn't really be surprised that they're struggling to cope.""

He reiterated the need to improve the way we farm. ""Seventy per cent of Britain, roughly, is farmland, and there is pretty clear evidence that the way farming has changed is the biggest driver of biodiversity declines. So moving towards a more sustainable approach to food production seems to me vital.""

Countless landslides in Nantou county are disrupting ancient agricultural traditions, leading some to wonder how much longer they can continue to cling to the steep slopes they call home

Halfway up Taiwan's central mountain ranges, two young women were working a shift at the town's service station in August when the landslide hit. As torrent of water, mud and rocks gushed down they ran next door for shelter, a decision that probably saved their lives. Moments later, the station became buried under tonnes of earth and rock.

The disaster in Ren'ai township was one of countless landslides in the same month across Nantou, a landlocked county in central Taiwan, triggered by torrential rain brought by the whipping tail of distant typhoon Khanun.

The county in the central region of Taiwan's main island is set in a dramatic range of lush, jungle-covered mountains. Thousands of peaks, some higher than 3,000 metres above sea level, stretch sharply into the sky from narrow valleys and rivers. They are sparsely populated, with small towns and villages accessed by winding single-lane roads, where aboriginal tribes are among those making a living mostly through agriculture, and holding on to ancient traditions. They say they have never seen so much water.

Landslides are not uncommon in Taiwan, the whole island is in a hot zone for typhoons and earthquakes. However, mountain communities like Nantou are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather, and things are getting worse amid the climate crisis. This was the fourth time since 2000 that the service station had been hit and some are beginning to wonder how much longer their traditional way of life can continue.

The local economies are largely based on agriculture, and indigenous customs are tightly linked to seasonal harvests. Nantou is the ancestral homeland of the Seediq people, one of 16 recognised aboriginal tribes in Taiwan, and the modern home of several others. The August typhoon caused the cancellation of autumn harvest ceremonies, an annual ritual lasting up to a week.

""˜There are no crops to celebrate'

""There is nothing to harvest,"" says Wang Wan-quan, a 70-year-old farmer in Nang Feng village in Nantou. ""They were all destroyed by typhoons, covered by landslides, and damaged by heavy rain. We can't celebrate anything. There are no crops to celebrate.""

Wang draws his income from growing tea and organic vegetables. ""When a typhoon comes, some people will make money and some won't,"" he says.

Zi-jun Zeng, the village head in Nang Feng, says rising temperatures, increased extreme weather events, and changing climates are exacerbating the weakening of Aboriginal culture, disrupting ceremonies, changing harvest patterns and the annual celebrations tied to them.

""Indigenous communities in Taiwan are all farming communities. The culture is always connected to the land,"" he says.

Climate scientists say changing weather patterns are making typhoons, known elsewhere as cyclones or hurricanes, much more intense. A 2016 study published in Nature found the proportion of storms of categories 4 and 5 hitting east and south-east Asia had doubled or even tripled in the preceding four decades.

A report released in March by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found it was ""likely"" that the proportion of category 3-5 cyclones had increase globally over the past four decades, and that it was ""very likely"" the proportion of category 4-5 cyclones would increase with global heating. The IPCC also said it had ""high confidence"" that anthropogenic climate change had contributed to extreme rainfall amounts during intense cyclones.

Taiwan draws most of its drinking water from typhoons. Although the frequency of intense typhoons is increasing, the overall number making landfall has dropped significantly, prompting record-breaking droughts. When they hit, their increased strength brings floods and landslides, and hurt local economies by destroying crops and the roads along which produce is transported for sale.

Chen Guo-xiong Che, the major secretary for the township covering Nangfeng, says they are seeking to adapt farming strategies, citing efforts to plant more trees among the monoculture tea and coffee fields. But the current infrastructure of the tribes couldn't handle this latest downpour.

""I am worried about climate change ,"" says Chen. ""This year's typhoon impact was bigger and temperatures are higher. We've never experienced so much water.

""Climate change directly impacts us and those living in high altitude. The large quantity of rain in a short time cut off the main road and the farm road - people's road to work ""¦ The road is ruined in seven or eight places and directly affects livelihoods and incomes.

""Villagers living in the mountains are not scared of natural disasters, they can face damage. But we hope the government can help with better construction and infrastructure.""

A relocation conundrum

Dr Lin Tze-luen, a spokesman for the executive branch of Taiwan's government, tells the Guardian his country has become adept at preparing for and responding to disasters, ""but now the challenge is climate change"".

""There is a debate, some say people should relocate. But indigenous culture is rooted in that area ""¦ We know it affects traditions but it's difficult and we try to increase their resilience,"" Lin says, citing the provision of satellite phones to residents who decide to stay, and increased government subsidies for home insurance.

In Ren'ai township, days after typhoon Khanun, the rubble is nearly cleared but the service station building is ruined. Mangled pumps are covered by a layer of mud, and water is still pouring across the road from the collapsed hillsides.

The town's response is organised and practical. There are local government representatives, disaster response charities, and community volunteer groups. Some young male residents returned from military conscription service to hike through devastation to reach stranded residents and deliver supplies. One of the young women who escaped the service station is now helping her neighbours clear the mud and debris.

Few talk of leaving this place. Wang, who travels in a mobility scooter, says he won't leave, but it was a close call this time. He was out checking on a neighbour when a landslide hit his house.

""The cloud stopped over our tribe and wouldn't go away,"" he says. ""We had never seen such rain as this.""

26,"Kenya declares war on millions of birds after they raid crops","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/17/kenya-birds-raid-crops-pesticides-quelea-raptors-aoe","Kenya declares war on millions of birds after they raid crops

Toxic pesticides used to eradicate grain-eating quelea may harm the country's endangered raptors, say conservationists

A drive by the Kenyan government to kill up to 6 million red-billed quelea birds that have invaded farms will have unintended consequences for raptors and other wild species, experts have warned.

The continuing drought in the Horn of Africa has reduced the amount of native grass, whose seeds are queleas' main food source, causing the birds to increasingly invade grain fields, putting 2,000 acres (800 hectares) of rice under threat. About 300 acres of rice fields have been destroyed by the birds.

A single quelea can eat up to 10 grams of grain a day, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Farmers in western Kenya stand to lose close to 60 tonnes of grain to the birds. In 2021, the FAO estimated crop losses attributable to the birds amounted to $50m (£40m) annually.

The spraying of fenthion, an organophosphate pesticide, has been the method of choice in fighting the pests in Africa, but the chemical has been described by researchers as ""toxic to humans and to other non-target organisms"".

""Fenthion can therefore injure or kill indiscriminately, with consequent adverse effects on non-target organisms,"" the reasearchers concluded.

Paul Gacheru, species and sites manager at Nature Kenya, a local affiliate to BirdLife International, said the method used to control quelea should be well-informed since ""widespread use of non-target species avicides can result in environmental contamination and mass deaths of other birds and animals"".

""Often, there is poor post-spraying site management, thus increasing the risk of poison-related wildlife deaths, especially among scavenging animals - hence the need to enhance education and awareness on quelea control,"" he said.

With an estimated breeding population in Africa of 1.5 billion birds, ornithologists say there are neither enough birds of prey to wipe out vast quelea colonies nor effective, environmentally friendly solutions.

Simon Thomsett, a director at Kenya Bird of Prey Trust, said the culture of guaranteeing human food security above all else would be amplified ""due to what we now perceive to be a probability, owing to climate change, as open grasslands that were quelea feeding grounds quickly turn into farmlands"".

In wheat-growing parts of Kenya, Thomsett added, farmers have sprayed any species of birds deemed to be a threat to farms, ""yet some of the birds are there to feed on insects that feed on their wheat"".

But it is the effect the pesticide may have on the few remaining raptors that worries him most. ""Those on the raptor conservation side of the fence are greatly alarmed at the spraying. Today, all raptors [in Kenya] are endangered. In any case, how effective has the spraying been in the last 60 to 70 years?""

The FAO and the United Nations Environment Programme jointly administer the Rotterdam convention, whose aims include reducing risks from hazardous chemicals in agriculture. They have been considering listing fenthion in Annex III of the treaty, a list of pesticides and industrial chemicals banned or severely restricted on environmental or health grounds.

A report prepared by Robert A Cheke from the University of Greenwich and which was used as a working document in a 2017 FAO workshop in Sudan recommended alternatives to the use of the chemical, including a forecast and control planning method.

""If the efficiency of control operations could be improved, then the quantities of fenthion used could be reduced. One way of improving the efficiency of control strategies is to detect the presence of suitable quelea breeding areas by satellite imagery ""¦ or to forecast where the birds are likely to breed,"" the report said.

It added: ""Given that the birds' migrations and breeding opportunities are determined by patterns of rainfall, it is possible to devise forecasting systems to predict where the birds are likely to breed and, thus, to concentrate activities in search of the colonies to areas where the birds are likely to be.""

Quelea invasion frequently occurs in many African countries. Six months ago, the FAO released $500,000 to the government of Tanzania to support pesticide spraying, surveillance and capacity-building after 21 million quelea invaded rice, sorghum, millet and wheat fields.

Climate crisis is exacerbating damage caused by crop-destroying fungi, risking ""˜global health catastrophe'

Fast-rising fungal attacks on the world's most important crops threaten the planet's future food supply, scientists have said, warning that failing to tackle fungal pathogens could lead to a ""global health catastrophe"".

Fungi are already by far the biggest destroyer of crops. They are highly resilient, travel long distances on the wind and can feast on large fields of a single crop. They are also extremely adaptable and many have developed resistance to common fungicides.

The impact of fungal disease is expected to worsen, the researchers say, as the climate crisis results in temperatures rising and fungal infections moving steadily polewards. Since the 1990s, fungal pathogens have been moving to higher latitudes at a rate of about 7km a year. Wheat stem rust infections, normally found in the tropics, have already been reported in England and Ireland.

Higher temperatures also drive the emergence of new variants of the fungal pathogens, while more extreme storms can spread their spores further afield, the scientists say.

Prof Sarah Gurr, at the University of Exeter in the UK, a co-author of the report, said fungi had recently come to public attention through the hit TV show The Last of Us, in which fungi infect human brains.

""While that storyline is science fiction, we are warning that we could see a global health catastrophe caused by the rapid global spread of fungal infections. The imminent threat here is not about zombies, but about global starvation.""

The scientists said there was also a risk that global heating would increase the heat tolerance of fungi, raising the possibility of them hopping hosts to infect warm-blooded animals and humans.

Prof Eva Stukenbrock, at the University of Kiel in Germany, a co-author, said: ""As our global population is projected to soar, humanity is facing unprecedented challenges to food production. We're already seeing massive crop losses to fungal infection, which could sustain millions of people each year. This worrying trend may only worsen with a warming world.""

The warning, issued in an article in the scientific journal Nature, said growers already lost between 10% and 23% of their crops to fungal disease. Across the five most important crops - rice, wheat, maize, soya beans and potatoes - infections cause annual losses that could feed hundreds of millions of people. Fungi made up the top six in a recent list of pests and pathogens with the biggest impact.

Fungi are incredibly resilient, the researchers say, remaining viable in soil for up to 40 years, and their airborne spores can travel between continents. ""After tornadoes in America, you can see the spores have been sucked up and gone on long distance voyages,"" Gurr said.

Fungicides are widely used but the pathogens are well equipped to rapidly evolve resistance to treatments that target only a single cellular process. Existing fungicides and conventional breeding for disease resistance are no longer enough, the researchers say.

One solution is planting seed mixtures that carry a range of genes that are resistant to fungal infection, rather than monocultures of a single strain. In 2022, about a quarter of wheat in Denmark was grown in this way. Technology may also help, the scientists say, with drones and artificial intelligence allowing earlier detection and control of outbreaks.

New pesticides are being developed, with a team at the University of Exeter recently discovering compounds that could lead to chemicals that target several biological processes within the fungi, making resistance much harder to develop. The approach has already been shown to be useful against fungi infecting wheat, rice, corn and bananas.

The researchers said fungal pathogen research was seriously underfunded, comparing the £550m allocated to Covid-19 research by the UK Research and Innovation council from 2020 to 2022 with the £24m for fungal crop research over the same period.

""If we don't have enough to eat, malnutrition will kill us before we get anything like Covid-19,"" Gurr said. ""But our [research area] is absolutely penniless compared with every medical disease you could imagine.""

After hottest day ever, researchers say global heating may mean future of crop failures on land and ""˜silent dying' in the oceans

Successive heatwaves threaten nature's ability to provide us with food, say researchers, as they warn of an ""unseen, silent dying"" in our oceans amid record temperatures scorching the Earth.

Heatwaves are ripping through Europe, the US and China, with the global hottest day ever recorded at the start of July, endangering human life as well as the land and sea it depends on.

""Our food system is global,"" said John Marsham, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Leeds. ""There are growing risks of simultaneous major crop losses in different regions in the world, which will really affect food availability and prices. This is not what we're seeing right now, but in the coming decades that's one of the things I'm really scared of.

""As a human being, if you're wealthy enough, you can get inside and put the air conditioning on. But natural ecosystems and farmed ecosystems can't do that.""

The 2018 European heatwave led to multiple crop failures and loss of yield of up to 50% in central and northern Europe. In 2022, record temperatures in the UK killed fruit and vegetables on the vine.

Heatwaves are expected to become 12 times more frequent by 2040 compared with pre-warming levels. Although one heatwave might not kill an ecosystem, longer and more frequent events will mean nature does not have time to recover.

Marsham said: ""People are generally isolated from the effects of the weather on which we all depend. We go to shops to buy food - we don't grow it ourselves. But if you talk to farmers anywhere in the world, they are extremely aware of what the weather is doing, and the impacts on their farming.""

The climate crisis doesn't just increase atmospheric heatwaves but oceanic ones too, harming coastal communities and threatening another key food source for humans. Heat stress causes dramatic die-offs, such as the 2021 ""heat dome"" along Canada's Pacific coast, which killed an estimated 1 billion marine animals.

Daniela Schmidt, professor of earth sciences at the University of Bristol, said: ""We often think about impacts on ecosystems on land because it's easy to see - the plants wilt and animals get too hot. But people generally don't think about marine heatwaves. That's what really worries me - that unseen, silent dying.""

Some of the most vulnerable ecosystems are the ones used to having a stable temperature year-round, such as species in the tropical oceans. Warming of 2C is expected to essentially wipe out tropical corals reefs. They have the highest biodiversity of any ecosystem globally, and support more than 500 million people worldwide, most of whom are in poor countries.

""I've got young kids,"" Marsham said. ""Whenever you watch Finding Nemo or read a book about coral reefs, you can't help but feel that, on some level, you're selling them a lie. Unless we act fast, those systems are going to disappear. Some people might not care about coral reefs, but there's no part of the globe that is immune to the impacts of climate change.""

Schmidt added: ""Not everything has to have a financial value. You need plants for every breath you take. It's the oxygen you breathe - we tend to forget that.""

Research is just starting to scratch the surface of understanding how heat affects ecosystems. Under a high-emissions scenario of 4.4C warming, 41% of land vertebrates will experience extreme thermal events by 2099, according to research published in Nature. Stresses induced by hot temperatures can cause numerous problems, affecting growth, fertility, immunity and changes in behaviour.

Species are moving up mountains and towards the poles to evade the heat. Ultimately, it is likely to drive more species towards extinction.

Nature can, however, play an important role in making extreme heat more bearable, say experts. Bodies of water such as ponds and fountains make landscapes more resilient in hot, dry summers, helping prevent wildfires and reducing the impacts of drought.

Dr Nicole Miranda, a senior researcher at the Oxford Martin programme on the Future of Cooling, said: ""The presence of vegetation and water in our landscape can serve as ways to passively cool our surroundings. Trees and plants provide shading and also have the mechanism of evapotranspiration. Bodies of water, such as ponds and fountains, capture the heat around them by evaporating water.""

One example is the large-scale green corridors in MedellÃ­n, Colombia, which have reportedly cut urban heat by 2C.

Gene editing or selective breeding hold promise of a non-toxic variety of the protein-rich and drought-resistant plant

It is grown in some of the world's most inhospitable, arid regions and is noted for being rich in protein. But the grass pea - although hardy and nutritious - comes with a catch. It contains a poison that can occasionally trigger irreversible paralysis, particularly among individuals who are already undernourished.

As a result, it is often grown only as an insurance crop, to provide short-term food supply when harvests of other crops have failed. Nevertheless, poisoning from Lathyrus sativus still occurs in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Ethiopia and Algeria.

But now a group of UK scientists studying the grass pea have revealed the secrets of its poison production. In the near future they expect to create versions that are free of its toxic side-effects.

""Very soon, we will be able to make safe versions of the grass pea and provide our undernourished, overheated planet with a very valuable crop,"" said project scientist Dr Anne Edwards, of the John Innes Centre in Norfolk.

The key biochemical steps by which the grass pea's poison is made were revealed when scientists decoded the highly complex genome of Lathyrus sativus. They discovered details of the pathways that lead to the pea poison's manufacture, leaving them poised to use gene-editing or standard breeding techniques to create versions that are poison-free or extremely low in toxins.

""Obviously you don't want to create a version of the grass pea that does not make toxins and then find out that it is also no longer drought-resistant,"" said Edwards. ""However ""¦ it seems there is no penalty from removing the toxin or having very, very low levels of it.""

When eaten as part of a balanced diet, the grass pea is safe. But when other crops have failed and only the hardy grass pea survives, its consumption can have grim effects in the form of the neurotoxic disease of lathyrism.

The earliest description of the illness was made by the Greek physician Hippocrates, while the Spanish artist Goya's aquatint print, Thanks to the Grass Pea, depicts the consequences of Napoleon's siege of Madrid. It shows a woman who can no longer walk due to the effects of lathyrism, surrounded by a small group of starving citizens waiting for bowls of food containing the poison pea.

However, once stripped of its toxic effects, the grass pea could have a crucial role to play in a world that has been afflicted by the consequences of the climate emergency. ""We should not underestimate the potential of grass pea across the world,"" said Edwards. ""It's a legume, and bacteria in its roots make fertiliser by converting nitrogen in the air into ammonium compounds, which it releases into the soil and improves it.

""It also has an enormous root system that goes deep into the ground. So growing the grass pea could play a major role in improving soil fertility across the planet - in the west as well as in arid countries in the Middle East and Africa.""

Dr Peter Emmrich from the Norwich Institute for Sustainable Development, who is one of the scientists working to develop safe varieties of the grass pea, said: ""As we prepare for increased climate change, we are going to need crops that can cope with drought or flooding or inundations of salt water. Grass pea can survive such conditions.""

31,"Have we reached ""˜peak meat'? Why one country is trying to limit its number of livestock","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/16/netherlands-european-union-regulations-livestock","Have we reached ""˜peak meat'? Why one country is trying to limit its number of livestock

Dutch farms are feeling the squeeze from EU rules and need to make sweeping changes to the farm system - could a huge producer like the US follow suit?

Ingrid de Sain is one of thousands of dairy farmers in the Netherlands who says she sometimes lies awake at night. Since a court ruling in 2019 which found the Dutch were breaking European environmental law, her farm of 100 cows in north Holland has been illegal.

Like the other 2,500-plus farmers whose environmental permission was suddenly invalid, she wants a future where she can earn a living and farm legally again.

The Netherlands is first to face questions scientists believe will soon come to all intensively farmed areas: how can we balance the needs of the environment with the way we farm and grow? Have we reached ""peak meat"", like peak oil: so much livestock, so much local pollution, that the only sustainable future is in reduction? They're questions the US, the world's largest producer of beef, will also soon have to answer.

In November, the Dutch government announced the first part of a â‚¬24.3bn ($26.3bn) plan to buy out up to 3,000 farms and major industrial polluters near protected nature reserves - if necessary, through compulsory purchase, ""with pain in our hearts"". It is hugely controversial and only initial outlines have been announced after a year of protests, tense negotiations and a report in October recommending buying out the top 500 or 600 polluters within a year.

The reason is that the emissions of ammonia, nitrogen oxides and nitrous oxide are damaging areas of unique, natural landscape known as Natura 2000 habitats, which the country is bound by EU law to protect. The government says this means reducing local nitrogen compound emissions from between 12% and 70%, including slashing the Netherlands' 118 million farmed animals by 30% by 2030, according to Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency projections.

Tjeerd de Groot, a member of the house of representatives in the Netherlands and agriculture spokesman for coalition party D66, advocates halving the numbers of pigs and poultry, raising fewer cows and grazing them on pasture, rather than importing grain and soy for feed. ""Everywhere you look, there's a problem with agriculture,"" he said, citing the toll the resulting pollution has taken on biodiversity and water quality. ""Yes, we have been a big exporter but now we are paying a big price in the environment.""

Environmentalists believe the Netherlands needs to change all elements of its food system chain to provide a good income for different methods of farming. ""All the signs are red,"" said Natasja Oerlemans, head of the food team at the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Netherlands. ""The production system of meat and dairy in the Netherlands can no longer be held at this level. That's been clear for years.""

All eyes are on the Netherlands, according to scientists who believe the world needs action to reduce livestock - rather than relying on voluntary pollution reduction or technological measures that may be unproven at scale.

""The major difference to previous measures is a reduction in livestock numbers,"" said Dr Helen Harwatt, a senior research fellow at Chatham House and climate policy fellow at Harvard University. In 2019 she led a group of scientists calling for action to ensure livestock declines. ""We tend to only see technological approaches to reducing nitrogen at the point of production or reducing leakage to the environment, rather than reducing the amount of agricultural production. It'll be all eyes on the Netherlands to learn from this transition.""

Livestock - farmed both for meat and for dairy - have major environmental impacts, and Harwatt argues that reductions should be part of a broader green action. ""Currently, the aspiration globally is to protect more land for biodiversity, reverse biodiversity loss, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, halt deforestation and increase livestock production,"" she said. ""There are currently far more livestock on the planet than wild animals, and more than three times the human population. Livestock production is forecast to continue increasing, as diets transition across the world to include more animal products. Something has to give and it shouldn't be the climate or biodiversity.""

Countries such as Denmark and the US may soon face similar predicaments, according to Pete Smith, professor of soils and global change at Aberdeen University in Scotland. ""We demonstrated last year that animal agriculture is responsible for 57% of greenhouse gas emissions from the food system,"" he said. ""It has a disproportionate effect on the climate. We have too many livestock for the climate to support, and it's the intensity of farming that's the issue. I'm not surprised the Netherlands is taking the lead as it has the biggest problem.""

The US, meanwhile, is the world's largest producer of beef, chicken meat and cow's milk, and is the second largest producer of pork. ""If we compare foods in terms of their nutrient pollution impact per kilogram produced, nothing is higher than beef,"" said Harwatt. ""Two-thirds of all crop calories produced in the US are used for feed crops. But livestock production contributes less than 1% to US GDP, and at least twice as much food for humans could be produced on land currently used to grow feed crops for farmed animals.""

The US is set to produce 12,820,000 metric tons of beef and veal this year, according to the United States Department of Agriculture - a slight fall of 6% due to drought conditions, but with increased production of pork and chicken.

Animal farming has been linked to 17,900 US deaths a year from air-based pollution, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency says agricultural runoff is the leading cause of ""water quality impacts to rivers and streams, the third leading source of lakes and the second largest source of impairments to wetlands"". One example is the Mississippi River.

While the US has signed treaties such as the G7 2030 Nature Compact, pledging to halt biodiversity loss, and has a new special envoy on biodiversity and water resources, it is not party to the Convention on Biological Diversity - a potential stumbling block to adopting a Dutch-style plan.

Dr Matthew Hayek, assistant professor in environmental studies at New York University, advocates deciding a point of ""peak livestock"" and aiming for reduction, rather than trusting climate mitigation strategies such as seaweed additives or manure digesters. ""They don't address part of the problem and their technical efficiency hasn't been shown at levels of scale - especially when you compare with just producing and consuming less,"" he said.

""In the United States, in midwestern states especially, there are still way higher levels of nitrogen concentration and ""˜impaired waters' than are federally allowed. But states can carve out exemptions, and this is what has been done across Iowa and a lot of corn- and meat-heavy states. There's just not the legal mechanisms or social pressure to address them - especially given you have so much social and regulatory capture by the agricultural industries.

""We also have a certain amount of nitrogen pollution that is ""˜allowed'. The way that we deal with a lot of ""˜point source' pollution from industrial animal farming is by spreading it out over fields and miraculously turning it into non-point source pollution, which can't be strictly regulated,"" he added.

Hayek believes ""soft"" policies such as vegan-by-default menus in New York City hospitals could be combined with local regulation, like the 2010 ""total maximum daily load"" limit to improve water quality in Chesapeake Bay - as well as increasing public awareness. ""Often, we are not even choosing to eat meat; we are choosing because we don't recognise that there's a choice not to eat meat,"" he said. ""We're also not really combining the micro scale with the macro scale in our regulatory frameworks. We're looking at one farm or one field, but we aren't asking the question: is that nitrogen load in that watershed higher than that watershed can handle?

In the small, densely populated Netherlands, it might seem easier to address ""macro"" policy in a country of 17.8 million people.

But political action here is fraught with conflict, competing interests, anger and distrust.

Farmers complain of hanging in uncertainty for years; say pollution sources such as aviation, road travel and industry are scarcely addressed; and assert their sector has made more reductions than any other. ""People in the countryside have been innovating for 30 years to reduce nitrogen - there's no other sector that has done as much,"" said Kees Hanse, a farmer and windfarm owner in Zierikzee who is standing in Zeeland elections for the growing BBB Farmer-Citizen Movement. ""We don't want to get ever bigger but we will continue to innovate and keep trying to create safe food resources for people. Nitrogen reductions are not about buying up farmers. It should come from industry, air traffic, shipping, car movements.""

Meanwhile the idea of suggesting the Dutch should eat less meat was so controversial that it was quietly removed from a 2019 climate awareness campaign by a former agriculture minister.

Some believe that a nitrogen pricing system, part of the new proposals, will help.

""Farmers haven't done anything wrong: they have just done what the economy dictates,"" said MP de Groot. ""Because there's no pricing of pollution, food is too cheap. The damage has been counted by an institute at â‚¬7bn a year, in the Netherlands. You should [monetise] that - and then the economy will change.""

Environmentalists like Oerlemans call for scrutiny of other parts of the food chain - including banks and feed producers - as well as help for farmers to transition to better-paid, lower-intensity farming plus services such as nature development, flood plain management and carbon sequestration.

But for dairy farmers like de Sain - one of those the government wants to legalise by making ""peak polluters"" stop - certainty cannot come soon enough. ""Farmers always followed the rules,"" she said. ""If I could make ends meet with 50 cows, why would I milk 100?""

I've been accused of being a ""˜soyboy' and ""˜in the pay of Big Lettuce' by one of the most destructive industries on Earth

Everything that makes campaigning against fossil fuels difficult is 10 times harder when it comes to opposing livestock farming. Here you will find a similar suite of science denial, misinformation and greenwashing. But in this case, it's accompanied by a toxic combination of identity politics, nostalgia, machismo and the demonisation of alternatives. If you engage with this issue, you don't just need a thick skin; you need the skin of a glyptodon.

You will be vilified daily as a ""soyboy"", a ""hater of farmers"" and a dictator who would force everyone to eat insects. You will be charged with undermining western civilisation, destroying its masculinity and threatening its health. You will be denounced as an enemy of Indigenous people, though generally not by Indigenous people themselves, for many of whom livestock farming is and has long been by far the greatest cause of land-grabbing, displacement and the destruction of their homes.

You will find yourself up against those who promote paleo diets (with or without added anabolic steroids), ""agrarian localists"" pushing impossible dreams of feeding 21st-century populations with medieval production systems, and culinary conservatism, which ranges, in different forms, from Donald Trump to MasterChef. You will find yourself fighting not only a very modern and peculiarly vicious demagoguery, but also a very old and deep-rooted romanticism, which still portrays the pastoral life much as the Greek poets and the Old Testament prophets did. There's a powerful, de facto alliance between the two.

Perhaps most often, you'll be denounced as a puppet of the World Economic Forum (a target of multiple conspiracy fictions), or a stooge of corporate or institutional power, in the pay of plant-based meat, precision fermentation, Big Lettuce or Big Bug, which are depicted as monstrous behemoths stamping on traditional businesses. As usual, it's pure projection. Between 2015 and 2020, financial institutions invested $478bn (£380bn) in meat and dairy corporations. But from 2010 to 2020, only $5.9bn was invested in plant-based and other alternatives. Astonishingly, the livestock industry also receives, across the EU and US, about 1,000 times more government funding than alternative products. This includes massively more money for research and innovation, even though meat and dairy are well-established industries, while the alternatives are at the beginning of their innovation phase. Why? Because the livestock industry's political connections are umbilical.

Tempting as it is to turn away, we simply cannot afford to ignore this sector. A remarkably wide and intense range of impacts - from global-scale habitat destruction to the mass slaughter of predators, river pollution, air pollution, dead zones at sea, antibiotic resistance and greenhouse gas emissions - reveal livestock farming, alongside fossil fuels, as one of the two most destructive industries on Earth.

The chances of a reasoned conversation across the divide are approximately zero. That's not an accident. It's a result of decades of the meat industry's tobacco-style tactics and manufactured culture wars. Clever messaging triggers men who are obsessed by (and anxious about) their masculinity, generating paranoia over ""feminisation"" and a loss of dominance. The industry amplifies popular but false claims about livestock healing the land and drawing down more greenhouse gases than it produces. These efforts are reinforced by a tidal wave of disinformation from far-right influencers on social media. While many people have now become aware of how the fossil fuel industry has deceived us, there's less recognition of the even grimmer game played by the livestock industry.

This came to a head at Cop28, which was meant to be the first climate summit at which the impacts of the food system were properly considered. But by the time 120 meat and dairy lobbyists had done their worst, nothing meaningful came of it.

The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) unveiled a report at the summit that was shocking even by that organisation's notoriously pro-corporate standards. It greatly underplayed the impacts of the livestock industry and proposed nothing but a series of feeble technofixes to address it, including some that have been wildly overhyped, such as feeding seaweed to cows to limit the amount of methane they produce. I call this approach guillotine syndrome. There might be a slight improvement in efficiency, but it's still decapitation.

Where was the discussion in this report about reducing livestock production or consumption? On the contrary, it proposed that, for nutritional reasons, the poor world should be eating more meat and dairy. It's true that many of the world's poor should have access to more protein and fat, but new approaches, such as microbial proteins, could deliver them to everyone without the import dependency, environmental disasters and health problems caused by switching to a western diet.

So where, in the FAO's vision, would these extra livestock products come from? Hold on to your seats, because the answer is truly gobsmacking. As the Financial Times reports, the organisation's chief economist, Maximo Torero, explained that ""the way forward was for countries that are ""˜very efficient in producing livestock', such as the Netherlands and New Zealand, to produce more meat and dairy and then ship those products across the world"". Could he really be unaware that both these countries have been thrown into severe ecological and political crisis by the scale of their livestock industries? Yet now he wants them to produce even more - and for poorer nations to become dependent on these imports? Greetings to our visitor from Planet Meat.

The FAO, as the Guardian has documented, has a long and shameful history of suppressing awareness of livestock's massive impacts. The scientists at the organisation who tried to raise the alarm about the environmental impacts of livestock production in 2006 and 2009 were vilified, censored and sabotaged by senior management. Following the report it published this week, I feel I can state with confidence that the FAO is a major cog in the meat misinformation machine.

The meat industry also nobbled the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Earlier this year, delegates from Brazil and Argentina - major meat exporters - managed to block its recommendation that we should shift towards plant-based diets.

Huge and powerful as these forces are, we need to be brave in confronting livestock production and the dark arts used to promote it. Those of us who do so don't hate farmers, however much some of them might profess to hate us. We simply seek to apply the same standards to this industry as we'd apply to any other. But when we raise our hands in objection, they are met with fists raised in aggression. That's the strategy, working as intended.

Analysis of EU and US shows livestock farmers receive about 1,000 times more public funding than plant-based and cultivated meat



The ""gigantic"" power of the meat and dairy industries in the EU and US is blocking the development of the greener alternatives needed to tackle the climate crisis, a study has found.

The analysis of lobbying, subsidies and regulations showed that livestock farmers in the EU received 1,200 times more public funding than plant-based meat or cultivated meat groups. In the US, the animal farmers got 800 times more public funding.

The money spent on lobbying the US government by meat producers was 190 times more than for the alternatives and was three times higher in the EU. The researchers also found that almost all dietary guidelines avoided highlighting the environmental impact of meat production and bans on alternative products using terms such as ""milk"".

Cutting meat consumption in rich nations is vital to tackling the climate crisis. Livestock production causes 15% of all global greenhouse emissions. Cutting meat and dairy consumption also slashes pollution, land and water use, and the destruction of forests, with scientists saying it is the single biggest way for people to reduce their impact on the planet.

""The power of the animal farming sector, both in the US and in Europe, and the political influence they have is just gigantic,"" said Prof Eric Lambin, who conducted the study with Dr Simona Vallone, both at Stanford University, US.

The researchers concluded that ""powerful vested interests exerted their political influence to maintain the system unchanged and to obstruct competition created by technological innovations"".

Lambin said: ""We found that the amazing obstacles to the upscaling of the alternative technologies relates to public policies that still massively fund the incumbent system, when we know it's really part of the problem in terms of climate change, biodiversity loss and some health issues.""

The researchers said that tackling the problem would require government policies that ensured the price of meat reflected its environmental costs, potentially via taxation, increased research on alternatives, and better informed consumers.

Alex Holst, at the Good Food Institute Europe, said: ""While European investment in sustainable proteins has increased in recent years, this study shows the sector is still only picking the crumbs off the EU's table. The sector needs public investment to scale production and reduce prices [or] Europe risks missing out on the enormous benefits.""

The North American Meat Institute and Copa-Cogeca, Europe's largest farming trade body, did not respond to requests for comment.

The study, published in the journal One Earth, analysed the major EU and US agricultural policies from 2014 to 2020. It found the amount of public money spent on plant-based alternatives was just $42m (£33m) - 0.1% of the £35bn spent on meat and dairy. The former accounted for 1.5% of all sales. In the EU, cattle farmers got at least 50% of their income from direct subsidies.

For research and innovation spending, 97% went to animal farmers, with almost all of these funds aimed at improving production.

The researchers also highlighted restrictive labelling rules. Terms such as ""milk"" and ""cheese"" have been banned since 2017 in the EU for most alternative milk and dairy products. A US proposal would prohibit the sale of alternative meats unless the product label included the word ""imitation"".

National dietary guidelines influence the many millions of meals served in public sector institutions such as schools, hospitals and prisons. The researchers found there was no mention of the environmental impacts of meat and dairy in US dietary guidelines nor in all but four of the EU's 27 member states.

""Dietary guidelines are shaped with a strong influence from industry representatives,"" said Lambin. ""However, the Nordic country guidelines have just been rewritten and for the first time clearly promote a mostly plant-based diet.""

Lambin said there were glimmers of hope for a shift to more sustainable diets, with EU proposals to accelerate the shift due to be adopted this year, funding in the US Inflation Reduction Act to help farmers cut emissions, and the US approval of lab-grown chicken.

""It's not a level playing field at all at the moment,"" Lambin said. ""The new sector needs to be given its chance to expand and gain efficiency. After that, consumers will judge whether they like it or not, and scientists will judge whether it is really better for the environment and for health. But if it cannot even develop to a scale where we can make this assessment, it will be a lost opportunity to transition to a sustainable food system.""

A 2022 report from the Boston Consulting Group said plant-based meat was by far the most effective climate investment.

Document used to target top EU officials over environmental and health policies but climate experts view it as propaganda

A public statement signed by more than 1,000 scientists in support of meat production and consumption has numerous links to the livestock industry, the Guardian can reveal. The statement has been used to target top EU officials against environmental and health policies and has been endorsed by the EU agriculture commissioner.

The ""Dublin Declaration of Scientists on the Societal Role of Livestock"" says livestock ""are too precious to society to become the victim of simplification, reductionism or zealotry"" and calls for a ""balanced view of the future of animal agriculture"". One of the authors of the declaration is an economist who called veganism an ""eating disorder requiring psychological treatment"".

The declaration was published a year ago but gave no information on its provenance. Its supporters appear to be overwhelmingly researchers in animal, agricultural and food sciences.

Documents obtained by Unearthed, Greenpeace UK's journalism project, and seen by the Guardian, show the creation, launch and promotion of the declaration have significant links to the livestock industry and its consultants.

The declaration and associated studies are viewed as ""propaganda"" by leading environmental scientists. Prof Matthew Hayek of New York University in the US said: ""The scientific consensus is that we need rapid meat reduction in the regions that can afford that choice.""

Studies in the highest-ranking scientific journals have concluded that cutting meat and dairy consumption in rich countries is the single best way to reduce a person's impact on the environment and that the climate crisis cannot be beaten without such cuts. People already eat more meat than health guidelines recommend in most developed nations.

The EU was pursuing policies to reduce meat consumption on environmental and health grounds, but some of these have recently been dropped.

""˜Dietary comedy'

The Dublin Declaration was launched at a meeting hosted by the Irish government's agriculture and food agency, Teagasc, in October 2022, with the summit costing â‚¬45,000. It claims ""livestock-derived foods are the most readily available source of high-quality proteins"" and that ""well-managed livestock systems ""¦ can generate many other benefits, including carbon sequestration, improved soil health, biodiversity, watershed protection"".

It was supported in April by a special issue of an academic journal, Animal Frontiers, guest edited by Prof Dr Peer Ederer and Prof Dr Frederic Leroy. Both were part of a six-member organising committee that initiated the declaration.

Ederer runs the Global Food and Agribusiness Network (GFAN), a company that provides research and advice to clients in the meat and livestock sector. He said recently on social media that veganism was an ""eating disorder requiring psychological treatment"" and likened it to the Heaven's Gate cult.

He has also criticised the ""climate hysteric policies"" of the EU and in 2020 gave a talk to the Global Warming Policy Foundation, the UK's most high-profile climate sceptic group, in which he said ""cows are not the reason for whatever climate change we have"".

Emails related to the declaration were released by Teagasc under freedom of information rules. In one, another member of the organising committee, Collette Kaster, the chief executive of the American Meat Science Association, described Ederer as the ""primary author"" of the declaration, although he denies this.

He said: ""The authorship for the declaration lies with the entire group of 36 scientist co-authors who contributed to the scientific articles of the Animal Frontiers special edition."" A webpage describing the authorship appeared on the declaration website after Ederer was contacted by the Guardian. ""We had not reported about our potential conflicts of interest as would be common in scientific practice, so we fixed this,"" Ederer said.

""I have clients in the livestock sector,"" Ederer said. ""This emphasis on whether some researchers have customers from private industry is, in my view, and many people's, completely meaningless, because there's no such thing as conflict-of-interest free research."" He said no one was paid for their involvement in the Dublin meeting or declaration.

Leroy is a food scientist at Vrije Universiteit Brussels and president of the Belgian Association of Meat Science and Technology. He has called plant-based meat alternatives ""dietary comedy"", suggested green campaigners ""would secretly enjoy a savage apocalypse"" and called politicians backing green policies ""out-of-touch, virtue-signalling simpletons"".

The EU's biggest farming lobby group, Copa Cogeca, says it ""supports"" a pro-livestock information initiative administered by Leroy and the documents show Leroy discussed the declaration with Copa Cogeca. Leroy did not respond to requests for comment.

Polish beef

The declaration shares some text and themes with a position paper prepared for the UN food systems summit in 2021 by dozens of groups, including nine private industry associations such as the International Meat Secretariat, International Poultry Council and the International Dairy Federation. Ederer said: ""The private industry associations had minimal input into the document.""

An assistant director of Teagasc, Declan Troy, one of the Dublin organising committee, noted in an email that some of its members had ""close ties"" to the meat sector, ""but then so does Teagasc"".

A spokesperson for Teagasc said: ""Contracts with food companies outline that they will not have any influence over the publications of the outputs of the research or knowledge transfer programmes."" The American Meat Science Association (AMSA), represented by Kaster on the committee, is a professional society of meat scientists and supported financially by many of the world's biggest meat producers.

The Dublin Declaration website is hosted by a meat industry research project called the International Meat Research G3 Foundation, which is registered to the same Warsaw address as the Polish Beef Association (PBA) and is chaired by the PBA's president.

The declaration was publicly promoted by the Global Meat Alliance, an industry-funded group, and the PR agency Red Flag, which has worked for the North American Meat Institute and the US National Cattlemen's Beef Association. Ederer said he did not know who paid Red Flag.

""˜Fossil fuel playbook'

The declaration states that ""the highest standards of ""¦ evidence underscore that the regular consumption of meat, dairy and eggs, as part of a well-balanced diet, is advantageous for human beings"" and that ""drastic reductions of livestock numbers could actually incur environmental problems on a large scale"".

As evidence, the declaration points to seven papers published in the special issue of Animal Frontiers in April 2023. The publication is the ""official journal"" of the World Association for Animal Production (WAAP) and four animal science societies, which fund it. These include AMSA, with Kaster serving on the management board of the journal. WAAP also states that ""industry representatives are involved in its activities"".

The journal's content was delivered by Ederer and Leroy as guest editors. Ederer said he considered the special issue to be the work of all six members of the Dublin organising committee.

Prof Peter Smith of the University of Aberdeen, UK, a lead author on eight reports by the authoritative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said: ""The Dublin Declaration reads more like livestock industry propaganda than science. It makes a mockery of independent, objective science publishing. This is not about stifling debate - it is about protecting scientific integrity.""

after newsletter promotion

Smith viewed the declaration and the Animal Frontiers studies as extremely poor, selective science and he is working with other experts on a comprehensive rebuttal. For example, he asserted that they overgeneralise evidence that applies to a very small fraction of global livestock and fail to acknowledge the serious and acute public health and environmental harms of livestock.

Hayek said: ""It is clear from the past two decades of independent, peer-reviewed evidence that business-as-usual meat production and consumption is unsustainable and growing.""

He added: ""Scientific consensus can and should always be challenged, but doing so requires strong, novel, and large amounts of high-quality evidence. The Animal Frontiers issue does not accomplish that."" In Hayek's view, many of the articles are ""just slanted reviews that rehash and re-adjudicate old debates"".

Prof Jennifer Jacquet of the University of Miami, US, said: ""The Dublin Declaration is another instance of the livestock industry taking a page out of the fossil fuel playbook to fight action on climate change. It tries to leverage the academic profession and its institutions to downplay the role of livestock in climate change.""

A statement from the management board of Animal Frontiers said: ""Animal Frontiers publishes discussion and position papers that present international perspectives on the status of high-impact, global issues in animal agriculture. The journal requires all authors to disclose any potential conflict of interest at the point of submission.""

Leroy and Ederer published a letter in the journal Nature Food in June 2023 decrying ""hyperbolic arguments"" against meat production and consumption and highlighting the Dublin Declaration and Animal Frontiers papers.

A recent response in the same journal by 16 scientists said the letter ""contains unsubstantiated generalisations and statements"" and ""overlooked and downplayed research demonstrating the incompatibility of current and projected levels of consumption of animal products with the imperatives of bringing humanity's economy within the planetary biophysical limits"".

Winking face emoji

The Dublin Declaration has been used to try to influence senior EU officials. Ederer and others presented the messages in the declaration at a PBA meeting in Warsaw in January 2023, which was attended by Janusz Wojciechowski, the EU's agricultural commissioner, and his officials. Wojciechowski had already endorsed the declaration on social media in October, calling it ""a very valuable contribution to the ongoing debates in the EU"".

A blog post from the Global Meat Alliance (GMA) about the meeting said: ""Ensuring that the evidence presented at the Dublin summit is visible to the European commissioner is of huge significance."" Ederer told the GMA that the meeting had ""proved fruitful"". The blog post's author said they had watched the meeting via Zoom ""with a glass of wine in hand and a rather large steak"".

Shortly after the Warsaw meeting, Ederer wrote to Leroy, Troy and the rest of the organising committee: ""I spoke with the head of cabinet of the commissioner and his press coordinator. They both said that the Dublin summit and the Dublin Declaration was the first piece of utilisable science they have received in all their four years of commission work. They are more than enthusiastic about our clarity and depth of scientific evidence and relevance that we pulled together. They will support us with any other event we want to organise, especially if we do something in Brussels. We are on the right track.""

In April, there was an event in Brussels promoting the declaration, hosted by the industry-backed group Animal Task Force (ATF). Leroy wrote of the event: ""We're specifically targeting the Brussels EU bubble.""

In email discussions before the meeting, Leroy suggested involving ATF on the basis that it was a ""network of scientists"". Ana Granados Chapatte, an ATF vice-president representing industry bodies, backed the suggestion, saying it would help the event ""remain a scientific initiative ""¦ far from the use of science that the private sector or NGOs can do for their own interest ""¦ even if ATF is also the private sector"", ending the sentence with a winking face emoji.

Chapatte told the Guardian: ""ATF is a partnership that brings together public research and the private sector to define research and innovation priorities for European Commission research programmes aimed at enhancing livestock sector sustainability, with a focus on Brussels' EU policymakers and stakeholders.""

Indefinite delay

In November 2022, the EU's leading agrifood lobby groups wrote to Wojciechowski using the Dublin Declaration to argue against a plan to end public funding for the promotion of red meat. The EU has spent hundreds of millions of euros advertising meat and dairy products but the plan to end the funding is deadlocked in Brussels.

The declaration was also highlighted to the European Commission's group of chief scientific advisers as it produced its advice on moving ""towards sustainable food consumption"".

The EU's sustainable food systems legislation was expected to be published in September but has since been dropped. ""It's clear that this commission, when it comes to food and farming, started with a very high level of commitment, at least in words, but it has ended up with basically nothing,"" said Marco Contiero, Greenpeace's EU policy director on agriculture.

Olga Kikou of the campaign group Compassion in World Farming said: ""The commission seems to have undertaken a U-turn in its promised reform of the EU agriculture policy. It is clear that more transparency is needed on how tools such as the Dublin Declaration are used.""

Contiero said: ""Opposing the necessary reduction in livestock production and consumption means supporting vast amounts of deforestation, huge loss of biodiversity and a guaranteed end to a stable climate.""

Exclusive: Pressure from agriculture lobbies led to role of cattle in rising global temperatures being underplayed by FAO, claim sources

Former officials in the UN's farming wing have said they were censored, sabotaged, undermined and victimised for more than a decade after they wrote about the hugely damaging contribution of methane emissions from livestock to global heating.

Team members at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) tasked with estimating cattle's contribution to soaring temperatures said that pressure from farm-friendly funding states was felt throughout the FAO's Rome headquarters and coincided with attempts by FAO leadership to muzzle their work.

The allegations date back to the years after 2006, when some of the officials who spoke exclusively to the Guardian on condition of anonymity wrote Livestock's Long Shadow (LLS), a landmark report that pushed farm emissions on to the climate agenda for the first time. LLS included the first tally of the meat and dairy sector's ecological cost, attributing 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions to livestock, mostly cattle. It shocked an industry that had long seen the FAO as a reliable ally - and spurred an internal clampdown by FAO hierarchy, according to the officials.

""The lobbyists obviously managed to influence things,"" one ex-official said. ""They had a strong impact on the way things were done at the FAO and there was a lot of censorship. It was always an uphill struggle getting the documents you produced past the office for corporate communications and one had to fend off a good deal of editorial vandalism.""

Serving and former FAO experts said that between 2006 and 2019, management made numerous attempts to suppress investigations into the cow/climate change connection. Top officials rewrote and diluted key passages in another report on the same topic, ""buried"" another paper critical of big agriculture, excluded critical officials from meetings and summits, and briefed against their work.

""There was substantial pressure internally and there were consequences for permanent staff who worked on this, in terms of their careers. It wasn't really a healthy environment to work in,"" said another ex-official.

Scientists also expressed concern about the way the FAO's estimate of livestock's overall contribution to emissions is continuing to fall. The 18% number that was published in 2006 was revised downwards to 14.5% in a follow-up paper, Tackling Climate Change Emissions in 2013. It is currently being assessed at about 11.2% based on a new ""Gleam 3.0"" model.

But many scientists plot farm emissions on a very different trajectory. One recent study concluded that greenhouse gas emissions from animal products made up 20% of the global total and a 2021 study found that the figure should be between 16.5% and 28.1%.

A recent paper by Matthew Hayek, the assistant professor in environmental sciences at New York University, said that the FAO's use of emissions modeling - without using verifiable atmospheric data - could underestimate methane emissions from livestock by up to 47% in countries such as the US. ""Models are only estimates that need to be constantly validated - and there's been an alarming lack of validation over the now decades that this [FAO] research has been produced,"" he said.

Anne Mottet, the FAO's livestock development officer, stressed that the changing figures reflected best practices and evolving methodologies, rather than an assumed cut in livestock numbers.

""Livestock is part of the FAO's strategy on climate change and we work with governments and farmers and industry on this programme as well,"" she said. ""We can't ignore the main actors of the sector but there has been no particular pressure from them.""

The new report's methodology had produced more accurate figures because ""we have access to better data and tools and the IPCC calculations for emissions are also being improved and updated regularly"", she added.

The Guardian conducted in-depth interviews with about 20 former and current FAO officials, and corroborated their accounts as far as possible. Speaking anonymously, the officials described a culture in which attempts to probe the connection between livestock and climate change were discouraged and, in some cases, suppressed, and where management attempted to sabotage research and research networks. Henning Steinfeld, the head of the FAO's livestock analysis unit, said that diplomats and meat lobbyists talked to senior FAO managers and encouraged them not to invest in work that dealt with environmental impacts.

""It's not that anyone would come to you and say: ""˜Stop this! We don't like this work,'"" the source said, describing the working environment. ""They would just make your work difficult. They would not invite you to a meeting with a donor. You would not get a slot when you should be speaking. You would not get the support from project development, from capacity building, from all kinds of other units in the FAO that others would get.""

Jennifer Jacquet, professor of environmental science at the University of Miami, suggested it was ""no coincidence"" that the FAO had rowed back on its appraisal of farm emissions, given the pressures recounted by former officials. ""It's a story as old as time, that the meat and dairy industry has enormous influence over the policymaking apparatus,"" she said.

FAO data was a ""prime source"" of data for the UN International Panel on Climate Change's last report on forestry and agriculture, according to its lead author, Gert Jan Nabuurs.

The organisation's current focus is on making sure that scientific innovation is made as available as possible for farmers around the world. In September it hosted the first global conference on sustainable livestock transformation, which looked at animal feed, precision farming and animal genetic resources, with the goal of ""sharing information about good practices and initiatives to make optimal use of natural resources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions"".

It has also, for the first time, set itself the aim of trying to outline how food systems must change for the world to stay within the globally agreed goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.

The FAO and several meat and dairy industry lobbyists declined to comment for this story.

This article was amended on 24 October 2023. A previous version said a paper found that the FAO's model could underestimate methane emissions from livestock by up to 90%; that should have been 47%.

Detailed analysis finds plant diets lead to 75% less climate-heating emissions, water pollution and land use than meat-rich ones

Eating a vegan diet massively reduces the damage to the environment caused by food production, the most comprehensive analysis to date has concluded.

The research showed that vegan diets resulted in 75% less climate-heating emissions, water pollution and land use than diets in which more than 100g of meat a day was eaten. Vegan diets also cut the destruction of wildlife by 66% and water use by 54%, the study found.

The heavy impact of meat and dairy on the planet is well known, and people in rich nations will have to slash their meat consumption in order to end the climate crisis. But previous studies have used model diets and average values for the impact of each food type.

In contrast, the new study analysed the real diets of 55,000 people in the UK. It also used data from 38,000 farms in 119 countries to account for differences in the impact of particular foods that are produced in different ways and places. This significantly strengthens confidence in the conclusions.

However, it turned out that what was eaten was far more important in terms of environmental impacts than where and how it was produced. Previous research has shown that even the lowest-impact meat - organic pork - is responsible for eight times more climate damage than the highest-impact plant, oilseed.

The researchers said the UK should introduce policies to help people reduce the amount of meat they eat in order to meet the nation's climate targets. Ministers have repeatedly said they will not tell people what to consume, despite the precedent of, for example, taxes on high-sugar drinks.

Prof Peter Scarborough at Oxford University, who led the research, published in the journal Nature Food, said: ""Our dietary choices have a big impact on the planet. Cutting down the amount of meat and dairy in your diet can make a big difference to your dietary footprint.""

The global food system has a huge impact on the planet, emitting a third of the total greenhouse gas emissions driving global heating. It also uses 70% of the world's freshwater and causes 80% of river and lake pollution. About 75% of the Earth's land is used by humans, largely for farming, and the destruction of forests is the major cause of the huge losses in biodiversity.

Prof Neil Ward at the University of East Anglia said: ""This is a significant set of findings. It scientifically reinforces the point made by the Climate Change Committee and the National Food Strategy over recent years that dietary shifts away from animal-based foods can make a major contribution to reducing the UK's environmental footprint.""

The study also showed that low-meat diets - less than 50g a day - had half the impact of high-meat diets on greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution and land use. However, the differences between low-meat, pescetarian and vegetarian diets were relatively small.

Prof Richard Tiffin at the University of Reading said: ""This study represents the most comprehensive attempt to link food consumption data to the data on the environmental impacts of food production.

""Encouraging high-meat-eaters to reduce meat consumption and encouraging vegetarians to become vegans should result in lower emissions,"" he said. ""However, it's hard to justify changes to the diets of moderate omnivores on the basis of these results, other than to switch to a completely vegan diet.""

The researchers who conducted the new study said diets enabling global food production to be sustainable would mean people in rich nations ""radically"" reducing meat and dairy consumption.

They said other ways of reducing the environmental impact of the food system, such as new technology and cutting food waste, would not be enough.

The biggest difference seen in the study was for emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas produced by cattle and sheep, which were 93% lower for vegan diets compared with high-meat diets.

The UK Health Alliance on Climate Change recommended in 2020 that sustainable diets should be supported by mandatory environmental labelling on foods, regulation of promotions and taxation of high-carbon foods.

A government spokesperson said: ""People should make their own decisions around the food they eat. Achieving the net-zero target is a priority, and whilst food choices can have an impact on greenhouse gas emissions, well-managed livestock also provide environmental benefits such as supporting biodiversity, protecting the character of the countryside, and generating important income for rural communities.""

The farming minister, Mark Spencer, said last week that he would like to see genetically modified cows that emit less methane.

Concern over public health fuelled by studies linking UPF to raised blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes

Health experts have ramped up calls to improve the national diet in the wake of research that paints a worrying picture of the harms linked to the consumption of ultra-processed food (UPF).

Doctors, scientists and dieticians say a wide-ranging and comprehensive effort is needed to boost public health, with strategies to combat the aggressive marketing of UPF, remove the food industry's influence over policymaking and make sure healthy foods are affordable, accessible and enjoyable.

""We have a food system driven by profit and cost and that makes it a challenge, but the solutions are out there,"" said Duane Mellor, a dietician and senior lecturer at Aston University. ""It's not an unsolvable problem.""

Concern over the national diet has been fuelled by recent studies linking UPF to raised blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes - findings described as a wake-up call for governments worldwide. Previously, researchers have found higher rates of heart disease, obesity and some cancers in those who eat the most UPF.

Research on UPF typically adopts the Nova classification developed by Brazilian researchers more than a decade ago. It groups foods according to how much they are processed.

Group one foods are minimally processed or unprocessed such as whole fruit and vegetables, fresh meat and fish.

Group two foods are processed ingredients such as salt, sugar and oils.

Group three covers processed foods such as tinned fruit and vegetables.

Group four are the ultra-processed foods: sweet and savoury snacks, ready meals, soft drinks and other items that often have little if any intact food from group one. On average, UPF makes up half of the UK diet.

The Nova classification is not perfect. Mellor points out that wholemeal and wholegrain bread from the supermarket count as UPF but are ""probably not what we should be worrying about"".

Most bread is made by the Chorleywood process, which uses fats and emulsifiers so more water and lower-protein flours can be used. And many foods classified as UPF are those high in salt, fat and sugar, for which dietary guidance already exists, he adds.

Despite its shortcomings, the Nova classification has driven a surge in research. The vast majority are observational studies that look for associations between UPF and poor health in populations, but cannot prove that consumption is to blame. This shortcoming, common to nearly all nutritional research, leads to uncertainty - and uncertainty leads to inaction.

In July, the government's scientific advisory committee on nutrition noted that while the evidence around UPF causing harm was ""concerning"", the limitations of Nova and other potential explanations for ill-health - such as people with poor lifestyles eating more UPF - meant the findings should be treated with caution.

But others want action now. ""We urgently need to advise people to reduce consumption of UPF in our national dietary guidance,"" said Chris van Tulleken, an expert on UPF and author of the bestselling book Ultra Processed People. ""Globally, poor diet is the leading risk factor for early death and cardiovascular disease, and the evidence shows that poor diet means a diet high in UPF.""

He wants black warning labels on UPF, a move adopted in Chile and Mexico.

Elling Bere, a professor of public health at the University of Agder in Norway, agrees there are weaknesses in UPF research, but believes the evidence is strong enough to warrant warnings. He and Dr Filippa Juul at New York University were asked to review the health effects of UPF and make recommendations for this year's Nordic Nutritional Recommendations (NNR).

On the basis of the review, Bere and Juul said the NNR should advise people to limit their consumption of UPF. The advice was turned down after it was opened for public consultation. The decision drew accusations of food industry influence, which the NNR strongly deny.

""I was surprised because we just summed up the literature,"" said Bere. ""As far as I can see, the science behind the advice on eating red meat is no stronger than for UPF and they say don't eat more than 350g of red meat a week. There's not even a qualitative recommendation on UPF. We should think about the precautionary principle.""

How UPF might cause ill health is still being untangled. The foods tend to be high in fat, salt and sugar; they are energy dense, but poor in fibre and other nutrients. They contain emulsifiers, preservatives, gelling agents and artificial colours and flavours.

One of the most famous studies in the field, led by Kevin Hall at the US National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in Maryland, found that people on a UPF diet over-consumed and put on weight compared with those who ate less processed food.

Processing itself may be an issue, by destroying nutrients and making it easier for the body to absorb calories. ""It looks like there is something in the processing that is not good for us,"" said Bere.

Mellor argues that public health campaigns should focus on promoting healthy diets rather than stressing the harms of UPF. He wants more social community cooking spaces where people can make and buy inexpensive, healthy meals made from ingredients that would otherwise go to waste.

""We can have healthy street food outlets and a pay-as-you-can approach,"" he says. Smart marketing strategies are also needed, he adds, to show that healthy foods can be quick, enjoyable and affordable.

In the face of industry power, the challenge appears substantial. ""We need to remove the influence of the industry,"" says van Tulleken. ""Until the major charities that inform policy, the research groups doing dietary health research, and the doctors and scientists that write in the media stop taking money from the food industry, very little will change. Just like tobacco, we need to see UPF company money as dirty.""

In her new book, Endangered Eating, Sarah Lohman chronicles disappearing foods - and why they need protecting

The American buff goose. Amish deer tongue lettuce. The Nancy Hall sweet potato. The mulefoot hog. When food historian Sarah Lohman stumbled on these fantastical-sounding ingredients in a database of vanishing foods called the Ark of Taste, she set off on a journey across the United States to discover more ingredients and traditions that had been abandoned in the annals of history.

The endeavor was the latest installment of a storied career that has included cooking 19th-century recipes at a living history museum and chronicling American cuisine in her book Eight Flavors, which documents how foods like black pepper and sriracha have helped reshape what Americans eat.

Her journey across the United States resulted in her latest book, Endangered Eating: America's Vanishing Foods, which came out in October. To report the book, she clambered up ladders in Coachella valley to examine rare dates dangling from palm trees. She butchered and prepared a Navajo-churro sheep with local people living on Indigenous land in the south-west. She flew to South Carolina to visit a farm where a food historian was growing a type of peanut previously thought to be extinct.

Lohman spoke to the Guardian about the cultural and political importance of these near-forgotten foods. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

So what is an endangered food, exactly?

I was drawn into this whole project because endangered foods are not something we usually think about. Usually, the term is applied to species: manatees, or pandas. People don't say, ""Save the Long Island cheese pumpkin,"" which is a beautiful native Long Island pumpkin that is also on the Ark of Taste list [which is run by the NGO Slow Food International].

But endangered foods are the focus of Slow Food International's work. They catalogue thousands of international and hundreds of national foods that are considered delicious, distinctive and worthy of protection. In some cases, those foods are not endangered, just hyperlocal, and they want to protect that food because it's important culturally in some way. In other cases, there's a threat to the foods they've catalogued: there are few of them left or there's a reason they're not grown anymore. One theme in my book is that there's a very diverse list of reasons why these foods are on the brink of extinction. Some are stable, meaning they're not imminently going extinct - but stable doesn't necessarily mean safe.

What might land a food on the endangered list?

It depends. For Coachella valley dates, the biggest reason is that farming is a difficult industry. The second- and third-generation inheritors of a family farm don't necessarily want to keep going, so those plants can be lost. For Hawaiian legacy sugar cane, development played a huge role. Hawaiian resorts have a huge effect on native and agricultural plants, as people's homes are being bought up and their backyards bulldozed. The endangerment of the Navajo-churro sheep and other Indigenous foods are the results of colonization and cultural genocide. This happens when Indigenous people are moved off their land and then [their foods are] purposely replaced with foods that are important to European Americans, such as white flour, pork and coffee. That's the government coming in and saying: ""That's not the right way to live. Empty space is unused space. You need to plant a tree on it. You can't move around with your herds.""

It can also be something simple. The Carolina runner peanut is a little tiny peanut that's delicious but hard to pick by hand, and was discarded for a larger peanut that fits machinery better. There are so many reasons. You can see how they create a broad picture of American history and all the ways we've chosen to shape our landscape over time. It's time to walk some of that back to make sure we can maintain that culinary history.

And why is that culinary history important? Why preserve these foods?

It depends who you ask. For me, individual foods are important because they're culturally important. Flavor is processed in the same part of the brain as memory. We often talk about the taste of home, whether that's your family's cooking or a food that's only available in the geographical region where you grew up. Imagine that flavor being taken away and never experiencing it again. There's something deeply psychologically important about these foods sticking around. Also, as I wrote in this book, it's important to assist cultures across America, whether that's native, Black, migrant or immigrant groups, to make sure that everybody has access to their particular cultural foods, and that the caretakers of those foods will have them for a long time to come.

In 2016, I reviewed your previous book, Eight Flavors, which argued that American cuisine is constantly expanding to encompass new food traditions. Did your latest research inspire you to question or expand upon that thesis?

Of course, in Eight Flavors, I thought about some of these ideas. That book is also concerned with the idea of what we eat and why: this is why we're eating black pepper, this is where vanilla came from. In Eight Flavors, I explore the idea that American food comes here in shifts. I still enjoy seeing that play out.

But at the same time, there's this list of hundreds of things that have been edited out of our food systems. This book asks the question: why? What is it saying about us that we are selecting out foods we don't eat? Where are those foods going? A lot of times, it's not easy to make sure they're preserved, but it's incredibly worthwhile.

What's your favorite of the foods you explore in this book?

There's an apple called the Newtown pippin, which was created on Long Island. Nobody is familiar with this apple anymore, but it's never faced the same endangerment as other heirloom apples because it's the primary apple in Martinelli's cider. They pay a premium for Newtown pippin to be planted. That's very nostalgic for me, because Martinelli's was a big part of my family.

Now, instead of thinking about something as an apple, I think about the story behind it. I see these ingredients everywhere now. It feels like learning a new language.

I love that feeling when you're introduced to a different way of noticing. It's like putting on a new lens.

That's the hope for this book: that it'll change the ways that readers look at American food, and everything that food can mean.

Once people put on that lens, what definitive steps can they take to save these foods? What's the solution here?

I don't think there's any one answer. One major question we need to consider is: who should have access to these foods and at what price? I found people profiting off Indigenous foods, and other people profiting off Black American foodways, who weren't of that culture and weren't doing much to provide money or support the original caretakers of these plants. We should view saving foods as an opportunity for people with money and power to funnel money to other people who don't have it. For example, it can mean buying real wild rice from the Ojibwe tribe in the American midwest [who've cultivated wild rice for thousands of years]. It doesn't only put money into the tribal nation, but also to individuals who harvested that rice and sold it. It's a real investment in the community. It can be that easy to buy a bag of rice.

Also, if you're traveling, you can make an effort to engage with the local food community. I use the Ark of Taste book as a food guide. For example, people go to the Coachella valley all the time, for vacation in Palm Springs or to the music festival. If you're there, why not go to the date farm and try some dates? You'll put money into the pocket of the farmer and get to taste one of the world's most delicious foods. You can also let the book guide you to something that's 30 minutes away from you. These foods are an invitation to learn something about your own region, your own culture. They can also give you the incredible opportunity to learn about somebody else.

Safe levels exceeded in 13,000km of rivers globally with ingredients potentially degrading into more persistent substances

Agricultural pesticides leach far from their original sources into the world's waterways, according to new research which finds pesticides exceed safe levels in 13,000km of rivers globally.

Analysing 92 of the most common agricultural pesticides, scientists have estimated that 710 tonnes of pesticide active ingredients leach into the world's oceans each year.

The study, involving Australian scientists and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, also identified pesticide hotspots around the globe.

The research found that the rivers with the highest exposure to land pesticides ""are located in central and western United States (Mississippi and Sacramento), Argentina (Parana), India (Ganges), East China (Yangtze, Pearl and Yellow (Huang He) River) and South East Asia (Irrawaddy and lower Mekong)"".

""Rivers in Europe received an intermediate pesticide yield from land with hotspots along the Po and Danube.""

The calculations were made based on estimates of annual pesticide use in 144 major water catchment areas, amounting to 940,000 tonnes. About 3m tonnes of agricultural pesticides are used globally each year.

The research identified that 82% of pesticides degraded into other molecules while 10% remained as residues in the soil. Another 7.2%, about 68,000 tonnes, leached into aquifers - rocks or sediment that hold groundwater.

""In many observed cases pesticide active substances may degrade into a cascade of daughter substances which can be as toxic as the parent and occasionally even more persistent [in the environment],"" the scientists noted.

The researchers estimated that 730 tonnes wound up in river systems each year, of which 710 tonnes made it to the world's oceans.

The latter figure comprised only a tiny fraction - less than 0.1% - of the agricultural pesticides used in the studied catchments.

""Although this amount is less than 0.1% of net inputs, it is a cause of decreased species richness of stream invertebrates with little known consequences on near-coast ecosystems,"" the researchers noted.

The study's lead author, associate professor Federico Maggi of the University of Sydney, said even small amounts resulted in concentrations above safety limits.

Along more than 13,000km of rivers, pesticide levels exceeded a safety threshold of 1 microgram per litre, with what the researchers say has poorly understood impacts on aquatic ecosystems.

""It is not the pesticide use only that is important,"" Maggi said. ""What is important is the load - that is, the applied mass and toxicity of individual active ingredients.""

Dr Francesco Tubiello, a study co-author and senior environmental statistician at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, said in a statement: ""We must urgently adopt sustainable management strategies to promote reductions in field applications of harmful pesticides and set in place systems to effectively monitor their use under the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.""

The study is published in the journal Nature.

Female farmers represent an increasing share of Golden State cultivators - and grow a wider variety of ""˜specialty crops' than done in traditional monoculture

At Radical Family Farms, Leslie Wiser recently planted bitter melons, what she refers to as ""one of our most beloved crops"", a staple in many types of Asian cuisine that grows on a vine and is related to zucchini, squash and cucumber. It was a warm day on her three-acre farm, yet the cloud cover made it just right to be working on what Wiser says is her ""dreamy but expensive"" mixed-Asian vegetable farm that she started in 2018.

""Regenerative climate, smart farming takes a lot of time,"" said Wiser, the child of Chinese-Taiwanese, German and Polish-Jewish immigrants who came into farming in her early 40s. She dreamed about growing vegetables that reflect her heritage and teach her children where their food comes from, and this is exactly what she's doing.

Women like Wiser are increasingly the face of farming in California, and nationally as well. Experts say the growing presence of women in agriculture is having an impact on how the industry operates, especially in the face of generational challenges like pandemics and climate change, with research showing that women-led businesses are more likely to take a community-minded approach to how they operate and fill in gaps during crises. And as Congress prepares to debate its latest farm bill, many women are calling for it to provide more support for what the legislation calls ""specialty crops"": locally produced fruits and vegetables, often grown by women, as opposed to heavily subsidized industrial staples such as wheat, corn and soybean.

Women in California today represent 37% of all the producers in the state, according to the most recent USDA Census of Agriculture - which only began tracking these numbers in 2017. And since 2009, women are clearly outpacing men in agricultural education.

Caitlin Joseph, Women for the Land program and policy manager at American Farmland Trust, said that 75% of the students who earned a bachelor's degree in agriculture-related majors from 2019 to 2020 at the University of California, Davis, were women. This trend tracks with the rise in the number of women majoring in Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields and establishing careers in physical and life sciences, which include agriculture.

Joseph said that young women might also be inspired by the ""community supported agriculture model"", in which people farm together on land they co-own and do everything from grow food to raise children and feed their communities.

""We think there is strong evidence that women are a growing share of the people in California's agriculture industry,"" Joseph said. ""We know that women have always been essential parts of the farming community in California. But their roles have often been overlooked in behind-the-scenes tasks that are undervalued as key pieces of [agricultural] operations' success, such as bookkeeping, marketing or customer relationship building.""

Now they are more and more a part of the actual production. This trend in California mirrors a similar shift nationally. Between 2012 and 2017, the number of women-operated farms grew by 23% in the US.

In her dissertation about women farmers for Utah State University, published in 2019, Ennea Fairchild wrote: ""Not only are women making up at least a third of those in most agricultural fields, but ""¦ their numbers are continuing to grow, with women increasingly becoming involved in all aspects of agriculture.""

This is having an effect on how American farms operate. Female farmers in the US are younger, more likely to be a beginning farmer and more likely to live on the farm they operate compared with male farmers, according to the Census of Agriculture. American Farmland Trust says women-led farms in the US have laid off fewer workers during financial crises, along with being at the forefront of ensuring food security in their communities.

""""‹""‹Research shows that women-led businesses in general have a community networking mindset approach to their operations, which does mean in times of crisis, like the Covid pandemic and supply chain issues, women are filling in the gaps,"" Joseph said. She adds that women of color, in particular - continuing a long history of creating community-based mutual aid networks - have supported access to land and healthy food for all.

Evan Wiig, director of membership and communications at the Community Alliance with Family Farmers (Caff) in California, said that he, too, has witnessed women farmers in California leading the charge through some of the state's worst crises, whether it's recovering from a fire or sharing tips about smart water practices and irrigation efficiency.

""Men say, ""˜I don't need help, I know everything I need to know,'"" Wiig said. ""But women have the grace to say that ""˜I can learn a lot.' Maybe this is a stereotype, but maybe it's true."" Women make up two-thirds of Caff, whose mission is to build sustainable food and farming systems through policy advocacy and on-the-ground programs that create more resilient family farms.

Joseph agrees that women farmers often lean on their community in tough times and, in return, it is women who support others who need it. ""That's my observation. I think these things are interconnected,"" she said.

During the pandemic, for example, Joseph said women farmers filled ""the gaps in local communities for food access"". Radical Family Farm stepped in to feed food-insecure seniors throughout the Bay Area when it was not safe for them to go to the grocery store or farmers' market.

""A lot of this was driven by the attacks on our Asian elders during the pandemic,"" Wiser said. ""It's still happening, with seniors afraid to walk on the streets without being pushed down, murdered or beaten."" Her long-term goal is to dedicate one-third of the produce from her farm to seniors in the Bay Area.

""It is part of my cultural heritage to honor our elders,"" she said, adding that her grandparents on both sides took care of her growing up, so delivering ""culturally relevant produce"" to seniors is meaningful. ""Instead of getting bags of potatoes, they can get vegetables, produce and herbs that are familiar to them.""

Farmers in California grow an array of what Joseph calls ""specialty crops"". California farms produce more of these crops - such as almonds, artichokes and broccoli - than any other state in the country. More than a quarter of the food produced in the US, including most of the country's fruits and vegetables, comes from California, according to the Food & Environment Reporting Network, which credits the state's long hot summers and mild winters for its ability to produce so much.

And as climate-related disasters threaten that production, it's increasingly California's women farmers who are rallying to face the fallout in creative ways, such as keeping money circulating locally to support job growth and ensuring that local communities have fresh food to eat. Joseph explains that because so many women-owned farms in California sell directly to consumers to feed local communities, this reciprocation is beneficial to everyone.

During the 2018 Paradise fire in northern California's Butte county, Azolla Farm donated produce to World Central Kitchen, a non-profit that works to feed those displaced by natural disasters. ""The Paradise fire was pretty intense over here,"" said Rosie Kaperonis, co-owner of Azolla Farm, which she runs with her partner Scrivner Hoppe-Glosser in Pleasant Grove.

It just goes to show that the formal participation of women in agriculture is at ""a historic high"".

Wiser is among those women. This spring, she is back outside at Radical Family Farm to check on her plants, prep the fields and transplant the remaining crops with her crew. On Instagram, she posts a sweet photo of a bitter melon plant and says: ""They are looking good!""

The Golden State is expected to overtake Germany as the world's fourth-largest economy this year, but not all of this wealth is being shared equally.

60,"Intensive farming is biggest cause of bird decline in Europe, study says","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/15/intensive-farming-is-biggest-cause-of-bird-decline-in-europe-study-says","Intensive farming is biggest cause of bird decline in Europe, study says

Use of pesticides and fertilisers identified as most significant factor behind loss of 550 million birds from skies

The use of pesticides and fertilisers in intensive agriculture is the biggest cause of the dwindling number of birds in the UK and the rest of Europe, scientists have said.

Compared with a generation ago, 550 million fewer birds fly over the continent, with their decline well documented. But until now the relative importance of various pressures on bird populations was not known.

A team of more than 50 researchers, analysing data collected by thousands of citizen scientists in 28 countries over nearly four decades, found that it is intensive agriculture, above all, that is behind the decline in the continent's bird populations.

They found the number of wild birds of all kinds across the continent has fallen by more than a quarter since 1980, but that this decline deepened to more than half among farmland species.

Birds that rely on invertebrates for food, including swifts, yellow wagtails and spotted flycatchers, were the hardest hit. ""It's more than a smoking gun,"" said Richard Gregory, a senior conservation scientist at the RSPB, and one of the lead authors of the study.

""I don't think a study has looked at all these factors in one go, in such a sophisticated fashion, correcting for one variable alongside another; and it comes out with a very clear message.""

The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, examined how 170 bird species had responded to four widespread manmade pressures, including agricultural intensification, forest cover change, urbanisation and the climate crisis.

Farmland species suffered the most precipitous decline, with numbers falling by 56.8% since research began, the study said. Numbers of urban dwelling birds were down 27.8%, and among woodland dwelling birds the fall was 17.7%.

But in all contexts, intensive agriculture, which has been on the rise across Europe, was identified as a major factor in decline, with the mass slaughter of invertebrates as pests creating a ""trophic cascade"" up the food chain.

""The losses are quite huge,"" Gregory said. ""And a lot of them go back to that kind of an insect diet or linkage with insects, which is suggestive of a link to the way we're farming land.""

Urbanisation, also on the increase across Europe, was identified as the next most important factor putting pressure on bird populations. Many cities are steadily losing to development what little plots of green space they had, while modern architecture also played a role, Gregory said.

""We know many of the urban birds - the swifts, the house martins, the house sparrows, the starlings - that live in those environments, that their numbers are declining very strongly, driven we think by the problems in relation to the food supplies, but also house construction and how that's changing, how the modernisation is removing their natural kind of nest sites in those areas,"" Gregory said.

Northern, cold-preferring species of birds were also found to be under heavy pressure, with numbers down 39.7% as temperatures rise across Europe as a result of the climate crisis. Changing temperatures had winners as well as losers, the study noted, with numbers among southern warm-preferring species down only 17.1%.

The researchers wrote: ""Overall, while temperature change can lead to an increase in the distribution and abundance of some species, for those (especially cold dwellers) already affected by other anthropogenic pressures, temperature change constitutes a double burden acting directly on their annual cycle.""

Only ""the rapid implementation of transformative change in European societies, and especially in agricultural reform"" could save the continent's bird populations, the researchers said.

They added: ""This paper contributes to the highest political and technical challenge faced by agricultural policy in Europe, struggling to balance high productivity from intensive agricultural practices with environmental protection, and the results are therefore crucial to policymakers, scientists, and the general public concerned with biodiversity and global change issues.""

Their call was echoed by Alice Groom, the RSPB's head of sustainable land use policy in England. She said: ""Increasing our reliance on pesticides and fertiliser has allowed us to farm more intensively and increase output, but, as this study clearly shows, at a huge cost to our wildlife and the health of the environment.

""The UK and devolved governments should ensure agri-environment schemes reward nature-friendly farming practices such as flower-rich margins and herbal leys that are proven to enable farmers to produce good food whilst supporting progressive reductions in the use of pesticides and fertilisers.""

64,"Cabbage-growing experiment shows human waste can be good to use as fertiliser","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/cabbage-experiment-human-waste-faeces-fertiliser-aoe","Cabbage-growing experiment shows human waste can be good to use as fertiliser

Scientists say yields from crops fertilised with recycled human waste rival those produced by organic methods

Using fertilisers derived from human faeces and urine can be as productive as conventional organic ones, with no risk of transmitting disease, according to new research.

It may seem unappetising, but humans have been using human waste as a fertiliser for thousands of years because it contains the key nutrients that plants need to grow, including nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Ploughing human excrement - conventionally flushed down our toilets and into the sewage system - back into the soil creates a more sustainable farming system without significant drops in yield, the researchers found.

The team studied a crop of white cabbages grown 12 miles (20km) south of Berlin between June and October 2019. They tested three waste-based products: two fertilisers derived from human urine and one from human faeces called ""faecal compost"". The effects were compared with those of using a commercial organic fertiliser, vinasse, which is made from sugar-beet and is a byproduct of bioethanol production.

The lead co-author Franziska HÃ¤fner, a PhD student at University of Hohenheim in Germany, said: ""The fertilisers from nitrified human urine gave similar yields as a conventional fertiliser product, and did not show any risk regarding transmission of pathogens or pharmaceuticals.""

Urine fertiliser produced comparable, or even slightly higher, yields to those of the commercial fertiliser. According to the paper, published in Frontiers in Environmental Science, the yield for faecal compost was on average 20-30% lower. However, the faecal compost bolstered soil carbon, meaning fertility could be maintained long term. As a result, the most sustainable option is mixing urine fertiliser and faecal compost together, the researchers sugggested, producing yields on average 5-10% lower than commercial fertilisers.

Researchers tested the human waste fertilisers against organic fertilisers instead of conventional synthetic fertilisers because they say there are many reasons why we need to shift away from synthetic ones, given the damage they do to the environment, so they did not want to revert to them as standard in the experiment. Yield from organic fertiliser is estimated to be about 20% lower.

Synthetic fertilisers are credited with increasing food production and reducing hunger, but they come with huge environmental costs, including air and water pollution, as well as driving declines in wildlife. Fertilisers have high greenhouse gas emissions, with synthetic nitrogen fertilisers responsible for about 2% of global energy use.

Meanwhile, the cost of fertiliser has increased exponentially. Prices in 2022 were three times higher than at the start of 2021, which is likely to cause food costs to rise this year, putting an additional 100 million people at risk of undernourishment, research suggests.

To test how safe the fertilisers were, researchers screened the waste for 310 chemicals such as insect repellants, rubber additives and flame retardants, which people sometimes empty into their toilet. They also looked at pharmaceutical products such as painkillers and hormones, which end up mainly in urine. More than 93% of these chemicals were not detected, and the remainder were present at very low concentrations.

The most significantly present were the painkiller ibuprofen and carbamazepine - used to treat epilepsy and as a mood-stabiliser - which were found in the edible parts of the cabbages (ie, the head) but in extremely low quantities. This would be because the vegetable had taken them in through its roots.

The researchers found that you would need to eat half a million heads of cabbage to take the equivalent of one carbamazepine pill. ""In general, the risk for human health of pharmaceutical compounds entering the food system by means of faecal compost use seems low,"" they wrote.

Dr Rupert Hough, an environmental and soil scientist from the James Hutton Institute in Aberdeen, who was not involved in the research, said sewage sludge has been used for decades as a fertiliser in agricultural production but that there had always been challenges in ensuring it was not contaminated. He said: ""Quality has significantly improved over time due to new modern treatment methods and now, in most situations, it can be used without harm. This study shows that source separation of human waste prior to any conventional wastewater treatment, ie, the use of composting toilets, has the potential to improve quality further.""

Effectively recycling human waste requires changes to toilets so that urine and faeces can be separated and the nutrients they contain harvested. For the experiment, researchers used waste collected in dry toilets, although some new water-based toilets can also keep faeces and urine separate.

The study's other co-author, Dr Ariane Krause, a researcher at the Leibniz Institute of Vegetable and Ornamental Crops in Grossbeeren in Germany, said: ""I think water toilets as we know them will only be on our planet for a short period of time - they are nice and comfortable but they don't work in the long term, because they are not sustainable.

""Our findings in the field experiment corroborate what researchers have found in a couple of dozen experiments from Asia, Africa, North America and South America. Our next step will be to merge the datasets and to conduct a meta-analysis,"" she said.

Stacked Farm can produce perfect-looking strawberries, tomatoes and baby cos all year round. But will high energy inputs be its achilles heel?

Not far from the fertile farmlands known as Australia's salad bowl, rows of fruit and vegetables are being cultivated without sunlight or soil.

Perfect-looking strawberries, tomatoes, baby cos lettuces and coriander grow under moody purple fluorescent lighting. Here in the research wing of a 4000 sq metre facility at Arundel on the Gold Coast, the intensity and timing of light, the humidity of the air, and the nutrients in the water supply are all intricately controlled.

Founded in 2017, indoor vertical farming company Stacked Farm bills itself as being able to produce fresh fruit and vegetables year-round, using less water than traditional farming and without the need for pesticides.

In months, its leafy vegetables will hit the shelves of major supermarkets around the country.

Stacked Farm, the biggest player in Australia's vertical farming industry, says the technique can produce more crops more quickly and in less space than traditional agriculture requires.

Vertical farming refers to indoor farming in controlled environments, usually in the absence of soil and natural light, and involves well-established horticultural techniques. Stacked Farm, for instance, uses a form of hydroponics, growing its plants in rockwool, a material similar to an insulation batt, while a channel of water flows underneath.

As weather events around Australia become more extreme and threaten food supply chains, the reliability of indoor farming may become an increasingly alluring choice.

But the approach has been criticised for the high energy inputs it requires, with industry players even saying they are not trying to do away with outdoor farming altogether.

Vertical farming: towers of produce

American academic Dickson Despommier first floated the idea of vertical farming more than two decades ago, envisaging city skyscrapers filled with produce to feed tens of thousands of urbanites.

Efforts to put vertical farming into practice began around 2010 in the US where there have been major produce supply challenges, says Paul Gauthier, a professor of protected cropping at the University of Queensland (UQ).

A decade on, commercial vertical farming is now booming in the US and Europe, but locally the industry is lagging behind, in part because Australia has historically been food secure.

""Australia has plenty of space, a low population density, a fairly stable climate and significant expanses of agricultural land. It simply does not have the same pressures on agriculture as do other countries,"" says Floris Van Ogtrop, an associate professor at the University of Sydney. ""This has meant that investment in vertical farming ""¦ in Australia is not comparable to other countries.""

Paul Millett, co-founder of InvertiGro, an Australian firm that specialises in stackable vertical farming modules, agrees. ""We're kind of hamstrung in a way because we've been blessed with our abundance of fresh produce,"" he says. ""However, particularly in the last couple of years with Covid and floods and fires, we've had lots of supply chain challenges, and people have seen shelves empty of lettuces.""

With the extreme weather set to continue, Australian firms are starting to go commercial.

From July, Stacked Farm will begin commercial-scale farming using a fully automated process from seeding to bagging, says Michael Spencer, the firm's chief commercial officer. Half of the floor space at Arundel will soon be filled with 10-metre high growing modules, each housing 15 levels of produce.

Spencer estimates the facility will be able to produce between 400 and 440 tonnes of produce a year, depending on the crop. Two larger farms, in Melbourne and Sydney, are planned for in the coming years.

Stacked Farm has already signed supply deals with wholesalers such as MorCoFresh, which supplies chains such as Grill'd and Guzman y Gomez, and PMFresh, whose salad bags can be found on the shelves in major supermarkets.

InvertiGro - which produces stackable vertical farming modules ""almost like Lego"" - has also established contracts with food distributors and retailers such as Woolworths, Millett says.

It has grown more than 200 crops to date, including leafy greens, berries, soft fruits and vegetables, and the firm is also experimenting with growing medicinal cannabis, flowering crops and fodder for livestock feed.

One advantage of indoor farming is that the conditions can be optimised to shorten the time to harvest. ""For leafy greens, we're getting a crop ""¦ at least every four weeks or thereabouts,"" Millett says. Spencer cites a similar length at Stacked Farm, with a growth cycle taking between 14 and 30 days for leafy greens.

""For traditional farming, depending on the region and if the climate is [good], you get anywhere from five to six harvests a year,"" he says. ""In indoor farming, we're now getting roughly 17 harvests ""¦ out of that same period.""

There is also the benefit of a reduced need for water, which is traditionally lost to evaporation or runoff. Spencer says Stacked Farm uses 95% less water than farming in a field. ""Every time water moves through the system, it's captured and re-used. The only water that leaves the facility is in the plant itself.""

UQ's Gauthier is researching vertical farming for crops that may become more difficult to grow outdoors in future. ""The areas of land on Earth where we can grow coffee and cacao are shrinking because of climate change,"" he says. Currently in a field, the time from seed to harvest for cacao is about three years, whereas, ""In vertical farming, it will take 12 months"".

The energy issue

But vertical farming has an achilles heel: energy consumption.

""Depending on which study you read, if a mix of energy from the grid would be used, the CO2 equivalents and nitrogen equivalents of producing lettuce in a vertical farm can be up to double that of conventional agriculture,"" Van Ogtrop says.

However, he adds, the figures can sway in favour of vertical farms if they are run on renewable energy.

Solar power could help bring down energy costs, Spencer, says, but is not a panacea. ""Large scale farms will have solar on each roof. To give you an idea, it might support 10 to 15% of our needs.""

Millett concedes that energy cost is a key consideration. ""It's about minimising the amount of energy that goes into a lettuce or bunch of basil. It's optimising the lights ""¦ only with the intensity and colour spectrum that they need.""

Other drawbacks of vertical farming include the use of synthetic fertilisers, which either come from energy intensive processes or are mined, Van Ogtrop says. Though there is interest in recycling nutrients from sources like food waste, such processes are still in their early days.

Van Ogtrop adds that the growth materials used, such as coconut coir, rockwool, peat moss and perlite, ""are often not sourced sustainably or ethically and may have downstream environmental or health impacts"".

And there is also the risk of pests ruining a crop, Millett says, adding that one benefit of the InvertiCube's modular set-up - each has walls and glass doors - means it has greater resistance to pests than other forms of vertical farming.

Ultimately, Stacked Farm wants to fill supply chain shortages rather than do away with outdoor fields. ""We're not here to displace traditional farming,"" Spencer says.

Van Ogtrop agrees with Spencer, believing that, ""Vertical farming is not going to replace broad-acre farming for growing our grains and legumes.""

""Much of our fruit and veg will still be grown under the sun and in soil, which is why it is super important that we invest in sustainable agriculture and do all we can to mitigate climate change.""

Growers fear a perfect storm for a tradition that has long bound rural communities together

A sharp wind shunts clouds across the low and endless skies of La Mancha as Carlos FernÃ¡ndez stoops to pluck the last mauve flowers of the season from the cold earth. Their petals, which stain his index finger and thumb blue, enclose an almost weightless prize whose crimson threads are treasured in Spain and across the world.

But despite the prices his crop fetches, and the weighty comparisons those prices inevitably invite, the life of a saffron grower is not without its trials, travails and frustrations.

As well as the back-breaking picking and the painstaking sorting, there is the foreign competition, the unpredictable yields, the increasingly evident effects of the climate emergency and, on this particular day, the infuriating discovery that a gang of thieves with head-torches descended on his fields overnight and made off with some of the flowers. And then there are the dreaded words - ""oro rojo"".

""Calling it ""˜red gold' damages our saffron because it makes it sound like something that's expensive,"" says FernÃ¡ndez, the president of the regulatory council of La Mancha's Protected Designation of Origin saffron label.

""Everyone likes to compare it with gold and so when a housewife goes shopping and sees that a gram of saffron costs â‚¬9 [£7.75], she'll think it's an expensive product. But if you use it right - and in the right quantities - you'll get 60 helpings from that saffron."" Divide nine by 60, he says, and the price of that little jar doesn't seem quite so outrageous.

Sales, yields and marketing language are, necessarily, never far from FernÃ¡ndez's thoughts. This corner of Spain produces some of the finest saffron in the world, and has done since the Arabs arrived with their crocuses almost 1,000 years ago, but the sector is a husk of what it once was.

A century ago, Spain was the largest saffron producer in the world, plucking, toasting and selling 140 tonnes grown on 13,000 hectares of land a year. By the 1970s, annual production had fallen to 70 tonnes.

Today, only 140 or so hectares - the overwhelming majority of them in Castilla-La Mancha - are estimated to be given over to saffron crocuses. Total production for 2022 was around 450kg. Iran, meanwhile, produces between 200 and 250 tonnes of saffron a year and Greece around 2.5 tonnes.

The biggest problem, according to FernÃ¡ndez, is that saffron growing has always been something of a sideline for Spanish farmers. Unlike the vine, olive, pistachio and almond sectors, which have boomed over recent decades, the saffron industry has never been properly scaled up, professionalised or mechanised. It remains rooted in the past.

""The big landowners would give their workers a bit of land where they could grow saffron to be used as a kind of currency,"" he says.

""Once it was harvested, the saffron was stored away and brought out and sold when a family had a big expense to meet, such as a daughter's wedding or building work on their house. That structure survives to this day, nothing whatsoever has changed.""

While that small-scale, low-tech approach may have kept saffron production going over the past few decades, it has also left it on the edge of extinction.

""We're being held back by the idiosyncrasies of the sector itself,"" says FernÃ¡ndez. ""What we're trying to do now is bring about a change and a transition so we're not left behind in this folk tradition, which is where I think we are now. As producers, we can't grow enough saffron to meet our customers' demand all year round and that means it's not a stable business.""

Production is unpredictable because the bulb-like corms from which the crocuses grow are susceptible to fungus and very sensitive to temperature changes. Over recent years, the 200 producers whose saffron has protected origin status have seen what the climate emergency is doing to their crops.

Higher temperatures and less rainfall mean that flowering happens later and later each year as the plants wait for things to cool down. Yields are also fluctuating. The average yield in 2015 was around 650kg, rising to a peak in 2018 of 915kg. Since then there has been a gradual decline - 750kg in 2019, 625kg in 2020 and 345kg in 2021.

""Although it's a crop that's hard to predict as you get a different flowering each night, the figures we have suggest yields are going down,"" says FernÃ¡ndez. ""Last year, we were getting 3.5kg a hectare when the normal yield is 7kg to 9kg.""

Even though growers in La Mancha can sell saffron to their buyers for â‚¬5,000 a kilo, profits are eroded by the fact that sowing corms costs â‚¬25,000 a hectare, with no guaranteed yield because of the threats posed by fungus and higher temperatures.

Plummeting production in Spain has also sent buyers to overseas competitors that have the capacity to meet demand.

All of which is why FernÃ¡ndez and his fellow growers are asking the regional government of Castilla-La Mancha to fund an â‚¬18.5m strategic plan to save and develop the saffron sector.

Proper funding and research, they argue, could drive a five-fold increase in production and land use over the next five years. Healthy, pathogen-free corms could be bought from Holland, they say, or corms could even be developed in vitro, like garlic.

Add to that mechanisation that would allow robots to extract the threads from the flowers, and FernÃ¡ndez sees no reason why there couldn't be 5,000 hectares of crocuses producing 25 tonnes of saffron in 10 years' time.

The regional government of Castilla La-Mancha says it is committed to helping growers find solutions to the difficulties they face and to showcasing the protected crop. It says funds are available to attract more young people into the sector and to help farmers mechanise and modernise their harvests.

For now, however, the harvesting and processing of saffron in the area follows its ancient rhythms. Once the morning's crop has been gathered and brought in wicker baskets to a small warehouse, half a dozen women - including FernÃ¡ndez's mother, Caridad Segovia - put on overalls and hairnets and sit around a long table for the monda, or separating off the stigmas and style from the petals. They chat as they work, practised fingers moving independently of eyes. By the end of the monda, their fingers will be stained yellow.

For Segovia and her friends, saffron is a ""social and family spice"" whose picking and sorting binds the community together.

""If there was no saffron, we wouldn't be here together like this,"" she says. ""Everyone can talk about their problems or their happinesses here. It helps us help each other. It's a kind of therapy where people can talk and ask for help if they need it.""

Despite the hairnets, the overalls and the sterile interior of the warehouse, the scene is oddly timeless. As he looks on, Carlos FernÃ¡ndez wonders how long it will endure.

""If the temperatures keep rising as they are, if we don't solve the health problems that corms have, which really reduce production, and if we don't professionalise the sector, it's very, very clear that it's only a matter of time,"" he says.

""A very high number of producers are now over 70 and when they stop, their children aren't going to take over and screw up their backs when they could be doing office work. It's not viable.""

Pumpkin growers in west and south-west fail to achieve predicted yields as climate crisis worsens drought and heat extremes

Alan Mazzotti can see the Rocky Mountains about 30 miles west of his pumpkin patch in north-east Colorado on a clear day. He could tell the snow was abundant last winter, and verified it up close when he floated through fresh powder alongside his wife and three sons at the popular Winter Park resort.

But one season of above-average snowfall wasn't enough to refill the dwindling reservoir he relies on to irrigate his pumpkins. He received news this spring that his water delivery would be about half of what it was from the previous season, so he planted just half of his typical pumpkin crop. Then heavy rains in May and June brought plenty of water and turned fields into a muddy mess, preventing any additional planting many farmers might have wanted to do.

""By time it started raining and the rain started to affect our reservoir supplies and everything else, it was just too late for this year,"" Mazzotti said.

For some pumpkin growers in states such as Texas, New Mexico and Colorado, this year's pumpkin crop was a reminder of the water challenges hitting agriculture across the south-west and west as human-caused climate change exacerbates drought and heat extremes. Some farmers lost 20% or more of their predicted yields; others, like Mazzotti, left some land bare. Labor costs and inflation are also narrowing margins, hitting farmers' ability to profit off what they sell to garden centers and pumpkin patches.

This year's thirsty gourds are a symbol of the reality that farmers who rely on irrigation must continue to face season after season: they have to make choices, based on water allotments and the cost of electricity to pump it out of the ground, about which acres to plant and which crops they can gamble on to make it through hotter and drier summers.

Pumpkins can survive hot, dry weather to an extent, but this summer's heat, which broke world records and brought temperatures well over 100F (38C) to agricultural fields across the country, was just too much, said Mark Carroll, a Texas A&M extension agent for Floyd county, which he calls the ""pumpkin capital"" of the state.

""It's one of the worst years we've had in several years,"" Carroll said. Not only did the hot, dry weather surpass what irrigation could make up for, but pumpkins also need cooler weather to be harvested or they'll start to decompose during the shipping process, sometimes disintegrating before they even arrive at stores.

America's pumpkin powerhouse, Illinois, had a successful harvest on par with the last two years, according to the Illinois Farm Bureau. But this year it was so hot into the harvest season in Texas that farmers had to decide whether to risk cutting pumpkins off the vines at the usual time or wait and miss the start of the fall pumpkin rush. Adding to the problem, irrigation costs more as groundwater levels continue to drop - driving some farmers' energy bills to pump water into the thousands of dollars every month.

Mazzotti says that with not enough water, you ""might as well not farm"" - but even so, he sees labor as the bigger issue. Farmers in Colorado have been dealing with water cutbacks for a long time, and they're used to it. However, pumpkins can't be harvested by machine like corn can, so they require lots of people to determine they're ripe, cut them off the vines and prepare them for shipping.

He hires guest workers through the H-2A program; Colorado recently instituted a law ensuring farmworkers to be paid overtime - something most states don't require. That makes it tough to maintain competitive prices with places where laborers are paid less, and the increasing costs of irrigation and supplies stack onto that, creating what Mazzotti calls a ""no-win situation"".

Insect declines mean reduced yields of healthy foods like fruit and vegetables and increased disease in people

The global loss of pollinators is already causing about 500,000 early deaths a year by reducing the supply of healthy foods, a study has estimated.

Three-quarters of crops require pollination but the populations of many insects are in sharp decline. The inadequate pollination that results has caused a 3%-5% loss of fruit, vegetable and nut production, the research found. The lower consumption of these foods means about 1% of all deaths can now be attributed to pollinator loss, the scientists said.

The researchers considered deaths from heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and some cancers, all of which can be reduced with healthier diets. The study is the first to quantify the human health toll of insufficient wild pollinators.

The study was based on data from hundreds of farms across the world, information on yields and diet-related health risks and a computer model that tracks the global trade in food.

""A critical missing piece in the biodiversity discussion has been a lack of direct linkages to human health,"" said Dr Samuel Myers, at Harvard University's TH Chan School of Public Health and senior author of the study. ""This research establishes that loss of pollinators is already impacting health on a scale with other global health risk factors, such as prostate cancer or substance use disorders.""

""But there is a solution out there in pollinator-friendly practices,"" Myers said. These include increasing flower abundance on farms, cutting pesticide use, especially neonicotinoids, and preserving or restoring nearby natural habitats. ""When these have been studied, they pay for themselves economically through increased production."" Nonetheless, the researchers said ""immense challenges remain"" in restoring pollinator populations globally.

The study, published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, assessed dozens of pollinator-dependent crops using data from the global farm study. It found that insufficient pollination was responsible for about a quarter of the difference between high and low yields.

The farm data was used to determine the drop in yield due to too few pollinators. ""We estimated that the world is currently losing 4.7% of total production of fruit, 3.2% of vegetables, and 4.7% nuts,"" the researchers said.

They then used an economic model to track how these losses would affect the diets of people across the globe. Finally, they used well-known data on how reductions of fruit, vegetables, legumes and nuts affect health to estimate the number of early deaths.

The researchers found the biggest impact was in middle-income countries, like China, India, Russia and Indonesia, where heart disease, strokes and cancers were already prevalent due to poor diets, smoking, and low levels of exercise. In rich nations, more people could still afford to eat healthily even if the price of the foods went up due to lower production, although the poorer people in those countries would still suffer.

Previous work by the team showed that most of the effects on health in a country were due to loss of pollinators in that country, rather than in other countries from which food was imported. The biggest drops in yield caused by insufficient wild pollinators were in low income countries. Food production there would benefit most from better wild pollination, but people's health suffered less due to lower existing rates of heart disease and stroke.

The estimated number of deaths is conservative, the scientists said, as the study did not include the impact of the reduction of micronutrients such as vitamin A and folate in diets, or the health impact of lost income for farmers.

Prof David Goulson, at the University of Sussex, in the UK, who was not part of the study team, said: ""Globally, we consume too much of the wind pollinated crops - wheat, rice, corn, barley - which are rich in carbs but relatively low in nutrients, leading to an epidemic of obesity and diabetes around the world. We do not eat enough fruit and veg, most of which requires insects for pollination - think apples, cherries, strawberries, squash, beans, tomatoes etc.""

Goulson said that declines in other insects, such as predators of crop pests, would also cut yields. Furthermore, poor health, lost work and disability due to poorer diets would also have large impacts on health services and economies, adding: ""The overall impacts of declining biodiversity on crop production are likely to be far larger than measured in this study.

""The most concerning aspect of this study is that, since insect populations are continuing to decline, this lost crop yield is going to get worse into the future, while the human population is going to continue growing to at least 10 billion,"" Goulson said. ""The problems described here are likely to get much worse as the 21st century progresses.""

Myers said: ""We're transforming every one of the natural systems on the planet and we keep experiencing these surprises. For example, our earlier work showed how rising carbon dioxide levels are making our food less nutritious. So this pollinator study is important, not only for its own sake, but as an indication that there's risk in completely transforming our natural life support systems.""

Stalky plant is not approved as a livestock feed, holding back a sustainable industry that could invigorate agriculture

Ken Elliott runs a hemp oilseed and fiber processing facility in Fort Benton, Montana. His company, IND Hemp, grinds up the stalky plant so that it can be used for a variety of purposes, such as snacks, grain, insulation and paper. About 20 truckloads of spent biomass lie in heaps on his property.

Elliott estimates he could make a couple million dollars if he sold this leftover stuff as livestock feed. Hemp seedcake would make a great substitute for alfalfa - rich in fatty acids, proteins and fiber. His cattle rancher buddies are hit hard by the soaring costs of hay and would love to get their hands on this alternative. One buffalo herder wanted to buy the whole lot.

But Elliot can't sell to them. He can't even give it away for free. That's because when the 2018 Farm Bill took hemp off the list of controlled substances, hemp as commercial livestock feed was not approved.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved hempseed and its meal and oil for human consumption. A variety of hemp snacks for pets are allowed on the market, because they don't constitute the main part of the diet. But you can't give hemp as feed to farm animals that produce eggs, meat and milk for sale, until tests prove it is safe and nutritious to pass along the food chain.

In other words, Elliott can serve hemp products to his baby grandchild. Or to a cat. But not to 2,000lbs steer. And that's bad for the American farmer, he says. ""Some of these guys have to sell their cattle and five-generation farms because they can't afford hay and barley,"" Elliott says. ""Why wouldn't you want to help them?""

Hemp industry advocates say this ban on livestock feed not only denies livestock farmers necessary relief, but is also denying the $80bn American feed sector an inexpensive product during a time of global grain shortages. And it is hindering a nascent green industry that could invigorate American agriculture while also saving the environment.

The type of hemp in question is not the flowery plant that yields CBD. The bamboo-like ""industrial"" variety processed by Elliott has greater potential to be a commodity. Its woody core, grain (seeds) and fiber have 25,000 uses. They include dietary ingredients, textiles, biofuel, bioplastics, mulch, lubricants, paints and construction materials.

Industrial hemp is also a dream sustainable crop. It requires less water than similar plants and sequesters carbon. It can grow in nearly every climate, with up to two harvests a year. Hemp also regenerates the soil, absorbs toxic metals and it resists pests, mold and fire.

But this sector is stymied by the federal government's linkage of hemp to its cousin, marijuana. Both come from the cannabis sativa plant, but industrial hemp has none or negligible quantities of tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, the main psychoactive compound in marijuana.

Nonetheless, hemp is highly regulated. Growers must be fingerprinted and background-checked. They must spend thousands of dollars for tests that prove their harvests contain less than 0.3% THC. Anything above that fraction must be destroyed.

Further burdens are placed on those seeking approvals for commercial hemp livestock feed. (So far none have been granted on the federal level.) Manufacturers complain that with only a dozen FDA officials processing requests, applicants can wait up to six months for a response or for questions, which when answered require further waits. The process can take years.

""The FDA responds to requests with very resistant language that creates a long back and forth,"" says Andrew Bish, a harvesting equipment entrepreneur from Nebraska who helms the Hemp Feed Coalition advocacy group. He added that funding the clinical trials to prove safety can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Moreover, separate testing must be done for each species that would eat the feed. Data involving dairy cows, for instance, won't suffice for beef cattle. Different research is required for chicken broilers and egg layers, and trout versus salmon.

The FDA approval group is ""woefully understaffed with a backlog of work"", Leah Wilkinson told a webinar in August that brought together regulators, hemp companies and university researchers. She is the vice-president of public policy at the American Feed Industry Association.

""Many of these ingredients are stuck in an antiquated regulatory review process at the FDA, which has resulted in the US trailing its global competitors in bringing these products to the market.""

Regulators on both the state and federal levels defend the process, however. They say animals metabolize food differently from humans, so a person snacking on hemp seeds might process the ingredient differently than a goat subsisting on it every day.

""I understand the processors' standpoint,"" says Ian Foley, a plant regulatory official with Montana's department of agriculture. ""It's a difficult burden to sponsor and pay for research. But the product must be beneficial as well as not cause harm. Everyone wants the safest ingredients, and I don't think we're there just yet.""

While the US government treats hemp as a new product, it was historically a staple crop in America from the 1600s onwards, thriving especially in Kentucky. George Washington grew it. A draft of the Declaration of Independence was on hemp paper. But the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act debilitated the once-thriving industry, and then the 1970 Controlled Substances Act essentially killed it.

With decriminalization five years ago, the industry had to jumpstart from scratch.

This has cost the US market share in a global market estimated at more $4bn and expected to grow to over $17bn by 2030. Canada, China and Europe (particularly France) are big players. The US produced merely $824m worth of hemp in 2021, the last available figures.

Stakeholders say that the animal feed issue is particularly stymying the industry.

The only way around stringent federal restrictions is to win consent on the regional level, but the products cannot be transported or sold across state lines. Kentucky has approved feeding hemp-seed meal and oil to chickens and horses. In Montana, it can be given to non-production animals. Tennessee requires informing consumers in writing if hemp adulterants are added to feed.

The Wenger Group of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, managed to get state approval to sell feed for chickens. Wenger, which produces about 2m tons of feed a year, first had to invest $400,000 to do a hemp feed study on the nearby Kreider Farms involving 800 hens and 120,000 eggs.

The data found that hemp feed produced healthy yolks and weight, with no THC residue. ""It was absolutely compelling and convincing that the ingredient was safe,"" says Raj Kasula, the chief nutrition officer for Wenger.

But getting the green light to sell was ""unduly"" time-consuming. ""The process was delayed by objections and questions which were not worth the delay,"" Kasula says. ""Each time they come with a new set of questions. To their credit they are being very thorough but it's a source of frustration.""

Still, experts see hopeful baby steps and believe the first federal approval for egg-laying hens might come within a year.

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has granted millions of dollars for clinical studies into hemp as animal feed through its National Institute of Food and Agriculture office.

Panelists participating in the August webinar included scientists from universities across the country, including Texas, North Dakota, Ohio and Kentucky. They saw great potential for livestock, horses and fish.

""I was blown away,"" said Massimo Bionaz, an associate professor of dairy nutrigenomics at Oregon State University. ""It has good fiber content, the protein is at the level of alfalfa, even better. We found it's safe to feed this to animals.""

Even if it won approvals for feed, the hemp industry must convince farms farmers to grow industrial hemp, says Bish. After the 2018 legalization, most hemp growers planted the CBD type. Many went bust due to an ensuing glut and are reluctant to pivot to industrial hemp even though it has more potential as a cash crop.

One reason is the paucity of processing facilities. What with soaring freight costs, the handful of facilities that are scattered across the country lie too far away for most farmers to transport the bulky product. Prospective processors baulk at investing in multimillion-dollar machinery without enough raw supply of hemp.

""It's a chicken and egg story, so there's no economy of scale,"" says Bish.

Hemp stakeholders are pinning hopes on Congress, which is due to renew the Farm Bill this year. They are lobbying for exemptions to make it easier to produce hemp fiber and grain, such as lifting the 0.3% THC limit. They also seek more Congressional funding to boost the number of FDA staff processing feed applications.

Meanwhile, progress remains glacial. ""I would like to see more collaboration between the FDA and the industry to come up with clear guidelines to make the application process more efficient,"" says Kasula. ""Other countries are moving forward, and we need to reinvent the wheel.""

A Masters of Beef Advocacy program teaches ""˜scientific sounding' arguments on cattle's sustainability in an all-out public relations war

The US beef industry is creating an army of influencers and citizen activists to help amplify a message that will be key to its future success: that you shouldn't be too worried about the growing attention around the environmental impacts of its production.

In particular, it would like you not to be especially concerned about how meat consumption needs to be reduced if we are to avoid the most violently disruptive forms of planetary heating (even if all fossil fuel use ended tomorrow).

It definitely does not want you to read scientific papers showing wealthy nations must reduce meat consumption to keep below the average global temperature rise of 2C, a threshold to stop systems collapse, mass extinctions, fatal heat waves, drought and famine, water shortages and flooded cities.

I know about these industry priorities as I am one of more than 21,000 graduates of a free, by-admission-only, online training course created by the US beef industry called the Masters of Beef Advocacy (MBA) program.

The course is the creation of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA), the beef industry's main lobby group, and on completing it I can tell you that you don't actually get a master's degree, despite its name.

What you get is multiple misleading - but scientific sounding - narratives about beef industry sustainability and repeated appeals for students to engage proactively with consumers online and offline about environmental topics. Via a private Facebook group for graduates, the NCBA also distributes infographics and industry talking points to deploy in online conversations.

MBA-trained ""advocates and spokespeople help educate consumers and influencers about the role of beef in a healthy diet and how beef farmers and ranchers raise beef responsibly and sustainably"", according to one document the Guardian has seen from the Cattlemen's Beef Board, which earmarked $572,700 for the initiative for 2023.

The Cattlemen's Beef Board is the organization that oversees the federally enshrined beef checkoff program, which funds industry marketing and promotion through a fee ranchers pay on every head of cattle.

""These advocates also help to respond when there is misinformation in the public about beef production and other beef-related issues,"" the document says about graduates of the MBA courses.

My interest in doing the course was to better understand cattle industry messaging at a time when beef's outsized role in climate crisis is under scrutiny. My experience as an MBA student, in addition to other details I uncovered as I reported this story, led me to conclude that the beef industry is engaged in an all-out public relations war to pre-empt environmental criticisms of its products - and that those PR efforts are increasing.

These new details complement the picture provided by the scientists, food systems researchers, behavioral experts and policy specialists interviewed for this story, who say the industry is working to sow confusion about the impacts of animal agriculture - sapping the will for broader political change.

That's not to say that all beef production is inherently unsustainable. In the right ecological context, and with the right management practices, cattle can help maintain soil health while yielding nutrient-dense edible protein in return, among other benefits. But the truth is that we already eat too much beef for the planet's good. The world can't afford the rise in global beef consumption that experts predict - while wealthier nations, whose residents have the most emissions-intensive diets, could make rapid climate gains by choosing to eat less.

This narrative is one that industry-aligned interests badly want to extinguish. Through blog posts, videos, educational assets, op-eds, TV ads, social media campaigns, trained influencers and other channels - many described here for the first time - the industry is trying to convince us all of what the science definitely doesn't show: that dietary change has no role in climate strategy.

The Cattlemen's Beef Board and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, which says the US produces the world's most sustainable beef, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

The most emissions-intensive food

According to a landmark study in the peer-reviewed journal Science, every kilogram of beef consumed adds a whopping 99.5 kgs of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases to the environment, on average. It was the most climate-damaging food studied, and the competition wasn't even close. According to a subsequent analysis of the results by researchers at Oxford University's Our World In Data project, beef consumption is 2.5 times - 250% - worse for the climate than the runner-up, sheep and lamb. Eating beef puts more than four times more strain on the atmosphere than eating cheese. It's more than seven times worse than farmed fish, eight times worse than pork, and 10 times worse than poultry. It's 21 times worse than eggs.

When compared to fruits, vegetables, grains and legumes, the impacts of beef consumption are even worse. The Science study found that, on average, producing a kilogram of beef contributed over 22 times more to climate crisis than producing a kilogram of rice and 63 times more than a kilogram of wheat. Root veggies, certain tree fruits and nuts were all more than 200 times more climate-efficient by weight than beef.

What makes beef such an outlier? Cows essentially chew for a living - masticating and regurgitating grasses all day long so that tough plant fibers can pass through their multiple stomachs. This process, called enteric fermentation, allows ruminants to nourish themselves - and therefore us - on plants few other animals could eat. But all that chomping comes with plenty of reflux and belching and every burp emits a little methane, a planet-warming gas 28 times more powerful than carbon dioxide over 100 years. (It's a common misconception that cow farts are what cause warming; from a climate perspective, the burps are what matter.)

In addition, the average steer consumes several metric tons of forage and feed in its life, which means they need a lot of room to roam. But there aren't enough native grasslands on earth to feed all the cows that humans want to eat. So raising cattle often means cutting down forests or displacing other ecosystems to make room for bovines and their food. Taken together, these characteristics - belching, methane and grazing - add up to a climate triple-whammy.

""˜Downplaying the environmental footprint'

In 2006, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) published Livestock's Long Shadow, a report that revealed animal agriculture's significant role in the climate crisis. By showing that livestock production makes up a significant proportion of global emissions - around 18%, though it would later revise that number downward slightly - as well as contributing to other environmental issues including land degradation and water pollution, the report generated headlines and started conversations, helping to make the toll of meat-overconsumption front-page news.

It was also a moment that terrified the meat industry. According to Jennifer Jacquet, associate professor in the department of environmental studies at New York University, Livestock's Long Shadow helped to inspire meat multinationals and their allies to launch a counteroffensive, working overtime to defend the environmental reputation of meat, especially beef.

""Since at least 2006 ""¦ the industry has been borrowing tactics from the fossil fuel playbook,"" Jacquet wrote in a 2021 Washington Post op-ed. ""While meat and dairy producers have not claimed that climate change is a liberal hoax, as oil and gas producers did starting in the 1990s, companies have been downplaying the industry's environmental footprint and undermining climate policy.""

Of the major meat lobbies, the beef industry has arguably done the most to mobilize on the topic of climate. The Guardian's review of strategy and funding documents from the past decade shows that the cattle business sees itself as perpetually under attack by a variety of hostile forces - with environmental issues of increasing concern.

""The beef industry seemingly is under continuous assault on multiple fronts,"" according to a 2022 strategy document from the Cattlemen's Beef Board. ""These attacks frequently are aimed at consumers of beef, bombarding them on a daily basis with negative commentaries concerning ""¦ the adverse environmental impact of beef production, its role in the development of antimicrobial resistance, and a myriad of other problems.""

By 2009, the cattle industry had found a new way to drive the narrative, one that cast cattle as a force for environmental good. That year, Frank Mitloehner, a UC Davis animal scientist, co-authored a paper pointing out some issues with Livestock's Long Shadow, including a faulty calculation that had caused the report's authors to overstate livestock's proportionate share of climate pollution. FAO acknowledged the error, and would go on to downgrade its estimate of livestock's portion of global emissions from 18 to 14.5% - though some experts argue the lower number is now outdated, and may still be too low.

Still, the controversy caught the notice of the mainstream press, with outlets from Fox News to CNN eagerly covering the fallout. Mitloehner seized the moment to talk about FAO's error. Except in his telling, the mistake was about much more than a few percentage points. In subsequent, widely circulated comments first quoted in a UC Davis press release, he also claimed that reducing greenhouse gas production is possible, ""but not by consuming less meat and milk"" - something his peer-reviewed critique of Livestock's Long Shadow didn't actually prove.

""He proceeded to take this study and critique and go on media and wildly misrepresent his own research,"" said Vasile StÄƒnescu, a Mercer University professor who has written a peer-reviewed book chapter on how Mitloehner's so-called ""Cowgate"" dustup circulated virally through the media.

Meat industry groups claimed victory.

""Eating less meat won't curb climate change, air quality expert says,"" gushed a blog post published by the North American Meat Institute (NAMI), a meat lobby. ""Eating less meat has no impact on climate change,"" the trade group National Hog Farmer claimed. ""Meat and dairy intakes not linked to climate change,"" wrote Feed Navigator, a trade publication covering the livestock industry.

The industry had its soundbite - but in all the uproar, three things usually went unmentioned. First, that Mitloehner's widely shared remarks didn't actually prove his assertions about the ineffectiveness of dietary change. (His claims ""read more like advertising than science"", StÄƒnescu wrote in his book chapter.) Second, that FAO didn't overestimate livestock's emissions as much as underestimate the relative impact of transport - the mistake did nothing to inflate livestock's raw climate contribution, which was and still is huge. And third, that Mitloehner's study had been funded by a $26,000 grant from the Beef Checkoff Program. Mitloehner didn't mention the funding in his study, where such a disclosure would be customary. The grant was mentioned in the UC Davis release that generated so much attention, but it mostly went unremarked upon by the press.

There's nothing unusual about scientists taking money from industries they study, as long as those ties are properly disclosed. In this case, though, Mitloehner was held up by media and trade groups as a neutral scientist without competing interests, when that wasn't quite the case.

Responding to questions from the Guardian, Mitloehner said: ""Journalists, organizations and even other academics use my comments in ways that I do not always intend. For better or worse, I cannot control what they say or how they say it.""

But if the incident disturbed Mitloehner, you wouldn't know it. He'd go on to coordinate even more actively with big meat - not just on research, but on messaging.

""˜The Schwarzenegger of science communicators'

Mitloehner is a Twitter fixture with a tenacious presence and over 30,000 followers, someone who weighs in with (often contrarian) takes on new developments related to meat production and climate. He's also known for punchy, headline-grabbing blog posts, as well as defiant op-eds in mainstream outlets - including the San Francisco Chronicle and the Los Angeles Times - that defend the sustainability of beef. A glowing profile in the trade publication Meatingplace called him ""the Schwarzenegger of science communicators"" and lovingly dubbed him ""the Debunki-nator"".

In 2018, UC Davis announced it would open a new research and extension program - the Clarity and Leadership for Environmental Awareness and Research Center, or Clear Center - under Mitloehner's direction. The center exists to publish and promote research that increases the efficiency of animal agriculture, especially beef. What wasn't evident at the time, but was revealed last year in reporting by The New York Times, was that the center was established with a $2.9m grant from IFeeder, the non-profit arm of a livestock industry group representing multinational beef packers and other animal agriculture interests. The center has also taken hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding from other industry sources, according to the Times's report.

In his response to the piece, Mitloehner rightly pointed out that it's normal for researchers to take industry funding. But the Times story also revealed a more unusual dynamic: that the Clear Center has coordinated public messaging campaigns with industry groups.

That seems to have been the goal. In a confidential 2018 memo first obtained by the environmental advocacy non-profit Greenpeace and subsequently published in full on its website, IFeeder president Joel Newman outlined a vision for the center that was largely focused on Mitloehner's value as a meat industry messenger.

""The communications sub-committee has been working with Dr Mitloehner on expanding his proactive communications, outreach and recognition on key issues,"" Newman wrote, adding that ""several committee members have forwarded content for Dr Mitloehner to comment/respond to as well as people for him to follow/engage with on Twitter"".

According to the memo, the overt - if not primary - focus of the center would be to support messages that downplay meat production's environmental toll.

""The Center's immediate focus is on reviewing current research, filling research gaps and providing impactful messaging to address the significant misinformation regarding the environmental impact of poultry and livestock production,"" Newman wrote.

Today, that vision has come to fruition: materials generated by the Clear Center, or featuring Mitloehner, feed the meat lobby's sprawling counter-messaging machine.

Behind the scenes, Masters of Beef Advocacy graduates coach each other on how best to deploy Mitloehner's research and blog posts in their activism efforts, according to my review of conversations in their private Facebook group, while industry-aligned websites feature him and his work prominently.

Mitloehner said in his email to the Guardian: ""The primary goal of the Clear Center is to advance sustainability in animal agriculture. We do that with research and science communications. As an academic, I noticed that research that was critical to advancing important conversations wasn't always effectively communicated, so the idea was born to create a center that ensures research would be shared.""

He added that his public statements were rooted in research and the purpose of the Clear Center was to ""advance sustainability in animal agriculture ""¦ with research and science communications"". He said this ""cannot be done without engaging the industry"" and that by targeting methane it was possible for livestock industry to reach climate neutrality ""and eat into historical emissions"".

But other academics interviewed for this article felt that Mitloehner's messaging efforts and the manner in which they're routinely amplified by industry, go beyond the bounds of normal scholarly conduct.

""Frank Mitloehner doesn't echo industry talking points; he seems to create entire messaging strategies. Those messages are then echoed by trade groups multiple years afterward. He is then commended by industry, including his funders, for broadcasting those messages across social media and to political groups,"" said Matthew Hayek, an assistant professor at New York University who studies agriculture's greenhouse gas emissions impacts.

""Only a fraction of the Clear Center's work seems focused on methane reduction,"" Hayek said. ""More broadly, the Clear Center creates industry-friendly messages to help fight off a wide range of proposals to tackle climate change. Those proposals include meat reduction, investments in alternative proteins and producer buyouts away from animal agriculture. His/their positions diverge from climate expert consensus and cherry pick scientific findings to undermine how drastic those proposals' mitigation potential actually is or could be.""

A digital command center staffed 24-7

A five-year strategy document written in 2020 by a handful of leading cattle industry organizations identified a need to turn up the heat in its messaging fight. Their highest priority was to ""demonstrate beef's positive sustainability message and key role in regenerative agriculture"".

""It is highly likely the beef industry will continue to be threatened by legislation and/or regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions,"" the document said. It went on: ""The task force believes it is more important than ever to aggressively promote the multiple advantages of beef and educate consumers on how beef fits into a healthy lifestyle and sustainable diet.""

The meat industry has long used lobbying and marketing to improve the business climate for its products. In a paper she co-authored in 2021, Jacquet described the scope of these efforts, including intensive lobbying of government officials, millions of dollars of campaign contributions and public (often misleading) net-zero commitments. Then there's the marketing.

The Cattlemen's Beef Board - which contracts with the National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA) for its marketing and promotion efforts - has long had significant cultural impact. Its famous early 1990s ""Beef: it's what's for dinner"" spots, backed by music from Aaron Copland's Rodeo suite, are among the most iconic TV commercials of all time.

Since at least 2018, NCBA has also hired top-shelf creative agencies and public relations firms - including Ketchum, VMLY&R and Linhart PR, all of whom also have fossil fuel industry clients - to help devise its messaging and strategy. And while its marketing efforts have historically shored up support for beef as the centerpiece of the American plate, those efforts have recently taken on a much more environmental focus. The NCBA-operated website BeefItsWhatsForDinner.com contains numerous articles and fact sheets downplaying beef's role in the climate crisis.

In a private video training session for beef industry influencers, Sarah Reece, NCBA's senior executive director of brand marketing, described a plan that involved paid advertising on Google, Facebook, Reddit, YouTube and Instagram, as well as video and audio ads spots on ESPN, Spotify and Sirius XM Radio. One sustainability-oriented marketing effort, which ran from April to June 2021, generated 60m impressions and drove nearly 90,000 clicks to Beef: It's What's For Dinner web pages and content, including material muddying the waters about beef's links to climate. It's ""a surround sound approach to reach consumers"", Reese said. ""We're getting them everywhere they are.""

Those efforts appear to be going strong in 2023. According to strategy documents posted to the Beef Board's website, NCBA requested $9.1m for content marketing and paid advertising this year - all of which will serve to improve beef's image, and some of which will specifically ""communicate the net climate and environmental impact of beef production"".

Then there is the Masters of Beef Advocacy (MBA) course, though the NCBA has even more ambitious plans to combat what it calls ""misinformation"".

Using checkoff money, NCBA has developed what it has called a ""Digital Command Center"" - a sophisticated online monitoring system that tracks media outlets and social media for more than 200 beef-related topics. Hosted in Denver in a space that ""looks like a military operations center combined with the TV section at an electronics retailer"", according to a recent Cattlemen's Beef Board mailer sent to ranchers, the command center alerts members of NCBA's issues management and media relations team whenever stories or online chatter rise above a certain threshold. It's staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with personnel redundancies built in to make sure someone's always watching.

One goal is to enable the industry to respond to emerging public health or economic emergencies. But the center, which received $742,400 in checkoff money for fiscal year 2023, is also used to keep track of public conversations around beef's sustainability in real-time - and to deploy ""talking points, media statements, fact sheets, infographics, videos and various digital assets"" as necessary to shift the terms of conversation.

NCBA calls it ""proactive reputation management"": a strategy that entails monitoring the internet for messaging opportunities, then leaping in to burnish beef's image whenever it's advantageous. In 2021, for instance, during Climate Week NYC - a time when online discussion of beef's sustainability tends to skyrocket, according to NCBA's monitoring tools - the organization worked to place pro-beef op-eds in news outlets, ensuring the online chatter would include its perspective. In the private video for MBA students, Marisa Pooley, NCBA's senior director of issues and reputation management, explained how the NCBA collaborated closely with chef and rancher contributors to place independent-seeming pieces in outlets like the Denver Post and Denver alt-weekly Westword.

Climate Week NYC was ""something we really took a big swing at and leveraged as a reputational opportunity"", Pooley told students. She said content related to the op-eds generated millions of views.

It was the same playbook NCBA had used in May 2021. That spring, two high-profile culinary institutions dropped meat to protest livestock's outsized role in the climate crisis: food media outlet Epicurious decided to stop featuring new recipes with beef, and Manhattan restaurant Eleven Madison Park took meat off its menu entirely. The news made headlines. And when NCBA noted the trend in its monitoring tool, it sprang into action.

NCBA started by defending beef's sustainability in a slate of paid ad buys - which ran in outlets like the New York Times and the Washington Post - but it didn't stop there. In the private video for Masters of Beef Advocacy students, Pooley described how NCBA worked with celebrity chef Lamar Moore to write a piece insisting on a central place for beef on the plate. That story - which ran with the subhead ""Why cutting meat from the menu (or magazine) is misguided"", ran in LA Weekly - and was plugged repeatedly on Twitter by NCBA (and other industry accounts) as if it had no connection to the story.

In fact, none of the pieces NCBA privately admits it played a role in - in LA Weekly, Westword and the Denver Post - disclosed the trade group's participation.

The industry sees these messaging efforts as part of an existential battle for survival. In the training video, NCBA leaders cited data that found 47% of Americans aren't sure about the sustainability of beef. That persuadable middle is a top priority for the industry, they said, as whoever reaches them best has the power to sway the balance of public opinion.

The industry must engage in a ""defensive strategy"", Pooley told MBA students. Sustainability, she said, ""has the potential to become a crisis if we don't address it early"".

From elephants to tigers, study reveals scale of damage to wildlife caused by transformation of wildernesses and human activity

The total weight of Earth's wild land mammals - from elephants to bisons and from deer to tigers - is now less than 10% of the combined tonnage of men, women and children living on the planet.

A study by scientists at Israel's Weizmann Institute of Science, published this month, concludes that wild land mammals alive today have a total mass of 22m tonnes. By comparison, humanity now weighs in at a total of around 390m tonnes.

At the same time, the species we have domesticated, such as sheep and cattle, in addition to other hangers-on such as urban rodents, add a further 630m tonnes to the total mass of creatures that are now competing with wild mammals for Earth's resources. The biomass of pigs alone is nearly double that of all wild land mammals.

The figures demonstrate starkly that humanity's transformation of the planet's wildernesses and natural habitats into a vast global plantation is now well under way - with devastating consequences for its wild creatures. As the study authors emphasise, the idea that Earth is a planet that still possesses great plains and jungles that are teeming with wild animals is now seriously out of kilter with reality. The natural world and its wild animals are vanishing as humanity's population of almost eight billion individuals continues to grow.

""When you look at wildlife documentaries on television - for instance of wildebeest migrating - it is easy to conclude that wild mammals are doing quite well,"" lead author Ron Milo told the Observer.

""But that intuition is wrong. These creatures are not doing well at all. Their total mass is around 22m tonnes which is less than 10% of humanity's combined weight and amounts to only about 6lb of wild land mammal per person. And when you add all our cattle, sheep and other livestock, that adds another 630m tonnes. That is 30 times the total for wild animals. It is staggering. This is a wake-up call to humanity.""

The study, The Global Biomass of Wild Mammals, also reveals that those that do best - such as the white-tailed deer in the US and wild boars - are those that find it easier to adapt to the presence of humans. Both species can be found near settlements and are occasionally treated as pets. ""Even within the wild, the fingerprints of humanity are obvious,"" added Milo, whose team's study is published in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

As part of the paper, researchers Lior Greenspoon and Eyal Krieger collected biomass data on about half of all known mammals and used machine-learning computational models on other zoological samples to calculate the other half.

The grim figures for land mammals were matched by those found in the oceans. The total mass of marine mammals was calculated to be around 40m tonnes. Fin whales have the largest total biomass with sperm whales and humpbacks coming into the second and third slots, respectively.

Common pet species were also found to be major contributors to humanity's planetary impact. Domestic dogs have a total mass of around 20m tonnes, a figure close to the combined biomass of all wild terrestrial mammals, while cats have a total biomass of around 2m tonnes, almost double that of the African savanna elephant. ""These domesticated-to-wild mass ratios emphasise the active role humans play in shaping the abundance of mammals on Earth,"" the researchers state in their paper.

Biomass studies are not the only way to quantify the animal world. Numbers of species are also revealing. As an example, it has been found there are 1,200 species of bats that account for a fifth of all land mammal species and two-thirds of all individual wild mammals by head count. However, they make up only 10% of the biomass of wild land mammals.

""Biomass is complementary to species richness and other diversity metrics, and can serve as an indicator of wild mammals' abundance and ecological footprint on a global scale,"" the researchers state.

Estimates made two years ago by the team suggested there were about 50m tonnes of wild mammals on Earth. The new figure, calculated using a host of techniques including AI, indicates that the crisis facing the planet's wildlife appears to be much worse than first appreciated. Just how quickly the depletion of wild mammals is proceeding now needs to be assessed as a matter of urgency, they say, and is the focus of the study's next phase which will assess how much of the biomass loss occurred over the past 100 years.

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from livestock is vital. But the politics is fraught

Until relatively recently, Dutch farming prowess was hailed as one of the wonders of the global economy. In 2017, a National Geographic article headlined ""This tiny country feeds the world"" encapsulated a sense of national pride at the Netherlands' status as the second-biggest exporter of agricultural products by value behind the United States.

These days, Dutch farmers are in the headlines for less upbeat reasons. As the climate emergency and a related biodiversity crisis belatedly take centre stage in policymaking, the prime minister, Mark Rutte, has committed to halving the country's overall nitrogen emissions by 2030. A large proportion of these are generated by the manure and urine produced by more than 100m cattle, pigs and chickens. To reach the target, and protect biodiversity in the polluted countryside, the government has announced plans to reduce livestock numbers by a third. Reluctant farmers have been warned they could be subject to compulsory buyouts.

That, at least, is the policy. Turning it into a reality is proving a challenge. As other European countries also look to overhaul their agriculture sectors, Dutch farms have become a test case in navigating the vital politics of the green transition. Last week, protesting farmers confronted the finance minister, Sigrid Kaag, with burning torches. Tractors have blockaded roads, and slurry has been dumped at the home of the minister for nature, Christianne van der Wal. Meanwhile, the far right has successfully co-opted the farmers' cause, and promoted a toxic conspiracy theory that targeted farmland is being sequestrated in order to build homes for asylum seekers.

The intimidation tactics used by elements of the farmers' protest movement have been rightly condemned. But the rural backlash has generated widespread public sympathy - particularly outside the major cities. Ahead of crucial regional elections this month, a new Farmer-Citizen party is running third in the polls. If it wins enough seats in the Dutch senate to form a blocking alliance with the far right, the aims of the ""nitrogen law"" could be thwarted.

This would send a terrible signal. UN researchers estimate that, without decisive action, agricultural greenhouse gas emissions alone will take the world beyond the tipping point of 1.5C of warming. The emblematic standoff between Dutch ministers and the country's farmers demonstrates that achieving the necessary reductions will require working collaboratively with those whose livelihoods and way of life are affected; that also means battling the insidious influence of the far right and providing resources to ease the transition.

In the Netherlands, some progress on these fronts has been made. But for years, governments in The Hague celebrated intensive farming as a Dutch success story. Mr Rutte is now playing catch-up by imposing a revolution from above. More should have been done earlier to address the brewing crisis and get support for change from farming organisations. Meanwhile, a â‚¬24bn government fund - which would help some farmers diversify and relocate away from pollution hotspots - is yet to be signed off by the EU, which has concerns over state aid implications.

That deal should be swiftly expedited. As extreme political forces seek to leverage the green transition for their own ends, the stakes are huge. In farming, as with car manufacturing and in other industries, meaningful progress towards net zero will only come if those at the sharp end are persuaded to come on board for the journey.

Petros Chrysafis helps Californians ""˜like the wildlife they live with' by taking a unique approach to deterring livestock killings

Petros Chrysafis has always had a fascination with predators, but he never thought he could make a career out of it. Then he helped a friend solve a chicken-stealing coyote problem. Word spread. Now he runs a one-man ""predator detection and deterrence"" business in California's Central valley and Sierra Nevada mountains.

His job is an odd combo of forensic scientist, homicide detective, set designer and negotiator. Typically when he first meets his clients, they are ready to find and kill the predator that's been attacking their livestock. His goal is to offer an alternative: coexistence.

Chrysafis, age 33, grew up in the Republic of Cyprus, where the largest beast of prey is a red fox. Today, he treks out into predator country without fear. ""No point carrying bear spray,"" Chrysafis said. ""I'm a pretty big dude.""

He works on about 60 cases a year in California's backcountry settlements, grazing lands and mountain communities. When he arrives at a farm where owners have just lost livestock, emotions often run high. ""There's anger and then there's grief that you have to navigate,"" he said. ""This work is 90% human conflict, 10% wildlife conflict.""

His process begins with identifying the local predator. To gather information, Chrysafis deploys his secret weapon: trail cameras. He walks the land, looking at it say, how a mountain lion might see it - the vantage point of a high ridgeline, the draw of a pond - and places cameras by the clearings and trails where animals are most likely to walk by. The cameras are motion-activated, and store a few thousand time-stamped photos - shots of wildlife slipping by, sniffing the air and glowing like ghosts in night vision captures.

The images he gathers often help to put landowners at ease; caught on film, even a mountain lion can seem less like an unseen stalker and more like an introverted neighbor. ""It does change people's perception of things,"" Chrysafis said. ""It helps people like the wildlife that they live with.""

Once the culprit is identified, Chrysafis sets out a plan to deter them from going after livestock again. Every animal spooks differently. Flashing lights usually scare off mountain lions and bobcats, but coyotes quickly get used to them. A trusty guardian llama can run off coyotes, but might become lunch for a mountain lion.

Many of Chrysafis's deterrence techniques are designed to simulate human activity. Element by element, he builds up an elaborate theater of human presence. The tools he uses to keep up this grand illusion have the unsophisticated charm of Home Alone booby traps: radios playing a constant murmur of voices, flickering motion lights that mimic a human with a flashlight, ""Critter Gitters"" that emit startling high-pitched sounds.

One effective predator-repellent is human smell: Chrysafis hangs detergent packets in trees, or wrings the sweat out of his own shirt.

The best audio for perturbing predators is lengthy, animated and includes multiple voices, so sometimes Chrysafis records his own Dungeons & Dragons sessions and plays them out hour after hour through solar-powered radios, like a digital St Francis preaching to the animals.

In the American west's long history of hunting and trapping, Chrysafis's approach is a softer one. He tries to communicate the real value of wildlife to ranchers, while recognizing the need to keep their livestock safe.

Finding solutions for predator deterrence is only going to become more necessary. Legal protections have helped mountain lion, black bear and bobcat populations slowly rise over the last few decades. At the same time, human activity is encroaching on predators' habitats, making conflict more likely.

Among Chrysafis's most frequent interlocutors in the hills and ranges of California is the mountain lion.

For most of California's history, mountain lions were aggressively hunted; the state paid out a bounty for every dead lion until 1969 and the population crashed. Then, in 1972, mountain lion hunting was made illegal in the state.

Elusive and wide-ranging, the animals are hard to count, but state agencies estimate that today the state population is holding steady somewhere between 4,000 and 6,000 cats.

Humans are still the leading cause of mortality for mountain lions in the state. Their habitat is being destroyed and fragmented; increasingly, mountain lion populations are hemmed in and isolated from each other by uncrossable highways.

The debate over mountain lion-livestock conflict is complex, and exemplifies the nuances of Chrysafis's job. Conservationists want mountain lion numbers to rise: a healthy predator population has a cascade of positive effects on an ecosystem. By removing old and sick animals, apex predators keep deer populations healthy and slow the spread of chronic wasting disease. Hundreds of other animals benefit from mountain lion kills, from the small mammals that steal scraps to the insects that pass entire life cycles on the carcass, to the birds that eat the insects.

But many California farmers and ranchers feel that mountain lion protections come at an unreasonable cost to livestock owners. On social media groups for agricultural professionals, posts about mountain lion sightings are full of comments like ""The only good cat is a dead cat"" and ""SSS"" - shorthand for ""shoot, shovel and shut up"". It's impossible to know how many mountain lions are killed quietly and illegally.

There is also a legal route for killing mountain lions in California. If a mountain lion kills three livestock animals in the state and non-lethal deterrents aren't working, landowners can apply for a ""lethal depredation permit"". About 100 mountain lions in the state are killed on these permits every year, most of which have been awarded to homesteads, ranches and hobby farms: places where each animal represents a significant investment.

For Chrysafis, the permits mean that he's often working against a ticking clock: he has to find a way to deter the animal before it takes its third forbidden meal.

Chelsea Wilhite and her husband Wayne live on a small homestead in Oakhurst, California, 50 miles south of Yosemite valley. They own 13 sheep, two dozen chickens and a handful of turkeys: all potentially appealing prey for the mountain lions, bears and coyotes that pass through their property. Their predator deterrents are working, but there have been some close calls. The wooden door of their chicken coop is splintered and grooved with bear claw marks. ""Our laying hens have names,"" Wilhite says. ""It's personal.""

Chrysafis recommends a multi-pronged approach to deterrence; Wilhite's property has mobile electric fencing and LED lights that gleam in the darkness, designed to look like a pair of glinting, watchful eyes. They also employ one of the oldest (and best) predator deterrents: a well-trained livestock guardian dog, or ""LGD"". Willhite's LGD, Bree, sleeps out with the sheep, digging herself a little bed in the grass every night. Since they've had Bree, Wilhite and her husband have stopped seeing bears on their property. But they still dread an eventual predation event.

""Overall, livestock loss to predators is tiny,"" said Chrysafis, ""But look at Chelsea. If they lose one or two sheep, that's a huge blow to them. And not just financially, but emotionally.""

When a predation has occurred, Chrysafis analyzes the carcass, looking for clues about the killer. Mountain lion victims usually have distinctive puncture wounds on the back of the neck or head, from the lion's two-inch-long canine teeth. Coyotes generally attack the hind legs, to pull the animal to the ground. Wild predators kill precisely. Mountain lions eat the nutrient-rich internal organs first: liver, kidney and lungs.

Nearly half of the predation cases Chrysafis works on are committed by dogs, both feral packs and roaming pets. Mountain lions often take the blame. Tracking down the offending dog can create tensions with neighbors and the general fear of mountain lions makes them an appealing scapegoat. ""It's a much easier way out,"" said Chrysafis. ""There may be some truth to it - they may eventually lose a goat to a mountain lion. But then you also lost four goats to your neighbor's dogs.""

When livestock has been killed, a non-lethal response can be a hard sell - but Chrysafis tries to show that keeping your local mountain lion alive is good for everyone. The best predator deterrent is another, bigger predator - so if you can find deterrents that reliably work on your mountain lion neighbor, he'll stay away from your livestock, and so will other wildlife. If you shoot him, a new mountain lion or a pack of coyotes will fill the power vacuum and you start from scratch. You're better off with the predator you know.

Chrysafis funds his work through small business grants and environmental consulting work. The money doesn't really cover the time he spends working cases. But by operating independently, he's able to work with the government-wary ranchers who might never reach out to US Fish and Wildlife or to non-profit conservation groups - people who might not otherwise seriously consider non-lethal approaches. ""My appeal is that I'm not linked to government agencies,"" said Chrysafis. ""I'm just a dude.""

Often, his clients pay him in eggs, meat and offal. Like a mountain lion, he considers the internal organs to be the choicest meats. ""A lot of the stuff that Americans don't eat, I'll take,"" he says. ""It's a comfort food for me. Whenever I was sick, my grandma was like, ""˜Here's some entrails of an animal.'""

For all his work studying mountain lions, Chrysafis has never encountered one face to face. But they've seen him. Once, he opened a batch of trail cam photos to see himself walking away from the camera, followed a minute or two later by a big, tawny mountain lion padding casually behind him. She wasn't stalking him - she was just a shy neighbor, keeping a polite distance.

Chrysafis's trail cam images have an interesting side-effect, he said: they make it apparent that humans are one part of a larger community of animals. When Chrysafis flips through the pictures from a trail cam on a property in the Sierra foothills, they show a trail runner whip by, then a bevy of quail, then a bobcat, dog walker, coyote, mountain lion and finally a family with a picnic basket. ""If you've been on that little trail,"" Chrysafis said, ""you have been on the same trail that 90% of California's mammals have been on. It's just such a cool thing to think about.""

Wildlife appears on trails for the same reasons we do: they're easier to walk on than pushing through undergrowth. Human and wildlife populations are drawn to the same things; our conflicts with each other boil down to the fundamental animal tensions over water, food and space. Seeing it that way makes it easier to choose deterrence over retaliatory killing. ""We don't live in isolation from wildlife and nature,"" said Wilhite. ""We are part of it.""

Last year, a rancher in Fresno county lost two sheep; their deep neck wounds pointed to a mountain lion. Coexistence seemed unlikely, but Chrysafis recommended deterrents and set up cams. His cameras caught a mature female mountain lion haunting the rancher's property once or twice a week. A few months after Chrysafis's visit, the rancher sent him an email with a photo attached: a trail cam shot of his mountain lion, caught mid-stride on a high ridge above the ranch. ""It's a great picture and I want to frame it,"" he wrote. ""Is that OK with you?"" So far, that mountain lion hasn't taken a third sheep.

The Australian scientist on the links between ultra-processed foods and decreased brain health, and the effect of government policy and industry resistance

Felice Jacka is a leading researcher of nutritional psychiatry, a relatively new field of study that considers the role of diet in mental and brain health. She is also the co-director of the Food & Mood Centre at Deakin University, Australia, and president of the International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry Research. She spoke to the Observer about her discoveries into the links between ultra-processed foods and the health of our brains.

We usually think of food as having an effect on us from the mouth down. Why study its impact on our brain?Our gut microbiome affects virtually every aspect of health. It affects our metabolism, our blood glucose, our body weight. It affects the way genes turn on and off, and the amount of serotonin in our brain by altering the way the gut breaks down tryptophan [from protein] in our diet. It influences the stress response system. It affects the way the [energy-producing] mitochondria in our cells work, and it very profoundly influences our immune system.

So if you start to think about all of those things, all of which are very much involved in mental and brain health, and that diet is a key factor that affects the gut microbes, then you can see why we need to think about what we're eating and what we're not eating in relation to our mental and brain health.

And ultra-processed foods play a particularly unusual part in that?It's a question that science doesn't yet have all the answers for. There is already some research that tells us that when a western junk food diet is given to young people who normally eat a fairly healthy diet for a week, we can see there are impairments in the cognitive functions of the hippocampus [an area of the brain]. We and others have shown that people who have a less healthy diet have a smaller hippocampus, and people who have a healthier diet have a larger hippocampus.

A shrunken brain is a frightening image. How scared should we be?The hippocampus is the one area of the brain that can grow and shrink. People with, for example, severe depressive illness on average have a smaller hippocampus. But when they're no longer depressed, their hippocampus grows again.

So the hippocampus is really important in mental health. We know that in animal studies, if they block the proteins that help to grow the hippocampus, then antidepressants don't work. And then, of course, the hippocampus is very important for various aspects of learning and memory. It's really important for kids at school, for example, while any of us who want to maintain our brains and not have cognitive decline as we get older, you want to do everything you can to keep your hippocampus nice and fat and healthy.

So why are ultra-processed foods impairing our brains?We've just run a very interesting study where we tested the ultra-processed food v the wholefood version of a low-calorie diet, and looked at the impact on the gut microbiome. What we think is that with ultra-processed foods, even when the packet says it's got this vitamin, or it's got added minerals, or it's got enough protein, your brain or your gut microbes don't process it as food in the same way [as wholefoods]. We just need more science to show this conclusively.

Food manufacturers often claim ultra-processed foods can be healthy for their fibre and vitamins. Is that wishful thinking?I think the big picture is really critical here. The industrialised food system is the leading cause of illness and early death around the world. And it is the leading cause of biodiversity loss. The UN food report of 2021 worked out that our global industrialised food system costs the globe roughly $20tn a year. About $11tn of that is in the impact to human health, like heart disease, high blood pressure and cancer. And about $7tn is the impact to the environment.

Therefore we should reduce consumption of ultra-processed foods where we can?The real issue is that many people don't necessarily have the option because it's very often the case that ultra-processed foods are the cheapest. This is a failure of government policy, nothing short of that.

In the UK, as it is in Australia, when you go to fill up your car with petrol, you see row after row of ultra-processed foods, sugar-sweetened beverages, and every sort of chip and lolly and soft drink you could possibly imagine. Given that those foods interact really strongly with the reward systems of the brain, if you're getting those in your face every day when you're on the high street, at the supermarket, filling up your car with petrol, it is very difficult for individuals to make healthy choices.

You've also explored a connection between ultra-processed foods and neurodevelopmental disorders. What have you found?In 2021, we looked directly at diet quality in mothers and children, and ADHD symptoms and diagnosis. And particularly, the mothers' intake of healthy and unhealthy foods were both independently linked to children's ADHD diagnosis.

That's not an experiment, it's just an observation. But it's very concordant with animal studies and the emerging understanding that the microbes that are in mothers' guts while the baby is growing, and the microbes that are in the guts of infants when they're born, not only influence immune development but also brain development. Because people's diets are so very impaired in the west, we think that that, along with antibiotic exposure and the loss of biodiversity from the food we're eating, limits the healthy microbiome in mothers and infants. And that might be part of what's leading to apparent increases in neurodevelopmental disorders as well as mental health problems.

Some researchers have criticised the term ultra-processed food as being ill-defined, overly broad and unfit for purpose. Should we reconsider the term?Food must be the most complex exposure in the world. It comes in so many forms, has so many links to culture and emotional health, and it fulfils so many different roles. So it's inevitable there's going to be some fuzzy borders and some misclassifications.

But what I also know is what industry does, absolutely knowingly, is to jump in and make people confused. With cigarettes, it has never been categorically shown through a randomised controlled trial that smoking causes lung cancer. How could you randomly assign people to either smoke or not and follow them for 40 years? But we know from convergent evidence - from animal studies, from epidemiology - that if people stop smoking, their risk goes down.

What the tobacco industry had done for a long time was to confuse people by saying correlation doesn't equal causation. Now, they do exactly the same thing with food. Think of the billions of dollars that are generated in profits through the industrialised food system every year, and the power of those industries to get people, including scientists, to muddy the waters. A lot, I think, of the conversation around the Nova classification [which groups food according to their level of processing] and if it's fit for purpose is actually coming from industry.

The headline of this article was amended on 26 October 2023. In an earlier version we referred to Professor Jacka as a ""nutritional psychiatrist"", whereas she is a professor of nutritional psychiatry rather than a medical doctor.

Targets include cutting methane emissions from livestock by 25%, halving food waste and managing fisheries sustainably by 2030

Reforming the world's food systems will be a key step in limiting global temperature rises, the UN has said, as it set out the first instalment of a roadmap for providing food and farming while staying within 1.5C.

Food production is highly vulnerable to the effects of the climate crisis, with research suggesting that as much as a third of global food could be at risk from global heating.

Agriculture and livestock farming are also major sources of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing roughly a 10th of global carbon output directly, and more than double that if the conversion of natural habitat to farming is included.

Until now, however, the UN has held back from setting out in detail how the world can both meet the nutritional needs of a growing population, which is forecast to reach 10 billion by 2050, and reduce global greenhouse gases to net zero by the same date. The latter is required to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.

Maximo Torero, the chief economist for the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), told the Guardian: ""We need to act to reduce hunger, and to stay within 1.5C. This is about rebalancing global food systems.""

For instance, he said, in some parts of the world there was over-consumption of protein, but in other regions people did not get enough protein. Some regions could benefit from using less chemical fertiliser, but other areas were not using enough. In some regions, livestock rearing should be intensified, but in others the focus should be on restoring degraded pasture land.

The roadmap will be laid out over the next two to three years, starting with a document published at Cop28 in Dubai that contains 20 key targets to be met between 2025 and 2050, but little detail on how they can be met. Further detail on how the aspirations can be achieved will be set out in future instalments at the next two Cop summits.

The targets include: reducing methane emissions from livestock by 25% by 2030; ensuring all the world's fisheries are sustainably managed by 2030; safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030; halving food waste by 2030; eliminating the use of traditional biomass for cooking by 2030.

Torero said the plan would not include calls for a meat tax, which some experts have advocated, but would examine measures to tax sugar, salt and super-processed foods, and better food labelling.

More climate finance should be devoted to agriculture, he added, which accounts for only about 4% of climate finance today. He also called for much more efficient use of agricultural land and resources.

Emile Frison, an expert at IPES-Food (the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems), said: ""The FAO should be applauded for this first step in laying out a plan to eliminate extreme hunger and the third of greenhouse gases that come from food systems, and particularly for its emphasis on a just transition - it is not easy.""

But he said the plan did not go far enough. ""This current draft puts a huge emphasis on incremental changes to the current industrial food system. But this is a flawed system that is wrecking nature, polluting the environment, and starving millions of people,"" he said. ""These efficiency-first proposals are unlikely to be enough to get us off the high-pollution, high-fossil-fuel, high-hunger track we are on.""

He called for more radical proposals in the coming instalments. ""The next rounds of this process will need to go much further in proposing a real transformation of the status quo, by putting much more emphasis on diversification, shorter supply chains and agroecology, and on tackling the massive power inequalities imposed by a handful of companies that define what we grow and eat.""

Ruth Davis, a fellow at the European Climate Foundation, and senior associate at Oxford's Smith School, said: ""The world desperately needs a roadmap which points us to a fairer, more resilient and sustainable future for food systems. The FAO has made a useful start but it doesn't take us all the way to the destination we need.""

She called for a much stronger focus on nature, which she said would be crucial to ensuring food security. ""Goals and targets for protecting and restoring nature, agreed by 188 governments last year in a historic global deal [to protect 30% of the planet for nature by 2030] must guide the next iteration of the FAO roadmap, or we all risk being on the road to nowhere.""

Claire McConnell, of the International Institute for Sustainable Development, said the FAO must also be more inclusive.

""Looking to future iterations of the roadmap, broader engagement with stakeholders - in particular smallholder farmers, women and Indigenous peoples - will be key to both capturing the invaluable knowledge these communities hold and for ensuring acceptance, uptake and implementation of the roadmap,"" she said.

Emissions from food system alone will drive the world past target, unless high-methane foods are tackled

Emissions from the food system alone will drive the world past 1.5C of global heating, unless high-methane foods are tackled.

Climate-heating emissions from food production, dominated by meat, dairy and rice, will by themselves break the key international target of 1.5C if left unchecked, a detailed study has shown.

The analysis estimated that if today's level of food emissions continued, they would result in at least 0.7C of global heating by the end of the century, on top of the 1C rise already seen. This means emissions from food alone, ignoring the huge impact of fossil fuels, would push the world past the 1.5C limit.

The study showed that 75% of this food-related heating was driven by foods that are high sources of methane, ie those coming from ruminant livestock such as cattle, and rice paddy fields. However, the scientists said the temperature rise could be cut by 55% by cutting meat consumption in rich countries to medically recommended levels, reducing emissions from livestock and their manure, and using renewable energy in the food system.

Previous studies have shown the huge impact of food production on the environment, particularly meat and dairy, but the new study provides estimates of the temperature rises their emissions could cause. These could be a significant underestimate, however, as the study assumed animal product consumption would remain level in the future but it was projected to rise by 70% by 2050.

""Methane has this really dominant role in driving the warming associated with the food systems,"" said Catherine Ivanovich, at Columbia University in the US, who led the research. ""Sustaining the pattern [of food production] we have today is not consistent with keeping the 1.5C temperature threshold. That places a lot of urgency on reducing the emissions, especially from the high-methane food groups.""

""We have to make the goal of sustaining our global population consistent with a climate-safe future,"" she said.

The contribution of global food production to the climate crisis is complex because it involves several important greenhouse gases, all of which have different abilities to trap heat and persist in the atmosphere for different amounts of time. Previous studies have converted the impact of methane and other gases into an equivalent amount of CO2 over 100 years, but this underplayed the high potency of methane over shorter timescales.

The research, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, treated each greenhouse gas separately for 94 key types of food, enabling their impact on climate over time to be better understood. Feeding this emissions data into a widely used climate model showed that the continuation of today's food production would lead to a rise of 0.7C by 2100 if global population growth was low, and a 0.9C rise if population growth was high.

""As we had already reached more than 1C warming above pre-industrial levels by 2021, this additional warming [from food production] alone is enough to surpass the 1.5C global warming target,"" the scientists concluded. ""Our analysis clearly demonstrates that current dietary production and consumption patterns are incompatible with sustaining a growing population while pursuing a secure climate future.""

Food-related temperature rise could be curbed, the researchers said. If people adopted the healthy diet recommended by Harvard medical school, which allows a single serving of red meat a week, the rise could be cut by 0.2C. Such a diet would mean a big cut in meat eating in rich nations but could mean an increase in some poorer countries.

Cutting methane emissions from cattle using feed additives and better management of manure could avoid another 0.2C, the researchers said, while switching to green energy in the food system would cut 0.15C. Ivanovich said the emissions reductions options included in the study were those possible today but that future technological advances might be able to reduce emissions further.

""We already know that livestock production has a disproportionate contribution to climate change - even using traditional metrics, in 2021 we showed that 57% of emissions from the food system arise from animal agriculture,"" said Prof Pete Smith, at the University of Aberdeen, UK. ""This very neat study uses a simple climate model to show the disproportionate impact of methane emissions from agriculture on temperature increases, and throws light on the importance of reducing methane emissions from the food system.""

Only a third of the world's countries have included policies to cut emissions from agriculture in the climate plans they have submitted under the UN Paris agreement. The researchers said their work was aimed at increasing the understanding of the impact of global food consumption on future global heating. Ivanovich also said policies to cut emissions had to protect access to food and livelihoods for vulnerable populations.

86,"Is eating local produce actually better for the planet?","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/07/is-eating-local-better-environment","Is eating local produce actually better for the planet?

Think that eating local will help save the planet? Think again. Most emissions come from food production, not transportation

In June 2005, four women spoke at a San Francisco celebration of the first World Environment Day in North America. The Bay Area locals - Jen Maiser, Jessica Prentice, Sage Van Wing and Dede Sampson - invited the audience to join them in a local food challenge: spending the next month eating only food produced within 100 miles (160km) of their homes.

Although the concept of eating locally was not new - the farm-to-table movement had kicked off in the 1960s and 70s as hippies protested against processed foods and Alice Waters opened the first farm-to-table restaurant, Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, California - these women gave it new life with a new name, calling themselves ""locavores"". In his 2006 book, The Omnivore's Dilemma, Bay Area local Michael Pollan also advocated for the local food movement, and by 2007 the Oxford American Dictionary had dubbed ""locavore"" its word of the year.

Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe that eating local food is better for the environment. But in recent years, a series of studies have shown that eating locally might not be as environmentally impactful - in and of itself - as advocates once hoped. In fact, research shows that the carbon footprint of transporting food is relatively small, and that it's more important to focus on how your food is produced. Eating local can be a part of that, but it doesn't have to be.

What's the evidence for eating local?

In 1994, the UK-based Sustainable Agriculture Food and Environment Alliance (now called Sustain) published The Food Miles Report - the Dangers of Long-Distance Food Transport, which offered scientific backing for the burgeoning local food movement. It argued that the long-distance transportation of food was only possible because of cheap, non-renewable fossil fuels that allowed transnational corporations to ""exploit land, labour and resources in developing countries for the production of raw commodities to which they add considerable mark-ups before sale in the North"".

""As you can perceive in the title, food miles were initially considered (almost by definition) as a big threat and contributor to climate change,"" Laura Enthoven, a PhD researcher in agricultural economics at the UniversitÃ© catholique de Louvain in Belgium and author of a recent review of local food systems research, said in an email. The farther food had to travel, the more fossil fuel was used and greenhouse gases emitted.

Those emissions are especially high for food transported by airplane: food that is flown is responsible for up to 50 times as much carbon dioxide as food transported by boat. Fortunately, very little food travels by air (think perishables that need to be eaten soon after harvest, like asparagus and berries). Many fruits and vegetables with a longer shelf life, like apples and broccoli, can be shipped by boat, truck or rail, whose food miles produce far fewer emissions.

Is it the best way to reduce food-related emissions?

In the 2000s, scientists began conducting full life cycle assessments of food supply chains - looking at how much greenhouse gases are emitted not just when food is transported, but also when crops are planted and fertilized, animals are taken out to pasture or kept in confinement, and food scraps end up in the garbage. What they found was that transporting food made up a relatively small percentage of food's total carbon footprint.

In a 2018 paper, a team of researchers from the UK and Switzerland found that only 1% to 9% of food's emissions come from packaging, transport and retail. The vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions - 61% - come during production, while food is still on the farm. That's supported by research published in the early 2000s in the US and Europe.

""What we eat and how it is produced makes more impact on our food carbon footprint than purely where it comes from in terms of distance,"" said Enthoven.

The greatest source of emissions can vary among foods. In many crops, it's the fertilizer and pesticides required to grow large quantities of food on industrial farms. In beef, for example, less than 1% of emissions come from transportation while the vast majority come just from feeding cattle (and their methane-heavy burps).

Scientists are still grappling with how to define food miles: some only take into account the emissions of transporting food while others consider the full life cycle of producing food in one region before it is moved to another. As recently as last year, a study in Nature Food found that food miles accounted for a significantly larger share of the food system's emissions than had been previously thought by taking into account the emissions from transporting fertilizers, machinery and animal feed to grow that food.

So is eating local worth it?

Does the research mean there are no benefits to eating locally? ""It depends,"" both Enthoven and Mike Hamm, a professor emeritus and founding director of the Michigan State University Center for Regional Food Systems, said separately. Eating locally can be a means of supporting farms that use more environmentally friendly production practices, such as minimizing their use of fossil fuel-rich pesticides and fertilizers.

""I've often said the whole idea of local foods wasn't about just reducing food miles,"" said John Ikerd, professor emeritus of agricultural economics at the University of Missouri. It's also a solution for people ""looking for an alternative to the industrial food system"".

Ikerd recalls the farm-to-table movement and hippy-led rebellion against industrial food beginning shortly after Rachel Carson's indictment of pesticides, Silent Spring, was published in 1962. That led to the birth of the organic food movement, which sought to produce food without greenhouse gas-emitting fertilizers, pesticides and other chemicals. But as more corporations began producing organic-labeled food, Ikerd saw consumers turn to local farms where they might have a better sense of how their food was grown - and more peace of mind that farmers were using regenerative agricultural practices.

""Well-designed, inclusive, local food initiatives can have a positive impact,"" said Enthoven. But she cautions that consumers can fall into a ""local trap"", a term coined in a 2007 article by researchers at the University of Washington, if they ""believe that the whole system should switch to local only, which is not per se more sustainable or inclusive"".

Although many local farms tout themselves as ethical alternatives to industrial agriculture, there's no rule saying they have to be organic or worker-friendly. In fact, many small farms are exempt from paying the federal minimum wage and US Occupational Safety and Health Administration safety oversight and investigations.

Local farms can be important alternatives, especially when there are disruptions in supply chains, as occurred at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. But ""we need a diversity of scale in our production system across product types,"" said Hamm, especially as we look at ways to feed 8 billion people in the era of climate crisis.

In 2019, a looming crisis over pollution led the Dutch government to crack down on farm emissions. The response was furious - and offers a warning to other countries about protecting the environment without losing public trust

It was the worst traffic jam in the history of the Netherlands. From Amsterdam to Eindhoven, Rotterdam to Roermond, more than 2,000 tractors lumbered along clogged highways during the morning rush hour of 1 October 2019. Their spinning beacon lights shining amber through the dark and the rain, they caused more than 1,000km of backups on their way to the seat of government in The Hague. Other tractors made their way slowly through the sand of North Sea beaches. They converged at the Malieveld, a park located close to parliament and the primary royal residence, and a traditional scene of protest. Authorities had said that only 75 tractors would be allowed in the park, but wanting to avoid a direct confrontation, they quickly lifted the restriction. Within hours, 2,200 tractors would be squeezed in, parked front grille to trailer hitch.

The farmers had gathered to protest against an announcement made the previous week. An advisory committee, chaired by the former deputy prime minister Johan Remkes, had declared that the government would need to take ""drastic measures"" to reduce emissions of nitrogen, a formidable contributor to pollution of land, seas and skies worldwide. By far the largest share of nitrogen deposited on Dutch land comes from agriculture, so these measures would need to involve, according to the committee's report, buying out and shutting down livestock farms. The report - titled, with a very Dutch combination of understatement and candour, Not Everything Is Possible - did not make clear whether these buyouts would be voluntary or forced. Farmers assumed the worst.

A few tractors broke through fences that had been erected around the Malieveld, and three people were arrested. Otherwise the scene was peaceful. Barbecues were lit and music played. A few enterprising food vendors brought their trailers and did a brisk business selling chips. Signs proclaimed, in English, ""No farmers no food"", and ""How dairy you"", and in Dutch, ""Proud of the farmer"".

Anje Grin, who raises 250 dairy cows on a large farm near the centre of the country, drove her tractor to the protest with one of her employees. ""The atmosphere was very nice,"" she told me recently. Her husband, Piet, stayed home to look after the farm. ""Someone has to stay behind,"" he said. ""Otherwise I think the demonstration could have been twice the size.""

Remkes's announcement did not come out of nowhere. Within the 27 member states of the EU, there are a number of specially protected nature reserves, known as the Natura 2000 network. In the summer of 2019, the Dutch council of state, the highest administrative court in the Netherlands, had ruled that the Netherlands' nitrogen permits system was failing to prevent emissions harming these reserves within its borders, and it needed to end immediately. At the time, this ruling didn't seem like such a big deal. Major newspapers covered it on page five, or page nine. Alex Datema, who heads the agricultural division of Rabobank, the Netherlands' second-largest bank, told me that it took dairy farmers ""a few months to realise what it meant"".

When the Remkes report hit, everyone woke up. Agriculture was responsible for 80% of emissions of one form of nitrogen pollution, and the report pointed out that the largest share was coming from dairy farming. But dairy accounted for just 1% of GDP. Maybe, the logic went, cutting back on production wouldn't be such a great sacrifice for the country.

This enraged farmers, who in many cases were already feeling mistreated. They had already reduced their nitrogen emissions by almost two-thirds since 1990, mainly through technical advances. Over the same period, government services in rural areas had been cut in favour of investment in cities. And for more than half a century, government policies had encouraged farms to expand, saddling farmers with debts; now they were being told to do the opposite. ""A lot had the feeling that the government betrayed them,"" Datema said.

In the days and weeks after the rally at the Malieveld, more demonstrations took place, and rhetoric grew fiercer. Protesters broke down the door of the provincial government in Groningen, a university town surrounded by farmland. A leader of the far-right Farmers' Defence Force, one of the groups that organised protests, declared that the cabinet wanted ""civil war"", an accusation that amounted to a threat.

As strange as it sounds, the government's failure to develop a workable political solution to the problem of excess nitrogen has shaken Dutch politics to its foundations. In the Netherlands, it is known simply as the stikstofcrisis, the nitrogen crisis. An environmental reform that, at first glance, seemed to affect only a small proportion of Dutch society has somehow become not only wildly controversial in its own right, but embroiled in a web of related and unrelated issues, grievances and conspiracy theories. In 2019, Prime Minister Mark Rutte called it the ""fiercest crisis"" he had faced as leader, and improbably, it has attracted attention around the world. In the summer of 2022, Donald Trump gave a speech in which he celebrated the Dutch farmers for ""courageously opposing the climate tyranny of the Dutch government"". The US rightwing website Breitbart praised the farmers' resistance against a ""green agenda"", and demonstrators in Canada, angry at Covid travel restrictions, waved Dutch flags.

In the Netherlands, far-right groups have seized on the chaos, using the issue to push their own agendas, and two new right-leaning parties (though holding, in a manner peculiar to Dutch politics, leftish elements) - the populist Farmer-Citizen Movement (known by its Dutch initials, BBB) and the centrist New Social Contract - are now polling well in rural areas. Political discontent that coalesced around the nitrogen issue may well determine the outcome of the general election, which takes place on 22 November.

The nitrogen crisis is a story about the political consequences of ignoring a problem for fear of antagonising an important interest group, then fumbling the response when it becomes clear that doing nothing is no longer tenable. And other countries should take note. France, Italy, Germany and Belgium also have Natura 2000 areas that overlap with intensive livestock farming, and without a change in European law, those governments must eventually tackle nitrogen emissions, too. More broadly, as the stikstofcrisis shows, if policymakers cannot devise effective political solutions to urgent environmental problems, they will find themselves in a double bind: watching the natural world fall apart around them, as political upheaval spreads.

At some point in primary school, you probably learned that humans need oxygen to breathe. You may then have been surprised, somewhere between primary school and reading this article, to discover that each breath we take contains far more nitrogen than oxygen. Nitrogen accounts for 78% of the Earth's atmosphere, and it is perhaps even more surprising that such an abundant element could be one of the greatest sources of pollution worldwide - believed by some to be, after climate change, the most serious environmental challenge we're now facing.

The nitrogen in the atmosphere is, on its own, harmless. But when it reacts with other elements, it can form more unstable compounds, like the gases ammonia or nitrogen dioxide. Small amounts of both have always been found in the environment, but thanks to human activity over the past 75 years, emissions of the two gases have skyrocketed. Burning fossil fuels emits nitrogen dioxide, which pollutes sky, land and sea, and causes, among other health problems, asthma in children.

Another contributor to our global nitrogen problem is the way we farm. In the second half of the 20th century, around the same time that nitrogen dioxide-emitting cars, planes, power plants and factories proliferated, chemical fertilisers containing nitrogen began to be widely used. Such ammonia-based fertilisers helped to massively improve grain yields. But crops typically don't absorb all the fertiliser they're given, because it's hard to know exactly the right amount to apply. So the excess ammonia runs off into waterways, causing a chain of chemical reactions that decrease oxygen levels in the water and result in ""dead zones"", where fish can't live. As fish populations plummet, coastal economies suffer, too.

Beyond nitrogen-rich fertilisers and burning fossil fuels, there is another key source of nitrogen pollution. Intensive livestock farming contributes significantly to the increase in ammonia. If you crowd too many cows into a field, they'll eat all the grass before it can grow back. So farmers prefer to put them in barns and feed them concentrated proteins such as soy, which are between 13% and 19% nitrogen. This has increased milk and beef yields, but again, with environmental costs. A cow's digestive system didn't evolve to absorb so much nitrogen-containing protein, so the animals excrete a large amount of it. When the animal's urine and faeces combine, they form ammonia. (This happens more in barns than in fields, because indoors the cows are standing around in the same place all day, rather than spreading their waste over a wider area, so that it combines less.) As with nitrogen dioxide, ammonia floats into the atmosphere, spreading pollution.

These effects cascade. An excess of nitrogen in the soil sets off a chemical chain reaction that depletes the soil's calcium. Snails use the calcium in soil to form their shells. No calcium, no snails. Snails are, in turn, a crucial source of calcium for birds. Without it, when fledglings try to stand in the nest for the first time, their legs break. That means they won't grow up to spread fertiliser or seeds through their waste, a process crucial for maintaining forests. Nor - bringing the effects of nitrogen pollution full circle, back to farms - will these birds consume insects and rodents that devour crops. Everyone - plants, animals, humans - loses.

Anje and Piet Grin rise well before dawn every morning, don coveralls or trousers, go downstairs, pull on a pair of wellies left by the kitchen door, and head out to their two barns. It's a lifestyle that still holds a firm grip on the Dutch imagination. Even today, many city people have parents or grandparents who are or were farmers, and cherish childhood memories of romping about in open fields under skies out of an old master's landscape painting. In the 20th century, ""cities were developed with the idea of integration with the countryside, to give people plenty of fresh air because they don't have many big parks"", said Geert Mak, who has written several books on Dutch history and culture. More than in many other developed nations, city and country people in the Netherlands have stayed connected, physically and culturally.

Harold Zoet, who raises Welsh ponies and was elected in March to the provincial council of Gelderland on the BBB slate, sees the nitrogen crisis as a manifestation of an emerging divide between urban and rural Dutch. In the Netherlands, and across the world, rural communities have been hollowed out by urbanisation, the mechanisation of farming and plummeting grain prices; and they've felt overlooked by politicians perceived to be part of an urban elite. ""People don't understand what it is to work on the land,"" Zoet told me. As people feel bad about their increasing separation from nature, he believes, they seek policies to protect it, but are oblivious to how those policies affect rural communities.

The Grins' farmland, barely an hour's drive from Amsterdam, was first owned by Piet's parents, who had 30 or 40 cows along with some crops. When Anje and Piet took over in 1984, they ditched the crops and expanded to 100 cows. In 2012 they expanded again to 250, housing them in a new, state-of-the-art barn designed to limit the amount of nitrogen that gets into the atmosphere. Ever since, they've been selling their cows' milk mostly to a cheesemaker in Germany, 60km to the east.

The Grins are in their mid-60s, and none of their five children is interested in taking over the family business. They want to sell the farm and move to a smaller property nearby where they currently keep a few cattle and tend sugar beets. Theirs is a physically demanding job. ""It's very intense,"" Piet said. ""There's a moment when you decide it's enough.""

The Grins' farm is what's known as a piekbelaster - it's on the government's list of 3,000 businesses that ""cause the most nitrogen precipitation on overburdened nitrogen-sensitive Natura 2000 areas"". That makes them eligible to be bought out by the government. The buyout programme is technically voluntary, but it doesn't feel that way to the Grins. ""What does that mean when you are standing in the corner with the gun pointed at you?"" Anje wrote on Facebook in August.

The couple have poured their lives into their farm, and it's their chief asset. But they can't continue as they are, and they cannot sell the farm to a private buyer, because the government will not grant a permit that guarantees that the new owner can continue farming. Without that permit, banks won't grant a loan to any potential buyer. They feel their only option is to accept the government buyout, but that would mean accepting that the barn would be torn down, the animals sold, their life's work erased.

As part of their retirement plan, the Grins hope to raise a small number of cattle for sale. But they've been told that it's a condition of the buyout programme that sellers no longer farm. They worry that even a few cattle would violate this condition. The government has assured them otherwise, but has refused to confirm this by signing a document drawn up by the Grins' lawyer. ""We're very afraid that in five years they'll come back and say: ""˜We made a mistake - you can't have cattle on the second farm.'"" (The agriculture ministry won't discuss individual cases, but says that the buyout programme only bars continued farming at the original location.)

""Farmers want to know they'll still have a good income in 10 or 15 years,"" Zoet said. ""They're looking for a sustainable future."" The Grins, among others, say they can't see it.

Before he became the head of Rabobank's agricultural division in May, Alex Datema was a dairy farmer. He still co-owns the operation where his father and grandfather raised cows, and his family's story encapsulates the remarkable history of Dutch farming over the last 75 years.

In the 1950s, the Netherlands was still recovering from five years of Nazi occupation and the famine that gripped the nation in the final winter of the war. Many of the population were subsistence farmers, with a few cows, a few chickens, some crops, and maybe a pig. Sicco Mansholt, the agriculture minister, decided that the Netherlands could leave behind poverty and hunger by producing enough food to feed itself, rather than relying on imports. Under his proposals, a certain number of farmers would specialise in one product and expand their business, while the government would pay other, smaller farmers to quit. This would mean both that more food could be produced and that the remaining farmers would earn more.

Mansholt's policies did not pay off immediately. In 1960, GDP per capita still barely exceeded $1,000, 23% less than in the UK. But gradually the plan began to work. The number of Dutch farms plummeted - in 1950, there were 410,000 farms among 10 million Dutch people, while today there are only 55,000 in a population of nearly 18 million - and those that remained became increasingly productive. Since 1984, for example, the number of cows per farm has more than doubled.

Datema's father and uncle took advantage of subsidies implemented under Mansholt to build new barns, where more cows could be kept on less land. Their cattle herd doubled and they bought concentrates such as soy to feed them more efficiently. Although Dutch farming thrived, Dutch farmers did not have it easy: today many operate on low margins and under heavy debt burdens. ""Farmers were more or less forced to expand and intensify, because margins on their produce shrank and the banks that financed them also demanded growth and intensification,"" says Caspar van den Berg, a professor of public administration at the University of Groningen.

By 1990, the environmental effects of Mansholt's policies were also becoming clear. A government commission into the country's compliance with its nitrogen emissions targets stated that much more needed to be done. The commission acknowledged that nitrogen reductions would create a drop in income for dairy farmers: a typical farm would lose 10,000 guilders a year (about £3,900 today), or about 20% of per capita GDP at the time.

No one wanted to hear this. Since the 1980s, the Netherlands' coalition governments have almost always included the Christian Democratic Appeal party, which has particular support in rural areas. The party's leader would almost reflexively be appointed to head the agriculture ministry, which was heavily staffed by the sons of farmers. Despite the 1990 commission, the Christian Democrats successfully kept the issue off the table, and the government continued to encourage farmers to invest and expand.

Dairy production jumped further between 2008 and 2015, as the EU phased out its limits on the amount of milk that individual farmers could supply. By 2020, the Netherlands was home to 3.8 million cows, 11.9 million pigs and 90.2 million chickens in an area one-quarter the size of England, giving it the densest livestock population in Europe by far.

Farmers knew, Datema told me, that perhaps one day they'd have to do more to reduce nitrogen emissions. ""But most of them thought, well, if there's legislation, we'll do it - but nobody's really talking about it, besides some people from the environmental groups."" Then, quite suddenly, in 2019, everyone was talking about it.

If the farmers who had driven their tractors to the Malieveld had hoped for a softening of the ""drastic measures"" that Remkes had declared necessary, they were to be disappointed. In June 2020, eight months after the tractor protest, Remkes held a press conference where he released his final report, with Carola Schouten, the agriculture minister, smiling beside him. Nitrogen emissions would need to be halved within the decade.

The brutality of Remkes's demand was the consequence of years of inaction. ""We knew for a long time about the effect of nitrogen on certain habitats,"" Zoet said. ""It's never good to address in such a short term something that built up over a long time.""

To many, the government's proposals to halve emissions seem both harsh and unworkable; â‚¬975m was set aside to buy out piekbelasters like the Grins, and another â‚¬500m to buy and shutter other nitrogen-emitting farms. The funds were to come from a pot of â‚¬25bn for nature restoration, including nitrogen-emissions reduction. But when the cabinet asked the regional governments to come up with nitrogen plans for their own territory, those plans added up to â‚¬58bn.

""If we had started with good legislation 10 years ago,"" Datema adds, ""it would have been much, much easier to solve the problem than it is now.""

The October 2019 protest on the Malieveld didn't catch the attention of the far right. The first appearance at a farmers' protest by Forum for Democracy (FvD), a far-right political party, came four months after the tractor jam. Then Covid hit, and the FvD turned its attention to campaigning against pandemic restrictions and vaccines. But as those restrictions eased and vaccines took effect, and as the farmers' protests grew more violent, the FvD saw an opening. ""Farmer issues lend themselves well to far-right ideology - nostalgia for the past, also their connection to the old Nazi theme of ""˜blood & soil', creating room for the pure white people, all that creepy fascist stuff,"" says LÃ©onie de Jonge, a political scientist at University of Groningen.

As the government scrambled to come up with ways to reduce nitrogen emissions, those on the far right, as well as some politicians and farmer activists, tried to undermine any proposals. In May 2020, the agriculture minister proposed limits on the protein content of animal feed. Her opponents loudly insisted that this would lead to cows producing less milk and a resulting decrease in farmer income. They ignored the fact that, as the minister's press release pointed out, cattle are generally fed more protein than they need, and that the proposed limits were carefully chosen so that milk yields would not suffer.

Conspiracy theorists seized on another part of the press release. Noting the contribution of housing and infrastructure to nitrogen emissions, it stated that ""the government considers it important that the licensing of housing construction ""¦ does not come to a halt"". This statement seems to have been the basis for the idea, which took off on social media, that the government planned to replace Dutch farms with apartment buildings that would be used to house migrants from Turkey and the Middle East. A former FvD candidate was invited on to Tucker Carlson's Fox News programme, where she repeated this same conspiracy theory. (She wore a red bandana, a symbol of support for the protesters, tied around her neck.)

In 2022, as discontent with the government intensified, protesters showed up at the home of Christianne van der Wal, the new minister for nature and nitrogen policy (the element had been given its own cabinet post). Stepping out of her front door to confront the men in her driveway, she told them: ""My children are inside shaking."" Undeterred, the protesters attacked a police van that had been sent to protect her. One night six months later, in a Ku Klux Klan-style protest, a group carried flaming torches to the home of another cabinet minister.

Alongside such violent actions, fierce but peaceful protest against the government continued. Farmers' associations and feed companies supplied farmers with Dutch flags to be flown upside down as a sign of displeasure; along many rural roads, upside down flags were placed every 100 metres or so. Alongside their own upside-down flag, the Grins posted a sign on their lawn reading ""We are fed up with this policy"".

This year, relations between the government and the agricultural sector have deteriorated further. In June, the largest farmers' union dropped out of negotiations for an agreement over nitrogen policy, blaming the government's intransigence. By then, the far right had successfully linked it to the refugee problem. Some rural municipalities wanted to select the nationality of refugees relocated in their communities.

In July, cabinet discussions over reforms to immigration policy collapsed. The government had shuttered all but two of its refugee processing centres; outside the one remaining centre, migrants had slept on the ground and a baby died. This created the impression of a flood of desperate foreigners overwhelming the country. In what many commentators saw as an attempt to appease the right, Rutte argued for tougher restrictions for asylum seekers that would have put the country's immigration policy in contravention of European law and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. None of the other parties in the coalition agreed to his proposals. The cabinet talks ground to a halt, and Rutte announced the dissolution of his cabinet.

A few days later, Rutte said that he would not stand for re-election in November. After 13 years in power, he planned to quit politics altogether.

It doesn't take an expert in public policy or public relations to recognise that the Dutch government has made a mess of the nitrogen issue. Remkes's recommendation for a ""targeted"" approach made piekbelasters such as the Grins feel just that - as if they had targets on their backs.

What could the government have done differently? The dairy industry would like to see more pressure on other sources of nitrogen. While the vast majority of current ammonia emissions in the Netherlands are produced by agriculture, 67% of nitrogen dioxide emissions comes from vehicles, and 24% from industry and energy production. ""The farms are really under the microscope,"" Zoet told me. ""I think the government should do more to make other businesses responsible."" But Remkes's report was clear that nitrogen reduction was not only necessary for farmers. It also targeted the construction industry - another major nitrogen emitter - and proposed other measures, such as lowering the motorway speed limit.

Benjamin Bodirsky, an agricultural economist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, suggested to me that the government could simply tax farmers on the amount of nitrogen they emit. This would both incentivise farmers to emit less nitrogen, and allow them to reduce emissions in the way that suits them best. ""I think you need to leave as much as you can to the farmers themselves and they need to have clarity when it comes to rules of emissions,"" says Franciska de Vries, a professor of earth systems science at University of Amsterdam.

Others see technology as the way forward. That was the main driver of the significant ammonia reductions between 1990 and 2010, which have since levelled out. Zoet is enthusiastic about a new system developed by a Dutch company called Lely, which makes robotic farm equipment. This system separates cattle's waste streams in the barn so that they form less ammonia, then turns much of the ammonia that is formed into fertiliser that the farmer can apply to their own fields with greater precision, so that it doesn't harm protected areas. The company says that the system reduces ammonia emissions by 70%. Farmers could also add enzymes to feed that help cows absorb more of the nitrogen that they eat, so that less is dumped into the environment.

Yet Natasja Oerlemans, head of food and agriculture at WWF Netherlands, dismisses such notions as sticking plasters. ""We need a total rethink of the system,"" she says. She and others point out that it's wildly inefficient to give cattle food such as soy, which is suitable for humans, or to raise them on the kind of land that could instead be producing crops. And if consumers ate more plants, and less meat and dairy, ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions would drop.

There may be no proposal that will satisfy dairy farmers. Any solution for reducing emissions will require either fewer farms, or existing farms to function differently, or both. No solution can guarantee that incomes will be unaffected. As environmental protections become more urgent, it is likely that some people will simply have to change the way they work, just as others might be forced to change how they travel or cook.

But turmoil of the kind seen in the Netherlands might be avoided if politicians act with more care and empathy. Drastic measures may be needed, but it isn't necessarily helpful to frame them as such, or to place stringent demands on already struggling rural communities. How politicians choose to engage with their opponents is as important as the policies themselves - especially today, when misinformation and disinformation spread with unprecedented speed.

On 30 October, Pieter Omtzigt, leader of the centrist New Social Contract party, debated on TV with Frans Timmermans, the head of a new alliance of leftwing parties. The two men organised the event to show that they could work together to lead a coalition government that could freeze out Rutte's centre-right party after the November election. Dutch pundits generally regarded the event as a success for both men, and for their parties.

Even if they lead the votes, the two will almost certainly need to pull in another party, or even two, to get to a majority. BBB, now polling fifth, is in an excellent position to play dealmaker - or spoiler - putting an end to Rutte's party's dominance.

Whoever wins, the next government will face a host of challenges that have become linked to the nitrogen issue. The Netherlands has 122 job openings for every 100 unemployed; the tram service in Amsterdam has been reduced due to staff shortages, and signs outside virtually every shop seek employees. Migrants are eager to take these jobs, but the government doesn't have the capacity to process their applications to stay - and there are few places for them to live because of a nationwide housing shortage, exacerbated by the fact that 18,000 construction projects have been halted, because the government wants to restrict their nitrogen emissions. What seems to be a solution to one problem aggravates the others.

This might seem like so much local politics, but the broad contours can be recognised in political trends elsewhere, from the US to Britain to central Europe to the Indian subcontinent. The 2018 gilets jaunes protests in France originated among rural residents displeased with higher fuel taxes, which fell on them disproportionately because they drive more than the inhabitants of cities. Populist politicians are well placed to pick up votes from segments of society that feel abandoned or discriminated against by the government. Van den Berg, the Groningen professor, spoke of the drop in social cohesion in the Netherlands, with public services, public transport and healthcare provisions whittled away in many rural areas. He thinks voters in those places are jumping from one party to another, desperate for anybody to come along and say the government is the problem. On 5 November, Timmermans said he no longer thought it necessary to stick to the current government's goal to halve nitrogen emissions by 2030.

Though they have been Christian Democrat supporters most of their lives, on 22 November the Grins will be filling in their ballot for the BBB.

This article was amended on 20 November 2023. A previous version said the per capita GDP of the Netherlands in 1960 was 40% lower than that of the UK. It should have said 23% lower. This has been corrected.

Floods, freezes and heatwaves threaten seed production as farmers scramble to produce strains that resist climate chaos

Once upon a not-so-distant time, the growing season for the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Green Things Farm Collective followed a steadfast trajectory.

""We reliably had rainy springs and early summers, then hot and dry in late July and August, with the rains picking up again in September,"" said Stacy Mates, Green Things' seed company manager. ""For a crop like lettuce seed, it was perfect.""

Within this decade, Mates has noticed that the previously familiar cycle ""has changed dramatically. What we've gotten the last three years is drought in June and then torrential rains in July and August,"" causing complete lettuce seed crop failures two years running. This year, after golf ball-sized hail, numerous severe thunderstorms and 75mph winds, a first crop of seed never matured. Mates treated a second crop with kid gloves, trellising the plants and covering them with shade cloth in hopes they'd survive another deluge. By late September, Mates had managed a solid harvest, with enough seed to sell.

Farmers are already fighting many battles in a growing season: beating back powdery mildew on cucumbers, hornworms devouring tomato leaves and strawberries plagued by verticillium rot. But for the farmers who grow the seeds that wind up in our seed packets and undergird our horticultural adventures, production has become ever more difficult.

So difficult, in fact, that Green Things recently decided it would call it quits on growing for seeds. Mates can't say for certain just how much climate change is to blame for production challenges, only that its role is undeniable.

""We are not having normal seasons any more"", said Lane Selman, an agricultural researcher at Oregon State University and founder of a seed-producer community called the Culinary Breeding Network. As the northern hemisphere shakes off its hottest summer on record, intensifying weather events threaten the variety we take for granted when we page through winter-delivered seed catalogues, dreaming of a bountiful spring.

""Every seed company is facing these problems, but they probably wouldn't want to tell you that,"" said Alan Sparks, an industry veteran who consults for Baker Creek Seeds. """"˜We've got everything in control! Everything's gonna be OK!' But it's not OK.""

Green Things, which also grows vegetables, herbs and flowers, produced all the seeds in its catalogue. But many seed companies contract with individual farmers to grow at least some stock. One reason is that some crops need lots of space for a good yield. And not all seeds grow well everywhere. Furthermore, open-pollinated, non-hybrid seeds must be spaced sometimes miles apart - not just from similar varieties on that farm but on its neighbors' farms too - to avoid cross-pollination and ensure they grow true to type. On Mates' half-acre, she stopped growing carrots because they cross with a common weed, Queen Anne's lace.

Seed farmers may grow hybrids or open-pollinated varieties; they do this in many locales, although Selman called the Pacific north-west ""one of the greatest places to grow seed in the world"" because of its (once) reliable weather. Some seed companies contract with farmers in Asia or India, for climatic and cost reasons.

No matter where or how, it's harder to produce seeds than market-ready vegetables. Seed farmers ""have to be trained how to treat the soil, how to keep the plant healthy, when to harvest ""¦ And [seed is] a living product that you have to keep cool and dry"" when you store it, said Sparks. Poor-quality seeds may have lower germination rates or be more susceptible to disease.

Plants grown for seed stay in the ground much longer than food crops. Growing cabbages to eat may require sowing in June and harvesting in October. ""But that only represents a very small portion of a cabbage's lifecycle,"" said Nathaniel Talbot, who raises seed and vegetables at his Deep Harvest Farm on Whidbey Island, Washington.

Know your seed types

Open-pollinated

Open-pollinated seeds are pollinated naturally in the field, where they become adapted to local growing conditions over time. As long as they don't cross-pollinate with other varieties or species, they grow ""true to type"" - that is, with the same characteristics - every year.

Heirloom

Heirlooms are old varieties passed down for generations. All heirlooms are open-pollinated, although not all open-pollinated varieties are heirlooms.

Hybrid

People purposely cross pollen from one variety or species with another to get a third, called a hybrid. The goal may be drought tolerance or pest resistance. Hybrid seeds are considered vigorous, but they don't grow true to type a second year.

A seed cabbage overwinters in the ground and keeps growing the next spring. A biennial plant, cabbage takes two years to bolt - that is, elongate in preparation for flowering. After it's pollinated, the plant produces seed in a narrow pod that looks like a string bean; Talbot handpicks these pods, taps their seeds into a bucket after they've dried on tarps, then arduously removes the chaff by hand. Seed to seed, the process can take 14 months.

""There's a lot more time involved [in raising seeds]. And with more extreme weather sprinkled through our lives, it's a lot more time for things to go wrong,"" said Brian Campbell, co-owner of Uprising Seeds in Bellingham, Washington. In 2021, a heat dome hit the Pacific north-west just as Campbell's cauliflower came into full bloom. The cauliflower survived, but its pollen withered from 100F temperatures. ""We ended up getting no seed from that crop,"" he said.

Jim Gerritsen is an organic farmer in Bridgewater, Maine. He grows 20-plus varieties of organic seed potatoes, for mail-order customers and seed companies like Southern Exposure. After several years of drought, extreme wet is now the problem - although Gerritsen's taken to chiseling up the soil ahead of planting to ""divert rainwater into the subsoil away from the rhizosphere"" where his potatoes are rooting and growing, he said.

Even if his spuds grow well, he still needs dry days for harvesting. ""You dig on a Monday. Then on Tuesday, you get an inch of rain so you're not digging,"" he said. ""You take Wednesday to dry out and then you get back in the field on Thursday; then you get another half inch rain on Friday. You're not digging on Saturday because the ground [needs to] dry out, so maybe you don't get back into the field until Monday. The harvest takes about 15 good days, but in a wet fall it takes [four or more] weeks to find 15 good days to dig in.""

Seed work isn't finished after harvest, either. Broccoli seed, like cabbage seed, dries for a week before it's cleaned and placed in packets. Explained Culinary Breeding Network's Selman: ""During that dry down period, if the seeds get wet, you are completely screwed.""

An heirloom nasturtium offered by Baker Creek, called purple emperor, was developed by a Japanese seed company that for seven years selected plants that consistently produced purple flowers. The first 2.2lbs of seeds yielded another 55lbs in Holland; those were then sent to a farmer in Punjab, India, for bulk production. Recently, Sparks learned that the water table in this ""breadbasket"" region of India is diminishing. On top of floods there in 2021 and a heatwave in 2022, in 2023 there was only a ""30% of harvest [of all seeds] for this growing area,"" he said. ""It could be that in the next 10 years [no one is] able to grow there anymore.""

For large seed companies accustomed to adjusting locations, moving production to less temperamental locales may not be a daunting prospect - although Sparks said that training farmers to raise seed takes time and there's already a critical shortage of people to do the work. But no matter where they live, seed farmers themselves don't have the luxury of relocation. For them, the key to future resiliency is adaptation right where they are. For Mates of the Green Things Farm Collective, that means that more research into both open-pollinated and hybrid seeds is necessary for an uncertain future - and that especially holds true for small-scale and organic farmers. She said that farmers like her need seeds that are disease- and pest-resistant, grow in systems with few chemicals and little tilling, and survive a range of climate fluctuations.

Hybrid varieties are bred for what's called ""vertical"" resistance, to one pest or disease; growers of open-pollinated varieties save seed from plants that have ""horizontal"" resistance, meaning they can withstand a variety of regional stressors. ""As climate change becomes more chaotic - one year's drought might be another year's freeze - we want plants with a resilient enough genetic makeup that they can survive if not thrive in both of those situations,"" Talbot said.

These tenets of open pollination ""are part of the resilience you're talking about"", said Selman. The biggest thing home gardeners purchasing seed can do to help is to ""support local, small, regional seed companies so they don't go away because they are doing incredible work"".

Latest blow to sustainable farming incentive for nature recovery prompts warnings of ""˜tough autumn'

Farmers in England are being left without crucial nature recovery payments and unsure of what to plant after delays to a post-Brexit scheme.

The sustainable farming incentive (SFI) is part of a package of payments that is replacing the EU's common agricultural policy, which paid land managers for the amount of land in their care. The aim of the SFI is to pay farmers to look after nature, soil and other public goods, rather than simply for farming and owning land.

The 2023 scheme was supposed to roll out in August but is being delayed, and farmers are not expected to receive any payments until 2024. Because the rules regarding SFI payments have changed since last year, land managers are unsure whether to continue with the scheme from 2022, or to follow guidance laid out in proposals for the 2023 scheme.

This is the latest blow to the post-Brexit scheme. Last year, only 224 farmers in England received payments under SFI. Just a tiny fraction of the payments went to farmers in 2022. While subsidies were cut by an average of 22% for farmers last year, the money paid out through SFI equated to only 0.44% of the total funding plan for farmers, leaving them asking where the money is going.

This year the cuts are even more stark, with the government planning to slash payments by 36%. This, coupled with a difficult harvest caused by adverse weather conditions and rising interest rates, is causing a squeeze on farms.

David Exwood, the vice-president of the National Farmers' Union, said: ""Farmers in England have had further basic payment scheme reductions. Milk prices are down and prices for red meat are also on the slide.

""It has been the most expensive year we have ever had and a very difficult harvest. It will be a tough autumn for farmers.""

The industry publication Farmers Weekly reported that the IT team managing the scheme had encountered technical problems, leading to further delays.

Alice Groom, the head of sustainable land use policy at the conservation charity the RSPB, said: ""With the proposed August rollout yet to begin we increasingly fear that Defra [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] is at risk of failing on all fronts - leaving farmers confused and with no progress against pressing environmental targets. This is undermining everyone's efforts to produce food while creating space for nature and taking action on climate.

""The UK government needs to step up a gear and show leadership here with a clear roadmap - detailing how ambitious schemes, advice, grants and support will enable all farmers to have profitable, nature positive and low carbon businesses.""

Martin Lines, the UK chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, told Farmers Weekly: ""This continued uncertainty is leaving farmers with the inability to plan their sustainable farming businesses for the future, delivering public goods and food production hand in hand.

""Defra seems to continue to overpromise and underdeliver, leaving farmers in the lurch and making it almost impossible to plan their future through this transition.""

A Defra spokesperson said: ""We are continuing preparations to open SFI 2023 for applications, including final pre-launch tests and adjustments to ensure the process is as straightforward as possible."" A spokesperson said applications will be open from 18 September.

Hawkshead, Lake District: It's always a long but wonderful day, full of vintage tractors, fell running and competitive veg

After a break of five years due to bad weather and Covid-19, the Hawkshead show returned this year to showers and sunshine. Agricultural shows are key events in the Lake District calendar, where locals and visitors meet to share a day of competitions and socialising.

I have many happy memories of showing sheep at Hawkshead, but this year the reduced format meant that there were, sadly, no sheep on the field. Instead, I take the dogs to compete in the dog show. We had had a very successful Ravenstonedale show recently, winning the best small dog and best puppy prizes.

After our entry fee of £1 was paid, we joined the throng of people and their animals waiting for the pet classes. The working dogs were shown first - sheepdogs, terriers and lurchers - followed by the pets. I had entered Elsie, a wire-haired dachshund, in the cutest puppy class. We did not win this time, but Elsie enjoyed herself meeting all the other dogs and I enjoyed chatting to other farmers.

We then sat in the back of the Land Rover to eat our sandwiches. The sounds of the show swirled around us, the Tannoy announcing fell runners coming into the field (""Here's a local runner coming in, in third place!"") and calling people for competitions (""Can we please have the remaining competitors for the mounted fancy dress pony class to the ring now? And don't forget the tug-of-war later today."") Small children ran past with water pistols, shooting each other and screaming with delight.

Shows can be long days; I have been known to have a quick sleep in the Land Rover after lunch, but today I was straight back into the show to look at the vintage tractors lining one side of the fields, and the industrial classes in the barn. There were some wonderful felted sheep in the craft section, and an array of vegetables grown locally. I studied the rhubarb closely as I have a lot in my garden. What makes a winner? Big thick stalks and having the leaves left on seemed to be important to my untrained eye. Maybe I could enter rhubarb into local competitions in the future.

I'm not generally competitive, but where there are marquees, rosettes and other farmers to beat, it does bring out a desire to do well.

Their fight for diversity and inclusion in farming culture echoes the womyn's land movement from the 60s and 70s

At Ashokra farm in New Mexico, in the heart of Albuquerque's fertile North Valley, lush fields of kabocha squash and heirloom corn grow alongside beds of tomatoes, onions and 13 varieties of okra. The team's four farmers tend four fields spread across two and a half acres of leased plots on private residences and in a community garden, hauling their tools between each field in a mobile shed.

But the bountiful harvest is only one of Ashokra's goals. As a queer-, trans- and people-of-color-owned vegetable farm, Ashokra is ""trying to embody values and create a space that we haven't seen on farms that we've worked at"", says farmer Anita Adalja. ""A place where we have dignity, where we can feel safe, where we can feel like we can be our authentic selves"", protected from the threats of homophobia, transphobia, racism and sexism.

In their past work experiences, Adalja and their colleagues have each faced discrimination - either as queer farmers or people of color. Sometimes, that came in the form of being demeaned by owners who didn't respect their skills or who took their photo for promotional purposes; other times it came in the shape of co-workers using racial slurs. At Ashokra, they're trying to challenge the structures that permitted those abuses: by caring as deeply for the land as they do for one another, implementing a zero-tolerance policy for abusive language and adopting a nonhierarchical structure.

The farmers at Ashokra are not alone in that desire. Queer farmers across the country - and throughout history - have long tried to access land where they can live out their values. But that aim is often complicated by issues of safety and access to capital, which is why many queer farmers have come together to collaboratively challenge the structure of the traditional family farm.

In the 1960s and 70s, as the women's liberation, gay rights and environmental movements took off across the US, thousands of women moved out on to the land to form more than 150 lesbian separatist communities. Sometimes called womyn's land, lesbian land or landdyke settlements, many of these groups aimed to form communities away from men and the patriarchal and heteronormative structures that governed society. Although many of these spaces still exist today - like Huntington Open Women's Land in Vermont, Outland in New Mexico, Alapine in Florida and the Oregon Women's Land Trust just south of Portland - their history is not well known, even within the queer community.

These farmers were ""really trying to live their values"", said Jaclyn ""Jac"" Wypler, a sociologist and farmer who wrote their dissertation on modern lesbian and queer farms in the midwest. Today, a new generation of queer farmers, like the team at Ashokra, are continuing to organize community farms around shared values, like a commitment to anti-capitalism, cooperative living and each other's safety. But queer farmers can struggle to access land for a variety of reasons, including being estranged from their biological families and cut off from generational wealth or not being counted by government agricultural censuses.

While they were writing their dissertation, Wypler observed that some queer farmers had managed to acquire land through family or by buying property later in life. But many younger farmers ""were renting land, were working on other people's land and really struggling to secure land access"", in part because the wages paid to farmworkers are typically not enough to allow them to save up and buy their own land.

Although the US Department of Agriculture offers grants and programs to members of certain communities that have been excluded from farming in the past, Wypler says the department ""historically has been very verbal about saying queer farmers are not part of a special category"" and collects no data on sexual orientation or gender identity. ""When you're not even measuring queer farmers, how could you ever recognize that they have struggles around not having access to land because they've been disowned by their families or the issues around where you can feel safe?""

Although there is no formal measure of the number of LGBTQ-owned and operated farms in the US, Wypler says there are some studies that have tried to approximate their prevalence. In its 2022 survey, the National Young Farmers Coalition found that ""24.2% of young farmers identify as a sexuality other than heterosexual"", but only surveyed farmers under the age of 40. A separate 2019 study used data from the USDA census of agriculture to identify the number of farms owned by men married to men or women married to women, but the study's authors emphasized that further refinement of the census is needed.

In the absence of government or institutional support, many queer farmers have devised alternative models for accessing land by working with one another.

In the 1990s, lesbian organizers came together to found Lesbian Natural Resources, a non-profit committed to helping lesbians obtain and maintain community land, at a time when lesbian couples had few legal rights. In the 2000s, farmers Nett Hart, Barbara Holmes, Terri Carver and Lisa Pierce co-authored the pamphlet On Our Own Terms, a guide to access, ownership, conservation and transfer of lesbian lands with chapters on ways to finance land, hold title to land and structure farm enterprises, among others.

At Humble Hands Harvest, a small organic farm near Decorah, Iowa, known for hosting the Queer Farmer Convergence, Hannah Breckbill and her colleagues - not all of whom are queer - are experimenting with a new system they call the Commons.

In 2014, Breckbill was farming on rented land in Decorah when a parcel of land came available. Worried that it might be bought up and turned into a hog confinement, Breckbill and her neighbors quickly organized to buy the land together. Breckbill started imagining what it would look like if she started a diversified vegetable farm on it. When she voiced an interest in buying the land back from the community for her own farm, a few of the shareholders gave their shares to her. Today, Breckbill calls that chunk of capital the Commons. ""It belongs to the farm and the community, and what the farm is doing in the community,"" she said.

Breckbill and her co-owner are working to transform Humble Hands Harvest into a worker-owned co-op, and are using the Commons to make buying into the co-op more affordable and sustainable. If either of them ever leave the farm, the money they've each invested will become a loan that the farm will need to pay back over time. But the capital that was given to them will stay with the farm, and its future owners. It's an attempt, Breckbill says, to help them survive in a capitalist system while still challenging the idea of profiting from land ownership.

Meanwhile, Rock Steady farm, a queer-owned and operated cooperative vegetable farm in Millerton, New York, launched in 2015 with a rolling 10-year lease. Rock Steady was able to acquire that first lease, says Maggie Cheney, the farm's general manager and owner, with a loan from Seed Commons, a non-extractive lending institution that funds cooperatives. Currently, Rock Steady is in the process of negotiating its next lease, which it hopes will be for an even longer term and eventually transition to a community land trust.

For ""a lot of marginalized folks who don't have access to capital, the thought of owning land is quite intimidating"", said Cheney. Farmland prices across the US vary but range anywhere from about $1,000 to $13,000 an acre. On top of that, production expenses - like the cost of labor, machinery, fuel, seeds and fertilizer - average about $182,000 a year per farm, according to the USDA. But at the same time, ""there's a real emotional draw to owning land, especially for Black and brown Indigenous people."" To that end, Cheney says, Rock Steady has learned how to operate as a cooperative ""from other marginalized communities who have been facing similar issues,"" like the Black sharecroppers who pooled their resources and pioneered the cooperative model with projects like Fannie Lou Hamer's Freedom Farm Cooperative.

Alongside their work at Ashokra, Adalja is also the founder and program manager of Not Our Farm, an online storytelling project that they started in 2019 to ""uplift and share stories of workers on farms not their own"".

""It's not just about their joys, their triumphs, their harvest. What Not Our Farm has started to do is highlight abuses that happen on farms,"" like inconsistent access to bathrooms, earnings far below the minimum wage and the discrimination that many queer, women and POC farmers face daily, said Adalja. ""There's so much of this country that is arable, beautiful farmland, but that's not safe for us to even be there"" as Bipoc queer and trans people. ""Farming in collectives is not just about the ease of farming and sharing resources, it's about safety too.""

Not Our Farm also gives space for farm workers to share the characteristics of their ""dream farm"", or what could keep them farming even if they never own their own land.

In many ways, it's an echo of the utopian goals of the womyn's land movement.

From farms that place an emphasis on biodiversity to owners who provide health insurance and safe housing, Adalja says that ""hearing what people share has been really, really beautiful"".

Leader says agriculture needs ""˜fundamental transformation' and makes hitting grain targets a priority as country isolated by sanctions struggles

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has urged government officials to engineer a ""fundamental transformation"" in agricultural production, state media reported, amid fears that the country's food shortage is worsening.

Kim said hitting grain production targets this year was a priority and emphasised the importance of stable agriculture production during the second day of a key meeting of the Workers' party, the state news agency KCNA said on Tuesday.

The report did not elaborate on what measures North Korea would take, but Kim said the changes needed to happen in the next few years.

Kim's remark comes amid reports of growing food shortages in the country, though North Korea has denied suggestions that it cannot provide for its citizens.

Collective farms account for the vast majority of North Korea's agriculture, according to researchers. Such farms typically host multiple small farmers who produce crops with joint labour.

Earlier this month, South Korea's Unification Ministry said the food situation in the North ""seemed to have deteriorated"".

The ministry said at the time that it was rare for North Korea to announce a special meeting on agriculture strategy, which was slated for late February.

In his address at Monday's meeting, KCNA said Kim mentioned the ""importance of the growth of the agricultural productive forces"" in ensuring socialist construction.

North Korea is under strict international sanctions over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, and its economy has been further strained by strict self-imposed border lockdowns aimed at stopping Covid-19 outbreaks.

The full extent of the food shortages in North Korea is unclear, but in a January report, the US-based monitoring project 38 North said that food insecurity was at its worst since famines that devastated the country in the 1990s.

""Food availability has likely fallen below the bare minimum with regard to human needs,"" the report said.

North Korea's pursuit of self-sufficiency means almost all its grain is produced domestically, but that has left the country vulnerable, 38 North found.

""Achieving adequate agricultural output in North Korea's unfavourable soils has, ironically, generated a heavy reliance on imported goods and left the country exposed to global shocks, diplomatic conflicts, and adverse weather,"" the report said.

The long-term solution to the problems lies partly in resolving the standoff over nuclear weapons and sanctions, but also requires economic reforms.

The initiation of domestic economic reforms would unshackle North Korea's productive capacity and allow it to export industrial products and tradable services, earn foreign exchange and import bulk grains on a commercially sustainable basis, 38 North said.

Fertiliser use on key crops down more than a quarter on 2010-19 average, while yields increased 2.4%

Britain's farmers increased their yields of major crops last year despite significant reductions in fertiliser use, according to research.

Making artificial fertilisers relies on natural gas, the price of which rose sharply last year after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Fertiliser prices more than tripled, from £233 a tonne in 2020 to £766 a tonne in 2022, which farmers say led to a reduction in their use.

Data from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) published last week revealed that for key crops - wheat, barley, oilseed rape and sugar beet - fertiliser use decreased by an average of 27% compared with the 2010-19 average. Despite this, yields of those crops were 2.4% above average compared with the same period.

An exception to the trend was the 10% increase in the use of fertilisers in the cultivation of potatoes, with a 8.6% reduction in yield.

Fertiliser use in agriculture is a major cause of pollution. In 2022, Defra found that pressure from agriculture accounted for 40% of pollution in inland water bodies. They estimated that 50% of nitrate pollution, 25% of phosphorus in the water environment and 75% of sediment pollution came from agriculture.

Martin Lines, the chief executive of the Nature Friendly Farming Network (NFFN), a group of farmers who campaign for sustainability in the industry, said the data showed how reduced fertiliser usage ""can bring big benefits to the business and beyond"".

While the ""alarming"" price rises of fertiliser came as a ""real shock"" to farmers, Lines said, the minimal impact on yield was unsurprising. ""We know that a lot of fertiliser applied to fields in the UK is not taken up by the crop, and instead gets washed into rivers and streams.""

David Lord, an arable farmer based in Essex, described the move towards natural fertilisation methods as ""definitely driven by economics"". He said he had reduced nitrogen usage by approximately 30% in the last decade, and believed that the recent gas crisis had forced farmers to become more environmentally efficient.

""People are learning that using less fertiliser opens up the opportunity to try more nature-friendly methods,"" Lord said. ""Artificial fertilisers have a cost to us as growers, but also to the climate.""

Artificial fertilisers can also be detrimental to plants, according to Andrew Mahon, an arable farmer in Bedfordshire. Having reduced his use of artificial nitrogen by 15%, Mahon likened nitrogen fertilisers to ""drinking four espressos in the morning. It gets you buzzing, and you get that comedown afterwards. And it leaves plants more prone to disease"".

Although decreased fertiliser use appeared to have little impact on yield in 2022, Lord and Mahon acknowledged that last year's harvest was an anomaly. Mahon said: ""Crops were pretty good last year and there was so much sunlight. That is what drove yield last year.""

""It's really hard to make a statement from one year,"" Lord said. ""Plants managed to perform a lot better than they do normally.""

Both Lord and Mahon expressed the importance of using nitrogen for fertilisation. Lord described nitrogen fertiliser as ""essential to growing consistent live food"" for farmers, but admitted that there was a need to use less of it.

Lord said the ""crackdown"" on urea by the government had been frustrating for farmers. ""Urea is a really important product,"" he said. ""If we didn't have it, it would be more harmful for the climate.""

In 2022, the government announced that the use of untreated urea would be restricted from 15 January to the end of March each year.

The move away from artificial fertilisation had led to a return to mixed farming methods among farmers, Lord and Mahon said. This includes livestock farming, which is the best way of cycling nutrients into soil, according to Lord, which he said was one way farmers could ""decrease usage [of artificial fertiliser] without actually impacting production"".

This article was amended on 31 July 2023. A previous version stated that ""fertiliser prices almost tripled from £233 a tonne in 2020 to £766 a tonne in 2022""; however, £766 is more than triple £233.

Some farmers are concerned campaigners do not fully understand how the countryside works

When Bizza Walters is out working on her Warwickshire farm, she often sees people strolling around the patchwork fields, looking at her fluffy sheep.

The 25-year-old is a fourth generation farmer on 500 acres of English countryside, and she likes that visitors to the area enjoy using their farm for a walk.

However, a campaign for the right to roam across the countryside has concerned her. In recent years, thousands of people have taken part in mass trespasses, arguing that many people in England do not enjoy access to nature, or the rights that those across the border in Scotland enjoy.

In England, just 8% of the countryside is open access - including the coastal path, moorland, mountains, heaths, downs and commons, and footpaths that crisscross the countryside. The situation is similar in Wales, and in Northern Ireland there is hardly any access at all as it is not under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act. Politicians have been pushing for a Right to Roam Act to pass in parliament, arguing that people do not get to have ""immersion in wild nature"" with the limited footpaths available. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, proposed her own bill to widen access, and said people are now confronted with fences and barbed wire when trying to access the countryside.

But Walters, whose farm is a mixture of livestock and arable, is concerned that further access rights would harm the family business.

""A large hotel borders the farm so we have a lot of people walking about both on and off the footpaths,"" she said. ""Right to roam wouldn't necessarily be the right way to go as we have livestock and crops in fields and we have people walking across them and it has an impact on food production and the countryside. Gates are left open and crops are destroyed. We also have wild birdseed down for the flora and fauna and people walking through can disturb them.""

Walters, who enjoys rambling in the countryside herself, is conscious of how some farmers are perceived: ""I don't want to be a typical farmer who says ""˜get off my land'. I want people to enjoy the countryside.""

She campaigns to keep farms accessible to the public, with clear signs and accessible footpaths, and does demonstrations during lambing season for the hotel guests next door.

But a minority of guests are disrespectful, she says, and wander off the footpaths. She is also concerned about dogs. A dog-lover, Walters has a sheepdog, Dougal, who accompanies her all day at work. But she fears a right to roam would encourage irresponsible dog owners to descend on the countryside with untrained, off-lead animals.

""We had quite a bad dog attack in a field without a footpath at all where quite a lot of livestock died. We care hugely about our animals and when you have one that's been torn apart by dogs, the welfare of the animal really upsets us,"" she said.

Another common complaint from farmers is that walkers often leave gates open: ""We have about 600 sheep on the farm and we spend all day separating them into different flocks and when people leave the gate open it is just so time consuming for the business to have to round them back up again.""

She sums up her views on right to roam: ""At the end of the day, [farming is] a business and we have to make a profit off it,"" she said.

""˜Reconnecting to land is a win for everyone'

Though farmers often see themselves as custodians of the environment - and many actively try to improve their land for nature - the UK's biodiversity has been in severe decline for decades, in large part because of the impact of intensive agriculture.

The government reformed the EU's common agricultural policy in England to pay farmers to give space for nature. Campaigners think these payments could include a scheme to encourage farmers to give people more access to nature, by improving or adding pathways and educating the public about the nature on the farm.

Amy-Jane Beer, who runs the landowners' working group for the Right to Roam campaign, said: ""We see reconnecting to land through responsible access as a win for everyone, including farmers, who face increasing isolation from local communities. Reconnecting with the land also means reconnecting with those who work there. When people can access land they can learn what responsibility means in practice.""

The campaign believes that access to nature is important in the fight against biodiversity decline, as people won't always protect what they don't know and love.

The barrister turned farmer Sarah Langford has a mixed farm in Suffolk, which she has spent a long time converting to organic.

She has footpaths across her land but finds the current law confusing: ""We do have a bananas right of way that takes you across a margin, through a crop, to join another margin, then through the crop again and then join the margin you just left. We tried to change the right of way so instead of three sides of a square it took you all across the margin, but it would have cost us thousands of pounds.""

Instead, Langford supports widened access to nature: ""I am very convinced that we need greater access to the countryside and that there is plenty of research to the benefit to people's physical or mental health.""

Rather than restricting people to footpaths, she thinks they should use the margins of fields that are set aside for access and nature: ""Because we have just gone organic we have changed three large East Anglian fields into six, but we have deliberately put big hedgerows and fat paths on the margins. I am very enthusiastic about people foraging in the hedgerows for blackberries.""

But alongside a right to roam, Langford thinks that the public needs to be educated about how to enjoy the countryside in a respectful way.

""We talk collectively quite a lot about rights without the mirror of that which are responsibilities,"" she said. ""I think there is an absence of a public information campaign about everybody's responsibilities in the country, from landowner to farmer to walker.""

She added: ""I don't think I would advocate open access without a corresponding information campaign.""

Langford cites ""common sense stuff"" that if you grew up in the countryside you know about, such as closing gates and keeping dogs under control.

""In London or in any city you can do what you want and don't have to worry about it. You can leave a door open, a gate open, drop a crisp packet, behave without consequence with a system that's set to clean up your mess. The countryside doesn't have that. How can they know that leaving a gate open will cause six hours of work for the farmer who has to round their sheep up?""

But as someone who is evangelical about nature-friendly farming, Langford wants people to be able to see the benefits. ""We've made a huge increase in our bird population and it's a great joy to be able to share that with the people who live around it, because their joy gives me joy,"" she said.

Social connection is ""˜one of the strongest protective factors' against mental ill-health and, for farmers, livestock sales are the biggest meeting point

The crackly drone of an auctioneer barking through a megaphone cuts through the mooing and commotion of the cattle. Dung and dust hangs heavy in the air, baking under a harsh mid-morning sun. It's sale day.

At Warwick, one of the largest saleyards on Queensland's Darling Downs, hundreds of steel pens brim with animals ready for auction.

A dozen eager buyers follow whoever holds the megaphone through a series of steel catwalks and concrete walkways that overlook the pens of cattle.

But retired farmer Milton Rippingale stands on the periphery. ""I'm just looking today,"" he says. Rippingale sold his first cow in 1956 for £38. He has come to the Warwick saleyards every week since.

""For old blokes like us, it's something for us to look forward to,"" he says. ""It's my day out.""

It is a scene repeated at saleyards across the country. Chiefly a place of business, they also play an important social role.

""You get to know a lot of people at the saleyards,"" Rippingale says. ""There are some very good people and there are some absolute bloody grubs.""

Also watching the action is Jim Kane, a retired farmer. Kane and Rippingale met at the yards two decades ago, and spend each sale day catching up. ""Oh, we get along all right,"" Kane says.

Semi-retired farmer Peter Mutch is still in the business of buying and selling but he is waiting for the steer auctions, which are held last.

In the meantime, he says, he will ""chat about the weather, price of cattle, and whatever you want to have a yarn about"".

The executive officer of the Australian Livestock Markets Association (Alma), Stephanie Whitaker, says sale day is one of the few opportunities for farmers, who spend most of their time working alone on isolated properties, to socialise.

""When it isn't raining or the market is really bad, or there are floods, farmers can talk about it at the yards,"" she says. ""They know they aren't alone and that helps them to deal with things - the burden is shared.""

Last year, Alma commissioned research to measure the social value of saleyards in rural communities.

Almost all the participants in the research say the saleyards are a place to connect with others and three-quarters said they were useful for information sharing and learning.

""I remember one man saying, ""˜It's just like a men's shed but with no commitment',"" Whitaker says. ""He has got all the benefits of meeting and mixing and having that sense of belonging and purpose with people at the sale ""¦ but it's all care, no responsibility.""

Whitaker says the core economic function of saleyards means people have a reason to attend, even if they are just there to catch up with friends.

""Its got a sense of business. It's not frivolous,"" she says ""You could say well, it's not really about catching up with mates, but the catch up is a really great side-effect.""

Heather Ellis, who authored the report, says they provide a place of intergenerational connection.

""Younger producers I interviewed were going there to learn from older farmers,"" Ellis says. ""Older members of the community are able to share knowledge about drought, livestock management of weed eradication - that makes them feel valued.""

But Ellis says the male-dominated industry needs to make that same culture accessible to women.

""There's been women getting elbowed while trying to bid for cattle,"" Ellis says. One female stock agent Ellis interviewed loved the industry but only lasted a year. ""She ended up completely broken - in terms of not being accepted,"" she says.

The director of the Queensland Centre for Mental Health Research, Prof Harvey Whiteford, says social connectedness is ""one of the strongest protective factors against developing mental health problems, with poorer mental health and lack of access to services common in the bush"".

Farmers may not explicitly attend the sales for their mental health ""but they are talking to their peers, sharing stories and building that connectedness"", he says.

Budding farmer Jack Callanan watches the bidding closely.

As the bidding roles on at Warwick, semi-retired farmer Peter Mikkelsen watches on from the catwalk. He moved into town a few years ago. He still has a few cattle, but sells them directly to abattoirs. He says he is here to watch the market but doesn't mind a chat, either.

""We talk about the rain if there has been any, and drought when it hits"" Mikkelsen says. ""We are a bit old to be talking about anything else, like girlfriends.""

And they all know they will be back next week. ""We say: ""˜I'll see you at the next sale',"" he says. ""That's just how it works.""

While most animal sacrifice is now organised by charities, some still prefer to fulfil religious obligation in their own back yard, and rely on the ambiguity of NSW law

As Mohammed loads a sheep into a van, to be taken to his home where it will be slaughtered in his back yard, the themes of Eid al-Adha become a lived reality for him, his family and his friends.

""This is a tradition rooted in Abrahamic foundations - doing it by your own hands is an embodied practice,"" the Sydney man says, standing in the cold in his uncle's back yard in western Sydney.

""It's about maintaining our traditions, our culture.""

Mohammed's name has been changed to protect his identity, as he is uncertain whether some of the rituals around halal hand-slaughtering meet the regulations around the slaughter of livestock.

Traditionally, Eid al-Adha is celebrated to mark the end of the hajj pilgrimage and to honour the prophet Abraham.

According to Islamic teachings, Abraham was instructed to sacrifice his son Ismael to Allah, in a test of faith.

God then replaced Ismael with a sheep just before the sacrifice was to take place. Muslims mark the day by also sacrificing livestock and distributing the meat, known as qurban, to family, friends and as charity.

In Australia, this process has mostly been organised by major Muslim charities, due to the regulations around livestock slaughter.

The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act says it is an offence to commit an act of aggravated cruelty against an animal that results in its death.

But the Act provides for a defence if the slaughter is carried out ""in accordance with the precepts of the Jewish religion or of any other religion"".

Mohammed does not stun the sheep he slaughters, in accordance with traditional Halal standards.

He denies the process, which involves using a sharp knife to cut the carotid artery, jugular vein and windpipe in a single swipe, causes the animal any pain. He believes the practice creates more respect for the animals.

""We have such a divorced view of the animals we consume; the meat just seems to turn up at the supermarket, already packaged, clean, wrapped and everything,"" he says.

""But doing this practice builds that connection and respect for the animal you're about to consume.

""And the fact that we will distribute the meat ourselves to those in need shows that these rituals are about making sure the community is fed as well.""

It's a sentiment echoed by Ibrahim, another Muslim who continues the practice, and whose name has also been changed to protect his identity.

Ibrahim and his friends carefully slaughtered two sheep in his backyard in western Sydney to mark the celebration, his mother watching on from the balcony.

""We're doing this to revive the tradition, to bring back the true celebration of Eid al-Adha, and to maintain our connection to our traditions.

""As far as I'm concerned, it's not illegal to feed your family.""

Asif Sana, the director of programs at Islamic Relief Australia, says the community is shifting towards depending on registered charities to organise their qurban.

""The demand for such programs is increasing, but it's still around 50-50 here. Lots of people still organise or do it themselves, but things are changing.

""The younger generation, the ones who were born here and who studied here, they lean more into charities such as ours. But the older generation do sometimes prefer to do it their way,"" he says.

Many families prefer to arrange for their qurban via a network of providers and distributors, often members of extended family who organise the slaughter.

But some still prefer to do it the way Ibrahim and Mohammed have: slaughtering the animals themselves, with both families portioning part of the meat for themselves, and distributing the rest via trusted networks to low-income families.

Lisa Ryan, regional campaigns manager at Animal Liberation NSW, says backyard slaughter, particularly of animals that have not been stunned, risks increased ""fear and pain"".

""Evidenced science tells us that animals as sentient beings feel extreme stress and fear leading up to and during all slaughter practices. We contend that undertaking any activity, be it slaughter or a routine husbandry practice, on an animal that knowingly causes pain and suffering, is animal cruelty.

""Animal Liberation is opposed to all backyard slaughtering regardless of who is undertaking the slaughtering. While many Australian slaughterhouses have been exposed for animal cruelty, there is a much increased risk of animal pain and suffering in an unregulated backyard environment.""

The RSPCA advises on its website against home slaughter, saying religious practices do not fulfil their standards for humane slaughter.

""Inexperienced persons slaughtering an animal, for example in the form of a religious sacrifice or during home slaughter, does not fulfil our expectations for humane slaughter. The RSPCA strongly condemns such practices.""

The NSW minister for multiculturalism, Steve Kamper, said religious practices were encouraged, provided they complied with existing laws.

""The NSW government encourages people to practise their religious traditions. However, there is an expectation these practices comply with the state's laws,"" he said.

A representative of the NSW Department of Primary Industries said it was not technically illegal to slaughter livestock at home, provided animal welfare considerations and biosecurity concerns were met.

""When animals are intended to be slaughtered, individuals must ensure that the animal is not caused unnecessary pain, suffering or injury through use of properly approved stunning and slaughtering methods.

""The person slaughtering the animal must have ""˜the appropriate level of competence to do so without causing any avoidable pain, distress or suffering'.""

Ibrahim says he abided by halal standards in slaughtering the sheep, ensuring they were prayed on, were not distressed and bled out quickly.

""This ritual is thousands of years old, older than Islam, and humans have been eating meat for longer still. We ensure it all happens very quickly and the animal feels minimal pain,"" Ibrahim says, as his friends clean the carcass while it hangs from a Hills hoist.

""It all happened in less than a minute - the sheep didn't struggle, only one person had to be there, we didn't even need to tie it up.""

114,"British cows could be given ""˜methane blockers' to cut climate emissions","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/02/british-cows-could-be-given-methane-blockers-to-cut-carbon-emissions","British cows could be given ""˜methane blockers' to cut climate emissions

UK's 9.4m cattle contribute to 14% of human-related emissions, mostly from belching, but green groups remain sceptical

Cows in the UK could be given ""methane blockers"" to reduce their emissions of the greenhouse gas as part of plans to achieve the country's climate goals.

Farmers welcomed the proposal, which follows a consultation that began in August on how new types of animal feed product can reduce digestive emissions from the animals.

However, green campaigners were sceptical, arguing that the move would not address the other major environmental harms resulting from the beef and dairy industries and showed a fixation on ""techno fixes"" rather than reducing consumption.

There are about 9.4m cows and calves in the UK. Methane from cattle burps and manure is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions; globally, cows and other farm animals are responsible for about 14% of human-induced climate emissions.

The government said in its net zero growth strategy published last week that it expected ""high-efficacy methane-suppressing products"" to enter the market from 2025 and could force farmers to use them if they prove effective.

It said: ""We ""¦ will explore the role of industry and government to maximise uptake of such products for suitable cattle farm systems at pace, through a phased approach.

""This will include the ambition to mandate the introduction of products with proven safety and efficacy in compound feeds for cattle as soon as practically possible in England.""

Tom Bradshaw, deputy president of the National Farmers' Union (NFU), said most of the methane emitted by cows is released by belching, ""the front end rather than the back end"". ""The evidence suggests these products could be useful,"" he said. ""I don't think we know enough yet about the impact they will have on the efficiency of the diet ""¦ but it's something that we have to investigate to try and reduce methane emissions.""

Methane-suppressing products are being trialled in the UK, he said, but have yet to yield evidence as to what extent they work.

The government has been criticised for a reliance on unproven technologies to pursue its climate goals. One group of 700 scientists criticised last week's net zero strategy for its emphasis on carbon capture and storage, which they said was ""yet to be proved at scale"".

Vicki Hird, head of farming for Sustain, an alliance of organisations that promote better food and farming, was similarly sceptical of the methane blocker plan. ""Governments and industry love their techno fixes like cattle feed methane suppressants and these may help a bit.

""But they won't fix the major harms associated with our huge livestock fixation, from rainforest clearance for feeds and pasture to UK river pollution and harm to wildlife, all of which inhibit action on climate, too. We need to produce and eat less and better meat using agro-ecological tools known for whole farm and nature benefits.""

The Food Standards Agency is responsible for licensing all animal feeds and would have to carry out a robust risk assessments of the impacts of each additive on animal health and welfare, food safety risks, risk to workers, wider environmental risks, and of the efficacy of the products, before licensing them for use in feed to reduce methane, according to the NFU.

At the moment, there are no additives licensed and available for use in the UK that suppress methane. However, applications have been submitted while the trials are conducted.

Bradshaw also pointed to genetic advances, namely breeding cows and sheep that emit less methane. Some countries, such as New Zealand, say they have reduced methane emissions from cattle through genetics.

A government spokesperson said: ""Well-managed livestock can provide various environmental benefits and we plan to encourage the uptake of high-efficacy methane-suppressing products once they reach the UK market.""

The government is yet to publish its response to the consultation of the farming industry, scientists and the public on cattle feed.

This article was amended on 3 April 2023 because an earlier version suggested that cows in the UK produce 14% of human-related emissions; that figure relates to emissions by cows and other farm animals across the globe.

Exclusive: Previously unpublished records show millions of animals traded over long distances between European countries or exported globally

Previously unpublished records have revealed evidence about the EU's role in the controversial trade in live farm animals, with millions of livestock being transported across Europe and internationally on long distance journeys condemned by campaigners.

The documents, which are copies of official planning records known as animal journey logs, reveal for the first time granular details of the journeys of more than 180,000 consignments of EU cattle, pigs, sheep and other species over a 19-month period between 2021 and 2023.

Millions of livestock were trucked, shipped and flown on lengthy journeys lasting eight hours or more, the records show, with many spanning days or even weeks. The animals were traded between European countries or exported globally for breeding, fattening and slaughter purposes.

Campaigners say such lengthy transport times are cruel and unnecessary, citing overcrowding, exhaustion, dehydration and stress as key factors affecting livestock health and welfare. Concerns over disease spread have also been raised.

The findings, which are published today as part of a wider report compiled by the pressure groups Compassion in World Farming and Eurogroup For Animals, come as EU officials prepare to announce proposals early next month for amending regulations relating to the live transport of farm animals.

The report calls for an embargo on EU farm animals being exported outside the bloc, strict limits on journey times between EU nations, and the outlawing of the live transport of unweaned livestock.

Peter Stevenson, chief policy adviser at Compassion in World Farming and the report's lead author, said: ""Although we knew that millions of animals were enduring cruel and unnecessary journeys in the name of profit this report shows that the situation is far worse than we had feared. The EU must address this as a matter of urgency.""

Reineke Hameleers, CEO of Eurogroup for Animals, called for a transition towards a trade in meat and carcasses, rather than live animals, saying the ""transnational nature of live exports makes it challenging to protect the welfare of animals"".

Anja Hazekamp, a Dutch MEP, said she was shocked at the findings. ""It is unsustainable to keep as many animals as we do in the European Union. We cause a lot of problems for animal welfare, climate, biodiversity and for human health.

""We need to eliminate long distance transport, rather than transporting animals all over Europe and to the other side of the world. It is ridiculous that animals are sent as far as Brazil and Colombia.""

The European Commission said it had been working to improve animal welfare for over 40 years, ""progressively improving the lives of animals and adopting welfare standards in legislation that are amongst the highest in the world"".

It added: ""Animal welfare is and will remain a priority for the commission. An example of that is the adoption in early 2023 of new rules on the transport of animals by sea. The Farm to Fork strategy foresees a revision of the EU's animal welfare legislation. This preparatory work is ongoing, covering legislation for the welfare of animals at farm level, during transport, at the time of killing and to establish a voluntary European label for animal welfare.""

They said the proposal on the protection of animals during transport, one of the four legs of the legislation, was the most advanced and would be presented in December 2023.

Researchers used animal journey logs, trade figures, freedom of information requests, satellite mapping and maritime data to compile a comprehensive overview of livestock journeys. They found that 44 million farm animals annually were transported between EU member states and exported internationally, many of them on long distance journeys lasting eight hours or more.

That represents a small but significant fraction of the 1.6 billion live animals, many of them chickens, that are believed to be moved within the EU and internationally each year. Some estimates have suggested that as many as 5 million farm animals are in transit on any given day worldwide.

The trade is flourishing owing to the rising demand for meat in some parts of the world: European companies are cashing in on the need to stock farms in countries such as Libya and Vietnam with breeding and fattening animals. For some countries - including Spain, Denmark, Ireland and Romania - livestock export is a key part of the farming economy.

The closure of abattoirs and increased consolidation within the meat processing sector has also resulted in longer transports within Europe.

The Middle East and north Africa are key markets for sheep, while some animals are transported as far as Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan by road, a journey that can take several weeks.

Recommendations published last year by the European Food Safety Authority (EFfSA), identified multiple welfare concerns in the transportation of live animals including ""group stress, handling stress, heat stress, injuries, motion stress, prolonged hunger, prolonged thirst, respiratory disorders, restriction of movement, resting problems and sensory overstimulation"".

Records show that some live animals - mainly pigs - have been transported from the EU by air to countries as far afield as Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore, Vietnam and Cambodia. Other pigs were flown from France to destinations in Africa, including Cameroon, Ghana and Uganda.

Many of the journeys cited in the report involve unweaned, infant calves and lambs. Over 300,000 unweaned calves were estimated to have been transported between EU member states each year between 2019 and 2021.

""Most of these calves are the unwanted male calves from the dairy sector. These tiny animals, often just two to three weeks of age, are frail and quite unsuited for transport,"" the authors said.

EU regulations allow unweaned calves to be transported on journeys of more than eight hours once they are 14 days old. However, EFSA has recommended that this age be increased to five weeks, with journey times capped at eight hours.

One of the ""tricks of the trade"" allegedly used, researchers found, was transport organisers recording assembly sites - where animals from various farms are gathered before the next leg of their journey - as the original points of departure. This allows the journey time to appear shorter than it really is.

A European Commission review last year acknowledged that ""the enforcement of current rules is insufficient to ensure the level of animal welfare expected"".

Matthias Beermann from the EU's budgeting body, the European Court of Auditors, which recently reviewed the EU's farm animal transport industry, said: ""Member states enforce EU animal transport rules unevenly. Transporters may choose a longer route to avoid passing through countries with tighter enforcement of EU rules and tougher sanctions.""

The EU is understood to be the world's largest live farm animal exporter. Economic factors are considered to be the biggest driving force in live animal transport in the EU, according to Beermann.

""Farms tend to specialise in one species or stage in production. There is a trend towards fewer, but larger farms and slaughterhouses. Against this backdrop, farmers and meat producers aim to minimise production and slaughter costs, maximise revenues and optimise economies of scale by exploiting cost differences between member states. These factors incentivise the transport of animals, particularly when transport costs account for a small fraction of the retail meat price,"" he said.

Countries including the UK, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand have committed to tighter regulation on live animal exports.

Longest trial so far of supplement derived from red seaweed produced 28% less of the greenhouse gas - a much smaller reduction than in previous studies

One of the world's longest commercial trials of a seaweed supplement that the global meat industry hopes could slash methane from beef cattle has recorded much lower reductions in the potent greenhouse gas than previous studies.

Putting the supplement into the diets of 40 wagyu cattle in an Australian feedlot for 300 days cut the methane they produced by 28%.

The supplement was derived from the red seaweed species Asparagopsis, which has been widely promoted as being able to cut methane by more than 80%, with some experiments suggesting reductions as high as 96%.

Globally, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization estimates, methane from burping cattle - known as enteric emissions - releases about 2.1bn tonnes of CO2-equivalent a year, compared with the 37.5bn tonnes of CO2 from burning fossil fuels.

But because methane is about 80 times more potent than CO2 at warming the planet over a 20-year period, cutting methane is seen as a way to slow global heating faster.

The trial, reported by the red meat industry's marketing and research group Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA), also found animals given the supplement ate less food and weighed 15kg less by the time they were sent for slaughter.

Dr Fran Cowley, a livestock scientist at the University of New England who led the trial, said it was the longest run so far using the red seaweed.

She said more research was needed to understand why the wagyu in the trial had not delivered the same level of emissions reductions as other experiments.

One factor could be the way the methane was measured in the trial, which used an open-air system in a feedlot compared with animals measured in dedicated indoor chambers.

But the trial report noted that other experiments over shorter timeframes using the same open-air measurement technique had recorded higher methane reductions.

""This was the biggest and longest trial so far and [the supplement] has not performed to the levels seen in the headlines people might have picked up. But that doesn't mean it can't,"" Cowley said.

Cowley said she thought cuts of 90% ""in the real world"" were possible but there would also be economic factors that commercial producers would have to take, such as factoring in the cost of the supplement against the market benefits of methane reductions.

The seaweed was mixed in canola oil and added to the animals' feed. In this trial it was given to the animals at slightly lower concentrations than other experiments that showed much higher methane reductions.

Cowley said it was also not clear why the animals on the supplement ate less food and put on weight more slowly.

Accounting for the extra 35 days the animals would have taken to reach the same weight would have theoretically meant the emissions savings were cut from 28% to 19% as they would have been alive for longer, all the time emitting methane.

Wagyu is considered a higher-end and more expensive beef. The trial found the seaweed supplement had no effect on the meat's properties, including flavour.

Dr Rob Kinley is a pioneer of the Asparagopsis supplement and the chief scientist at FutureFeed - the Australian company that holds the intellectual property for its use globally as a livestock feed supplement.

He said it was not surprising the trial had seen lower results given the differences across breeds, measuring techniques, diets of the animals and the amount of supplement given to the animals.

But Kinley said it should be celebrated that the supplement was able to cut methane over such a long period and is confident other trials would deliver far higher reductions.

""The golden lining is even though it was just under 30% emissions reduction, it stayed that way for 275 days - it hardly faltered at all and I was impressed by that,"" he said.

The Australian government funds a $29m research program to test different methane-reducing livestock supplements, including red seaweed.

The latest trial was financially backed by the country's biggest beef producer, the Australian Agricultural Company (AACo), which helped run the trial and provided the animals.

The AACo chief executive, David Harris, said the company had anticipated bigger methane cuts but ""reducing emissions by almost 30% is still significant"".

""There is no silver bullet to eliminating enteric methane emissions, but we'll keep trying and we'll discover how to make it work in our environment,"" he said. ""The important thing is that we are determined to get there.""

Most trials of methane-reducing supplements report emissions reductions only while animals are in the feedlot. Only 12%-15% of AACo's emissions occur while the animals are in a feedlot.

An MLA spokesperson said: ""Each time a new research project concludes, it places another piece into the puzzle, helping us understand the various products that might incorporate Asparagopsis and also helps us to understand further questions that need to be answered.""

They make up 57% of the UK diet - and the risks are becoming ever more evident. Here is how to recognise UPFs and find healthier alternatives

What is ultra-processed food?

Almost all food is processed to some extent. Even if you cook from scratch, you probably use, say, flour, olive oil and tinned tomatoes, none of which are in their raw states. But ultra-processed food (UPF) is very different. It contains industrial substances that you won't find in your kitchen, along with additives to make them taste good. In his bestselling book, Ultra-Processed People, Chris van Tulleken quotes the Brazilian scientist Fernanda Rauber as saying: ""Most UPF is not food. It's an industrially produced edible substance.""

Sounds disgusting! It's unhealthy, too, isn't it?

Actually, UPF often tastes delicious. But unfortunately, two recent large studies showed that it significantly raises the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, heart attacks and strokes. These studies are just the latest in a growing body of research that shows how harmful UPF is to health. Van Tulleken, who is also an infectious diseases doctor at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in London, cites research showing that a high consumption of UPF is linked to obesity, cancer, type 2 diabetes, depression, dementia and tooth decay, among other conditions. (A study published in 2019 found that 57% of the average UK diet is made up of UPF; among children and poorer people, it can be as high as 80%.)

How do I know if I'm eating UPF?

There are no health warnings on UPF in the UK - yet. But there are lots of red flags that may point to UPFs, says Van Tulleken. Does it contain at least one ingredient you don't recognise? Does it have a health claim on the packet, such as ""high in fibre"" or ""source of protein""? Does it contain palm oil? Is it made by a multinational company? Did that company start with a cheap crop, such as a lentil, and turn it into an expensive crisp, chip or puff? These are all hallmarks of UPFs.

What exactly should I look for on the label?

Carlos A Monteiro, a professor of nutrition and public health at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, has written a useful guide. According to his journal article, Ultra-processed foods: what they are and how to identify them, food substances not used in home kitchens tend to appear at the beginning or in the middle of the ingredients list (ingredients are listed in order of weight). These include protein sources (hydrolysed proteins, soya protein isolate, gluten, casein, whey protein, mechanically separated meat); sugars (fructose, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice concentrates, invert sugar, maltodextrin, dextrose, lactose); soluble or insoluble fibre; and modified oils (hydrogenated or interesterified oil).

Additives appear at the end of the ingredients list. Cosmetic additives, used to make the final product more palatable or more appealing, include flavours, flavour enhancers, colours, emulsifiers, emulsifying salts, sweeteners, thickeners, and anti-foaming, bulking, carbonating, foaming, gelling and glazing agents.

One caveat: some ingredients may sound unfamiliar to the layperson but don't signify UPF. For example, UK flour is routinely fortified with calcium, iron, thiamine and niacin; ascorbic acid is another name for vitamin C; and corn starch is a traditional, non-UPF thickener (unlike ""modified starches"").

I don't have time to read every label in the supermarket!

A handy, free resource is the Open Food Facts app. This app, by a non-profit organisation based in France, with contributions from tens of thousands of volunteers, lets you search for products and scan barcodes to identify UPFs. So far, the database contains more than 3m products.

What foods are definitely not UPF?

In the Nova food classification system, devised by Monteiro, category one is ""unprocessed or minimally processed food"". This includes fresh, frozen and dried fruit and vegetables; milk and plain yoghurt; fresh meat and fish; grains and legumes; fungi; eggs; flour; nuts and seeds; herbs and spices; pasta and couscous.

Category two covers ""processed culinary ingredients"". This includes things such as butter and vegetable oils; honey and maple syrup; and sugar, salt and vinegar.

Category three is ""processed foods"". These include freshly made bread and cheese; tinned food - vegetables, fish, fruit; cured meats and smoked fish; and salted or sugared nuts and seeds.

And what almost certainly is UPF?

Top offenders in category four, ultra-processed foods, include fizzy drinks; packaged snacks; sweets and chocolate; ice-cream; biscuits, cakes and pastries; sausages and burgers; packaged pies and pizzas; and chicken nuggets.

But surely no one thinks these are health foods?

True. But the UPF category also includes most bread; breakfast cereal and cereal bars; flavoured yoghurts; fruit drinks; milk drinks; ""diet"" products; and baby food. Van Tulleken estimates that more than 95% of supermarket bread - including healthy-sounding multiseed loaves or sourdough - is made by the industrial ""Chorleywood method"", which has a short proving time and a cocktail of additives and ""processing aids"". Even virtuous muesli often contains barley malt extract, a flavour enhancer.

Is there any convenience food that isn't UPF?

Plenty! Non-UPF cereals include Ready Brek and Shredded Wheat. Lots of time-saving tins, jars and sachets of food are not UPF, such as plain microwave rice. Some supermarket ready meals, including many lasagnes, are not UPF. Often the organic version of a UPF (baked beans or ketchup, say) will not be ultra-processed - although it will be more expensive. This is not to say that all these foods are necessarily ""healthy"", just that they are not ultra-processed. It will always be healthier to make your own lasagne, but lots of us don't have the time, inclination or skill.

What can I snack on that isn't UPF?

Van Tulleken snacks on peanuts, apples, carrots and bread with peanut butter or honey. If you would usually have a fruit and nut bar, he suggests buying nuts and dried fruit instead - even the ""raw"" bars contain flavourings. Plain salted snacks are often non-UPF, whereas flavoured snacks are almost always UPF. For example, he says: ""Flavoured Doritos contain additives, flavour enhancers and emulsifiers, which ready-salted crisps don't.""

I'm a vegan. Am I likely to be eating a lot of UPF?

If you base your diet on fruits, vegetables, pulses, grains and nuts, then you won't be eating a lot of UPF. Vegan alternatives to meat, including mushrooms, jackfruit, beans and tofu, are not UPF. However, ""fake meat"" - burgers, sausage, bacon etc - and most vegan cheeses are. With plant milks, if they contain emulsifiers, stabilisers or flavourings, they are UPF.

What about food from sandwich shops, takeaways and restaurants?

Almost every fast-food or sandwich chain includes some UPFs in their range - even those that have an aura of health, such as Pret or Leon. Van Tulleken says it is still possible to shop at such chains and avoid UPFs, by choosing porridge, fruit pots, salad (often without the dressing) and soup, and avoiding sandwiches, wraps and pastries. Chain pubs and restaurants also serve lots of UPFs. The dishes least likely to contain UPFs are ""whole foods"" such as steak and chips; anything with a coating, batter or sauce, such as scampi, will probably contain emulsifiers. Again, takeaways are extremely likely to serve UPFs. The best bet when eating out or on the go is to choose a family-run, independent business that serves home-cooked food - although, for many people, this option is not available or affordable.

To summarise, if you think it might be UPF ""¦

It probably is. But Van Tulleken says: ""Agonising over individual products is less important than your overall diet.""

Can't I just exercise more to counteract the effects of UPFs?

Exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle and has numerous benefits, physical and mental. But you can't magically get rid of the ill-effects of UPF in the gym, just as you can't cancel out binge-drinking by going for a run.

Isn't the focus on UPFs just another kind of fat-shaming?

Not at all - if anything, it's the opposite. UPF is designed to be overeaten; for some people, it is addictive. Eating it to excess has nothing to do with ""willpower"" or ""greed"". Van Tulleken stresses that he has no moral view on eating or not eating UPF, and has no interest in telling people what to eat or how to lose weight. He would simply like people to know what they are eating and be equipped to make a conscious choice.

The problem is the industrialised food system, not individual consumers. ""I resent our food system being so polluted,"" he says. ""I want UPF to be treated like cigarettes."" He would like to see them heavily taxed, banned from schools and with restrictions on marketing them to children. He suggests an approach similar to that which Chile used with foods high in sugar, salt and fat, putting black labels on them to warn consumers.

What if I want to quit UPFs?

Some people will find it easy to cut right down and just have the occasional chocolate bar or takeaway. Others, such as Van Tulleken, find total abstinence easiest. He recommends spending a week or so finding out as much as you can about UPF, while simultaneously eating as much of it as you like. ""You fancy six KFC hot wings? Have nine!"" The idea, much like chain-smoking while reading Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking, is that, by the end of the week, you will be disgusted by UPF and won't want to eat it any more.

I've quit - my food bill has trebled and I spend all my time cooking!

Van Tulleken recommends buying or borrowing a good budget cookbook with quick and easy recipes - he likes those by Jack Monroe and Allegra McEvedy. Online resources for thrifty cooks include the Guardian's budget meals series and BBC Good Food's budget section. The First Steps Nutrition Trust has easy, healthy recipe ideas aimed at pregnant women, but its ""eating well for £4 a day"" recipes have universal appeal. Again, this approach won't work for everyone - people who live in food deserts or don't have access to cooking facilities may have little choice but to eat UPFs.

It sounds like hard work. What's one easy change I can make?

Van Tulleken is clear on this one: stop drinking fizzy drinks, even the ""diet"" versions. ""Whether or not fizzy drinks have any calories, they will rot your teeth - and if they have phosphoric acid in them, they will also dissolve your bones,"" he says.

Speaking of drinks - is alcohol UPF?

Alcohol doesn't fit neatly into the Nova classification. Traditionally made beer, wine and cider could be considered processed; spirits and alcopops are ultra-processed. But that doesn't mean you can knock back the beers. ""No amount of alcohol is beneficial to your physical health. Everyone should drink as little alcohol as they possibly can,"" says Van Tulleken. ""And UPF alcohol is the most dangerous form of UPF.""

Richard PennyHouse painter and writer

Richard Penny, 58, a house-painter and writer, moved to Brixton, south London, from Guildford two years ago for a change of scene. Despite having 25 years of experience, work was tough to find so he scrapped his car last February to pay off his bills. In October, he went on universal credit as a last resort. Since then, not one call has come in for work.

MondayI called Universal Credit at 9am to find that my first payment was blocked on the premise that I ""failed to provide my income and expenses"" when in actual fact I presented my bank statements and tax calculation personally at an appointment with an adviser last Monday. Maybe it was the banter, they don't like that. Must be more robotic next time, more downtrodden, quietly beaming with eternal gratitude.

My first payment had been due last Thursday, but nothing arrived. The week before that, I sold the telly and the work radio to Cash Converters, but the haul wasn't enough to pay the monthly self-assessment tax bill - so I gambled on a horse and lost. HMRC have now given me three months' grace so the heat's off till January. I should cancel the telly licence now it's gone.

Today I have four or five eggs, bread, butter, some milk and a bit of cheap cereal, using up what was in the house - eggs on toast in the morning and afternoon, and cereal in the morning.

TuesdayI went out at about 11, checked the balance at the cashpoint, still nothing, so it was time to pawn the ring. He gave me £170 for it this time: £20 on the card to pay the telly licence and the rest in cash. On the way out I noticed a pre-owned gold pendant, inscribed ""Daddy"", and imagined how it got there. Pawnbrokers, the last outpost before the desert.

Out on the street I stopped and wondered what to do. First thought was to go straight to the supermarket, get food and roll-ups, and return to the flat to rot away like a good boy. Then I saw it in my mind's eye - a pint. Within a short second I pressed the old fuck-it button and dashed off to Wetherspoon's to get drunk. It's awful to say but whenever I get money it goes so quick it hardly seems worth having. One day it's there, the next it's gone.

I paid the minimart back for the tub of water (£1.79) and went home.

I skipped my meals today, but at home in the evening I had leftover cereal.

WednesdayUniversal Credit didn't call as promised yesterday so I called just now to see what's happening. Apparently there's an unidentified gateway intervention blocking payment. All sounds very Star Wars. I've waited six weeks for my first payment and this is now the sixth day of delay after that.

The call that was promised yesterday has now been escalated to an ""urgent"" call, due by tomorrow 6pm latest. It's a finely tuned mess. The money won't come until tomorrow at the very earliest so I'm stuffed.

There are four eggs left and bread and butter but I'm out of roll-ups and loo roll. Both ends stuffed. It's a beautiful day so I should at least have a walk in Brockwell Park.

The guy at Greggs was a little angel, gave me two sausage rolls instead of one, £1.20. Back home, at just before 5pm, I got a message from the jobcentre. I'm to attend a meeting on Friday morning. Only then will they release payment, which means I'm screwed for the rest of the week. There's no explanation, no apology, not a twitch of concern.

There's eight quid left in the bank but no roll-ups. That's a drag, but I do have two unopened packs of eight-year-old Marlboros. I just tried one and they're pretty rank. The neighbour came over for tea in the evening and gave me some tobacco, even lent me a twenty for food tomorrow. He's a lifesaver.

So today I had two pieces of toast with butter, one egg fried, and then later some eggs on toast and the Greggs sausage rolls.

ThursdayI skipped breakfast and went out at about half-eleven to get the shopping. With eight in the bank, five in shrapnel and 20 from my mate it was decided that I'd go to Wetherspoon's for three conciliatory pints of Punk IPA. They were gorgeous. At Lidl I got lamb mince, mushrooms, shallots, spaghetti, chopped tomatoes, apples, grating cheese, milk, a carrot and a bottle of red, £18.08. Back home I got the sauce going and relaxed with the wine and a few ghastly Marlboros. The spaghetti bolognese will give me two meals a day for the next three days.

FridayTook the bus for the 9.30 appointment at the jobcentre, where I met a nice chap who took me through my work commitments. It was then that I found out what I'm supposed to live on: £275 a month. This came as a real kick in the gut and there's no two ways about it - I need to find work pronto. Once my commitments were confirmed on the system, he said that the transfer usually only takes 10 minutes to go through, but latest it would go through was 8pm.

I spent £28.64 on beer at the pub and then left to go to a cashpoint. The money was there.

Tearing the notes from the guts of the cashpoint I went off to get roll-ups and tobacco, costing £18.60. For a few seconds I thought of just going home, but then the flavour came on and I was straight back at Wetherspoon's. This time, I played a fruit machine and in half an hour I'd drained the account to £80. I know I'm a nutcase but gambling's always been the story of my life. It started in amusement arcades when I was seven.

That was it after that, three more pints and then a waddle to the bookies to have the rest away. Went for a couple of games of pool then spaghetti bolognese at home and early bed. Pure insanity.

SaturdayI woke up and realised what I'd done. Unutterable despair and doom. A cold shiver ran through me. The old death shiver. I have no more water but I do have two quid coming back from a non-runner at Ayr yesterday, so I'll have to trudge back to the bookies in the drizzle and grab a tub. I can't live without tea but it looks like I'm back on the ""Dead Man's Diet"" until I get a job. The diet consists of tea (with or without milk) and whichever scraps may be left lying around. Then it's simply a case of staying alive till the next bit of money turns up.

My next dole payment is about a month away, so I'm screwed. I never was one for budgeting. My sister texted at midday so I went up to town in the afternoon and met her for a few beers. She paid. I told her about my mishaps, not all of them, then we trundled around Soho for a little while. She lent me a twenty then I got the bus back via the supermarket for bread, butter, strawberry jam, eggs, tissue paper and red wine (£13.40).

That evening I had eggs on toast, and earlier in the day I had a couple of slices of toast with jam and marmite.

SundayI need to find a job, any job, just to keep things ticking along. The knee's gone so I can't really paint any more. I have to click the leg back into place when I get up from the floor. Very annoying, especially when it won't go back in. Maybe driving or a washing-up job. There's not an awful lot out there but let's see.

The spag bol's gone and I'm down to eggs, butter, a large slice of bread and a bit of milk.

Jane and Dave
Work in green energy and teaching

Jane, 35, and Dave, 48, live in Glasgow. Jane works for a green energy organisation and Dave is a teacher for children with additional support needs. Dave's vegetarian and Jane has been vegan for about 15 years. They plan meals carefully each week to avoid the expense and wasting food. This is something they've always done, even when in a good financial situation. Jane has autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Dave has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

SundayOur area of Glasgow is ridiculously walkable, and so dense with cafes and delicatessens it's been dubbed the brunch capital of Scotland. Since neither of us drive (thanks, sub-par ASD spatial awareness!), we shop on foot. Usually, we visit three very nearby shops: the greengrocer's, then either the world-food store or the refill shop (depending on what's needed), and lastly the supermarket for the few remaining items.

In the morning we spend £15 which goes on a cinnamon bun, spicy lentil soup and sourdough, and two coffees at a local vegan cafe.

Dave usually cooks dinner, but today I make a big winter vegetable soup. Cabbages, carrots, turnips, tatties, parsnips, barley grains, and fennel (OK, a mostly winter vegetable soup - the fennel's an unseasonal cheat). With buttered slices of fancypants supermarket olive bread. It's cosy, it's herby, it's chunky - it's perfect for the season. Snacks are a pear from the grocer's shop and a few squares of dark chocolate.

MondayMy cereal is strawberry and oat supermarket-own-brand, with oat milk, and coffee, also with oatmilk. Yes, that's a lot of oats. I'm Scottish. We like a lot of oats.

Every morning except Saturdays, Dave has a 1-litre Huel ""meal replacement"" shake: 500 calories of vanilla-flavoured plant-based protein and a wide range of other daily nutrients. Some use it to lose weight, others to gain weight. Dave uses it to battle the very common ADHD problem of forgetting to eat then snacking unhealthily, and expensively. Since making this change, Dave says he starts every day fed well and cheaply.

Lunch for me is leftover cold pasta from Saturday. Buttered, with olives, capers and tomatoes.

On getting home from work between 4pm and 5pm, Dave has a ramen noodle snack to tide him over until dinner, bulked out with dried mushrooms and tofu. This is the same nearly every weekday.

The vat of winter vegetable soup was big enough to swim in, so Dave reheats it for today's dinner as well, and brings it to me at my work desk. Snacks are a couple of Hobnob biscuits and the ubiquitous dark chocolate.

I drink tea, coffee, water, and hot chocolate near-constantly as one of my medication side effects is a dry mouth. I reuse the loose tea leaves and coffee grounds twice, because I am thrifty and/or scummy, possibly both.

TuesdayAfter breakfast (granola and oat milk again) and my morning work shift, I do some baking. I make up a crumble with Bramley apples, and free bramble berries I foraged in a local park and froze. I love a free bramble, me.

I also try a pumpkin pie, with a pre-made pastry sheet and the frozen and defrosted pieces of our Halloween pumpkin. I didn't have time to cook with these on 1 November, but I didn't fancy binning so much potential pie filling, either.

Lunch is more winter vegetable soup. And freshly made crumble with some coconut-milk ice-cream. I've also tried roasting up the pumpkin seeds with sugar and cinnamon.

Dave got hungry on the way home and grabbed salty crisps from Lidl, and some ramen when he got home. That evening, he chops up and seasons tatties for spicy potato wedges to go with the affectionately named recipe Sausage Inna Bun for dinner.

WednesdayDave's breakfast is Huel, as ever. And lunch. Mine is coffee and two perfectly chilled slices of the DIY pumpkin pie.

My lunch is the last of the winter vegetable soup, plus leftover homemade tattie wedges.

Dave buys a two-month supply online of ramen noodles, because they take only three minutes to prepare. Bulked out with tofu plus raw veggies, it's actually nutritionally OK (barring the boatload of salt, obviously).

Dinnerwise, Dave's out at an ADHD support group. So he grabs takeaway chips and cheese, then comes home and pops a quick panful of salty popcorn.

For now, our doctors have pronounced him in damn good shape for nearly 50 years old - but someday one of them will probably bring up that salt intake ""¦ Myself, I'm working an evening shift and haven't time to make dinner, so have an apple and raisin cereal bar, a few bites of dark chocolate, and a doughnut.

ThursdayYesterday evening, I opted for a £4 ""Magic Bag"" on the Freegan app Too Good to Go. For the price, you get a bag from your chosen grocery shop/bakery/restaurant of whatever's unsold and about to be binned at the day's end. It can be a neat way to try out somewhere new, and you usually get about £15-£40 of food. Plus, it saves food waste.

Today's lunch is Magic Bag deli sandwiches: a vegan pesto, butternut squash and spinach salad concoction. And a Magic Bag pot of fruit salad. It's got mangoes, strawberries and blueberries. I am a lucky woman. Breakfast was strawberry oat granola, coffee, soymilk for me, and (as ever) Huel for Dave.

For us, dinnerwise, it's a colourful homemade stirfry of seasoned-up red cabbage, radishes, onions and soya beans (edamame). And supermarket Japanese dumplings (gyoza). It's one of the pricier meals this week. For snacks, dark chocolate, some pumpkin pie, and half a £1 bag of spicy chickpeas from the Indian grocery aisle.

FridayBreakfast is branflakes and coffee, both with oat milk. For Dave, it's another double-whammy breakfast and lunch of Huel.

This evening's menu plan was samosas, roast cauliflower and lentil dal, but it's a pal's birthday party so we'll have food when we're out instead. Dave eats the samosa anyway.

SaturdayIt's the last day before the food shop and I'm busy with a project. So today's eats happen at no particular time, and read like a greatest hits of the week's food. Reheated edamame and veggie stirfry bulked out with extra tofu (because protein), the rest of the spicy chickpeas, the last slice of pumpkin pie, dark chocolate and a portion of fruit crumble. Oh, and some Quorn nuggets. And maybe more coffee than was good for me.

Oluwatosin*

Refugee from Nigeria

Oluwatosin*, 36, is a counsellor from Nigeria who was very recently granted leave to remain in the UK as a refugee in December 2023. She came to the UK in 2020 and was seeking asylum for three years. She lives in the north of England. The Home Office pays for accommodation for her and her seven-year-old son, and she is given £90 a week to pay for everything else, which means about £60 on groceries each week. She is supported by the St Augustine's charity in Halifax, where she also volunteers three times a week. Oluwatosin is hoping to start work in the counselling sector now that she has been granted leave to remain.

SaturdayFor breakfast I had pancakes, sausages and hot chocolate. This is not something we usually have: this was my son wanting something different on that day. I made the pancakes from scratch, using eggs, milk and flour. My son is a fan of pancakes.

For lunch I had jollof and fried rice, with a fish and vegetables salad. Jollof rice is made from blended tomatoes, peppers and onions, and fried rice with a mix of vegetables. As it was a weekend I had time to cook all this, but I made just enough for the two of us so there weren't any leftovers.

For dinner we had some cereal. We had a smaller meal as we weren't too hungry. Sometimes when we have a larger lunch we will have a much smaller dinner.

In terms of my son's meals, he has been showing a pattern of skipping meals in recent weeks. He occasionally skips dinner, explaining that he isn't hungry and doesn't feel like eating. Despite skipping meals, he tends to snack frequently throughout the day. He also enjoys his cheese strings and grapes. When asked about his reduced appetite, he says he feels satisfied. Thankfully, there have been no signs of weight loss or diminished energy levels.

SundayFor breakfast this morning we had some toast with grapes and other fruits. We had the toast with tuna and mayonnaise, to make sure we had some protein with our breakfast. I try to have as many different fruits as possible with my son.

For lunch we had a potato-chips and vegetable omelette - I usually have fresh potatoes and chop them myself, but in this case that's all we had. We had this with spinach. Although my son can sometimes be a bit fussy, he is a fan of omelettes.

Fruit salad, tomato and broccoli: we had a lighter dinner due to having had lots of vegetables throughout the day.

MondayFor breakfast, we had akara, which is blended and fried beans, with some custard. The beans are from the African shop and already peeled. The custard was from Aldi.

My son has a packed lunch, which I prepared, and which changes throughout the week. Today it's pasta with tomato sauce and grapefruit, and some cheese strings. Although my son is entitled to free school meals, which he used to have, I now prefer to make his lunch for him so I know he is getting his nutritional needs.

I skipped lunch that day as I was volunteering as a case worker at a refugee and asylum seeker charity called St Augustine's, and I was busy and didn't think to stop for lunch.

My son skipped dinner as he said he wasn't too hungry, but I had fried eggs and chips.

TuesdayMe and my son both had boiled potatoes with some eggs and tomato sauce for breakfast before going to school. The tomato sauce was made with some onions, with some scrambled eggs through it.

We both had the same lunch, which was white rice with beans and a tomato-based sauce. As usual, I had packed this for my son to take with him to school. I pre-made the sauce in the morning from onions and some bell peppers.

We both had a smaller dinner of some plain noodles with boiled eggs, as we had a large breakfast and lunch so weren't too hungry.

Wednesday
For breakfast we both had fried plantain with some porridge. I prepared my son's lunch, which was a tuna sandwich with a banana and cheese strings.

I skipped my lunch today. Sometimes skipping lunch doesn't impact me, but today I had a mince pie at work because I got quite hungry.

For dinner we had homemade fried chicken made within the airfryer. I also made the sauce, and the chips were frozen and what I had left in the freezer. We had this with apples.

ThursdayFor breakfast we had bread with fried eggs. My son also had some jam on toast and some hot chocolate, while I had a breakfast tea.

For lunch I had some white rice with tomato stew and chicken. My son also had this for his packed lunch at school. With mine I added some beans, but my son isn't a fan so didn't have some.

For dinner we both had fried plantains with some porridge oats. We have breakfast food for dinners to save time sometimes, and it's not always easy to think of what to eat. I know that oats are healthy with fibre.

FridayFor breakfast we had white rice and a chicken curry sauce which I made especially, although the rice was leftovers from dinner the night before. I made the curry sauce with coconut milk and carrots, bell peppers and chicken. Just because I wanted to have a change from what we usually have.

My son and I had the same lunch, which was noodles and eggs. We had a smaller dinner of toast with fresh orange juice as we weren't too hungry as we had a much bigger lunch.

Abdul Jamial
Second-year undergraduate student

Abdul Jamial is a second-year undergraduate student from Hull studying law at the London School of Economics (LSE). He is also a food ambassador for the Food Foundation, a charity that campaigns for a better food system whereby everyone in the UK can afford and access a healthy and sustainable diet.

FridayFor breakfast I had three wheat biscuits. The Tesco own-brand is half as cheap as Weetabix and nutritionally the same. I use no-sugar nutty almond milk by Alpro alongside it as it is only 13-15 kcal per 100ml. To satisfy my sweet tooth, I use a spoonful of no-sugar-added orange marmalade.

I have been working hard to eat healthily recently so I thought I deserved to treat myself to a less stringent diet for the week. I haven't eaten fried chicken since the summer and so for lunch I spontaneously went out to eat KFC with a friend, buying a six-piece ""bargain"" bucket meal and two wings for £15.18. I tried to use my student discount but as the store did not have any signal or free wifi, I couldn't.

I don't normally eat out, but at dinnertime I used the website TheFork to book a table at the restaurant The Real Greek for a 50% discount against the Ã la carte menu. I bought Greek flatbread (£3.80), hummus (£6.00) and fried kalamari (£8.40). With the 50% discount, the total came to around £10 including service charge.

SaturdayI skipped breakfast as I woke up late. I don't normally have breakfast.

At lunch I bought a reduced melon pack at Tesco Express (only reduced by 14p to £1.13) alongside a tuna and sweetcorn sandwich. It was rainy and cold, but many nearby cafes require you to buy something expensive to eat in to shelter with warmth.

I quite liked the melons and so I picked up honeydew melons and big juicy oranges for £3 from Morrisons. I chopped these up and left them for whenever I was hungry for a snack. As I did a food shop today and ate out the previous day, I reverted to my usual homemade dinners.

I typically do my shops from Tesco as often their reduced ranges are more extensive. Today I left chicken drumsticks out to thaw and when I got home, made a jerk marinade with Dunns River seasonings and natural fat-free yoghurt. I threw these in the oven.

SundayToday was a day spent in the LSE library. As I normally don't have breakfast, I typically get a drink to tide me over. The drink prices these days really put me off, with most drinks more than £1. I bought a can of Pepsi Max as it was the cheapest (75p) with zero sugar and no calories.

There are loads of places to buy food on the Strand [near the LSE]. But I need to be careful how I spend my money. I can't go to Itsu, Wasabi or Starbucks every day. But I also try to be mindful when it comes to buying cheap food items. For example, a cheese and onion bake from Greggs costs £1.85. One bake uses up 75% of the recommended saturated fats for the day. A great price but not the best nutritional intake. So I opt for a Tesco meal deal, buying an egg-mayo sandwich, protein yoghurt and an Innocent smoothie for £3.40.

I came home from university late so I couldn't be bothered to wait 40 minutes for the oven as I wanted to get in bed. I diced some chicken breasts and mixed it with mixed periperi and barbecue seasonings, and boiled some mixed frozen veg. It was inexpensive and quick, but not very filling, so I steamed some dumplings as a dessert.

MondaySkipped breakfast again.

At lunch, the Christmas lights on the Strand were pretty and inspired me to get a festive smoked salmon and cream cheese sandwich with a cheese twist.

Later on, I did a shop at the Food Warehouse as they do great frozen foods. So for dinner I had some battered fish, and garlic and chilli breaded calamari. I also had some of the leftover melon and oranges from a couple of days ago.

TuesdayI have breakfast today - wheat biscuits and marmalade.

It was a cold rainy day and I didn't fancy another cold lunch from Tesco or Sainsbury's, so I went to [the Japanese restaurant chain] Marugame Udon and bought their small kake udon noodles for £4.95, which included hot soupy udon noodles. This is the cheapest substantial meal I've found in central London. I wouldn't have this regularly as it isn't very nutritious.

For dinner I bake frozen vegetable lasagne, with barbecue chicken thighs and boiled frozen vegetables.

WednesdayWoke up quite late and feeling ill. I wanted to eat something hearty and warm to make me feel better. I made beef and onion dumplings in a quick beef stock with some vegetables.

I was still peckish, so I decided to put some garlic bread in the oven and have that as a side. By the time I finished eating, it was around 12pm, so I decided it was brunch instead and I skipped lunch so I could get on with some work.

I felt a bit better later on and had booked to go to the cinema with friends. I decided to get popcorn from the supermarket to eat during the film. When I got home, I didn't have time to make anything substantial, so I just had an apple and went to bed.

ThursdayI skipped breakfast and then had meetings across the city so didn't have much time to get lunch.

By 6pm I was hungry. Watching TikTok on the bus, I saw an enticing video of a baked camembert and I decided to give it a try. The camembert and bread came to £5, but the amount of saturated fats was not worth the underwhelming taste - I'd stick to cheddar.

I was a bit full, but I knew I hadn't eaten all day so I microwaved some leftover chicken drumsticks to make sure I had a wider variety of nutrients.

A new study doubles the number of species at risk of extinction to 2m, driven by the latest data on insects. Losing these tiny creatures would have huge implications for life on Earth

Read more: Number of species at risk of extinction doubles to 2 million, says study

Cut an apple in half, and the white flesh reveals a cluster of black pips arranged in the shape of a star. It is a tiny constellation of seeds hidden in the fruit bowl. But it reveals an interlinked universe of pollination and nature's abundance - a delicate system, and one that can easily be thrown off course.

When the apple blossoms are pollinated, seeds pump out hormones telling the plant to produce the right vitamins, minerals and rate of growth. They help formulate crunchiness, size and shape. Lose those pollinators, however, and this fragile system becomes unbalanced. If only three or four of the seeds get pollinated, our apple may grow lopsided. The nutritional value might decrease, as could the shelf-life of the fruit, turning it brown and wrinkled before its time.

The story of the apple is one being retold over and over across the world. A new report warns that two million species are at risk of extinction, twice as many as in previous estimates by the UN. This increase is down to better data on insect populations, which have been less understood than other groups.

Often, it is animals such as insects - the species we tend to care the least about - which provide the greatest services to human populations: pollinating crops, helping provide healthy soils and controlling pests.

Despite ongoing uncertainties about invertebrates, the alarming loss of wildlife globally is well documented. In the past 50 years, wildlife populations have decreased by 70% on average - and their loss is already affecting how human societies operate and sustain themselves.

What's happening to pollination?

The latest study estimates that 24% of invertebrates are at risk of extinction - they are the ones that do the most pollination.

Crops that provide most of our vitamins and minerals, such as fruits, vegetables and nuts, depend on pollinators and organisms in the soil that keep it fertile. An estimated 75% of food crops rely on pollinators to some degree and 95% of food comes directly or indirectly from the soil.

Prof Simon Potts, from Reading University, says: ""If you get less pollination, you're going to get less production. But not only less yield or tonnage, the quality of that produce is going to go down ""¦ your strawberries will be misshapen and they won't be so packed full of sugars.""

""We call this ""˜pollination deficit',"" he says.

A review of scientific databases from 48 countries, published in Nature Communications, looking at 48 different crops, found fruits pollinated by animals and insects had on average 23% better quality than those which were not pollinated by animals, particularly improving the shape, size and shelf-life of fruit and vegetables.

Growing fruit that is short-lived and looks odd is likely to increase food waste, with the impact felt through the production chain, researchers warn.

What does that do to our global food system?

Insect pollination contributes more than £600m a year to the UK economy. ""Biodiversity should be regarded as legitimate agricultural input,"" Potts says. ""Farmers manage water, they manage fertilisers and pesticides, manage the seeds we put in the ground, but very few manage biodiversity as an input.""

Globally, between 3% and 5% of vegetable, fruit and nut production is being lost due to inadequate pollination, according to research led by Harvard University and published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives.

The lead researcher, Matthew Smith, who specialises in environmental health, says: ""At first glance, I was surprised that the figure seemed somewhat modest.""

However, the implications of this 3-5% loss were significant: it leads to about 420,0000 excess deaths annually from a reduction in healthy food consumption and diseases that stem from that, the researchers found.

Smith says: ""To put this figure in perspective, this is equivalent to the number of people who die annually from substance-use disorders, interpersonal violence or prostate cancer.""

The economic implications of those losses can also be substantial. One study has shown that a deficit in pollination for the UK's Gala apple crop could equate to £5.7m in loss of production.

Smith's team modelled similar lost economic value of agricultural production for three countries: Honduras, Nigeria and Nepal. They found between 16% and 31% of their agricultural economic value was lost from inadequate pollination.

""Because between one- and two-thirds of the population in these countries are employed in agriculture, this is a huge and widespread effect,"" he says.

What about water?

Pollinators help provide clean water and sanitation because healthy plant ecosystems keep waterways clean. Mangroves, which benefit from animal pollination, filter out pollutants, absorb runoff and encourage sedimentation, all of which help improve water quality. Since the end of the 1990s, global mangrove cover has declined by roughly 35%.

A paper published in the journal Nature shows habitats with more species are able to remove pollutants faster, which improves water quality. Research suggests wildlife in freshwater ecosystems is being lost at twice the rate of loss in oceans and forests. Only 40% of waters in Europe are classified as being in good ecological health.

What's happening to our soil?

When drought strikes, we tend to think of the impact above ground: plants wilting, lakes drying, people or animals forced to migrate. But beneath the the surface, a parallel crisis is under way.

Climate change causes direct negative effects for crops, such as heat stress, but its indirect effects are disrupting insect populations, and reducing soil biodiversity, where more than half of all species live. A paper published in Nature Communications showed that microbes in soils are not as tough as previously thought during droughts, which appear to change their biology.

Prof Franciska de Vries, from Amsterdam University, who was lead researcher on the study, said the immediate impacts of extreme events such as droughts, heatwaves and storms are on plants. However, recurring extreme weather damages soil biodiversity and the ability of plants to grow in the long term. If it's really dry for long enough, soil organisms just die.

""It's sort of a double whammy,"" says De Vries. ""On the one hand, we are actually not managing our soils very well, which is decreasing their ability to cope with these extreme events. At the same time, these extreme events are making our soils and our crops even more vulnerable.""

Up to 40% of land is now classed as degraded, UN data shows, with half of the world's population already suffering the impact of depleted soil fertility, water, biodiversity, trees or native vegetation. In these conditions, diseases are more likely to take hold, because the system is weakened and certain organisms in the soil have been knocked out.

""If you have healthy soils with organisms that can help the plants, then you mitigate the effects of those extreme events, to some extent.""

When will these effects start kicking in?

How humans will be affected by nature loss is often framed as something that will happen in the future. Despite all the effects of nature loss - which are already being felt - awareness of the biodiversity crisis still lags behind that of the climate crisis.

""I feel biodiversity is where climate was 20 years ago,"" says Potts. ""I think until the public actually lives in the reality of ""˜their life has been changed', I don't think research alone is ever going to convince people - look at the climate story.""

Exclusive: three out of five at briefing playing down concerns over UPFs have ties to makers of such foods

Three out of five scientists on an expert panel that suggested ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are being unfairly demonised have ties to the world's largest manufacturers of the products, the Guardian can reveal.

Recent studies have linked UPFs such as ice-cream, fizzy drinks and ready meals to poor health, including an increased risk of cancer, weight gain and heart disease. Global consumption of the products is soaring and UPFs now make up more than half the average diet in the UK and US.

On Wednesday, at a media briefing in London, a panel of expert scientists suggested consumers should not get too hung up on concerns raised about UPFs. They could sometimes even be good for people, they said.

The briefing, organised by the Science Media Centre, generated headlines including ""Ultra-processed foods as good as homemade fare, say experts"", ""Ultra-processed foods can be good for you, say nutritionists"", and ""Ultra-processed foods can sometimes be better for you, experts claim"".

Three of the five participants on the panel have either received financial support for research from UPF manufacturers or hold key positions with organisations that are funded by them. The manufacturers include NestlÃ©, MondelÄ“z, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Unilever and General Mills.

Prof Janet Cade, of the University of Leeds, told the briefing that most research suggesting a link between UPFs and poor health ""cannot show cause and effect"" and that some items falling into the UPF bracket were foods ""we would encourage such as wholemeal bread, wholegrain breakfast cereals, yoghurts and so on.

""And in fact, processing can actually help to preserve nutrients. Advice to avoid all ultra-processed foods would be at odds with elements of current guidance and could have an impact on wider nutrient intakes ""¦

""People rely on processed foods for a wide number of reasons, so the bottom line would be that if we remove them from our diets, this would require a huge change in the food supply, which is really unachievable for most people, and potentially resulting in further stigmatisation, guilt, etc in those who rely on processed foods, promoting further inequalities in disadvantaged groups.""

Cade is the chair of the advisory committee of the British Nutrition Foundation, whose corporate members include McDonald's, British Sugar and Mars. It is funded by companies including NestlÃ©, MondelÄ“z and Coca-Cola.

Prof Pete Wilde, of the Quadram Institute in Norwich, told the briefing: ""Homemade cakes or cheesecakes are not considered processed but they contain high levels of sugar, fat and possibly salt and [are] rapidly digested energy. Are they any more healthy than a commercial version of that product?""

Wilde has received support for his research from Unilever, MondelÄ“z and NestlÃ©.

Prof CiarÃ¡n Forde, of Wageningen University in the Netherlands, told the briefing that advice to avoid UPF ""risks demonising foods that are nutritionally beneficial"".

Forde was previously employed by NestlÃ© and has received financial support for research from companies including PepsiCo and General Mills.

There is no suggestion that the scientists failed to declare potential conflicts of interest. Each provided declarations of interests before the briefing, which the Science Media Centre shared with journalists. However, there was no mention of their links to UPF manufacturers in any of the media coverage.

""Evidence is very clear that to protect our health and prevent diet-related disease, we should be reducing consumption of UPF, especially products high in fat, salt and sugar,"" said Barbara Crowther, the manager of the children's food campaign at Sustain, the food and farming advocacy group. ""Suggesting that some UPFs can be labelled healthy is not only confusing for people but potentially very dangerous for public health.""

Duane Mellor, a registered dietitian and senior lecturer at Aston medical school, said: ""It is a problem for the public when messages and the media seem to swing from one side of a debate - UPFs being bad to UPFs being OK. This results in consumers being left confused. It also misses the point of what we should be eating more of, eg vegetables, fruit, pulses etc.

""It also is unhelpful when experts' links to industry are not clear, not because their views are not valid but because in doing so it sets up a false impression that industry and their experts are bad and those saying the opposite are good.""

Cade told the Guardian that her British Nutrition Foundation advisory role was unpaid. ""The BNF is keen to have independent scientists representing the evidence. That is what I aim to do in that role. I believe that to improve our food system we need to have discussion with all parties.""

Wilde said his integrity was ""completely intact"" and his ""views or opinions are not swayed"" by his links to food companies. ""We were simply trying to get a balanced debate around this issue, and such headlines don't always help, but if it gets a healthy public debate going around the subject and people get a better understanding of the arguments then I guess it will be worth it.""

Forde said: ""I don't think anyone made claims that all UPF are good or bad, but rather than the current system of classification is unsuitable to make widespread public health recommendations. The recommendation to avoid all ultra-processed foods may also lead consumers to remove nutritionally balanced foods from their diets.""

Fiona Fox, the chief executive of the Science Media Centre, said: ""The SMC regularly runs background briefings where journalists can question leading scientists on topical issues so that the public get good quality evidence. We choose the scientists based on their expertise, reputation and area of research.

""The scientists who spoke at our briefing on ultra-processed foods are publicly funded academics. However, senior scientists these days are encouraged by universities and funders to have contact with a wide array of partners including industry so that scientific research has impact on wider society. We make sure that any links with industry are openly declared to journalists.""

A ""˜harmless' sample of cells from one pig can produce millions of tons of ""˜cultivated meat' and is touted as far better for the climate

It was a confronting moment for a vegetarian. First, a pork meatball and then slices of bacon, balanced in a sort of mini BLT, were served to eat by beaming, expectant hosts. The meat even came from a named pig, an affable-looking swine called Dawn.

With some trepidation, I sliced into the meatball and ate it. I then took a nibble of the bacon. It was my first taste of meat in 11 years, a confounding experience made possible by the fact that Dawn, gamboling in a field in upstate New York, did not die for this meal.

Instead a clump of her cells were grown in a lab to create what's known as ""cultivated meat"", a product touted as far better for the climate - as well as the mortal concerns of pigs and cows - and is set for takeoff in the US.

""A harmless sample from one pig can produce many millions of tons of product without requiring us to raise and slaughter an animal each time,"" said Eitan Fischer, founder of Mission Barns, a maker of cultivated meat that invited the Guardian to a taste test in an upscale Manhattan hotel. The meatball was succulent, the bacon was crisp and, even to a vegetarian, both had the undeniable quality of meat.

""We got that sample from Dawn and she's living freely and happily,"" said Fischer, whose company has identified a ""donor"" cow, chicken and duck for future cultivated meat ranges. ""This industry will absolutely be transformative to our food system as people move toward consuming these types of products.""

Mission Barns is one of about 80 startup companies based around San Francisco's Bay Area now jostling for position after one of their number, Upside Foods, became the first in the country to be granted approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November, a key step in allowing the sale of cultivated meat in the US. On Monday, Upside said it aims to start selling its cultivated chicken in restaurants this year, and in grocery stores by 2028.

More than $2bn has been invested in the sector since 2020 and many of the new ventures aren't waiting for regulatory approval before building facilities. In December, a company called Believer Meats broke ground on a $123m facility in North Carolina it claims will be the largest cultivated meat plant in the world, set to churn out 10,000 tons of product annually once operational.

So far cultivated meat - the nascent industry settled on this name over lab-grown or cellular meat - has only started selling in Singapore, where another Bay Area contender, called Eat Just, was given the green light to sell chicken breast and tenders in 2020. But the ""world is experiencing a food revolution"", as the FDA put it, with the rise of cultivated meat holding the promise of slashing the meat industry's ruinous planet-heating emissions and shrinking its voracious appetite for land, as well as sparing livestock the barbarity of factory farming.

""We know we can't really hit the goals in the Paris climate agreement without addressing meat consumption and we think alternative proteins are the best way to address that,"" said Elliot Swartz, lead scientist on cultivated meat at the Good Food Institute (GFI) who envisions a sort of ""all the above"" approach where cultivated meat, plant-based offerings like Impossible burgers and simply giving up the pork chops and steaks help soften the impact of a growing, and potentially disastrous, global appetite for meat.

The raising and slaughter of livestock is responsible for more than half of the greenhouse gas pollution of the entire food sector, which in itself is estimated to contribute around a third of total global emissions. Faced with the need to reach ""peak meat"", cultivated meat has been pushed forward as a solution as it can cut emissions by around 17% for chicken and up to 92% for beef, the meat that weighs heaviest on the planet, GFI's research has found.

Vast areas of land, much of it deforested for grazing and vulnerable to outbreaks of zoonotic diseases, meanwhile, could be freed up if meat is instead conjured up in the sort of 30,000 sq ft facility Mission Barns operates. Eating something that's not been fed with copious amounts of antibiotics is of particular public appeal, too, the company's research has found.

""The production process is more efficient, you have significantly less feed material to get the same amount of calories out and you have a huge opportunity to restore ecosystems and slow biodiversity loss,"" said Swartz. ""It enables a way to mitigate all of these hard, sticky global challenges.""

A report last week identified a rise in plant based meat alternatives as one of three ""super tipping points"" that could trigger a cascade of decarbonisation across the global economy, alongside boosting electric vehicles and green fertilisers. It found a 20% market share by 2035 would mean 400m-800m hectares of land would no longer be needed for livestock and their fodder, equivalent to 7-15% of the world's farmland today, the report estimated.

This challenge is particularly stark in the US, the world's largest producer of beef and chicken and the second largest producer of pork, a country where meat-eating is deeply embedded through ingrained habit or the lack of available, affordable alternatives to the point that each American eats more than 260lb of meat each year, on average, a figure that appears to be edging up.

An excited, yet brief, craze over Impossible and Beyond Meat has underscored American desires for actual meat, rather than plant-based imitations. ""In consumer research a lot of people say, ""˜I'm not eating that plant stuff, I don't care how good it tastes,'"" said Swartz.

The goal for Mission Barns, which hopes to get its own FDA approval shortly and has a range of bacon, meatballs and sausages ready to distribute, is to ""appeal to folks who love eating bacon and who love eating meatballs"", according to Fischer, who himself has been vegetarian for more than a decade. ""Whether it's consciously or subconsciously we crave and desire the flavor of animal meat. Plant-based alternatives come close to mimicking them.

""But for folks who want that real flavor, I think giving them real pork is definitely the way to go. If we want something that tastes like bacon, it's not going to be enough to have a piece of tempeh and call it bacon.""

Since launching in 2018, Mission Barns has embarked on a PR offensive while developing its product, gathering information for regulators and raising money (investors put $24m toward a ""pilot plant"" in 2021). A sprawling kitchen that would look at home on TV show set has hosted lawmakers and potential customers (Steny Hoyer, a prominent congressional Democrat, was apparently a huge fan of the bacon) and a handful of outlets have agreed to stock its products once they are approved for sale.

Many of the emerging cultivated meat ventures have some sort of niche - companies that aim to sell lab-grown sushi-grade salmon, or bluefin tuna or even foie gras - and Mission Barns' is one of efficiency, by growing animal fat rather than more laborious and costly muscle and tissue. The fat, which has proteins and seasoning added to it, is created through growing cells in sturdy bioreactors, which replicate the growth of an animal.

The use of these cultivators, which are more usually deployed by the biopharmaceutical industry to manufacture drugs, presents an issue for cultivated meat because they more typically create small batches at high cost, whereas the food industry requires this equation to be reversed. Creating the first lab-grown burger cost $330,000 back in 2013, and while there have been improvements, the price tag is still a barrier to quickly scale production to rival the traditional meat industry in the short term. Eat Just has a chicken nugget that it said in 2019 costs $50 to make, though its prices have now come down.

The process can also be energy intensive, as meat cultivation has to replicate the heating and cooling of an animal, which will require running on a renewable-heavy grid to avoid adding to emissions. But beyond the practical obstacles the onset of cultivated meat raises broader questions. Will the public see any reason to switch to this newly formed flesh? And will this change the concept of what it means to eat ethically?

The intended audience for cultivated meat may be those who eat meat at least once a day, to help them sidestep to a more environmentally friendly option without giving up flesh entirely, but the advent of meat from a lab does pose philosophical questions for vegetarians.

If you don't eat meat because of animal welfare or climate reasons, what happens when these issues are stripped away from the food? How much is being a vegetarian about those sort of values, beyond the act of eating meat itself? I pondered this as I dealt with a sort of claggy, oily feeling in a mouth unused to eating meat. Others are less conflicted.

""I fully plan on eating this stuff when it's more available in the US,"" said Swartz, who has been a vegetarian for the past four years. ""People don't give up meat because it tastes bad, it's other motivations. I think we will need some new word, like cultivarian, or something like that.""

A high-tech micro-dairy called Floating Farm in Rotterdam is helping rethink agriculture in the age of climate crisis

Samuel L Jackson can have his snakes on a plane. Peter and Minke van Wingerden have concocted something even wilder: a herd of cows floating on the sea.

The Dutch husband-and-wife team's experiment on sustainable agriculture, a hi-tech micro-dairy called Floating Farm, can be found bobbing in the port of Rotterdam. The modernist structure houses 40 Maas-Rijn-Ijssel cows, who collectively produce some 200 gallons (757 liters) of milk a day. In addition to helping nourish the local community, the waterborne farm is playing a part in the global conversation about how the climate crisis is pushing farmers to reconsider how - and where - they produce food.

Floods, extreme heating, megadroughts and even rising night temperatures have sent the food system off its axis and cost the US farm industry alone over $1bn. The race to outsmart the constant onslaught of extreme weather is well under way: a team of scientists in Mexico is developing wheat strains that are climate-resilient, while Jack's Solar Garden in Longmont, Colorado, is a testbed for the emerging method of agrivoltaic farming - a space-efficient system that allows for solar arrays and traditional farming to coexist on the same patch of land, a multi-tasking innovation that proponents say results in a greater crop yield than traditional farming. ""If you have a strong ecological system underneath the solar panels"", says Byron Kominek, Jack's third-generation owner, ""you're able to have a win-win for climate change.""

Joshua Faulkner, a research assistant professor and the program coordinator for the University of Vermont's farming and climate change program, says extreme weather has rendered the world of farming unrecognizable from what it was only decades ago. ""Farmers used to be able to count on certain things being normal, like dates of planting and dates of harvesting. Over the past 10 to 15 years, these assumptions have been thrown out the window and farmers are having to rewrite the book.""

For their part, the Van Wingerdens are betting on a method that does without the land altogether. A former property developer with a background in engineering, Peter found his inspiration for the Floating Farm in a climate catastrophe half a world away. On a visit to New York City in the aftermath of 2012's Hurricane Sandy, which battered the north-east US, he saw how flooding hampered the delivery of fresh food to millions, a problem he was all but certain would become more severe in the coming years. So he turned to his expertise in aquatic architecture and created nearly 10,000 sq ft (929 sq meters) of space for farming that floats on the water. If successful, his experiment would not be vulnerable to rising sea levels or destructive floods.

Rotterdam has already established itself as one of the most climate-adaptive places in the world. Everything from office buildings to entire neighborhoods are built on water in the city, which is 90% below sea level. The Van Wingerdens' floating dairy farm was a new but inevitable twist. Should a weather crisis arise, a waterborne farm isn't necessarily stuck in place. An urban farm that serves city dwellers also reduces carbon emissions associated with food transportation. And a farm on water also helps to take a little pressure off the ""global land squeeze"", a term conservationists use to describe the ever-growing tension that arises when a finite amount of land results in an increasing amount of wild terrain being given over to agriculture in order to serve the appetite for ""food, feed, fuel and fiber"", explains Janet Ranganathan, the managing director for strategy, learning and results at the World Resources Institute, a global research-based NGO that focuses on sustainable land use.

The Van Wingerdens' experimental farm floats on pontoons, rising and falling with the tides (which, in Rotterdam, fluctuate about eight feet each day). The rubber-floored barn occupying the top level of the structure is where the cows are robotically milked, mucked and fed (they can also walk down a gangplank to a waterside patch of pasture). The middle level is where the milk is processed into butter, yogurt and other dairy products. It is on this level where rain and desalinated seawater are purified for the cows' consumption. The animals' manure, meanwhile, is processed for fertilizer that is used on local soccer fields - whose grass clippings return as feed. At the bottom of the structure is a naturally cool space used for ripening up to 1,000 wheels of gouda-style cheese at a time, some flavored with curry, others with wild garlic - all for sale through the farm shop. In other words, it's a circular system that is self-sustaining - not just ecologically, but economically.

The Van Wingerdens' model is ripe for reproduction - which is exactly what the Floating Farm's team of 14 are working on now. Plans are in the works for a floating vegetable farm to move into the space next to the current Floating Farm. Permit applications are also out for similar structures in Dubai, Singapore and the Dutch cities of Haarlem and Arnhem.

The new ventures will apply lessons learned from the original Rotterdam project. ""You need to build a house in order to know how to build a house,"" Peter says. Some of his key takeaways have been practical, such as those to do with mechanics on how farm materials flow through a waterborne structure. He's also learned a great deal about dealing with bureaucracy and entrenched thinking.

The biggest obstacles he sees ahead are not financial or physical, but rather political and administrative. ""As a world, we are in such a need to find solutions for the upcoming 30 years,"" Peter says. ""One of the biggest challenges we come across worldwide is regulations. Cities need to have disruptive thinking. Cities need to have disruptive departments. Cities need to have areas where you can say: OK, this is the experimental zone."" Because what Peter and his team are pulling off is of a different order than your typical sustainability measures. ""We are not innovative,"" he says. ""We are disruptive.""

Better farming techniques across the world could lead to storage of 31 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide a year, data shows

Marginal improvements to agricultural soils around the world would store enough carbon to keep the world within 1.5C of global heating, new research suggests.

Farming techniques that improve long-term fertility and yields can also help to store more carbon in soils but are often ignored in favour of intensive techniques using large amounts of artificial fertiliser, much of it wasted, that can increase greenhouse gas emissions.

Using better farming techniques to store 1% more carbon in about half of the world's agricultural soils would be enough to absorb about 31 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide a year, according to new data. That amount is not far off the 32 gigatonnes gap between current planned emissions reduction globally per year and the amount of carbon that must be cut by 2030 to stay within 1.5C.

The estimates were carried out by Jacqueline McGlade, the former chief scientist at the UN environment programme and former executive director of the European Environment Agency. She found that storing more carbon in the top 30cm of agricultural soils would be feasible in many regions where soils are currently degraded.

McGlade now leads a commercial organisation that sells soil data to farmers. Downforce Technologies uses publicly available global data, satellite images and lidar to assess in detail how much carbon is stored in soils, which can now be done down to the level of individual fields.

""Outside the farming sector, people do not understand how important soils are to the climate,"" said McGlade. ""Changing farming could make soils carbon negative, making them absorb carbon, and reducing the cost of farming.""

She said farmers could face a short-term cost while they changed their methods, away from the overuse of artificial fertiliser, but after a transition period of two to three years their yields would improve and their soils would be much healthier.

She estimated it would cost about $1m (£790,000) to restore 40,000 hectares (99,000 acres) of what is currently badly degraded farmland in Kenya, an area that is home to about 300,000 people.

Downforce data could also allow farmers to sell carbon credits based on how much additionalcarbon dioxide their fields are absorbing. Soil has long been known to be one of Earth's biggest stores of carbon, but until now it has not been possible to examine in detail how much carbon soils in particular areas are locking up and how much they are emitting. About 40% of the world's farmland is now degraded, according to UN estimates.

Carbon dioxide removal, the name given to a suite of technologies and techniques that increase the uptake of carbon dioxide from the air and sequester the carbon in some form, is an increasing area of interest, as the world slips closer to the critical threshold of 1.5C of global heating above pre-industrial levels.

Arable farmers could sequester more carbon within their soils by changing their crop rotation, planting cover crops such as clover, or using direct drilling, which allows crops to be planted without the need for ploughing. Livestock farmers could improve their soils by growing more native grasses.

Hedgerows also help to sequester carbon in the soil, because they have large underground networks of mycorrhizal fungi and microbes that can extend metres into the field. Farmers have spent decades removing hedgerows to make intensive farming easier, but restoring them, and maintaining existing hedgerows, would improve biodiversity, reduce the erosion of topsoil, and help to stop harmful agricultural runoff, which is a key polluter of rivers.

Smoke from blazes lingered over Ohio and other states in the corn belt affecting maturation, raising fears of crop damage

It was early November and Scott Haerr still had 2,500 acres of corn to harvest on his farm in south-west Ohio.

The harvest should be much further down the road - a dry spring was followed by adequate summer rain and heat, and then a dry fall meant no obvious delays were in the forecast. But the crop, he said, just hadn't ripened on cue.

""We knew that we were well behind the normal crop stage when [the corn plants] did not pollinate until at least 10 days to two weeks after we normally should have, last July,"" says Haerr. ""Usually by mid-September, our early planted corn is mature enough to harvest. This year it was hard to find anything ready by 1 October.""

Haerr thought he might have to pause harvesting. ""The moisture levels are really high,"" he said.

Haerr was initially puzzled at the slow maturation but believes he has hit on the culprit: smoke from wildfires in Canada that lingered over Ohio and the wider eastern corn belt for days last June and July - a critical time for corn plant development.

While the corn he is harvesting is currently yielding well, Haerr fears its high moisture content could push the remainder of his harvest into winter when bad weather could damage some or all of the remainder of his crop.

""The fear is a storm or heavy wind could down this, that the weather shuts us down before we get the work done,"" he said.

For a time last June and July, 18 states from New York to Montana were under air quality alerts as more than 600 wildfires burned out of control in Canada, which suffered its worst ever wildfire season in 2023. While the smoke created breathing difficulties for thousands of people, the growing cycle of crops suffered too.

Today's corn hybrids are carefully engineered with specific temperature conditions in mind, meaning minor or unexpected changes to weather can result in negative knock-on effects.

Data from Pioneer Hi-Bred International, a major seed company, shows that low growth periods last June correspond to days of heavy wildfire smoke over Ohio, Indiana and elsewhere that fueled low solar radiation corn depends on to grow.

Today, the corn harvest in Ohio is lagging more than 8% behind the five-year average, though it had been as much as 20%. Currently, harvest progress in states closest to some of the worst of last summer's wildfire smoke - Wisconsin (65%), Michigan (52%) and Ohio (70%) - lags far behind the national average of 88%.

Corn is one of the world's most important grains. Last year, the US exported $18.57bn worth of corn, most of which went to China where it is used to feed pigs that are harvested for tens of millions of Chinese consumers.

America's biggest crop, corn is also used for ethanol fuel, animal feed and in the production of countless foodstuffs. America's Corn Belt is centered in Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and other states close to Canada. Corn, a grass, is more sensitive to lower light than the other major US crop - soybeans - because it requires more photosynthesis.

With wildfires more likely affecting America's Corn Belt as the planet warms, a combination of the wrong conditions could disrupt the growing of a cornerstone food source for millions of people.

""Climate change is increasing the risk of drought and wildfires in certain areas of the world,"" said Aaron Wilson, state climatologist of Ohio with Ohio State University.

""What brought us the cooler than average temperatures this year was that northerly [air] flow out of Canada, well it so happens that also brought the wildfire smoke.""

Corn growers are facing another concern as winter approaches: weak corn stalks.

""The plant is predetermined to maximize yield so if there's a shortcoming of photosynthesis [during the growing period], it's going to rob that energy from sugars that were stored up in the stalk ""¦ making it more susceptible to stalk rot,"" said Kyle Poling, a field agronomist at Pioneer.

With the windiest period of the year approaching, weak corn plants in the eastern corn belt are at increased risk of being downed.

Experts, however, note that lower temperatures caused by wildfire smoke are not always a negative for crops. Reduced solar radiation as a result of smoke can help slow moisture being drawn from the soil into the atmosphere.

Poling says that while wildfire smoke may have played an indirect role in delayed maturation last summer, other factors were at play, too. ""The smoke acted as a barrier for radiant heat but there was also below average heat accumulation [on days] where we didn't have any haze,"" he says.

So far, America's 2023 corn harvest is set to return high yields. And corn growers can avoid having to harvest later in the year by choosing to plant seed hybrids that ripen more quickly.

But those corn types result in lower yields, reducing the overall profits of growers such as Haerr, who has a team of eight people - including two of his sons - working on this year's harvest. Corn containing high moisture levels can be harvested, but farmers then face a difficult choice of selling at far lower prices or paying huge fuel costs to dry the grain to prevent it from spoiling.

Haerr wouldn't speculate whether climate crisis has played a role in delaying his harvest, or whether he expects more wildfires in the future, though researchers say the climate crisis has more than doubled the likelihood of ""extreme fire weather conditions"" in eastern Canada.

Right now, he said his harvest would not be finished for some time. ""We're figuring that this year it's going to be into December. We're just hoping the weather doesn't turn bad.""

138,"US agency refuses to examine toxicity of ""˜inactive' pesticide chemicals to crops","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/09/epa-cfs-toxic-inactive-ingredients-pesticides","US agency refuses to examine toxicity of ""˜inactive' pesticide chemicals to crops

EPA says too many pesticide formulas exist to check all for the safety of ingredients that could harm humans, plants and wildlife

Ingredients labeled as ""inactive"" in pesticide formulas are potentially poisoning the environment, crops and animals, but the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has rebuffed calls to examine their toxicity and risks.

Agency rules do not require the EPA to account for inactive ingredients when it evaluates pesticide formula safety, despite the fact that industry labels dangerous substances like per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) as inert.

A 2017 Center for Food Safety (CFS) legal petition asked the EPA to close the loophole, but the agency denied the request this week. Many of the 18,000 pesticides approved for use by the EPA will likely remain more toxic than anyone knows, said Bill Freese, the science director at CFS.

""The idea that we're not assessing the actual chemicals that farmers spray is kind of ridiculous,"" Freese said.

CFS, along with several other organizations, filed the petition when the agency was under the direction of Donald Trump-appointee Scott Pruitt. The EPA effectively ignored the petition, CFS said, until the groups sued the agency to force it to respond.

The groups argued that inactive ingredients are added to pesticides to improve their performance by making them more toxic to the organisms they target. But that can also make a pesticide formula more toxic to the wildlife, humans and plants that are not targeted.

""People sometimes don't make the jump from ""˜more effective at killing the pest', which sounds like a good thing, to ""˜more toxic for everyone else' which is what ""˜more effective' means,"" Freese said. ""What about people, butterflies or anything other than [pests like] corn rootworm?""

In its response, the EPA claimed too many pesticide formulas exist for the agency to check them all for safety. It also said the formula changes once a pesticide is sprayed and dispersed, so an evaluation of the entire product in its packaging would be misleading.

Inactive ingredients are usually added as surfactants or penetrating agents that help disperse the active ingredients or make them more absorbable. About 4,000 inert ingredients are approved for use by the EPA, along with 1,000 active ingredients, and industry is not required to publicly disclose its formulas because they are considered trade secrets.

Among dangerous ""inert"" ingredients public health advocates know are added to pesticide formulas are PFAS, a chemical class of which many are extremely toxic at low doses. Another, polyethoxylated tallow amine (POEA), can harm or kill amphibians at very low exposure levels.

While it is dangerous on its own, POEA is also added to Roundup, a widely used and controversial pesticide. Roundup's active ingredient is glyphosate, which is considered a probable carcinogen, and POEA helps plants absorb glyphosate. But Freese noted that glyphosate is not as carcinogenic without the addition of POEA, and some researchers suspect the ingredients synergise to make the product more toxic.

Research also shows that POEA helps human skin absorb the chemical, but the chemical is still not considered when the EPA assesses Roundup's toxicity, Freese said.

A similar synergistic effect is seen in a class of surfactant chemicals called organosilicones that are added to neonicotinoid pesticides, which are thought to be killing bees. Research shows organosilicones are toxic to bees in isolation and impair their learning ability, but can be deadly when combined with neonicotinoids.

CFS noted broader research that compared toxicity of active ingredients to whole formulations and found almost all were at least ""several hundred times more toxic than their active principle"".

The law is clear around the issue and the EPA must consider the entire formula, say public health advocates. The petition points to Congress's ""unambiguous"" language in the laws governing pesticide use stating that the product ""will perform its intended function without unreasonable adverse effects on the environment"".

""The language says nothing about active ingredients,"" states the CFS petition.

Meanwhile, the federal government's definition of ""pesticide"" is ""any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest"".

""The definition is right there,"" CFS senior attorney Sylvia Wu told the Guardian, highlighting the word ""mixture"". The public health groups are ""analyzing their legal options"" and may bring a suit, she added.

The EPA in recent decades acknowledged inactive chemicals can be harmful.

""The safety of the formulation, including all its ingredients, is a critical factor in whether the pesticide will perform its intended function without unreasonable adverse effects on the environment,"" the EPA wrote in a 2009 rulemaking document. At the time, the EPA had proposed requiring companies to put inert ingredients on pesticide labels, but that never happened and the rule was revoked in 2014.

The EPA's response stated that it did not need to test the entire formula because once sprayed, humans and other organisms ""are not typically exposed to the intact formulation in a long-term, repeated exposure"".

Freese acknowledged the counterpoint, but added that the response is still wrong: ""There's a little truth in that, but their solution seems to be to ignore the inert ingredients all together.""

The EPA has plenty of data to show that many inactive ingredients are harmful, Wu added, and the agency seemed to acknowledge in its response that it has the authority to require more information, but it chose not to. The decision is ""disappointing but not surprising"", she said.

""It's unfortunate that they want to live in this loophole,"" Wu added.

Study proposes government commission more research into environmental benefits of cattle feed additives

Sweden is one step closer to making the use of methane-reducing cow feed additives such as seaweed government policy after experts recommended further investigation into the area.

A report by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency into reduced methane emissions says development in the field has been ""rapid in recent years"" and is among ""a number of new interesting additives with higher potential"".

Among the cow feed additives cited in the report were the seaweed red algae and the chemical 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP).

According to manufacturers, the daily feeding of red algae (where the active substance is bromoform) can reduce the methane emissions of meat animals by up to 90%. But, the agency said, more knowledge on cultivation and use was needed.

3-NOP, which has been fed to several cattle categories in Sweden and elsewhere, has been approved for use in dairy cows in the EU since February 2022. The chemical can cut methane emissions by an average of about 30% in dairy cows, according to the report, and by 45% in meat cattle.

The discovery about the effects of feeding seaweed was originally made by researchers in Australia and works by preventing microorganisms in the cow's first stomach from producing methane.

While some feed additives ""appear to have significant potential"", it warns that there is still uncertainty over the long-term effects and factors preventing it from being used more within production systems.

""More research and analysis is required both in terms of today's marketed products and to develop alternative, future feed additives,"" says the report.

As a result of its findings, the study proposes that the government commission the agency, along with other authorities, to further investigate the area.

Lines of inquiry, it says, should include socioeconomic impact, support for farmers and other stages in the food chain, improved research, innovation initiatives and increased collaboration with the industry.

Other potential areas of investigation for ""climate-smart cows"", it says, are enhancing productivity and genetic variations between breeds on how much methane they produce.

In 2021, Sweden's agricultural sector produced 3.6m tonnes of CO2 equivalents of methane - 2.9m tonnes of which were produced by cattle digestion.

Emma Carlen, a climate analyst at the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, said: ""We believe that this [methane-reducing feed additives] can be a measure to reduce the methane from cattle in Sweden. We don't have very many other measures that can have this affect within current production level. But we also believe it's still quite new and there's still more research to be done before we can really come in with a clear policy measure.""

The extra cost of such measures was a big constraint for farmers, she said, which is why they wanted to look at what financial support might be needed, as well as other measures.

Fredrik Ã…kerman, the co-founder and CEO of Volta Greentech, which is developing a land-based seaweed factory on the west coast of Sweden to make cattle feed, said in its pilot projects across two Swedish farms so far it had reduced cows' methane emissions by 80% a day.

Next year, the company, which started five years ago, is planning another pilot project at a commercial beef farm in the UK.

""We have developed a strategy that makes cows burp and fart less methane emissions,"" he said. ""So the additive is included into the cow feed and we have now been able, in several commercial pilot projects, to reduce 80% of emissions per day that the cows emit, which is of course making a big positive impact on climate change and agriculture.""

By installing a sensor on the farm, they are able to measure methane emissions before and after the introduction of the feed, data which is then verified by a third party.

The report's recommendations are vital for the industry's development, said Ã…kerman. ""To maintain profitability in the industry, it's quite difficult for us to sell a product that costs money to reduce emissions if the incentives are not there. So the policy development is very important,"" he added. ""It has been lagging behind other industries.

Study suggests antimicrobial used to promote livestock growth breeds bacteria more resistant to our natural defences

The blanket use of antibiotics in farming has led to the emergence of bacteria that are more resistant to the human immune system, scientists have warned.

The research suggests that the antimicrobial colistin, which was used for decades as a growth promoter on pig and chicken farms in China, resulted in the emergence of E coli strains that are more likely to evade our immune system's first line of defence.

Although colistin is now banned as a livestock food additive in China and many other countries, the findings sound an alarm over a new and significant threat posed by the overuse of antibiotic drugs.

""This is potentially much more dangerous than resistance to antibiotics,"" said Prof Craig MacLean, who led the research at the University of Oxford. ""It highlights the danger of indiscriminate use of antimicrobials in agriculture. We've accidentally ended up compromising our own immune system to get fatter chickens.""

The findings could also have significant implications for the development of new antibiotic medicines in the same class as colistin, known as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which the scientists suggest could pose a particular risk of compromising innate immunity.

AMPs are compounds produced by most living organisms in their innate immune response, which is the first line of defence against infection. Colistin is based on a bacterial AMP - microbes use the compounds to shield themselves against competitors - but is chemically similar to some AMPs produced in the human immune system.

The extensive use of colistin in livestock from the 1980s triggered the emergence and spread of E coli bacteria carrying colistin resistance genes, which eventually prompted widespread restrictions on the drug's use in agriculture. But the latest study suggests the same genes also allow pathogens to more readily evade AMPs that form a cornerstone of our own immune response.

In the study, E coli carrying a resistance gene, called MCR-1, were exposed to AMPs known to play important roles in innate immunity in chickens, pigs, and humans. The bacteria were also tested for their susceptibility to human blood serum.

The scientists found that E coli carrying the MCR-1 gene were at least twice as resistant to being killed by human serum. On average, the gene increased resistance to human and animal AMPs by 62% compared with bacteria that lacked the gene. The study, published in the journal eLife, also showed that the resistant E coli was twice as likely to kill moth larvae that were injected with the infection, compared with the control E coli strain.

MacLean said it was not possible to estimate how this might translate into real-world consequences, such as the risk of an E coli infection leading to sepsis and death. And the prevalence of these strains of E coli have dropped steeply since China banned the use of colistin as a growth promoter, suggesting that these genes carry other ""fitness disadvantages"" for the pathogens. However, the findings highlight a fundamental risk that has not yet been extensively considered.

""The danger is that if bacteria evolve resistance to [AMP-based drugs], it could also make bacteria resistant to one of the pillars of our immune system,"" said MacLean.

Antimicrobial resistance poses a dire global threat - the UN has warned that as many as 10 million people a year could be dying by 2050 as a result of superbugs - and so the need for new antibiotics is pressing. There is growing interest in the potential of AMPs as drugs, and some of those in development include drugs based on human AMPs.

MacLean and colleagues are not calling for the development of such drugs to be put on hold, but say extremely careful risk assessments of the likelihood of resistance emerging and the potential consequences are required. ""For AMPs, there are potentially very serious negative consequences,"" he said.

Dr Jessica Blair, of the University of Birmingham, who was not involved in the study, said: ""Antimicrobial peptides, including colistin, have been heralded as a potential part of the solution to the rise of multidrug-resistant infections. This study, however, suggests that resistance to these antimicrobials may have unintended consequences on the ability of pathogens to cause infection and survive within the host.""

Dr George Tegos, of Mohawk Valley Health System in New York, said that broad conclusions about the potential risks of AMPs could not be drawn from a single study, but added that the findings ""raise concerns that are reasonable and make sense"".

CÃ³ilÃ­n Nunan, an adviser to the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics, who was not involved in the study, said: ""This new study shows that colistin resistance is probably even more dangerous than previously thought ""¦ It is also remarkable that the British government is still opposed to banning preventative mass medication of intensively farmed animals with antibiotics, even though the EU banned such use over a year ago.""

Legislation now appears to be on hold after ferocious pushback from powerful farming lobbies

Meat lobby groups fought a ""hard and dirty"" war against a planned EU ban on caged hens and pigs that has now been shelved, the Guardian can reveal.

In 2021 EU politicians took the radical step of agreeing to phase out the use of cages for rearing farmed animals, including hens, broilers, pigs, calves, rabbits and quails, after receiving a petition signed by more than a million people. The measures, which were supposed to go through by the end of 2023, have the support of 89% of European citizens, according to an EU survey released last week.

But a ferocious pushback from powerful farming lobbies, details of which have been seen by an investigation by the Guardian and a media consortium led by Lighthouse Reports, means that the legislation now appears to be on hold.

Industry groups levelled backstage accusations of bias against the EU's food safety watchdog, and pushed for a corporate expert to be brought in to rewrite the ban, according to an EU official.

Anja Hazekamp, the vice-chair of the European parliament's environment committee, said: ""Industry fought really hard and dirty on this file. They tried everything they could think of because they know we desperately need animal welfare legislation to make our food system more sustainable and humane, and this was their last chance. They don't want to change, but see that change is inevitable so they're getting desperate. They will do anything to save their skins.""

One EU official close to the issue told the Guardian that agribusiness lobbying had put ""really aggressive pressure"" on the commission that ""enabled"" the delay.

""There was a strong presence of the industry on this file at different levels,"" the official said. ""There was a stream of negativity [from them]. All the dissuading arguments at a political level were built step-by-step by a set of very negative letters and positions and information that [industry] produced.""

Lobbyists ""targeted senior levels in the commission"" at strategic moments in the legislative process ""using privileged channels"", the insider said. After this, high-level attitudes towards the legislation became ""extremely negative"", the official added.

The lobbyists may have been pushing at an open door, according to a second EU official, who said that the EU's agriculture directorate viewed environmental and welfare laws as ""things to be resisted. That is just the psychology of the directorate. It's like: ""˜Fortress Agri must defend itself from all the people who want to change things.'""

At one point a number of groups submitted a 60-page analysis arguing that a positive European Food Safety Authority (Efsa) assessment of the planned package was not ""impartial"" and contained ""serious scientific errors"".

""This type of pressure on Efsa over a scientific outcome is always troubling,"" the official said.

The 60-page analysis was aimed at ""discrediting the work of the commission - the scientific work in particular - and complaining about a lack of transparency in the work done on economics and competitiveness"", the official said.

Lobbyists argued to EU officials that the ban would effectively destroy the EU's farming sector, according to minutes of the meeting released under freedom of information laws: ""If the [animal welfare] bar will be raised very high, production will disappear from Europe.""

This gloomy line was reinforced by another letter to the commission from the muscular EU farm union Copa-Cogeca, which said that Efsa's opinion would ""lead to the loss of most of the European poultry sector, meat and eggs combined"".

One group ""even proposed an expert [to rewrite] the commission's impact assessment who was actually a senior researcher from a top American [poultry] producer,"" the first official said. ""It was amazing.""

One new lobby group - European Livestock Voice (ELV) - was notably active, two EU officials said. ELV was set up as an activist-style network, using tactics borrowed from NGOs such as flashmobs, Twitter campaigns and social media organising.

Speaking at a conference in the US earlier this year ELV's frontman in Brussels, Andrea Bertaglio, told the audience: ""We are all focused in Brussels at least, on the revision of the animal welfare legislation.""

Bertaglio told the Guardian that he wanted to avoid a polarised US-style culture war over meat-eating but ""we are speaking about culture a lot when we speak about livestock"", he said. ""Culture in terms of our behaviour, our habits, it's a very cultural, sociological and philosophical subject in terms of our approach.""

Bertaglio, who was formerly an environmental journalist - and still calls himself one - also spoke out against what he called a constant ""propaganda which is connecting ""¦ meat consumption and climate and environment in a way that makes children feel constantly guilty and uncomfortable"".

ELV is not listed in the EU's transparency registry and the group declined to answer questions about its funding, how it was set up, or its lobbying on the animal welfare package.

The 2023 deadline for the EU's animal welfare legislation has now been missed and the law was dropped from the commission's work programme for 2024.

A commission spokesperson, who asked not to be named, said the commission was ""reflecting on and carefully assessing important aspects, including the related costs and the appropriate length of the transition period"" for its animal welfare legislation. ""It is important to have the support of all involved to make these proposals a success,"" the official added.

147,"""˜Everything is natural and tastes so good': microfarms push back against ""˜food apartheid'","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/10/local-food-microfarms-equity","""˜Everything is natural and tastes so good': microfarms push back against ""˜food apartheid'

Bipoc-led local farms in unconventional spaces decentralize systems that have produced food deserts and create food equity

On a recent Sunday morning in South Los Angeles, Crop Swap LA volunteers and staffers harvested bags of freshly picked produce from the front yard of a residence. Located just steps from Leimert Park Plaza, Asante Microfarm is the first of what will be numerous microfarms created by the organization, which is dedicated to growing hyperlocal food on unused spaces ""in the neighborhood, exclusively for the neighborhood"".

""Everything we're growing is nutrient-dense and the food remains in the neighborhood,"" says Jamiah Hargins, who founded Crop Swap LA in 2018 as a small monthly swap of surplus produce. After spending years in finance and consulting, Hargins decided to create a local food distribution system to address the fact that his neighborhood was a food desert, meaning most residents have little access to healthy food. It's now one of many Bipoc-led groups across the US that are reclaiming their agricultural heritage and redefining the local food movement by growing on traditional farms and unconventional spaces such as yards, medians and vacant lots as a way to increase food security and health in their own communities.

Crop Swap LA members live within one mile of one of the organization's microfarms and receive their weekly bags of produce within hours of harvest - which Hargins says is far more nutritious than buying produce that's been sitting on trucks or in storage for days and weeks - for $60 (£50) a month (Cal Fresh/EBT users pay $25).

The solar-powered microfarms feature on-site composting and rainwater harvesting, and plants are grown in long mesh containers made from upcycled polypropylene. Harvests have included Swiss chard, tomatoes, red-veined sorrel and pattypan summer squash, among other produce and herbs. A fruit tree harvesting program provides members with honey crisp apples and Asian pears.

Crop Swap LA's third microfarm will debut its first harvest in June and its biggest project yet will be an urban farm that will provide produce for a 10,000 sq ft food incubator and grocery store at the forthcoming Marlton Square development in south Los Angeles's Baldwin Hills neighborhood.

The local food movement has long been led by white upper-class activists, such as Michael Pollan and Alice Waters, which means the needs of diverse communities have often been neglected and the systemic racism that affects the US food system is often ignored.

""Some of the communities that have been systematically kept away from good food are realizing that they can get involved,"" says Hargins, who will introduce workshops and training programs next year so others can replicate his group's efforts. ""Our movement here is about refreshing the whole system, which ends up decentralizing food and creating more equity.""

Naomi Adams, who researches environmental justice at University of California, Los Angeles, says the movement of people growing their own food is gaining momentum and that having autonomy is an imperative for food sovereignty.

""It's empowering to grow food in your own back yard and not have to rely on these food market systems that don't care about these communities at all - they have no interest in actually supporting communities in need,"" says Adams.

Adams notes that the term ""food desert"" isn't entirely accurate since it makes areas sound barren and isn't reflective of what's actually going on in neighborhoods. Adams prefers using the term ""food apartheid"", which describes the system of racist policies that limit access to healthy food in communities.

Even those experiencing food apartheid can still be part of the local food movement, Adams says, whether growing food in a garden or traveling farther afield to access fresh produce.

Adams says that a person's relationship with food - in addition to their awareness and ability to harvest resources around them - results in how and what they eat. ""It matters where people live, but it's not the be-all and end-all,"" they say. ""There are many ways to be resilient in the face of food apartheid.""

South Los Angeles resident Tanya Hayley was taking her son for a haircut when she happened to drive by Crop Swap LA's second microfarm, La Salle, which opened last year. After learning about its mission, Hayley became a member and has since enjoyed Sunday deliveries of grapefruits, oranges, kumquats, red lettuce and herb bundles. ""You can tell that everything is natural and it tastes so good,"" she says. ""I cooked the kale and my son was hovering over the bowl - and he never eats kale.""

There are similar groups run by communities of color across the US.

After the Chicora-Cherokee community in North Charleston, South Carolina, was left without a grocery store for more than 10 years, Fresh Future Farm stepped in. Founded in 2014, the non-profit transformed a vacant lot into a flourishing urban farm that grows bananas, sugarcane, meyer lemons, satsuma oranges, collard greens, okra and tomatoes, among other crops. Two years later, it opened a sliding scale grocery store on the same property - the first one in the area in 11 years.

""Everything we sell from the farm space is harvested to order,"" says Fresh Future Farm co-director Tamazha North. ""We're really a necessity for folks to access food."" The non-profit also teaches home gardening classes, which is inspiring a new crop of home growers. ""Our dream is to have farms and stores in every neighborhood experiencing food insecurity,"" says North.

In New York's lower Hudson valley, Rise & Root Farm is a 5-acre ( 3-hectare) cooperative run by four multiracial LGBTQ+ women. In addition to selling a wide variety of seedlings and plants, their mission is centered on the healing power of food and farming to build a more equitable food system.

""It's a sense of pride when you grow your own food and it's passing on knowledge, storytelling, culture and education,"" says co-owner and farmer Karen Washington, a longtime urban gardener who helped transform empty lots in the Bronx into community gardens. ""For so long, the food movement has definitely been white-led. We're trying to reclaim our culture and heritage when it comes to farming and food.""

Washington, who was awarded the James Beard leadership award in 2014 for her work, says it's important to remember that the US and its food system were ""built on the backs"" of enslaved Black and Indigenous people.

In the US, 95% of farmers are white, while Black, Indigenous and other people of color often encounter challenges when it comes to securing capital, land, credit and infrastructure. In the last 100 years, the number of Black farmers in the US fell from nearly 1 million to 45,000, and Black farmers receive the lowest amount of loans, according to an NPR analysis of USDA data.

""We're trying to make sure that young Black and brown children understand their place in agriculture and in the food system,"" says Washington. ""Their ancestors came from an agrarian culture and they can embrace it, too.""

To fix it, curb the big supermarkets

As major retailers rake in huge profits, they are slashing jobs, squeezing suppliers and hollowing out our food industry

Supermarkets can seem as mundane as public utilities, as dull as plumbing - until something goes wrong. If the plumbing goes wrong, the ceiling collapses. But when the supermarket goes wrong, you can't put food on the table.

The naked vulnerability of the way we produce and sell our food is revealed whenever there is a shock to the system - whether that be fuel protests that disrupt deliveries from distribution warehouses, post-Brexit trade barriers increasing the price of food imported from the EU, or supply crises due to war or climate-related crop failure. In an industry defined by centralisation, concentrated ownership and global supply chains, things go wrong, often, and the problem for us - the shopper, the consumer, the citizen - is our lack of any real alternatives.

More than just retail plumbing, supermarkets are a form of giant economic architecture, but one with fundamental design flaws. The ""house of food"" sits on shaky foundations. It is palpably unsafe for a future full of worsening shocks.

Around a decade ago, the big UK supermarkets enjoyed what was, for them, a golden age. They dominated the market, raking in profit margins far above the international average. For high streets, independent shops, jobs, suppliers, producers and the social glue that holds communities together, it was a different story: one of closures, ghost towns, lost employment and economic thumbscrews being twisted. Regulators found repeated abuses and anti-competitive practices among the supermarkets but only wrung their hands, taking no meaningful action.

I warned about the dangers posed by the power of the supermarkets over a decade ago in my book Tescopoly. At that time, just three supermarkets controlled about 70% of the grocery market. Things have changed since. New companies have entered the UK market, from German discounters Aldi and Lidl to US online giant Amazon, but critical problems remain, not least the vulnerabilities of a still highly concentrated and centralised commercial food chain. Britain's biggest supermarkets have been accused of profiteering amid the current cost of living crisis. This week, research by the consumer group Which? reveals prices have risen significantly over the past two years. Some products have gone up by more than 30% since 2021.

Four companies, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Aldi, now control 66% of the market, with Tesco still by far the most dominant player with over a quarter share (27%).

Such size and power allows any or all of them - whenever they wish - to prioritise profits and pay shareholders and bosses ahead of considering the needs of local communities, the efficiency of the food chain and the economy as a whole. It also makes them hard to regulate.

Supermarkets try to paint themselves as the consumer's friend, but the figures don't add up. In the financial year up to 2022, the largest three retailers took £3.2bn in profit. As food inflation kicked in, Tesco and Sainsbury's made their biggest underlying profits since 2014, and this year are passing on £1.2bn to their shareholders.

The union Unite defines profiteering as ""the act of taking advantage of a situation in order to make a profit, usually by charging high prices for things people need"", and in a report earlier this year concluded the supermarkets have ""used the cost of living crisis to help push profits back up to levels we haven't seen for a decade"".

In June, the inflation rate for food and non-alcoholic drinks was 17.4%, and yet no cost of living crisis has affected supermarket bosses. While public sector workers were being told to rein in pay claims, the chief executive of Sainsbury's took a 36% rise last year, banking £4.9m. Bosses at Tesco and Morrisons also took over £4m each, giving them salaries over 200 times that of their average workers.

As the money rolls in for CEOs and shareholders, the ""cost savings"" and ""efficiencies"" that generate it are often the result of other people's jobs disappearing or being downgraded. Earlier this year, Tesco announced 2,000 planned jobs cuts and Asda 300, with more than 4,000 other Asda workers facing a pay cut; while Sainsbury's has cut thousands of jobs over the past three years.

The Office for National Statistics found that 25% of checkout jobs had already been lost between 2011 and 2017. And the arrival of Amazon means there are now UK supermarkets with no checkout assistants at all - but sensors instead to track what shoppers remove from shelves, and ""just walk out"" technology to bill customers and end queues. This shift affects more than jobs. It creates a more impersonal atmosphere and for some older people, in particular, it may deprive them of their only human contact of the day.

One US supermarket chain recently ruled out replacing cashiers because it said, ""Helping one another just cannot be replaced,"" and ""Employing our neighbours not only benefits this company, it also benefits our communities.""

A host of other supermarket tricks make life hard for those least able to afford food. The Competition and Markets Authority recently identified several practices that it thinks are ""problematic"", including confusing in-store marketing and missing pricing information.

Many low-income households without a car depend on smaller, local stores, but few of the supermarkets' lowest-priced essentials are available there. Which? called this ""shocking"".

Indeed, far from being the consumers' friend, Tesco was censured by the CMA in 2020 for breaking the law by blocking rivals from opening shops near its stores to the detriment of shoppers. And even when the big stores want to lower prices for consumers, it comes at a cost - not to the supermarket, but to already squeezed suppliers who are themselves having to meet higher bills.

Just as we need a more resilient, humane system, we're getting the opposite. The lack of small, independent food growers, producers and retailers leaves us ever more dependent on supermarkets and their self-interest. The pandemic revealed people want better. Future climate and energy shocks will widen the cracks, and leave us more vulnerable.

We need stronger regulators with the power to limit the size and market share of supermarkets in any given area. They need to tackle the unfair advantage their dedicated car parks give them over smaller retailers, that also encourage people to drive two-tonne SUVs to buy a pint of milk. Preferential business rates could recognise the greater benefits that small, independent, local businesses bring.

Our food system must be redesigned to put resilience and meeting people's needs before profit for the few. As things stand, when we tap at the self-checkout, we tip ourselves closer to the edge.

Mandatory reporting for large and medium-sized businesses would lower prices and help climate, say campaigners

The government has been criticised for binning food waste legislation that campaigners say could have reduced food prices and helped tackle the climate crisis.

The policy would have made food waste reporting mandatory for large and medium-sized businesses in England. According to research by the environmental campaign group Feedback, if it led to just a 1% reduction in food waste, food businesses would save an estimated total of at least £24.4m a year.

Martin Bowman, senior policy and campaigns manager at Feedback, said this was ""an immediately achievable goal"" that would ""more than offset the costs of measurement and reporting, saving millions of pounds, and helping struggling families by lowering food inflation"".

""After a decade of failed voluntary reporting, it is a dereliction of duty for the government to abandon this policy,"" he said. Campaigners say that the decision by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to backtrack on the legislation also risks exacerbating environmental challenges.

Jamie Crummie, a co-founder of Too Good To Go, an app that connects customers to businesses with surplus unsold food, said: ""Food waste contributes 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions, surpassing the aviation industry's impact. As we are witnessing the devastating effect of climate change first-hand across Europe this summer, a decision like this from Defra feels particularly disheartening.""

The government defended scrapping the legislation by claiming that the costs for businesses to regulate food waste reporting could drive food inflation. A Defra spokesperson said: ""A regulatory approach which we estimate to cost businesses around £5.3m is not suitable in the current economic climate, especially when any additional costs may be passed on to consumers.""

Instead, they have suggested expanding the government-funded waste charity Wrap's specialist taskforce encouraging businesses to report voluntarily. However, Wrap has said there is a ""disappointing"" lack of voluntary reporting by businesses, and that ""enhanced voluntary reporting"" would be more expensive than mandatory food waste reporting.

The government's own impact assessment found that just a 0.25% reduction in food waste would balance out any costs of measuring and reporting it, with food waste measurement costing an estimated £19 for each tonne measured, compared with between £1,189 and £3,099 of savings for each tonne of food waste reduced.

Last summer, the government launched a consultation regarding the proposed law, in which 99% of respondents expressed support for the law, including 79% of retailers and 73% of hospitality services.

Among thoseexpressing disappointment with the scrapping of the law are the retailers Tesco, Waitrose and Ocado. Tesco has said: ""Publishing food waste data is vital and must be mandatory if the UK is to achieve sustainable development goal 12.3 to halve food waste by 2030.""

Two-thirds of farmers who responded to the consultation also backed the introduction of mandatory food waste reporting.

Phil Carson, the UK policy lead at the Nature Friendly Farming Network, a group that promotes sustainable agriculture, said: ""The opaque nature of current food waste reporting means that farmers often bear the costs of our wasteful and inefficient food system. Mandatory food waste reporting would have played a vital role in supporting farmers to monitor and manage food waste and identify solutions to reduce it which would ultimately benefit profit margins.""

The Defra spokesperson said: ""We remain committed to tackling food waste and our response to our recent consultation outlines that enhancing the voluntary approach to food waste reporting is the government preference at this time.""

Bun roti, as the rolls are known, are sold for 10 Bangladesh taka (7p) at the same stalls where the city's rickshaw riders buy heavily sweetened tea to ward off hunger and tiredness.

""I often eat two or three of these a day with some tea. I still feel hungry sometimes but these usually keep me going for a few hours,"" says Ahmed, 27, opening a packet and taking a large bite.

Bangladesh is not the only developing country where snacks are ever more prominent in diets, helping fuel busy workers through the day or children on journeys to and from school, and sometimes even replacing meals. For experts, the rise of unhealthy snack foods is concerning because of potential impacts on long-term health, especially non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and heart conditions.

Ahmed used to eat a far more nutritious diet of fish and vegetables, but rising salinity in the rivers around his coastal home town of Bhola ended his livelihood in fishing and forced him into the city.

""Food in Dhaka is expensive and, with the cost of living crisis, even basic items are now unaffordable,"" says Ahmed, who chooses the bun roti over traditional, more substantial snacks such as vegetable-filled shingara pastries. ""Because bun roti comes packaged, it stays fresh, and can be eaten easily - especially when my rickshaw is stuck in a traffic jam.""

What is ultra-processed food?

Ultra-processed food involves extremely high levels of manufacturing to produce. It includes all formula milk, many commercially produced baby and toddler foods, fizzy drinks and sweets, fast food, snacks, biscuits and cakes, as well as mass-produced bread and breakfast cereals, ready meals and desserts.

What do these foods contain?

Ultra-processed ingredients include fruit juice concentrates, maltodextrin, dextrose, golden syrup, hydrogenated oils, soya protein isolate, gluten, ""mechanically separated meat"", organic dried egg whites, as well as rice and potato starch and corn fibre. Additives such as monosodium glutamate, colourings, thickeners and glazing agents are also ultra-processed.

Why does it matter?

Ultra-processed food contains higher levels of salt, sugar, fat and additives that are associated with obesity, cancer, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. They also tend to have lower levels of protein, zinc, magnesium, vitamins A, C, D, E, B12 and niacin necessary for a child's optimal growth and development. It is also thought that other mechanisms are at play in UPFs being associated with worse health outcomes, including negative effects on the development of gut microbiota.

But snacks like bun rotis tend to offer empty calories without key nutrients. Ahmed, who often eats only one meal a day, has lost weight in the year since he moved to Dhaka. ""That's because these foods give them a quick burst of carbohydrates, but it runs right through them and they need another one,"" says nutritionist Barry Popkin, who has observed similar trends in other developing countries as they become more urbanised and industrialised.

Even in rural areas, says Popkin, the move from family farming to industrial agriculture has taken people away from their homes and made them more reliant on quick, often prepackaged and highly processed energy fixes. This has combined with a global spread of snacking, which he says was rare before the 20th century, and increasingly means foods high in sugar and salt.

According to snack manufacturer Mondelez's 2022 State of Snacking report, 55% of people surveyed around the world eat a meal at least once a week consisting of snack foods - rising to almost two-thirds in Asia.

""That's a phenomenon that industry sold to us once they started creating ready-to-eat foods and really advertising and pushing it - in the 70s in the US, in the UK a couple years later, and then in Europe,"" says Popkin. ""It became the norm for adolescents and young adults to eat on the run, snacking at the factory or in the office. This is amazingly common globally now.""

Sales of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) doubled between 2006 and 2019 in developing countries, which food companies have targeted after saturating the market in richer countries such as the US, where 57% of dietary intake is from UPFs.

Popkin, who specialises in research on UPFs, says this has led to a rise in non-communicable diseases globally, especially because of high consumption by children.

New research shows a global rise in cancers in people under 50, a development that experts say may be partly due to diets high in UPFs.

In December 2019, the World Health Organization published a series of articles in the medical journal the Lancet focusing on the ""double burden"" of malnutrition - overlapping problems with undernutrition and issues such as obesity - calling it a ""new nutrition reality"" for low- and middle-income countries that the WHO has to adjust to tackle.

""This can exist in the same country but also in the same communities, in the same families and even in the same individuals, often simultaneously,"" says Francesco Branca, WHO nutrition director. ""Different forms of malnutrition are biologically connected. Somebody who was undernourished in the first period of life, or maybe during conception, is more likely to develop other overweight and non-communicable diseases later in life.""

Branca says snack foods have become increasingly available over recent decades, reaching deeper within countries accompanied by aggressive marketing, especially to children. This creates a food system - the environment for producing and consuming food - that is conducive to bad nutrition and the rise of non-communicable diseases. Such a food system, says Branca, ""doesn't support the accessibility and availability of healthy food but only allows foods which are high in energy but do not provide the adequate amount of, for example, vitamins"".

According to Popkin's research for the WHO, the double burden of malnutrition has risen fastest in the poorest countries and is most prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, while in the 1990s it had been a problem concentrated in higher-income developing countries.

Thomas Reardon, a food system expert at Michigan State University, says the distinction between a snack and a full meal has collapsed because of changing food systems, with small, portable foods becoming an important part of people's lives. ""It is not a snack to them, it's a cheap and fast meal. [Snacks] have displaced [a traditional meal] sitting down, because of convenience.""

Reardon's research into rising consumption of processed food in Africa has shown some nutritional benefits, such as greater milk consumption through packaged milks, but that up to a third of it was UPFs that posed challenges to public health.

According to the research, sub-Saharan African and south Asia are the regions where the double burden of malnutrition is most present, affecting 26 countries where efforts to bring down child stunting caused by undernutrition have not kept up with the rise in numbers of overweight and obese people, driven by UPFs.

In Kenya's capital, Nairobi, the evening rush hour can be when snacks sell best. Lucy Mwenda, 18, who runs a kiosk in a busy area, sells fizzy drinks, sweets, corn snacks and mandazi - a bestselling fried bread snack made by streetside vendors.

Mwedna says it is not just the quick and convenient energy boost they offer, but also the affordability of corn puffs and mandazi - 100 Kenyan shillings (55p) can buy nearly a dozen - that makes them a practical daily option for her customers. ""If you can't afford a kilogram of rice or flour, you buy mandazis and you can still survive,"" says Mwendwa, dismissing health concerns as a ""secondary"" matter.

A customer, 43-year-old business owner Moses Karori, says the other motivation is that snacking has simply become part of everyday life, particularly at schools at break times and at end-of-year ""closing day parties"".

""Today was my son's closing day, and I forgot to buy snacks. I had to go back and get them,"" he says. ""You have to get them, especially when you have children. It's a crime to go home without a snack.""

Costs are falling yet shopping bills rise. Something doesn't add up and experts point to ""˜greedflation' on the part of big retailers

""˜It's diabolical because if I put my prices up people are going to stop coming to my shop,"" says Bally Singh, owner of Hooked Fish and Chips about the hard decisions as high energy and food costs threaten his business.

Singh's fish and chip shop in West Drayton, in the outer suburbs of London, is one of 10,500 in the UK battling to keep customers happy as the cost of a meal, once as cheap as chips, soars, in grim lockstep with wider UK food prices which are climbing at the fastest rate since 1977.

A fish supper now costs an average of £9 in the UK, up £1.44, or nearly a fifth more, in the past 12 months as shop owners pass on rising costs. In Hooked, a large cod and chips has gone up by £1.25 to £9.50 which is competitive as, in other parts of London, you can expect to pay north of a tenner.

Singh pats the huge frying range that fills the width of the shop. It is gleaming after a recent polish but is a gas guzzler and one of the reasons his energy bill has tripled. That's just the start: cod is up nearly 80% at £195 a box. Now potatoes are a problem with the price surging nearly 60% as a result of supply issues caused by last summer's drought.

The squeeze means that some months Singh has not paid himself anything. Some customers grumble about the cost, he says, and these days the shop sells less fish as regulars opt for cheaper items such as a battered sausage or saveloy: ""Fish and chips is a British tradition but it's become expensive when it used to be the cheapest.""

A takeaway or fast-food fix is usually an affordable treat but Office of National Statistics data showed prices up 13% in the year to March. Fish and chips saw the biggest rise, at 19%, but burgers and kebabs were up 17% and 14% respectively. In restaurants, food prices rose 10% but the biggest shock was in the supermarket, where groceries jumped 19%.

For households worn down by a cost of living crisis into its second year it is more bad news. Last year, it was easier to explain price increases. The war in Ukraine had sent already high wholesale gas prices into the stratosphere and caused a food price shock as the supply of important commodities including wheat and sunflower oil was disrupted.

But why are they climbing now? Gas prices are lower than before the war. World food prices are also down sharply, too, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation. In April, its food index was down 19.7% on 2022.

This mismatch is giving credence to the idea of ""greedflation"": companies using inflation as an excuse to increase profit margins. Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite, insists the UK is ""in the grip of a profiteering crisis"", with the Lib Dems recently calling on the competition authorities toinvestigate.

Indeed, the Bank Of England said last week that its network of agents, which are its eyes and ears around the country, had found falling costs at some companies were ""not automatically being passed through to consumer prices in an attempt to rebuild [profit] margins"".

""The truth is that food prices are now driving inflation and causing misery for millions of families and poverty for millions more,"" Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, told the Observer.

""That is why the Competition and Markets Authority has to look into whether supermarkets and food conglomerates are making excessive profits.""

The drumbeat is getting louder and last week MPs on the cross-party Environment, Food and Rural Affairs committee said it would investigate ""fairness in food prices"".

However, Justin King, the former chief executive of Sainsbury's, counters that rather than profiteering, supermarkets were doing the opposite and actually subsidising food prices at the moment.

""They are absorbing some of the inflation they are experiencing and not passing it on,"" says King, who now sits on the board of Marks & Spencer. ""You can quite clearly see that their margins are stronger on fuel and their overall margins are slightly down and the delta between those two is the margin they make on groceries.""

With some chains giving staff multiple pay rises in the past year, the industry's wage bill has been rising. ""People don't understand quite how much of their grocery bill is paying labour, whether it be in the shop, in the supply chain, factory or in the fields,"" says King who adds there is a ""very significant Brexit cost in the shopping basket but it's very hard to see with everything else that's going on"".

While no fan of supermarkets, Henry Dimbleby, the government's former food tsar who in 2021 wrote a wide-ranging review of Britain's food system (only for it to be largely ignored by the government), says he would be very surprised if they were to blame for high food prices: ""The supermarkets have many faults but it is one of the most cut-throat, competitive sectors that I have ever come across. They are obsessed by price signals.""

""We have the cheapest food of anywhere in the world except for America,"" continues Dimbleby. ""The supermarkets used to have price wars that lasted a month or a few weeks but they have basically been in a price war with Aldi and Lidl for five years.""

Food industry experts say soaring energy costs and the supply chain disruption set off by the invasion of Ukraine are still the main driver of price increases. They list other things, too, including labour, the impact of the climate crisis on harvests and, for the UK, new Brexit trade barriers.

The good news is that a ""lot of the things that were driving inflation at the start of last year, like energy prices, are actually coming down, which will cool inflation in general,"" explains James Walton, chief economist at the food industry analyst IGD. However, that was not the case in food markets.

""The reason for that is that food commodity prices remain very, very high,"" continues Walton. ""At a world level and at a UK level, the cost of your food basics, things like soybeans, coffee, wheat and barley, remain pretty high. It also takes a long time for food cost changes at the top of the supply chain to percolate down to us as consumers.""

Producers and retailers buy and sell using long-term contracts, meaning the price is only adjusted when it ends and is renegotiated, he explains. But while inflation will eventually fall away for shoppers, there will be no turning back the clock, he says.

""In the UK it is not common for food pricing to go backwards,"" says Walton. ""Food prices rise behind the general cost of living, which means it tends to become cheaper over time, but once a price rise is achieved it tends to stick.""

Economists predict headline inflation will fall rapidly when figures for April are published later this month mainly because the 54% increase in the Ofgem energy price cap in April 2022 will drop out of the annual calculation. And while Rishi Sunak is due to host a ""food summit"" with supermarket bosses and other industry leaders on Tuesday, the big grocery chains have preempted him by advising ministers that food price inflation has peaked.

That is the view of the British Retail Consortium but its economist, Harvir Dhillon, fears it will be ""sticky and persistent"". ""Food prices are set to remain high but the annual rate itself, I think we can say with a good deal of confidence, has peaked."" Due to the still high price of some commodities ""the pace at which food inflation comes down is going to be a lot slower than perhaps we would like"", he adds.

With actions of the supermarkets under fierce scrutiny - in France, the government has struck a deal with retailers to cap the price of staples - the big stores have been trumpeting recent price cuts. Tesco led the way on milk and others followed, then last week it was Sainsbury's turn to start the ball rolling with reductions on bread and butter.

While lower prices on food staples were good news, Sue Davies, head of food policy at Which?, said that 10p off a loaf of bread ""won't make a huge difference when the overall price of a weekly shop can be as much as 25% more than it was a year ago in some supermarkets"". With reductions on only a handful of products so far, shoppers are unlikely to feel much benefit, she says. Returning to the example of fish and chips, last year shop owners were clobbered by rocketing fish (the industry had been serving up large quantities of Russian whitefish) and cooking oil prices, as well as the cost of the energy required to fry the food.

Andrew Crook, president of the National Federation of Fish Friers which speaks for the industry, says that apart from potatoes - where the price has gone from £8 to £16 or £17 for a 25kg sack in recent times - things seem to be ""holding steady"" at the moment.

His day job is running Skippers of Euxton, a fish and chip shop near Chorley in Lancashire. When the minimum wage for adults increased by 92p to £10.42 in April, he put the price of its cod and chips up from £8.75 to £9.50. ""The government presents that as putting people's wages up but, in reality, it comes out of our, and ultimately consumers', pockets,"" he says.

The price of sunflower oil has come down but at £43 for a 20-litre drum (versus £22 before the war) it is ""nowhere near what it was"". ""I think that's going to be the same for everything,"" he suggests, adding: ""It's the new normal, isn't it?""

""I'm in an area where it is difficult to charge £9,"" he adds. ""The perception of the public is that fish and chips should be a cheap meal and that's difficult because it is not. Fish is an expensive ingredient. People have to go out and risk their lives to catch it. You don't do that for a pizza.""

153,"Name-your-price produce: farms let customers pay what they can for fruits and vegetables","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/01/local-csa-farms-low-cost-food-access","Name-your-price produce: farms let customers pay what they can for fruits and vegetables

Community-supported agriculture programs offer sliding-scale shares to customers who can choose their payment level

Every Wednesday during the growing season, Emilyn Sosa picks up a box of produce from a community center in Brooklyn crammed with the week's harvest. This might include carrots, beets or sometimes kohlrabi, which she cooks up into soups and salads for her family of five.

The price? It's whatever Sosa judges to be fair. For a weekly box, the 33-year-old pays about $15 (£12). If she were to buy a similar amount of fruit and vegetables at a standard supermarket - where the prices are of course non-negotiable - the cost might be upward of $60 (£50) per week.

Sosa is a member of a community-supported agriculture (CSA) program called Rock Steady, a 12-acre farm in upstate New York. Customers like her make regular payments to receive bundles of freshly harvested fruit and vegetables. But the prices are determined on a sliding scale of income, allowing customers to choose a payment level that is affordable to them. Other market farms across the US are opting for sliding-scale models in an effort to reach a wider demographic of customers and to help farmers stay afloat.

Sosa has no idea what her fellow members are electing to pay. ""And that makes such a difference, to not feel like a charity,"" she said.

At Rock Steady, the annual price for members, based on their income, is split into high ($1,155), middle ($825) and lower ($660) brackets. In the lower bracket, that comes out to about $30 (£25) a week, for about eight or nine items. The farm also accepts Snap and EBT cards, the federal nutrition program formerly known as food stamps. Most people are in the middle bracket, while higher-income contributors subsidize those on the lower end of the scale.

When joining the program, customers are asked to take an inventory of their situation, both material and social, to determine how much to pay: do you own a house? Do you have a college education? Do you have savings? Those who do are asked to pay a higher share. Those who ""‹""‹have significant debt or are renting or are senior citizens are invited to pay a lower share.

A 2017 study of nearly 500 CSA farm managers across the US found that 14% offered subsidized programs. A more recent study identified more than 100 subsidized CSA programs.

Although Rock Steady introduced a subsidized model in 2015, the Covid pandemic was a turning point, says co-founder Maggie Cheney, who uses they/them pronouns. It was at the beginning of the pandemic, when lines for food pantries and grocery stores snaked around New York City blocks, that higher-income members of the CSA started giving more so that those with less means could afford it too, Cheney said. Now the farm's CSA is so oversubscribed it has a 200-strong waiting list.

""It's not a donation of our produce, which is not a sustainable route for farmers, who often can't even pay themselves,"" says Cheney.

""As a queer-owned and -operated farm, social justice runs deep in our mission,"" they add. ""What motivates us is feeding our community, which consists of many low-income and marginalized people.""

Also in New York state, but on the other side of the Hudson River, a CSA farm called the Phillies Bridge Project offers a national wage calculator to guide members to help them decide where they sit on the sliding scale. Some shares are discounted by 70% for those who are eligible for Snap, which comes out to about $6 a week for a small allowance of seasonal produce.

Assistant farm manager Rhyston Mays, who uses they/them pronouns, believes it's important to pay something, even a marginal amount. ""Part of our honor system is building a framework for people to be able to self-select and have agency as a person who participates in the food system,"" they say.

A study of 41 CSAs in California found that even when paying full price, low-income subscribers were often more committed to the program than those with higher incomes. Those with annual earnings under $50,000 (£41,371) were more motivated to share financial risk, volunteer and participate in farm events than those with higher incomes.

Subsidizing produce is still only one solution to the problem of reducing food inequalities, says Matt Kauffman, the founder of 5 Loaves, an urban farm in Buffalo that offers sliding-scale shares. ""Just making broccoli available doesn't mean people are going to eat broccoli,"" he says. ""There are cultural disconnects at play.""

This is one of the drawbacks that Marilyn Sitaker, an epidemiologist and public health researcher, has identified with sliding-scale models. ""Food access goes far beyond affordability,"" she says. Produce needs to be abundant, easy to pick up, culturally appropriate and suited to the customer's tastes. ""The CSA model requires willingness to make a commitment. It's not for everyone,"" she adds.

For this reason, 5 Loaves runs education programs, such as cooking classes and agricultural internships, to give communities the tools to enjoy fresh produce. In Buffalo, a city with a diverse refugee and immigrant community, ""maybe people want these specific eggplants from Thailand or crops from east Africa,"" Kaufmann says. As the Buffalo farm grows, it is starting to sow seeds from its members' cultures.

Communities can be knitted together by ""investing in the risk or reward of local agriculture"", says Colleen Dixon, a director at Zenger Farm in Portland, Oregon, which offers sliding-scale payments and operates more like a farmers' market. Instead of dispatching boxes of produce, the fruit and vegetables are laid out on long tables every week from which CSA members are invited to pick a set number of items.

But there are risks associated with CSAs, for example if a farm fails to produce enough crops. ""Some weeks we have huge harvests, but others it's hundreds of pounds of tomatoes and not much else,"" Dixon says. When this happens, Zenger Farm gives refunds to lower-income subscribers so they can source their staple foods elsewhere.

Extreme weather can also disrupt crops. ""If we have a snowstorm, drought or fires, it really shortens the growing season, which impacts food production,"" Dixon says. ""I expect we'll see more of these challenges with climate change.""

These CSA programs are far ahead of federal and state governments, Sitaker says. A national food strategy to fund programs that will remove barriers to local food access is only launching next year.

But Sitaker believes sliding-scale models could have ""a small but mighty"" role to play in addressing food inequities with greater government investment.

155,"A mushrooming trend: how fungi became an It food","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/02/mushroom-food-trend","A mushrooming trend: how fungi became an It food

The mushroom moment of the past few years shows no sign of ending. What's feeding its enduring popularity?

You can't walk more than a few aisles in the grocery store these days without running into some kind of new mushroom product. Fresh white button mushrooms are increasingly joined by specialty varieties like lion's mane, maitake or oyster mushrooms. There's sparkling cordyceps tea and chaga coffee boasting a range of health benefits, mushroom chips and even chocolate bars infused with reishi.

Mushrooms have been steadily growing in popularity in the US over the last decade, said Eric Davis, a representative of the Mushroom Council. Mushrooms frequently top food trends lists and were even named ""ingredient of the year"" in 2022 by the New York Times. According to the consumer consultancy Circana, grocery store sales of fresh mushrooms have increased by 20% over the past decade, while sales of specialty mushrooms have doubled in the same timeframe.

""A few years ago, we were saying ""˜mushrooms are definitely having a moment right now, let's enjoy it.' Here we are three or four years later, and it's still happening,"" Davis said.

So what's behind the craze that's allowed mushrooms to sustain such momentum?

Meet the mushroompreneurs

As co-founder of Smallhold, the best-known provider of specialty mushrooms in the US, Andrew Carter has had a front-row seat to this mushroom moment. Though Smallhold has been growing varieties like blue oyster and lion's mane in indoor farms since 2017, the company's founders witnessed an inflection point during the lockdowns in 2020, when they went from selling their produce to restaurants in Brooklyn to selling direct to consumer.

""Average consumption of mushrooms in the country at that point was something like 2lb per person per year,"" Carter said. ""But our customers were buying 5lb once a week ""¦ it just showed how much room there is to inject more mushrooms into someone's diet.""

Just a few years later, Smallhold products are carried in over 1,000 grocery stores across the nation. There, Smallhold has been joined by a variety of brands selling mushrooms to an increasingly mycologically curious American public.

Mushrooms aren't new to everyone's palates, of course. Growing up Chinese American, mushrooms were a standard part of Marilyn Yang's diet, and one that got her made fun of as a kid (China is the world's leading producer of mushrooms by a long shot). Seeing them take off as an adult has made the food entrepreneur feel like ""oh, people are finally catching up,"" she said. Now, she's helping spread her lifelong love of mushrooms with Popadelics, the snack company she co-founded, which sells mushroom chips in flavors such as parmesan truffle and Thai chili.

""There's no reason that mushrooms can't be as good of a carrier of flavor as a potato chip or tortilla chip can be,"" she said. ""It's just about introducing people to different ways that mushrooms can be used."" After launching in spring of 2022, the brand is now stocked in over 600 retail partners nationwide.

A (food) star is born

If you ask five different people how a food becomes part of the zeitgeist, you might get five different answers.

It would be easy to suspect well-funded marketing campaigns from industry lobbying groups might play a role - think the ubiquitous Got Milk? ads of the 1990s and 2000s, sponsored by the dairy lobby. And the Mushroom Council has certainly tried its best to encourage more mushroom eating. But as Alicia Kennedy points out in her book No Meat Required, sometimes produce becomes popular in a much more organic - and mysterious - way.

Take kale, for example, which went from being a garnish caterers used to line food displays to being celebrated in a BeyoncÃ© music video and even embraced (if briefly) by the likes of McDonald's.

One version of the story of kale's ascendancy claims that it all came down to the work of one PR person who decided to push kale simply because she liked it. Another version, espoused by Elly Truesdell, a former trend-spotter for Whole Foods and VC who invests in new food brands, goes like this: kale became popular because trend-setting chefs such as Dan Barber, of Blue Hill at Stone Barns fame, started using it. Errol Schweizer, a former grocery merchandiser at Whole Foods, tells a different story: he thinks it all traces back to the 2006 E coli outbreak linked to prepackaged spinach. Kale became an alternate option to fill a sudden void in nutrient-dense leafy greens.

There are at least as many stories to explain why mushrooms seem to be popping up everywhere. From Carter's perspective, 2020's lockdowns played a key role in prompting people to experiment with new ingredients in their home cooking. And the way that time period coincided with the success of films such as Fantastic Fungi on Netflix and the growth in medical psilocybin research, increased the public's interest in mushrooms.

Truesdell also called attention to the growing role that social media platforms are playing in whether a food gains traction or not. ""Color, beauty and imagery is a huge part of whether things actually stick, because we now are engaging with foods so visually, and often on a screen,"" she said. Coming in an array of otherworldly, visually striking forms, fresh mushrooms are photogenic in a way that gives them an edge in the digital era.

If mushrooms started to take off a few years ago, a number of factors have kept them in the spotlight. The growing interest in foraging and wild foods, in which mushrooms feature prominently - especially with unusual weather creating ""once-in-a-generation shroom booms"" in recent years - may have helped. And pop culture phenomenons such as the TV show The Last of Us have continued to capture the public imagination with fungi-centric storylines.

From Davis's perspective, it's not so much that mushrooms are trending as that they fit into the wider food trends, or priorities, emerging for many Americans, including personal and planetary wellbeing They're a hearty, umami-rich meat substitute. They're a generous source of vitamins, minerals, protein and fiber. And they can grow on waste materials.

No silver bullet

Other food trends offer something of a cautionary tale in treating any one food as a panacea, however. Quinoa, avocados and almond milk have all been hailed as sustainability and health wins, but their sudden rise to prominence has sometimes coincided with a growing number of human rights abuses and water crises in their supply chains.

""When there's a huge spike in demand, there's often going to be a level of irresponsibility around how that food gets to the place it needs to go, given how the agriculture system works, and the labor that it relies on in huge volumes,"" said Truesdell.

For now, even in spite of mushrooms' spurt in popularity, Americans are nowhere near eating enough of them to put much real strain on existing systems, said Davis. (Truesdell, who describes food trends moving through four stages - inception, adoption, proliferation and finally ubiquity - argues that mushrooms are still only in the first or second stage in the US.) And the fact that the primary culinary varieties are grown indoors on discarded materials such as sawdust sets them apart from crops like quinoa or almonds, which need plenty of water and fertile land to grow.

But for all the good it might do to eat more mushrooms, no ingredient, however healthy or sustainable it may be, will fix the US's broken food system on its own, Schweizer noted.

""The trends are cool, and they've made some things better,"" said Schweizer. ""But in terms of reversing the systemic issues and inequalities that we see in the food system, that has to be done at the policy level, undergirded by public organizing and pressure on the political system.""

Spanish research centre achieves first tank-bred Atlantic bluefin as NGOs warn of poor welfare, more antibiotic use and water pollution

The first successful breeding of Atlantic bluefin tuna at a Spanish research centre has spurred at least two companies to ramp up plans for the industrial farming of land-bred tuna.

The companies would be the first to use only tank-bred Atlantic bluefin stocks of fertilised eggs or young tuna. Up to now, farming of Atlantic bluefin has relied on catching young wild fish and fattening them in open-sea cages.

After the breakthrough in July at the government-run MazarrÃ³n aquaculture plant in Murcia, the company Next Tuna said it plans to begin building a tuna farm north of Valencia. Nortuna, a Norwegian company, has also signed a deal with MazarrÃ³n for the firm's pilot site in Cape Verde, off the west coast of Africa.

Commercial aquaculture companies argue that as more fish are farmed from stocks in closed tanks, fewer wild Atlantic bluefins will be caught for fattening or immediate consumption, reducing pressure on sea stocks. However, many NGOs note that an increase in farmed tuna would mean more fish taken from oceans to feed them. They have also raised concerns about animal welfare, antibiotic use and water pollution.

Two other species, the Pacific and southern bluefin, have been successfully bred on land before, but until July no one had successfully reproduced Atlantic bluefin (Thunnus thynnus) from tank-based adults. Atlantic bluefin are highly prized for sushi, but their commercial importance has attracted overfishing and populations have plummeted by as much as 80% in some areas of the Atlantic Ocean.

Aurelio Ortega, who leads the research team at the MazarrÃ³n centre, said: ""We have about 2,000 or 3,000 tuna fish now. They weigh about 5g to 10g each, and they will take two to three years to reach a size of about 30kg to 40kg.""

Under the plans, the plant will supply fertilised eggs and juvenile tuna to the newly created commercial firms, which will either continue the breeding cycle on land, or use a combination of land-based tanks and sea cages.

NGOs said this will pitch companies into unknown territory, given how little is known about the bluefin species. Catalina LÃ³pez, a veterinarian and director of the Aquatic Animal Alliance at the Aquatic Life Institute, said: ""Very little is known about [tuna] requirements for adequate welfare, as it is a highly migratory species with complex hunting behaviours and migration patterns.

""Without extensive scientific research on the welfare of tuna, it is irresponsible to farm them intensively, and could lead to many welfare issues [including] stress, frustration and, ultimately, poor immunity.""

Environmentalists have also noted that more tuna in captivity will mean diverting fish supplies that could be eaten by humans. Tuna, said LÃ³pez, are ""a very unsustainable species to farm, since 90% of the species used for fish meal and fish oil are food grade, meaning it could feed humans directly"".

More tuna farming would also mean increased use of antibiotics, which intensive farmers typically employ to avoid diseases spreading, given the relatively poor immunity of farmed animals.

Nortuna and Next Tuna have signed contracts with the MazarrÃ³n research centre, Ortega said. Both companies claim to have plentiful space, which would allow low densities of tuna in the tanks. However, according to Claudia MillÃ¡n, a fish welfare specialist with the NGO Equalia, even spacious captivity may be incompatible with the needs of a migratory species that crosses oceans to find food and reproduce.

Inefficient feeding practices can also produce toxic wastewater, said Salazar. ""Left untreated, [this wastewater] can deplete surrounding waters of oxygen, causing algal blooms [or] dead zones, and public health issues,"" she said.

The new breeding successes mean the supply of fertilised eggs could expand outside the species' natural reproductive season, normally limited to about 45 days in June and July. By controlling the natural spawning triggers of water temperature and lighting, the researchers said they hope the reproduction period could last for 60 or more days.

Other tools to induce breeding include implanting female fish with a synthetic version of a hormone that causes them to release eggs for fertilisation.

Paul Sindilariu, a co-founder of Next Tuna, said the company's farming plan involved ""a closed system that will bring in seawater, but there will be no outflow, so no environmental impacts"". He said the firm's model, known as a recirculating aquaculture system, would use floating cages that are on, but not in, the sea, and this would allow the company to control the water quality and temperature conditions in a similar way to a laboratory.

""The system has to be tuna-friendly,"" said Andrew Eckhardt, who manages site selection and financing for Next Tuna. ""They have to be comfortable. Our stocking density will be very low, less than 10kg [of fish weight] per cubic metre.""

The company said it plans to establish its own breeding programme and sell young fish to ""grow-out"" farms for fattening and sale. It aims to bring its first stocks from the research centre tanks to the new site at the port of CastellÃ³n de la Plana next year, with the goal of selling about 45 tonnes of juvenile Atlantic bluefin tuna by 2025, and 1,200 tonnes by 2028.

Nortuna also said it would keep stocking densities low. The company's chairman, Anders Attramadal, said one of the attractions of the pilot site in Cape Verde was space. He said the company aims to get fertilised eggs from the MazarrÃ³n research centre this year in order to produce saleable fish weighing between 12kg and 30kg by late 2024.

""We would buy eggs every week if we could. Right now, we can only get a six-to-eight-week supply,"" he said.

Attramadal dismissed concerns about food supply, saying farmed tuna ate less than wild ones. ""With formulated food we expect to be getting down to 3kg to 4kg of feed per kilo of [farmed fish] muscle mass,"" compared with about 30kg per kilo of muscle for wild Atlantic bluefin, he said.

Eckhardt said that although the main food for the tuna would be fishmeal and fish oil, Next Tuna would be ""working with our feed partners to add other ingredients, maybe plant proteins, algae, insects or krill"".

Nortuna said antibiotic usage would be minimal, only for brief periods if fish are sick, while Next Tuna said it would not use any antibiotics at all because they are incompatible with its recirculating aquaculture model.

Welfare experts said another problem with captive tuna was how to kill large, strong fish in a humane way. Recommended tuna-killing methods include shooting or stabbing heads with a metal spike, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health.

Next Tuna said it would sell young fish before slaughter, while Attramadal said Nortuna would ""use the best humane approved methods that apply at the time"", adding that a ""stressed, uncomfortable fish tastes less delicious"". According to a 2009 European Food Safety Authority report, when ""Atlantic bluefin tuna struggle to escape before dying, they produce considerable amounts of lactic acid ""¦ resulting in severe degradation of the flesh, [making them] unsuitable for the sushi and sashimi market"".

Sewage, poor sanitation and a lack of regulation give rise to antimicrobial resistance and threaten global health, report says

Pollution from livestock farming, pharmaceuticals and healthcare is threatening to destroy a key pillar of modern medicine, as spills of manure and other pollution into waterways are adding to the global rise of superbugs, the UN has warned.

Animal farming is one of the key sources of strains of bacteria that have developed resistance to all forms of antibiotics, through the overuse of the medicines in farming.

Pharmaceutical pollution of waterways, from drug manufacturing plants, is also a major contributor, along with the failure to provide sanitation and control sewage around the world, and to tackle waste from healthcare facilities. Resistant superbugs can survive in untreated sewage.

The findings of the new report, published on Tuesday, show that pollution and a lack of sanitation in the developing world can no longer be regarded by the rich world as a faraway and localised problem for poor people. When superbugs emerge, they quickly spread, and threaten the health even of people in well-funded healthcare systems in the rich world.

Poor sanitation and healthcare, and a lack of regulation in animal farming, create breeding grounds for resistant bacteria, and threaten global health as a result, the UN Environment Programme found in the report. As many as 10 million people a year could be dying by 2050 as a result of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), according to the UN, making it as big a killer as cancer is today.

The rise of superbugs will also take an economic toll, resulting in the loss of about $3.4tn a year by the end of this decade, and pushing 24 million people into extreme poverty.

Inger Andersen, executive director of UNEP, said: ""Pollution of air, soil and waterways undermines the human right to a clean and healthy environment. The same drivers that cause environmental degradation are worsening the antimicrobial resistance problem. The impacts of anti-microbial resistance could destroy our health and food systems.""

She called for urgent action to halt the pollution. ""Cutting down pollution is a pre-requisite for another century of progress towards zero hunger and good health,"" she said, at the launch of the report at the sixth meeting of the Global Leaders Group on AMR in Barbados on Tuesday.

The report found that sewage, poor sanitation, and the inadequate disposal of waste were all contributors to the problem.

Simon Clarke, microbiologist at the University of Reading, who was not involved with the report, said people often failed to recognise how big a difference antibiotic use made to modern medicine. ""Because of the effectiveness of antibiotics, we have perhaps forgotten the deadly impact that many infections had in the past. The risk of doing nothing is that every injury, operation or routine trip to hospital comes with the risk of picking up a lethal infection.""

Superbugs have been associated in the past with hospital acquired infections, such as MRSA. But that was changing, warned Oliver Jones, professor of chemistry at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. ""We tend to think of antibacterial resistance as being a problem associated with hospitals. What this report shows is that antibiotics and other medications ending up in the environment is a major factor in the spread of antibiotic resistance and something we need to pay attention to sooner rather than later,"" he said.

Governments and private sector investors in the developed world should wake up to the risks and provide the resources to tackle pollution in the developing world, which would be in their own self-interest, the report suggested.

Farming must also be a key focus, added Matthew Upton, professor of medical microbiology at the University of Plymouth. ""Although the situation is improving in some parts of the world, vast amounts of antimicrobials are used to treat and prevent infections in food animals. Improved husbandry and other infection prevention and control methods like vaccination should be used to reduce infections and the need for antimicrobial use, which in turn limits environmental pollution with antimicrobials, antimicrobial residues and resistant microbes. This is particularly applicable in aquaculture, which is going to be a major source of aquatic protein by 2050,"" he said.

Catrin Moore, senior lecturer at St George's, University of London, drew parallels with the failure by the UK's water companies and government to control the widespread release of sewage into rivers and beaches. ""This report reminds me that high levels of AMR could ultimately be on my doorstep, and in the water that I swim through with untreated human waste being released into local waterways,"" she said. ""Although the highest burden of AMR is found in low- and middle-income countries, and resistant bacteria can be spread easily - they show no respect to country borders. Ultimately if resistant pathogens are increasing in my local environment, reducing the burden of mortality and morbidity due to AMR will be an impossible task.""

Study confirms government lacks basic data on pesticides and other chemicals in the environment

The federal government has no suitable data source for monitoring the effect of agricultural and veterinary chemicals on humans, a new report commissioned by the Department of Agriculture has found.

The report also found data on pesticides in the environment was very local and generally just a ""snapshot in time"".

""Workplace health and safety regulators were not able to provide useful information about workers exposure to agvet chemicals,"" the research found.

""Similarly, those public health authorities who responded to inquiries did not hold useful information about human exposure to agvet chemicals.""

Agricultural and veterinary (agvet) chemicals are used to protect crops, livestock and domestic animals; safeguard the environment from weeds and pests; and meet consumer needs for things such as insecticides and pool chemicals.

The report confirms that Australia lacks basic data to assess the effect of agricultural chemicals on the environment and human health. Only one study on human bio-monitoring was found, dating back to 2005.

There are also no national sources of data on pesticides in groundwater, urban stormwater, drinking water, soil, or in wildlife, the researchers found.

The only long-term monitoring of pesticides in the environment was as part of the protection of the Barrier Reef and it was limited to 22 pesticides.

Monitoring of pesticides in food is better, the researchers said, thanks to the long-running National Residue Survey for exported meat and some agricultural products and the Total Diet Survey, which last screened for pesticides in 2019.

But the researchers noted monitoring of domestically sold fruit and vegetables, conducted by fresh food markets and supermarket chains, was confidential.

Authorities have repeatedly pointed to these surveys as the safeguard for Australian consumers. But no results or methodology is available publicly.

The researchers said other countries including the Netherlands, the UK and the US had government-run national produce surveys which report publicly each year on pesticides in food.

A spokesperson for the minister for agriculture, Murray Watt, said: ""The government is currently considering the report and will have more to say in the coming months.""

Matt Landos, a member of consumer advocate group National Toxics Network and an associate researcher at the University of Sydney, said the report highlighted the lack of data on the impact of use of pesticides was disturbing.

He said that without data to perform risk assessments and reviews of agvet products, the pesticides regulator, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority was engaging in guesswork when it approved products.

""The existence and quality of that data is paramount. The report shows there is no human data monitored and only scant measurement of food and the environment,"" he said.

The Guardian has reported extensively on the use and regulation of agvet chemicals in Australia which raise serious questions about how it can make claims that it is ""a clean and green"" producer of food.

It comes as the European environment agency released a report last week saying that widespread pesticide use in Europe ""is a major source of pollution - contaminating water, soil and air, driving biodiversity loss and leading to pest resistance.""

""Human exposure to chemical pesticides is linked to chronic illnesses, such as cancer, and heart, respiratory and neurological diseases,"" it said.

A large-scale human biomonitoring study conducted between 2014 and 2021 across five European countries found at least two pesticides present in the bodies of 84% of survey participants.

It is impossible to say whether Australia is worse or better than Europe because such data is simply not available in Australia.

However, as the Guardian reported last year, there are at least 70 chemicals that are either banned or no longer registered in Europe, which are still in use in Australia.

Globally, Australia is one of the heavier users of pesticides in food production. This is partly because of Australia's unique conditions and farming methods. But even these statistics are hard to find.

""Australian pesticide use reporting is limited to the annual report of product sales data by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority generated by registrant reporting to the regulator,"" the researchers said.

""This is, however, de-identified ""¦ to ensure individual product holders or companies are not identifiable, "" they said.

By contrast, other countries require farmers to keep records and in some cases report on their chemical usage.

The Department of Agriculture defended the current system.

""The department will use the findings of this report to inform future policy work to improve the agvet chemicals regulatory system, such as opportunities for improving the connection and monitoring of these programs,"" a spokesperson said.

Croplife Australia, which represents the major agricultural and veterinary chemical companies in Australia said the ""report reinforces the primacy of independent, data-driven and risk-based regulation of pesticides in Australia, as assessed by the APVMA"".

World Bank says subsidies costing as much as $23m a minute must be repurposed to fight climate crisis

Trillions of dollars of subsidies for fossil fuels, farming and fishing are causing ""environmental havoc"", according to the World Bank, severely harming people and the planet.

Many countries spend more on the harmful subsidies than they do on health, education or poverty reduction, the bank says, and the subsidies are entrenched and hard to reform as the greatest beneficiaries tend to be rich and powerful.

Reforming subsidies would provide vital funding to fight the climate and nature crises at a time when public coffers are severely stretched, the bank says.

The ""toxic"" subsidies total at least $7.25tn a year, according to a major new report from the bank. The explicit subsidies - money spent by governments - account for about $1.25tn a year, or more than $2m a minute. Most of these are harmful, the bank says.

There are also implicit subsidies such as waived taxes and the cost of the damage caused by worsenening global heating and air pollution. These total $6tn a year, according to the World Bank, although a higher recent estimate that includes the costs of pollution and destruction of nature by farming pushes the figure to almost $11tn a year.

In total, the subsidies supporting environmental destruction could amount to $23m a minute. The bank said the estimates were conservative, as some countries did not fully record subsidies and they had risen since the Covid pandemic and had yet to be fully counted.

The bank also said the bulk of the subsidies were regressive, benefiting the rich more than the poor, and that direct aid to the poorest would be far more efficient.

""Environmentally harmful subsidies [are] one of the most toxic aspects of development that we have in the world,"" said Richard Damania, the World Bank chief economist for sustainable development. ""These are trillions that we are throwing away, trillions that are doing harm. And yet we need that money.""

""There's something really quite strange about subsidising fossil fuels on the one hand, while we spend money to fight climate change on the other hand,"" he said. At $577bn, the explicit subsidies for coal, oil and gas in 2021 were twice as large as those for renewable energy, and almost six times higher than the climate finance promised by rich countries to developing nations.

In 2021, UN agencies reported that almost 90% of agricultural subsidies harmed people's health and the climate, and drove inequality, while the IMF found that trillions of dollars of fossil fuel subsidies were ""adding fuel to the fire"" of the climate crisis at a time when rapid cuts in carbon emissions were needed.

The World Bank report, titled Detox Development, says the subsidies are ""driving the degradation of the world's foundational natural assets - clean air, land, and oceans - [which] are critical for human health and nutrition"".

Fossil fuels are ""vastly underpriced"", the report says, while subsidy reforms ""save lives"". Pollution from fossil fuels causes 8.7m deaths a year, according to a 2021 study, one in five of all deaths globally.

Subsidies for agriculture are ""unequal and unwise"", the report says. ""Not only do these subsidies promote inefficiencies, but they also cause much environmental havoc."" The report found that subsidised fertiliser caused so much overuse in some regions that it reduced crop yields, while also causing huge nitrogen pollution.

It also found farm subsidies were responsible for the destruction of 2.2m hectares (5.4m acres) of forest a year, about 14% of global deforestation, which leads to almost 4m extra cases of malaria a year.

Fishing subsidies amount to about $118bn a year and are a key factor in over-exploitation of marine life, which has sent the oceans into ""a collective state of crisis"", according to the report.

The report says government subsidies today make up an ""enormous share of public budgets worldwide, perhaps larger than at any point in human history"".

""Subsidy reform is extremely urgent - in fact it is essential - if we are to safeguard both people and planet,"" said Morgan Gillespy, at the Food and Land Use Coalition. ""The report makes a significant contribution to the conversation on agricultural subsidies. Repurposing inefficient and unsustainable subsidy spending is the most cost-effective and economically attractive way to achieve global climate and nature goals.""

Ipek GenÃ§sÃ¼, at the ODI global affairs thinktank, said: ""Government fossil fuel subsidies have ballooned due to the energy price crisis, at a time when governments should instead be providing financing to increase energy efficiency and to invest in clean technologies. Instead, they have locked consumers and the society further into fossil fuel addiction.""

The report acknowledges that cutting subsidies is politically difficult and presents a roadmap for successful reform. Communication is key, it says, to build coalitions of support

Compensation is also critical. ""There will always be losers,"" said Damania. ""But compensation is an excellent way of putting money directly into the hands of poor people, rather than indirectly through some subsidy."" Lastly, reforms must be credible, he said; people must be convinced that governments will stay the course and not be pressured into reversals.

Higher levels of debt in many countries after the Covid pandemic and global economic problems resulting from the war in Ukraine and other factors meant subsidy reform could be a vital source of funding for environmental action, Damania said. ""We have to find ways of spending the money that we have better, rather than arguing that we need to spend more when budgets are so tight. Look how close we are to so many planetary boundaries.""

The report says: ""Although doing so will entail demanding policy reforms, the costs of inaction will be far higher.""

The humble creatures - which break down organic matter and aerate soils - contribute to as much as 6.5% of the world's grain harvests

Earthworms' contribution to the world's grain harvest matches that of Russia, according to a study documenting their enormous role in food production.

This amounts to 140 millions of tonnes of food a year, researchers said, which would make earthworms the fourth largest global producer if they were a country. Russia produced 150m tonnes in 2022 and expects to produce 120m tonnes this year.

The soil-dwelling invertebrates contribute to 6.5% of grain harvests, according to the study, published in Nature Communications this week. Crops include rice, maize, wheat and barley. If an average loaf of bread is made up of 15 slices, this means one per loaf depends on worms' activity to be produced.

Earthworms contribute to the growing of 2.3% of legumes, which includes soya beans, peas, chickpeas and lentils. This is probably smaller because legumes can fix their own nitrogen, which makes them less dependent on worms, researchers said.

As worms burrow and feed underground, they break down organic matter and aerate soils, increasing fertility and making nutrients available for smaller organisms. They also help soils capture and retain water.

Scientists have long been aware that the presence of earthworms makes crops grow better - naturalist Charles Darwin was writing about it in 1881 - but before this research, it wasn't known by how much.

""This is the first effort that I'm aware of that's trying to take one piece of soil biodiversity and say: ""˜OK, this is the value of it; this is what it's giving us on a global scale,'"" said lead researcher Steven Fonte from Colorado State University. ""Soils are just such an intricate habitat but there has really been very few efforts to understand what that biodiversity means to our global crop yields.""

Researchers looked at the impact of worms on grains and legumes by analysing and overlaying maps of soil properties and crop yields with a global atlas of earthworm abundance.

Earthworms contributed proportionally more in areas of the global south: 10% of grain yield in sub-Saharan Africa, and 8% in Latin America and the Caribbean, is down to worms, researchers said. This is probably because these farmers tend to use fewer fertilisers and pesticides, relying instead on manure and rotting organic matter, which helps increase earthworm abundance.

Topsoil is where 95% of the planet's food is grown. Last month, research showed that soil contains more than half of all species. Although the impact of earthworms is notable, other soil organisms may be ""equally as important"" but further study is needed, the paper said, and only a fraction are believed to have been identified.

Soil biodiversity has been historically undervalued, said Fonte, and this study showed how it enhances agricultural productivity.

""Soils are still this huge, big black box that we don't fully understand,"" he said. ""This work helps show that there's a lot of opportunity that we're just kind of ignoring.""

PFAS are present at ""˜potentially dangerous' levels in widely used chemicals sprayed on food crops destined for Americans' plates

Some of the United States' most widely used food pesticides are contaminated with ""potentially dangerous"" levels of toxic PFAS ""forever chemicals"", new testing of the products finds.

The Environmental Protection Agency has previously been silent on PFAS in food pesticides, even as it found the chemicals in non-food crop products. The potential for millions of acres of contaminated food cropland demands swifter and stronger regulatory action, the paper's authors say.

""I can't imagine anything that could make these products any more dangerous than they already are, but apparently my imagination isn't big enough,"" said Nathan Donley, environmental health science director at the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD), which co-authored the study. ""The EPA has to take control of this situation and remove pesticide products that are contaminated with these extremely dangerous, persistent chemicals.""

The groups last Monday submitted the test results to the EPA and the California Department of Pesticide Regulation, asking them to remove these products from use until contamination can be addressed.

PFAS are a class of about 15,000 chemicals often used to make thousands of consumer products across dozens of industries resist water, stains and heat. The chemicals are ubiquitous, and linked at low levels of exposure to cancer, thyroid disease, kidney dysfunction, birth defects, autoimmune disease and other serious health problems. They are called ""forever chemicals"" because they do not naturally degrade.

The testing found PFAS in three out of seven agricultural pesticides, including Intrepid 2F, which state of California data shows is the second most widely applied product behind Roundup. In 2021, the most recent year data is available, more than 1.7m pounds of it were applied to over 1.3m cumulative acres of California land. Use was highest in the Central Valley on crops such as almonds, grapes, peaches and pistachios.

The study also found the chemicals in Oberon 2SC Malathion 5EC, the latter of which contains the neurotoxin malathion.

Multiple studies have established that crops absorb PFAS and they can be ingested by humans. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began monitoring PFAS in food in 2019 and has detected them in fruits and vegetables, but has not set any limits.

The fertilizers are also probably polluting water with PFAS. The level of PFOA, one kind of PFAS compound, found in Malathion 5EC was over 100,000 times higher than the level the EPA considers safe in drinking water, though no limit has been set for PFAS in pesticides.

""There is no better way to poison Americans than contaminate our food supply and soils with PFAS, and the blame for this lies squarely on the shoulders of EPA,"" said Kyla Bennett, a co-author and science policy director with Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (Peer).

It is unclear why the chemicals are added to pesticides, though some in the industry have theorized they are used as a dispersing agent. The Intrepid 2F manufacturer Corteva-Agriscience in a statement to the Guardian said the product did not contain intentionally added PFAS.

The results are the latest in an ongoing dispute among federal regulators and independent researchers over the scale of PFAS contamination in US pesticides, and the response.

Bennett, a former EPA scientist, first discovered PFAS in pesticides in 2020, and alerted the agency and the Massachusetts department of environmental protection.

After conducting its own pesticide testing, the EPA concluded in early 2021 the chemicals were leaching from plastic containers in which they were stored, and said the contamination was limited to pesticides used in mosquitocides. The EPA issued an open letter to the industry reminding it that PFAS can leach, and asking companies to alert it if they were adding PFAS.

But the contamination continues. In late 2022, testing of insecticides used primarily for cotton, but which could potentially be used on food, found PFAS. That testing, along with CBD and Peer's research, also detected PFAS compounds not known to be used or formed when the chemicals are added to plastic.

The discrepancy suggests the PFAS are not coming from plastic bins, but are added to pesticides by manufacturers, either as active or inactive ingredients, or are inadvertently inserted into products somewhere in the supply chain.

In December, the EPA banned some types of PFAS compounds - but not all - that can be used as inert ingredients in pesticide products, and said at the time that active ingredients are being reviewed. ""EPA will share results of that investigation as soon as possible,"" an agency spokesperson said. No results have been released, but an EPA spokesperson said the agency has ""already analyzed some of the specific pesticides mentioned by CBD and Peer and plans to release those results in the coming weeks"".

PFAS have also previously been found in some widely used flea and tick pesticide products.

In a statement, the EPA said it ""has taken significant scientific, regulatory and enforcement actions to address this issue, will continue to take such actions"".

However, it did not say it would halt sales of the pesticides while it investigatesBennett told the Guardian the EPA is ""missing in action"".

""The fact that we are likely spraying pesticides with PFAS on food at a time when EPA acknowledges there is no safe level of some of these chemicals is nonsensical,"" she added.

With water reserves running low, Spanish farmers are also struggling to protect crops from thousands of rabbits starved of fresh grass

With much of Spain facing severe drought after an exceptionally dry winter that followed the hottest summer on record, Alex Foix is planting vines in dusty ground near the village of VerdÃº in the province of Lleida. He hopes to have enough water for the vines to survive their first year, but that is not his only worry: it is the rabbits he fears most.

Unusually, the area worst affected by drought isn't in the south of the country but in the north-east region of Catalonia, where - in addition to a severe water shortage - farmers are facing a plague of rabbits. With a lack of grass and water, the animals are destroying crops, especially young wheat and barley, and eating the bark on vines and fruit trees.

""A lot of factors have contributed to the rabbit population explosion: there was the pandemic, when no one could hunt for two years; they've become immune to myxomatosis; and the female can produce seven or eight offspring every two months,"" Foix says.

The Catalan government has said that more than 250,000 rabbits need to be killed by September to contain the population, according to reports, but it is a task beyond the means of the region's disappearing breed of aged hunters.

In an effort to reduce the numbers, the government has permitted the use of aluminium phosphate, which releases toxic phosphine gas when introduced into burrows.

""If it doesn't rain in April and we have another year like last year, the vines won't survive,"" says Juan Samboda, a member of Pagesos o conills (Farmers or rabbits), who grows cereals, vines, olives and chickpeas near VerdÃº.

Drought is endemic in Lleida, says Samboda, but he points with pride to the area's modern irrigation system, which is driven almost entirely by gravity. A series of small reservoirs are supplied with water from the Segarra-Garrigues canal. The problem is the water for the canal comes from the Rialb reservoir, 75km away. Standing on the bridge over the reservoir there is no sign of water but rather an improvised race track for trail bikes.

In Catalonia as a whole, water reserves are down to about 26% and Samboda and his neighbours are running out.

""The question is how to manage the resources we have,"" says Josep Carles Vicente, an olive farmer in Priorat, 60km south-west of VerdÃº. ""If we decide that this year we can only cultivate a quarter of the available land then we have to decide what crops to prioritise. It's vital that we don't just improvise from day to day.

""If the drought continues, in the case of fruit trees we can irrigate enough to save the trees but not enough for them to bear fruit.""

At the end of February, a number of measures were agreed by the Catalan government, including a 40% reduction in water used for agriculture, a 15% reduction for industrial use, and a cut in the average daily supply for each resident from 250 litres to 230 litres.

There is a ban on using drinking water to irrigate parks and gardens or for street cleaning, and plans to increase the amount of recycled water that can be introduced into rivers. An emergency plan allows local authorities to contract water tankers.

However, a cross-party emergency water summit held late last month failed to reach agreement on further restrictions. Municipal elections are due in May and - anxious to please voters - local mayors argued that municipal swimming pools be kept open on health grounds. They also blocked a proposal to fine local councils that exceed their water quota.

Some farmers have been learning to adapt to the changing conditions. Marta Casas, oenologist at ParÃ©s BaltÃ winery in PenedÃ¨s, near Barcelona, says global heating over the past 20 years has brought the grape harvest forward from late August to late July.

""We've noticed that if we leave ground cover around the vines they are better equipped to survive drought because the morning dew doesn't just settle on the leaves but on the grass, too,"" she says.

Casas adds that the winery is opting for grape varieties with a longer growing cycle, as the increasingly harsh climate affects the taste, aroma and sugar content of the grapes. This has led them to replace French varieties such as merlot and chardonnay with native vines such as sumoll, moneu and malvasia sitges.

But the plague of rabbits may not be so easy to combat. ""One study found areas where there were 100 times what is considered the stable population of rabbit an acre,"" says Foix, pointing to the protective plastic sleeves he's fitted to each young vine in the hope of keeping them at bay.

Documents show industry intends to go ""˜full force' in arguing meat is beneficial to the environment at climate summit

Big meat companies and lobby groups are planning a large presence at the Cop28 climate conference, equipped with a communications plan to get a pro-meat message heard by policymakers throughout the summit.

Documents seen by the Guardian and DeSmog show that the meat industry is poised to ""tell its story and tell it well"" at the Dubai conference.

The files show how the world's largest meat company, JBS, is planning to come out in ""full force"" at the summit, along with other big industry hitters such as the Global Dairy Platform and the North American Meat Institute.

The documents, which were produced by the industry-funded Global Meat Alliance (GMA), emphasise the industry's desire to promote ""our scientific evidence"" at the summit.

Members of the alliance have been asked to stick to key comms messages, which include the idea that meat is beneficial to the environment.

Meat and dairy companies are under increasing pressure over their large greenhouse gas footprints. The dairy industry is responsible for 3.4% of global human-induced emissions, a higher share than aviation.

Trade groups also give some indication in the documents of how they hope to shape conversations in Dubai. One said it will ""push"" the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization to host ""positive livestock content"" at Cop28. The Guardian recently revealed that pressure from the industry led to censorship of FAO reports on the role of cattle in increasing greenhouse gas emissions.

Animal agriculture is the largest emitter of methane, a greenhouse gas 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide when measured over a 20-year period. Scientists said that unless swift action is taken, methane from agriculture alone will push the world beyond a 1.5C (2.7F) rise in temperature above preindustrial levels that risks tipping the world into irreversible climate breakdown.

""These companies are stepping up their game because the exposure they are facing is stepping up,"" says Jennifer Jacquet, professor of environmental science and policy at the University of Miami. ""It used to be that they were caught on the back foot, but now they're completely prepared.""

""Any credible action to reduce emissions in the food sector will inevitably lead to a reduction in the total volume of meat and dairy products produced,"" says Nusa Urbancic, CEO of campaign group the Changing Markets Foundation. ""The industry is terrified of that and has been deploying multiple tactics to delay the inevitable.""

The meat sector's largest emitters plan to be on the ground at Cop28 in large numbers, the documents show. At Cop27, JBS, the world's most polluting meat company, gained access to talks because it came as part of Brazil's national delegation.


Companies at the summit will be accompanied by lobby groups that represent them, some of which have a history of obstructive action. They include the North American Meat Institute (Nami), which represents large meat producers in the US and which in 2022 was still questioning on its website whether climate change was caused by humans.

While the leaked documents are aimed at the meat sector, they also show that dairy companies are planning on sending a ""large delegation"" to Cop28.

Earlier this year, backlash from several countries with interests in meat led to the watering down of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's recommendations on diets.

Companies and trade groups are told in the documents that one of the ways to ""have the most influence"" is to ""equip delegates with your key messages and solutions"", a list of which are provided in the pack.

The files also detail collaborations planned for the event itself, with meat lobbying groups hosting events at country pavilions, including those of the US and Australia.

Australia and the US are the second and third largest beef exporters globally after Brazil, and their governments have a strong economic interest in supporting the growth of these industries, as well as close political ties with them.

Researchers said government support is a significant factor in determining the continued power of the animal agriculture industry over alternatives. A study this year found that in the EU, meat and dairy farmers received 1,200 times more public funding than new alternative protein sources, while in the US, they received 800 times more support.

Jacquet said addressing the cosy relationship between governments and industry was crucial to changing diets to align with climate goals.

""Typically, the talk is about demand-side interventions, like you can get schools or individuals to give up meat,"" she said. ""But I'm a little worried that some of this [meat] production is so baked into subsidies and policy, that even with decreased demand, this apparatus will just keep flowing.""

In the documents, trade groups also reveal their plans to influence non-country pavilions via sponsorship, which can cost between $10,000 and $200,000. This is championed as a way to host sessions and bring guests along to receptions.The documents also include a messaging summary with key talking points that present meat as ""sustainable nutrition"" and suggest that meat production can be beneficial to the environment.

In a four-page set of arguments, the Global Meat Alliance claims that producers can ""play a key role in environmentally sustainable food systems"" and that the sector is ""continuously driving towards carbon-friendly farming"".

Several of these arguments reference the idea that grazing livestock can help maintain healthy soils, which can store carbon. This is often described as ""regenerative agriculture"". It is a favoured line with many food companies, despite the fact that scientists have said that soils are not a reliable way to store carbon in the long term, and that removals can be easily undone.

In its messaging, the industry also heavily references the role of meat in relieving hunger in the global south, claiming that it ""plays a key role in reducing food insecurity and malnutrition"". However, the UN-linked Committee on World Food Security has repeatedly pointed out that hunger and malnutrition are not caused by a lack of food, pointing instead to problems with access, distribution and power.

Meat eating worldwide is very unequal. Europeans eat more than twice the global average, and consumption levels in north America and Australia are even higher. One 2018 study found western countries would have to reduce their meat intake by 90% to limit global heating to acceptable levels.

The documents make passing reference to cutting methane, and encourage participation in events where this is discussed. This is despite the fact that emissions from beef production globally are roughly equal to the emissions of the entire nation of India, with science pointing to a shift in diets as the one surefire way to cut emissions.

The Food4Climate pavilion, which aims to promote plant-based food, is labelled in the documents as ""extreme"", which also show displeasure at the Cop28 presidency's choice of a mostly vegan menu.

While the Global Meat Alliance presents itself as supporting an ""aligned global meat sector"" the group's membership is skewed heavily toward producers in the global north.

Fourteen of the group's 16 partners come from the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand or North America. The remaining two partners are global lobby groups representing large companies and multiple countries.

This follows a wider trend in multi-stakeholder climate initiatives, where smallholder groups are sidelined. A recent report found that small-scale farmers, who produce a third of the world's food, receive just 1% of climate finance.

A GMA spokesperson said: ""The GMA is an international networking group with an aim to support a better connected, aligned global meat sector by providing industry with accumulated insights, best practice, and collaboration opportunities to address shared challenges such as sustainability in the pre-competitive space. This includes visibility on intergovernmental events which are often dominated by an anti-meat narrative. GMA works to simplify and distil public information around these events, which is largely complex, to ensure industry understand how and where to engage, having equal opportunity to be heard.""

Livestock experts with a focus on the global south have repeatedly stressed the importance of including a range of perspectives in discussions of livestock pollution. Ian Scoones, a researcher at the Institute of Development Studies, said: ""My big fear in all of this debate is that the likes of pastoralists who we work with around the world will get stuffed because they don't have a voice.""

These are the arguments spun by big beef titans to persuade consumers that meat eating has negligible impact on the planet

It's a hard, unpalatable, disorienting truth: if we're serious about avoiding the worst scenarios of the climate crisis, people - particularly those who live in wealthier nations - need to consume fewer animal products.

But for the corporate titans who stand atop the nearly trillion-dollar global meat industry, this modest change represents an existential threat, which is why they're spinning the truth about the full climate impacts of animal agriculture.

In the Guardian's review of dozens of industry-aligned articles, op-eds, fact sheets, blog posts, informational videos, educational assets and social media messages, several themes repeatedly surfaced. Taken together, this vast body of industry-funded messaging works to perpetuate five myths to suggest that beef production is not a problem for the climate, and cutting consumption will not help - and may even hurt - environmental progress.

Myth 1: fossil fuels are the only real problem to fix

""What we eat matters environmentally to some degree, but it pales compared to what we drive or how we use energy,"" Frank Mitloehner, a UC Davis animal scientist, who works with the beef industry on research and messaging, said in a 2018 article for the industry publication Meatingplace. ""So, have the burger. Just make sure you walk to the restaurant.""

The implication - made repeatedly in Mitloehner's blog posts and public comments and reinforced through industry marketing materials - is that the impacts of energy use so far outweigh agricultural-related emissions that we might as well not worry about what we eat.

It's true that fossil fuels have been the primary driver of the climate crisis. According to most estimates, all of agriculture - not just livestock - is responsible for one-quarter to one-third of global emissions, while energy consumption for transport, industry and heating contributes the bulk of the rest. For that reason, some experts, like University of Pennsylvania climatologist Michael Mann, argue that we should laser-focus on transforming the energy sector. Once we've done that, Mann has said, we can argue about food.

But other experts disagree.

While fossil fuel consumption has done the most to put us on our dangerous path to climate catastrophe, a widely cited 2020 study in the journal Science argued that we can no longer avoid the worst of the climate crisis by cutting fossil fuels alone. Staying below the average global temperature rise of 2C - a threshold that scientists say will lead to systems collapse, mass extinctions, fatal heat waves, drought and famine, water shortages and flooded cities - will require ""rapid and ambitious"" changes to food systems.

The single most impactful food-related change we can make, according to their findings, is not increasing yields, ramping up agricultural efficiency or cutting food waste, though those approaches all would help. It's adopting a plant-rich diet.

While building out energy infrastructure can take years, changing our diet is something we can work toward today.

""Whenever you model out having the world manage massive climate change, you pretty much have to build in dietary moderation for people in wealthy countries,"" said Tim Searchinger, a senior research fellow at Princeton who studies the climate costs of agriculture. ""No one can get there without that.""

Myth 2: methane is different - and it isn't the problem

Methane - the greenhouse gas cattle emit in their belches - is highly potent. Since its warming potential is 28 times higher over 100 years than carbon dioxide's, every ton of methane emitted impacts the climate over two dozen times more than a ton of carbon dioxide. When measured in a shorter time frame, over the course of just 20 years, methane's impact is even more dramatic, causing about 85 times more warming a ton than CO2.

But industry messaging works to systematically downplay this impact, mostly by pointing out that methane only persists in the atmosphere for about a decade. In contrast, every ton of CO2 emitted sticks around for generations.

""Every time you've ever driven a car, or burned coal or gas,"" Mitloehner said in an interview published by the trade group Dairy Farmers of Canada, ""you've put out CO2 into the atmosphere and that gas is still there throughout your entire lifetime - and that of your parents, and that of your grandparents, and so on.""

Sara Place, a former executive of National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA) and a student of Mitloehner who is now a professor of animal sciences at Colorado State University, has told audiences that carbon dioxide builds up like water in a tub when the faucet is set to the max - overwhelming the drain's ability to clear out - while methane is like running the faucet at a flow speed low enough to drain right away. As long as emissions stay constant, we lose methane about as fast as we pollute with it; therefore, cattle aren't actually adding net emissions, she argues.

But using that argument to dissuade people from eating less beef makes no sense. If we reduce the overall number of cattle being raised worldwide, the climate gains from that reduction are more or less immediate, thanks to methane's short half-life. To use Place's metaphor, it's like slowing the faucet's rate of flow while keeping the drain open, so that the water seeps out faster than it comes in. Significantly reducing global cattle stocks through a shift to other nutritious foods, then, could lead to rapid cooling - one of the most powerful levers available to slow climate crisis right now, this moment.

Responding to questions from the Guardian, Mitloehner said he could not recall ""ever downplaying methane"". Mitloehner said: ""I have gone on record many times about the problems associated with methane and the great need we have to reduce it. I stress this each time I speak to or work with agriculture groups. However, I go beyond just informing members of the agriculture sector that they need to reduce their emissions; I work with them to get it done.""

He added: ""Let me say this clearly. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and managing it appropriately will limit warming.""

Still, beef advocates frequently use his statements about methane to minimize the potency of cattle emissions - and suggest only fossil fuels are worth worrying about. But other climate scientists warn that we shouldn't take methane reduction off the table.

As University of Melbourne researchers put it: ""Emitting methane will always be worse than emitting the same quantity of carbon dioxide, no matter the time scale.""

Myth 3: eating beef isn't a problem in the US

In 2019, researchers from the US Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) published the first cradle-to-grave life-cycle analysis of emissions from US cattle, factoring in everything from the climate costs of feed production to the methane emitted by the animals themselves. (The study was funded, in part, by the beef checkoff.) Their central finding: beef production contributes only 3.3% of the nation's overall climate footprint.

In a press release published by ARS, Alan Rotz, the study's lead author claimed that the findings showed US cattle are ""not a significant contributor to long-term global warming"". The study didn't actually make that judgment, only Rotz's public comments did. But that didn't stop Mitloehner and other industry advocates from using this number to suggest that cattle aren't really the problem.

""To those who think beef consumption must be lowered to protect the climate: the 3.3% GHG LCA figure for beef stands in sharp contrast to over 70% of all US GHG emissions stemming from the nation's fossil fuel sectors (i.e. power, transportation, and industry),"" he wrote in a 2019 tweet. Elsewhere, Mitloehner has suggested that the number is so vanishingly small that it's not worth worrying about. In comments to the Guardian, Mitloehner said: ""Livestock impacts on the environment are absolutely important and it's reflected in the work I do.""

Why is it wrong to suggest cattle's 3.3% impact is insignificant? Because a small percentage of a big thing is still a big thing. And considering that America's net emissions are the second highest in the world, the fact that a single food product could take up 3.3% of that disproportionately large pie is still staggering. For context, 243m tons of CO2 equivalent gasses - the total amount generated by US cattle each year, according to ARS - is roughly equivalent to the greenhouse gas footprint of the entire 47-million-person nation of Spain.

Myth 4: cattle are raised on lands where nothing else can grow anyway

It's true that well-managed ruminant populations can be a helpful, symbiotic relationship with grassland ecosystems, where their manure and migration patterns help to restore soil. In these environments, raising cattle can be much better for the environment - if they're not allowed to overgraze - than plowing to grow crops. This isn't an argument for cattle, necessarily: deer, elk, bison and other species can also provide these ecosystem services, while also being a source of human food.

And yet millions of cattle are grazed in places that are not native grasslands. All over the world, forests, wetlands, woody savannas and other ecosystems have been cleared to make room for cattle or growing cattle feed. In those cases, grazing livestock tends to have a much more destructive impact because of what experts call ""the opportunity cost of land"", in other words, factor in the carbon we're not capturing by letting these ecosystems be.

""The overwhelming greenhouse gas costs from agriculture comes from our land use,"" says Searchinger, who is also the technical director of the food program at the non-profit thinktank World Resources Institute. ""There's a huge amount of carbon in the atmosphere because it's no longer in the land that was entered into agriculture.""

Searchinger says that roughly a third of grazing land worldwide was once forested or heavily wooded - and could still be today. Forests are a key ally in the climate fight, and the lost opportunity to store carbon in forests should be factored into the carbon cost of cattle production.

Myth 5: future tech will save us

Thanks to advances in technology, genetics and other factors, the US cattle industry feeds more people with fewer animals than it did decades ago. Mitloehner argues that this trend line is the only one that matters.

""Foregoing meat once a week is not enough to make a significant difference in global warming. In fact, even if the world went 100% vegan tomorrow, that would fall short of making a sizable dent in greenhouse gas emissions. By a long shot,"" he wrote in a 2021 blog post. ""That isn't to say we shouldn't reduce animal agriculture's climate contributions, but impactful solutions are likely going to come on the farm.""

These on-farm solutions - from reducing cow burps with feed-additive seaweed to using bio-digesters for methane-polluting manure - are the focus of UC Davis's new research and extension program under Mitloehner's direction - the Clarity and Research for Environmental Awareness Center, or Clear Center, which has taken millions of dollars in funding from animal agriculture interests. But no solution can be as effective as reducing the overall number of cattle worldwide, a solution that Mitloehner and his industry allies tend to suggest is impractical or otherwise off-limits.

""If cattle aren't a problem, but seaweed is a solution to the problem, which is logically impossible,"" said Matthew Hayek, an assistant professor at New York University who studies agriculture's greenhouse gas emissions impacts, ""then we're blinded to the fact that just taking the meat off the table is technically the option that could accomplish the most mitigation.""

The Cattlemen's Beef Board and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Welsh government considers whether to block plan after experts say manure from intensive units is turning Wye into ""˜pea soup'

The Welsh government is under pressure to block a new mega chicken farm in the Wye catchment, in what campaigners call a ""crucial moment in the life or death of the Wye"".

The River Wye has become synonymous with the intensive poultry industry, with more than 20 million chickens in its catchment area, producing more manure than the land can absorb and turning the river the colour of ""pea soup"".

A scientific study led by Lancaster University recommends an 80% reduction in poultry manure in the Wye catchment to protect the river, calling for a cut in the overall number of birds and the exporting of manure out of the area.

However, Powys county council is still approving intensive poultry units in the catchment. Last year, Fish Legal challenged a decision by Powys to approve a unit at Wern Haelog near Builth Wells, housing 90,000 chickens, but lost the case.

Last week, the Welsh government sent a holding direction to Powys county council to prevent it approving a new industrial poultry unit, also near Builth Wells, which would house 100,000 chickens at any one time. Welsh ministers will now decide whether to ""˜call in' the application, and rule on the chicken farm at government level.

The Welsh environment agency, Natural Resources Wales, recently accepted publicly that poultry manure is harming rivers in the Wye area. In its core management plan for the River Wye, approved in September, the regulator states that ""spreading of manure from intensive poultry units"" is causing pollution, and that these operations are largely ""outside of regulatory control"".

A coalition of environmental groups, including River Action and Radnorshire Wildlife Trust, has previously called for a planning moratorium on the construction of new intensive livestock production units in the Wye catchment.

In January 2022, the Environmental Audit Committee published its ""Water quality in rivers"" report, highlighting the impact of intensive poultry production on the Wye, and recommending that ""new poultry farms should not be granted planning permission in catchments exceeding their nutrient budgets"".

The Welsh government has played a role in driving the growth of poultry units by handing out millions in grants and encouraging farmers to diversify into poultry farming. Yet in 2018, its chief planner wrote to the heads of all local planning authorities to remind them to ""fully consider the effects of intensive agricultural development when determining planning applications"". The letter stressed the risks to sensitive habitats and the need to consider the ""cumulative impacts"" of such developments.

The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, called a ""river pollution summit"" at the Royal Welsh Show last summer to discuss the phosphorus pollution of rivers in Wales, reiterating the role of regulators and government in improving water quality.

The Welsh minister for climate change, Julie James, was at the Cop15 biodiversity summit in Montreal last month, where she stated her commitment to nature recovery and tackling phosphorus pollution in rivers. An insider told the Guardian that the decision on calling in the latest Builth Wells plan is likely to fall on James's desk.

The Welsh minister for rural affairs, Lesley Griffiths, told Guardian columnist George Monbiot in his 2021 documentary Rivercide that she would consider closing intensive poultry units in sensitive catchments like the Wye, if that was necessary.

The writer Robert Macfarlane, whose forthcoming book will be about rivers, implored the Welsh government to call in the application, writing in a tweet: ""Many, many eyes are watching this. A crucial moment in the life (or death) of the Wye.""

Dr Christine Hugh-Jones, from the Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales, said: ""We can't believe Powys county council are still approving more intensive poultry units after all the information gathered about their damaging impacts on rivers and air quality.""

Chairman of River Action, Charles Watson, said: ""Whether or not the Welsh government decide to call in this ecocidal proposal to build another massive intensive poultry unit in the Wye catchment will define for ever their environmental record. It is now time for Mark Drakeford to intervene personally and show voters that his recent stated commitment to tackle the blight of river pollution across Wales is not just hollow rhetoric.""

A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""The Welsh ministers issued a direction on 5 January in relation to the planning application. The direction prevents the grant of planning permission until the Welsh ministers have assessed whether or not the planning application should be called in or not. Such directions are issued routinely where the Welsh ministers are considering call-in.

""The Welsh ministers cannot comment further on this matter, as to do so may prejudice any future planning decision they may make in relation to the site, and may affect any legal proceedings.""

The energy industry is turning waste from dairy farms into renewable natural gas - but will it actually reduce emissions?

On an early August afternoon at Pinnacle Dairy, a farm located near the middle of California's long Central Valley, 1,300 Jersey cows idle in the shade of open-air barns. Above them whir fans the size of satellites, circulating a breeze as the temperature pushes 100F (38C). Underfoot, a wet layer of feces emits a thick stench that hangs in the air. Just a tad unpleasant, the smell represents a potential goldmine.

The energy industry is transforming mounds of manure into a lucrative ""carbon negative fuel"" capable of powering everything from municipal buses to cargo trucks. To do so, it's turning to dairy farms, which offer a reliable, long-term supply of the material. Pinnacle is just one of hundreds across the state that have recently sold the rights to their manure to energy producers.

Communities around the world have long generated electricity from waste, but the past few years have seen a surge in public and private investment into poop-to-energy infrastructure in the US. Though so far concentrated in states with dominant dairy sectors, like California, Wisconsin and New York, Biden's landmark climate law passed last summer stands to unleash additional billions to support further development nationwide. The sector's boosters describe it as an elegant way to cut emissions from both livestock and transport; but critics worry that the nascent industry could raise more issues than it resolves by entrenching environmentally harmful practices.

Animal agriculture is the nation's single biggest source of methane, a greenhouse gas that climate scientists call a ""super pollutant"" due to its high short-term warming potential. The gas is released from animals when they burp, and through the decomposition of manure when collected in open-air ponds, a common livestock industry practice.

But those emissions are also a potential moneymaker. Methane from animal waste can be purified into a product virtually indistinguishable from fossil fuel-based natural gas. Marketed as renewable natural gas (RNG), it has a unique profit-making edge: in addition to revenue from the sale of the gas itself, energy companies can now also earn handsome environmental subsidies for their role in keeping methane out of the atmosphere.

In early 2020, an energy firm called Aemetis inked a 20-year contract to capture methane from Pinnacle's manure and turn it into RNG. Aemetis installed a digester on the dairy, which collects the farm's waste in a concrete-lined pool and captures the gas it releases. The company plans to upgrade it into renewable natural gas at its nearby refining facility, before transporting it to gas stations across the state.

""This is something that's going to be on every dairy in the future,"" said Jessica Cardoso, project coordinator at Aemetis.

Cardoso was raised on a dairy farm in California but, growing up, had no idea about the potential of cow manure. She predicts that natural gas and dairy production will soon go hand in hand.

Over the past few years, energy giants like Shell, BP and Chevron have all announced similar dairy industry partnerships. In California, the country's top dairy-producing state, officials estimated that over a hundred publicly supported manure digesters were slated to go online by the end of last year. Less than a decade earlier, in comparison, just six such projects were in the works. Nationally, the number of planned and operational RNG production facilities at livestock and agricultural operations jumped by over 36% in 2021 compared to the year prior.

But some watchers of the biogas boom worry that monetizing avoided emissions could backfire. Environmental justice and animal welfare groups are campaigning against subsidies for the industry and raising questions about the challenges posed by digester technology. For one, digesters can and do leak. They also only mitigate about half of the methane problem posed by the dairy industry. While digesters capture emissions from manure, they do nothing to resolve the issue of emissions from cow burps, which, in California, produce roughly the same amount of methane emissions as manure.

But the heart of their concerns is the question about whether or not renewable natural gas generated from dairy farms is truly carbon negative. The answer depends on how you tell the story of its production.

Under California's clean fuels policies, energy producers must reduce the carbon footprint of transportation fuel every year. Where fuels - such as gasoline and diesel - exceed the targets, producers have to buy credits to offset their excess emissions. Producers whose fuels are deemed to have extremely low carbon footprints can generate and sell valuable credits for every ton of emissions they help avoid.

The biggest winner under this system is RNG from dairy farms, which consistently receives not only the lowest carbon footprint scores across all fuel types, but also some of the only negative ones. Carbon-negative fuels are considered to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.

It's on this flattering grading system that energy producers like Aemetis can earn avoided methane credits for every unit of energy produced from cow manure. The more they produce, the higher the payoffs.

When assigning a carbon footprint to RNG fuel, regulators don't factor in any of the emissions associated with producing manure in the first place, such as the transport and raising of animals. This is not the case for many other renewable fuels, whose assigned carbon footprints take into account all greenhouse gases released during their production.

This discrepancy is rooted in the assumption that manure is not produced deliberately; it is an inevitable byproduct of the dairy industry. So, the thinking goes, when energy companies intervene to capture methane and convert it into fuel, that process results in a net reduction in emissions.

But not everyone sees it this way. Some agricultural economists point out that existing climate policies have turned manure into a revenue source in and of itself, similar to cheese or butter. By giving manure its own inherent value, climate regulators have turned it from waste into a commodity.

""Once you pay a cattle producer for their manure, you are effectively subsidizing the production of that manure,"" said Richard Plevin, consultant and former researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. ""You've altered the economics of cattle production.""

Some climate researchers worry that incentives for methane capture have become so generous that they may increase manure production in the long run. Taken to an extreme, some worry dairy farms could end up turning into feces farms that happen to also produce dairy.

Kevin Fingerman, an associate professor on energy and climate at the California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, published a study in 2022 - commissioned by science advocacy group, Union of Concerned Scientists - that scrutinized the risk of these unintended consequences in California.

He found that revenue from methane capture alone could, in some cases, make up almost 40% of total profits for mid- and large-sized dairy farms in California. When revenue from methane capture begins to eclipse that from dairy production itself, the study warned, it could end up incentivizing farms to increase herd sizes to produce more manure.

The study only looked at California's clean fuels policies, but most dairy RNG producers can also profit off a parallel federal program - the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires transportation fuel producers to meet certain renewable fuel targets, either through producing it themselves, or buying credits off those who do. Benefiting from both gives energy producers a valuable financial cushion.

Were California climate regulators to recognize manure as an intentionally produced material, like corn grown for ethanol, then its carbon intensity score would increase significantly to reflect everything from the greenhouse gases involved with producing feed to the emissions released from cow burps.

The California Air Resources Board (Carb), which oversees the state's clean fuels programs, defended its approach. Dairy digesters are responsible for a significant share of methane emission reductions in the livestock sector, Dave Clegern, public information officer for the agency pointed out. He added: ""We do not have any evidence that shows the [policy] is causing a higher amount of manure to be produced in California."" (One reason there may not be any such evidence yet is because the RNG industry is still in the early stages of development.)

At the same time, the agency has indicated an awareness that its subsidies might be overly generous. Last November, it sought feedback on the future of its clean fuel policies, including the possibility of eliminating avoided methane credits for dairy-based RNG by 2040. The suggestion sparked vocal outcry from energy industry representatives, who warned that it would unravel the sector's progress toward climate targets. In contrast, environmental justice groups welcomed such a phaseout, though some like the Union of Concerned Scientists worried it might be ""too little too late"".

The sharply divided response underscored the ongoing tension that arises when climate solutions attempt to balance environmental benefits with industry bottom lines.

Looking ahead to 2023, some policy analysts are skeptical that the agency will significantly overhaul its own clean fuel policies. ""There are so many vested interests,"" Plevin said. ""There are billions of dollars on the line if the numbers are changed.""

It also may not matter. Carb's policies have already been replicated by other regions and countries, setting off a frenzy for more manure-to-energy projects that now extends beyond California.

Back in the Golden state, energy producers are still moving forward with digester development. Aemetis, for example, is in the midst of building out a biogas labyrinth in its corner of California's Central Valley. The company plans to construct digesters on dozens more dairy farms over the next few years, all daisy chained together and connected to HQ via a private pipeline.

When I visited Pinnacle Dairy in August, the farm's digester was still under construction, and its manure ponds were uncovered. Before we left, I leaned over to get a closer look at one of them, watching as tiny gas bubbles rose to the murky brown surface. Some of them clumped together and others floated alone. Eventually they all popped, releasing the methane into the hot afternoon air.

For hundreds of years the Vlach herders in Greece and the Balkans have moved livestock to high mountain pastures for the summer months. But their numbers are dwindling as their arduous existence is threatened by soaring costs and a lack of state support

Every spring in the Thessalian plains of central Greece, in the shadow of the mountains, an ancient and sacred migration of humans and goats takes place.

The brothers Kostas and Efthymios Papastavros, along with Kostas's wife Fotini, herd their 800 goats up on foot to the Koziakas mountain from their winter pastures in the plains; a journey of around 30 miles which takes them two days.

The family are descended from the Vlachs, nomadic herders and breeders who have existed in the Greek and Balkan region for hundreds of years and practise transhumance - the act of seasonally moving livestock from one pasture to another.

The Papastavros's day is long and arduous, starting at 5.30am, milking the goats by hand before putting them out to graze. Twice daily they will transport their raw goat's milk along dirt tracks to plants for processing before returning home to rise early the next day to repeat the process all over again.

""My heart beats up here,"" says Kostas of the mountain thick with pines, walnut, and chestnut trees. It is here on the mountain's lush slopes where their flocks graze and drink from freshwater streams that the family spend their summers.

""Our mountain is rich in water and lush vegetation, the very best for the flock's subsistence,"" Efthymios says

Kostas makes a point that there are no specific gender roles, with all the labour from childcare to milking divided evenly. ""They are the other half of us,"" he says of the women in the family.

This nomadic and historic existence, however, is at risk. Kostas describes how other herders have had to sell or slaughter their livestock in the face of soaring energy costs. Farmers and herders like him, he says, are desperately in need of more government support and significant investment is needed to upgrade the mountain roads he uses to transport his milk.

Kostas plays with his baby after spending the morning milking his goats; Kostas cutting bread for the family's lunch inside their makeshift summer barn

In 1925 there were around 13,700 herder families [this is according to a study done by an agricultural inspector that year], now nearly one hundred years later, there remains only just over 3,000 transhumant flocks in Greece, and a small number of families who carry out the tradition of the seasonal movement between lowland and highland pastures on foot.""

Despite increasing hardships and the dwindling community, Kostas cannot imagine any other life.

""It's not easy for me and my family to be separated from our flock: the goats are part of our life, part of our family,"" he says. ""We sleep next to them and breath the same air."" But without government intervention he does not imagine how his son could follow in his footsteps.

The lack of investment in farming lifestyles such as his as well as the perception that herding is an inferior profession are among the reasons it is becoming unsustainable.

""People say that herders are uncivilised and uneducated and unable to do other jobs"", he says, ""but they don't realise that you have to be passionate to be one. You have to love the animals and love the job. I am very proud of what I do.""

Kostas also takes great pride in the Vlachs' rich history, participating in the dancing, music, and festivals which take place in the mountainous villages as well as the traditional weddings and baptisms which come hand in hand with transhumance. ""The Vlachs have always been hospitable and generous,"" he says, and he is determined to hand down this spirit to his children.

The knowledge, understanding and deep love of the land passed on from generation to generation is something that may ultimately end with him if nothing is done to save a livelihood that has existed for centuries in the mountains and plains of Greece. ""I don't know if it is going to be preserved after our generation,"" says Kostas. ""We are probably the last ones.""

Abares report forecasts average broadacre farm incomes to plummet by 41% this financial year, with livestock sector hit particularly hard

Drier conditions combined with lower commodity prices and smaller crops are expected to reduce broadacre farm incomes by 41% on average this financial year, according to the latest Australian agricultural seasonal outlook.

The Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics and Sciences (Abares) forecasts average cash incomes to fall to $197,000 per broadacre farm in 2023-24, with beef cattle and sheep farms expected to be hit particularly hard.

The forecast warns some farms will find it difficult to repay debt, which has increased over the past few years at the same time as interest rates have climbed.

Recent Abares figures show farm debt has accelerated each year since 2016-2017, primarily for land and working capital, though farm equity remains strong due to rising land prices.

It comes after El NiÃ±o climate pattern was declared and livestock markets plummet as farmers sell off stock to reduce herds ahead of an expected dry summer.

But the latest Abares farm performance forecast says the expected income falls are relative to the record highs for farm incomes over the past two years.

""Forecast farm incomes and profits for 2023-24 are still expected to be above those observed during recent drought years at a national average level,"" it says.

The forecast covers broadacre farms, which represent 95% of farmland in the country but a little over half of the value of production, because it excludes intensive industries such as dairy, horticulture and poultry.

In 2023-24, below average farm profits are likely for parts of southern Victoria and South Australia, and Western Australia in areas affected by both adverse seasonal conditions and declining sheep, lamb, and wool prices.

In northern New South Wales and southern Queensland, below average farm profits are expected to be primarily driven by the climate's impact on crop production.

However, central and central-north Australian conditions are forecast to remain more favourable, with expected farm cash incomes only forecast to decline 14% compared with 41% nationally.

Neal Hughes, a senior economist at Abares, said the new forecast combines a farm simulation model with a drought early warning system linked to the Bureau of Meteorology's seasonal weather forecasts and related crop and pasture growth estimates.

""The commonwealth government relied pretty heavily on data from the BOM but drought is generally a lot more complicated than just rainfall,"" he said.

""Some of Aabres's past research has shown ""¦ rainfall can only be weakly correlated with the actual agricultural impacts of drought.""

Hughes said the new forecasting system will help government programs - such as the Farm Household Allowance and the Rural Financial Counselling Service - to plan for the needs of communities.

But he said it was important to recognise that the commonwealth would not be returning to the old system where drought maps defined which farms were in ""exceptional circumstances"" and government assistance was paid according to certain criteria.

""It's important to emphasise that it's not about returning to some kind of exceptional circumstances type trigger,"" he said.

""But the government has a lot of programs that are related to drought that could benefit from drought information.

""If we can forecast where drought is happening, and what might happen in the future, potentially that could have helped them allocate resources.""

Consultation begins on timeframe as National Farmers' Federation says ""˜wiping out an entire industry is not the answer'

The Australian government has begun the process of phasing out live sheep export in a move welcomed by animal welfare organisations.

But the National Farmers' Federation is opposing ending live export and will not participate in consultation about the best way to phase out the trade.

Consultation had started on the timeframe for phasing out live sheep export by sea, with an independent panel to make recommendations by September, the agriculture minister, Murray Watt, said on Friday.

""We want to do it in an inclusive way through good consultation with people. We're not going to rush it,"" he said.

Watt said no decision has been made on compensation for farmers.

""I'm not sure that we necessarily are facing a situation where farmers will lose their business or go out of business,"" he said.

""Any issues around compensation, structural adjustment and those kinds of things are exactly the kind of things that we're going to be asking the panel to give us advice on.""

Labor took the policy of ending live sheep export to two federal elections, spurred on by the Awassi Express disaster in 2018. The trade has declined dramatically since then, in part due to a ban on summer trading. Just 575,000 sheep were exported live from Australia in 2021, compared with 2 million in 2017.

All live sheep exports from Australia are run through two foreign-owned companies that operate out of Western Australia.

The RSPCA Australia chief executive, Richard Mussell, said establishing an independent panel to phase out the trade was an ""appropriate and sensible move"", but urged the government to legislate an end date within its current term.

""Putting legislation in place before 2025 is the only way to give Australian farmers certainty, to protect Australia's reputation internationally and to ensure that this cruel trade actually ends,"" he said.

Mussell said the live sheep export trade had ""deep, inherent and unfixable animal welfare issues"".

The Humane Society International and the Australian Alliance for Animals also welcomed the announcement, saying both the weight of animal welfare evidence and public opinion were against the trade.

""Live sheep export has been a source of profound suffering to Australian livestock over the years and has reaped untold damage on the nation's clean, green agricultural reputation,"" the Alliance for Animals policy director, Dr Jed Goodfellow, said.

Watt said the phase-out was unlikely to happen within this term of government.

The National Farmers' Federation said it stands with 24 other peak agricultural bodies in Australia in opposing the ban on live sheep export and called on the government to reconsider.

""Cancelling an entire industry based on activist demands sets a dangerous precedent,"" the NFF chief executive, Tony Mahar, said. ""What industry will be next?""

Mahar said plans to phase out the trade ignore the ""significant animal welfare improvements"" made in recent years and would leave a gap in the market for other countries, with less strenuous animal welfare policies, to fill.

""We stand by our principles that wiping out an entire industry is not the answer and will not engage with the newly announced panel whose ultimate goal is to shut down live sheep export,"" Mahar said.

The animal welfare policies implemented since the Awassi incident include a ban on sending sheep on ships during the Middle Eastern summer, reduced stocking densities and a policy requiring an independent observer to travel on board and file a report.

Data presented to Senate estimates last month showed that just 11 of the 78 eligible live export voyages that left Australia between May and December last year had an independent observer on board. Almost half of those that travelled without an observer said they didn't have enough space on board.

The WA Farmers president, John Hassell, sent a letter to Watt after the announcement on Friday asking him to reconsider.

In the letter, seen by Australian Associated Press, Hassell said a ban would negatively affect 3,000 people associated with the industry, which he said is worth about $85m a year.

""We think that the government's live export policy was a dumb commitment,"" he wrote. ""If there was ever a case study of improvement in an industry, then the live exports is it.""

Hassell is himself a sheep farmer and told AAP he was about to export 1,000 sheep to the Middle East.

The independent panel will be led by former Murray Darling Basin Authority chief and senior public servant Phillip Glyde and includes former RSPCA Australia boss Heather Neil, former Northern Territory Labor MP Warren Snowdon and WA farmer and entrepreneur Sue Middleton. It is due to report by 30 September.

Minister says aim is to ""˜safeguard our nation's heritage' but campaigners say artificial meat holds promise

The Italian government has approved a draft law that would ban food grown in laboratories, including artificial meat, as it seeks to ""safeguard our nation's heritage"".

Under the ban, which needs to be passed in both houses of parliament, those who produce, export or import food grown from animal cells would face fines of up to â‚¬60,000 and risk having their manufacturing plants closed.

Coldiretti, Italy's biggest farmers' association, has lobbied for the ban, arguing that homegrown produce needs to be shielded from ""the attacks of multinational companies"".

The production of cell-based food, which supporters argue avoids the need for animals to be killed and is better for the environment, has not yet taken off in Europe, and it is expected to be years before such products appear on supermarket shelves.

Italy's move to ban the practice is ""based on precautionary principles"", the health minister, Orazio Schillaci, said during a press conference. ""[Because] there are no scientific studies yet on the effects of synthetic foods. We want to safeguard our nation's heritage and our agriculture based on the Mediterranean diet.""

Italy's rightwing government led by Giorgia Meloni promised to protect Italian food from technological advancements when it came to power in October.

Francesco Lollobrigida, the minister for agriculture and food sovereignty, said the aim of the bill was to ""protect our culture and our tradition, including food and wine"". He said: ""Laboratory products, in our opinion, do not guarantee quality, wellbeing and the protection of our culture, our tradition.""

The opposition and animal rights' groups have criticised the move. Riccardo Magi, the president of the small leftwing party PiÃ¹ Europa, said the government had ""created a new crime"".

""This time they are taking it out on synthetic food and prefer to continue with their reckless prohibition instead of doing research and developing a technology that could allow us to pollute and kill less,"" Magi said.

Although there have been advances in cultured meat in recent years, production remains small. To date, Singapore is the only country to have allowed the sale of cultivated chicken, while two companies in the US have been granted regulatory clearance to produce lab-grown chicken.

European countries including the UK, the Netherlands and Spain have announced investments in the research and development of cell-based foods.

""Italy is essentially a complete outlier here,"" said Alice Ravenscroft, the head of policy at the Good Food Institute Europe, an NGO helping to build a more sustainable food system. ""What we're seeing across the rest of Europe is that other governments are eager to unlock some of the benefits of cultivated meat and are therefore being supportive.""

Ravenscroft said Italy's reasons for the ban ""seem extremely misguided"". ""It's important to stress that cultivated meat has a lot of potential benefits and the passing of such a law would essentially shut Italy off from these,"" she said.

Citing research, Ravenscroft said cultivated meat could cause up to 92% fewer emissions than conventional meat, reduce air pollution associated with meat production by up to 94%, and use up to 90% less land. ""We could satisfy demand for meat while protecting the environment,"" she said.

Kim Foster, author of The Meth Lunches: Food and Longing in an American City, tried to distribute healthy food in Las Vegas during the pandemic

During the first year of the pandemic, I put out a few rolls of toilet paper in my Little Free Library. I found myself adding more and more, until one day, I realized I was running a free pantry. People kept showing up, asking for food and supplies. Soon there was a fridge, too, with a sketchy extension cord running back to the house to keep it powered.

I didn't know it at the time, but our family would run this pantry for more than a year, providing fresh vegetables, herbs, meat and dairy to our downtown Las Vegas community. Neighbors often wanted to chip in and help. They asked what the pantry needed.

I rattled off the most popular things. ""Bread. Milk. Cheeses. Meats. Greek yogurt. Eggs. Fish. Condiments. Canned Meats. Vegetables. All the damned vegetables. Salad-y things. Oil. Butter. Salt.""

""Fresh,"" I added. ""Things that people can cook easily and that will make them feel good.""

But I was new at this and naive about pantries and what they could and couldn't give the community. For a while, I controlled what went inside the pantry. I'm a food writer by trade and a cook, and I had this vision for how the food would be and what we could do.

This vision changed quickly.

Turns out, the Clark county school district, the fifth largest in the country, was handing out lunches and breakfasts at the elementary school down the street. They dumped all their leftovers in the pantry every day.

At first, this seemed like a great thing. The more food, the better to feed people. Right?

They left tacos and burritos wrapped in cellophane, chicken sandwiches with lettuce and quesadillas. These packaged foods can provide important calories for kids and families living in places where people can't cook, like motels. These meals nourish folks living in their cars or managing active eviction, or those with busted kitchens or pantries overrun by vermin and roaches. Yes, it was convenience food, but it fed people who needed something to be easy in already-hard lives.

This plastic-wrapped food is not what bothered me. It was the packaged chips and sugary snacks that unnerved me. I opened the doors of the pantry to find bag after bag of Doritos stuffed into the pantry; boxes of single-serve Corn Pops and Frosted Flakes; little cartons of chocolate milk stacked in the fridge; and countless chocolate Pop-Tarts and frosted doughnuts.

How was this coming from a school?

This food got a swift reaction from my youngest kids, my nine-year-old son, Raffi, and my five-year-old daughter, Desi, who both came to us from foster care. Raffi had experienced a lot of food scarcity with his biological family and was ravenous for sugar and processed foods. The pantry was a Hieronymus Bosch-level cornucopia of things he wanted to inhale, an orgy of dyes, synthetic flavorings, chemicals that created texture and satisfying smells, a storm of sugar, aspartame and cruddy oils. Such substances can disrupt metabolism at a cellular level, but they taste like a chemicalized fever dream to a kid who craves food in compulsive ways.

He was beyond thrilled!

At about 3.45pm each day, the house grew eerily quiet. Raffi and Desi would disappear to the front yard, little urgent faces pushed up against the door glass of the fridge, looking for treasure. For the longest time, my husband, David, and I controlled the type of foods Raffi could snack on at home. Now, all of that was out the window, and he could access junk food constantly.

So how did all that junk food get into the school and pantry food system? And what did it mean that kids could eat all this sugary food in their elementary school?

In December 2010 under the Obama administration, Congress enacted the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. This legislation provided for more fruits and vegetables in school meal programs, a focus on whole grains and a lot fewer starchy vegetables and trans-fat laden foods. This legislation also required federal nutrition standards for all ""competitive foods"" sold in school stores and vending machines and used in fundraising campaigns. They compete with federally funded meal programs for kids' attention and dollars. Because these foods are branded, under this legislation they are required to meet certain nutritional requirements. In response, some food companies rejiggered ingredients just enough to add ""whole grain"" to their packaging.

Things went downhill from there. Congress caved to lobbying in 2014, allowing schools to serve high-salt french fries and pizza sold by these companies. Again, big food lobbied hard and legislators pulled back on restrictions for sodium levels, flavored milks and amounts of refined grains. It got even more slippery during the Trump administration.

But perhaps the real culprit is how we think of education. We in the United States seem to believe that the cafeteria is not the classroom, that education is unconnected to food and how we eat.

Instead, our kids are at the mercy of the companies and brands inundating them: Tyson, General Mills, Kraft, Heinz and many others. These companies are teaching taste preferences with packaged and nutritionally deficient foods at earlier and earlier ages. That kind of marketing makes lifelong consumers and brand loyalty for generations. We know that before the pandemic began, the overwhelming majority of US schools offered branded foods during or around mealtimes, and that this is worth $20bn in preference-setting profits for the food industry. These businesses have a huge stake in fighting any kind of legislation that would turn this back. And our kids and their health suffer.

At our pantry, the most egregiously offending food product was Raisels. Think naturally sweet raisins (dried fruit tends to have a lot of natural sugar) dipped in sour-dust candy. The school dropped cases of them off to the pantry. Sold as a competitive food, Raisels come in flavors like ""Watermelon Shock"" and ""Lemon Blast"". They are on the list for approved snacks in our school system.

Raisels were the subject of a huge controversy in Denver schools back in 2016, where they were famously served in their breakfast program to elementary students. The Raisels were used as a fresh fruit stand-in. They were served to kids with a box of fruit juice (more sugar) and graham crackers (sugar on top of sugar).

You know the food system is in disarray when smart, educated school professionals decide it's OK to use candy as a substitute for fresh fruit. And hunger-relief organizations often play a huge hand in helping this preference-setting to happen.

Pantries and food banks get in bed with corporate food companies because they don't want to lose access to large quantities of foods and beverages that fill people up. That these products are unhealthy is a secondary or tertiary concern. Food banks and pantries are not always meeting the nutritional profiles of the people they serve, particularly people who are struggling with diabetes, obesity and decades of poor eating. This is compounded by many communities' marginalization from the healthcare system. This lack of access has severe and lasting health ramifications for deeply impoverished people; longtime pantry users; and Black, Latino, Indigenous and LGBTQ+ folks.

This is part of the reason I wrote The Meth Lunches: Food and Longing in an American City, a book about what people are cooking and eating when they're faced with poverty, incarceration, mental illness, family separation due to child protective services and addiction. I wrote about how the foods you eat, cook and buy depend a lot on how much money you make, how high your rent is, how able-bodied and stressed you are, how many hours you work, how many kids you have, how many people you care for and the kinds of work you do.

When I spoke to people who depend on pantries for long-term sustenance, they told me about their preferences for branded foods. One woman, named Amara, told me that sugary cereals and cookies were her mainstay.

""I know how they will taste, the same every time,"" she told me, ""and I crave the sugar.""

In a 2020 study from the University of Connecticut's Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health, lead author Kristen Cooksey Stowers noted that long-term pantry users ""have significantly greater odds of being burdened by both food insecurity and obesity when compared"" with temporary users - and that food banks feared what would happen if they turned down large corporate donations of unhealthy food and beverages.

Our lifestyle determines what we eat. And big food is all over it, hoping to make a buck.

While the pandemic raged, and the pantry continued to serve people, a team of us cooked meals for the families who came to the pantry. One day, I was taking down the hachiya persimmons I had hung to dry into a kind of natural candy. The little orange globes hung via kitchen string from the lattice overhead. We had planned salads for the pantry with these persimmons, goat cheese, fried pumpkin seeds and a light vinaigrette.

I offered Desi a slice, cut with a small jack knife. The slices were sweet, chewy and dense, our special treat. She refused.

""I like Raisels,"" she said, and left the kitchen.

This article was amended on 11 October 2023 to remove some incorrect nutritional information about Raisels.

182,"""˜I want to be disruptive': Mark Bittman sees profit-less restaurants as a win","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/02/mark-bittman-community-kitchen-restaurants","""˜I want to be disruptive': Mark Bittman sees profit-less restaurants as a win

The former New York Times recipe columnist is pitching investors the chain of his wildest dreams, with no specific menu: Community Kitchen, or non-profit restaurants

At 73, with close-cropped silver hair and a propensity to toss off a nebbishy shrug, Mark Bittman isn't ready to settle into retirement. After more than a decade of writing a wildly popular New York Times recipe column, The Minimalist, as well as more than a dozen cookbooks, countless opinion pieces that tapped into his despair over our broken food system and his passion for food policy, and most recently, the 2021 book Animal, Vegetable, Junk, a sweeping account of the history of food, he finds himself yearning for something more.

""You write the same thing over again and nothing changes,"" Bittman said. ""I kind of thought, you know, I'm not as enthusiastic about this kind of journalism as I was. I'd like to do something more concrete.""

Bittman is now seeking to reimagine the American dining scene. Armed with a churning mind and a charmingly low-fi PDF deck, he is pitching investors the restaurant chain of his wildest dreams. Community Kitchen, as it is called, does not involve a specific menu, an exact location, or even a gimmick. It's running on an earnest, somewhat fuzzy, yet indisputably radical belief: that restaurants can be virtuous from every conceivable angle.

Community Kitchen is the concretized distillation of all of Bittman's preoccupations. He hopes it will do everything up and down the food chain in a way that is, to him, unobjectionable. What if, rather than play to profit motives, a restaurant could hew to a new set of priorities? Namely, that the ingredients are sourced from regenerative farms, that workers are paid fairly, that the food is nutritious, and meals are affordable to all via sliding-scale prices.

Bittman's restaurant of restaurants is a heady proposition. While the characters on the new season of The Bear are losing sleep battling mold outbreaks and crisscrossing the world in search of culinary inspiration, Bittman is stationed in his home office, in Cold Spring, New York, where he lives with his partner, the food activist Kathleen Finlay. He still cooks dinner more often than not, he says, but his days are spent rolling fundraising video calls with prospective investors.

It's a decided pivot for a man who once called cooking at home the ""most radical thing"" people could do to improve their diets. But showing people how to cook for themselves only has so much impact if people aren't preparing their own dinners. ""Fifty per cent of meals are eaten outside the home, right?"" he said. ""So restaurants are there whether you want them to be or not, and most restaurants offer food that's generally unhealthy.""

""Most people will know that Mark makes delicious food. Fewer people will know that he is also deeply concerned about the problems of capitalism in the food system, and even fewer people still will know that he is a community organizer who is very committed to ending those problems,"" said Raj Patel, a research professor at the Lyndon B Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin. A food activist and fellow author, Patel has been friendly with Bittman for over a decade, and has been a key sounding board for his new venture.

Bittman's project is less concerned with establishing a dining destination or two than setting in motion a wholesale paradigm shift. ""This is not about building a restaurant empire,"" he said over a video call, his demeanor alternately professorial and avuncular. ""I want to be really disruptive, really revolutionary, really radical. I want to show that there's a whole other way we can do all the things that are related to food and address everything that's wrong with the current food system.""

There's little doubt the US needs a food overhaul. Roughly a quarter of Americans are food insecure. More than half of the calories in the average American diet come from highly processed foods. And the food we're loading up on is killing us: diet-related deaths outrank those that come from smoking.

Of all the notions feeding Community Kitchen, the most eyebrow-raising might be the assumption that the outposts will lose money. Bittman is not the first to float the idea of a non-profit restaurant. A pay-what-you-can concern in Fort Worth, Texas, is set to open a second outpost in Arlington, Texas. Brooklyn's Emma's Torch, which trains and employs refugees, asylum seekers and survivors of human trafficking, has just expanded to Citi Field. For a time, Anthony Weiner, the ex-congressman whose political career came to a crashing halt when it emerged that he was sending sexually explicit emails to a teenage girl, was developing a non-profit restaurant in the Rockaways.

Bittman said that bringing a non-profit restaurant to market is not that outlandish. After all, we live in a society founded on subsidies, where everything from American universities and agriculture are underwritten by the government. ""We subsidize farming, but not eating,"" Bittman said. ""The United States subsidizes the production of bad food. We subsidize the production of food that's extractive and destructive and unhealthy and makes people sick, and is bad for the environment and so on and so on. We could be subsidizing food that's nutritious and supports environmental health and supports farmers. That's a change that has to be made.""

""If you want to do right by people in planning a new idea for the food system, you're going to lose money,"" said Patel. ""And once you embrace that, the interesting question becomes, where do you best lose money?""

Once Bittman can line up investors and build his restaurants, his hope is politicians are inspired to fold support for similar enterprises into their agendas and budgets. ""The healthcare bill in the United States is $4tn. The defense bill is $1tn,"" he said, pointing out that investing in healthier eating habits would lower the costs of healthcare. ""I'm interested in building a model, in saying: this is how it could look and work.""

As for how, exactly, the restaurants will look and work, and who, exactly, the chefs will be, and what, you know, specific side dishes will be on offer and what brand of hand soap will get top bathroom billing, those are all details to be sorted out later. The rendering of a dining room on Bittman's power presentation calls to mind the initial renderings that Mark Zuckerberg shared when he was proposing his Meta virtual reality-verse. It's hard to think too granularly when you're changing the way we operate on such a large scale.

Bittman said his menus will be designed when the locations are locked in place. He has his eye on a range of zip codes north of midtown Manhattan, ranging from Inwood, in north Manhattan, to Westchester, all chosen for easy access to foods from the farms of New York's Hudson Valley, New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. The menus might be individualized and site-specific. ""If it's in a Latinx neighborhood, you concentrate a majority of the menu on that kind of food; if it's a south Asian neighborhood, you make the majority of the menu reflective of that,"" said Bittman.

He's confident the food will be field-trip worthy, enough of a draw for residents of tonier neighborhoods to make the trek (and cover the highest end of the sliding-scale prices). ""You create a community in which wealthy people eat in the same restaurant as people with less money,"" Bittman said. ""You don't see that very often.""

Given his station as a leading food-policy star and sought-after talking head, it's understandable that Bittman's project is brimming with pie-in-the-sky thinking. The question at hand now is: does his vision stand a chance of on-the-ground success?

""It's hard to do everything well,"" said Jennifer Blesh, associate professor of sustainable food systems at the University of Michigan's School for Environment and Sustainability. ""I think [Bittman's project] might be a little bit academic, but it could be this really important model of innovation that demonstrates how we could shift resources to more diverse and equitable food systems.""

There could be an opportunity to influence the national conversation, she added, and warm people up to the idea of government-supported dining. Blesh cited the Brazilian president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva's Zero Hunger program that led to the creation of low-cost Popular restaurants. Launched in the early 1990s, the group of local- and state-subsidized restaurants modeled after the Popular restaurant in Belo Horizonte provided affordable, nutritious lunches to low-income workers.

Charisma S Acey, the faculty director at the Berkeley Food Institute, said that if Bittman is shooting for the moon, then it's worth building out a fifth pillar that addresses the racial and gender dynamics that blight the US food world. ""There's often a disconnect between the good food movement and the struggles that low-income people and people of color face,"" she said. ""If you're really trying to create a non-profit restaurant that addresses everything, you have to ask: are we addressing the root cause, and not just trying to soften the blow of a terribly unjust global food system?"" Bittman said he agrees wholeheartedly with her point. ""The thinking behind Community Kitchen is to work across the whole system simultaneously,"" he said via email. ""This systemic approach does not partition race and gender inequity as if they were separate struggles, but works to dismantle all exploitation across all components of the system.""

Bittman seems eminently comfortable in his new role of fundraiser, perhaps fueled by conviction of his idea, or the self-confidence that comes from being a celebrated thought leader who gives TED talks and guest lectures on cruise ships (he and Finley had just returned from a week boating around Alaska when he spoke with the Guardian). ""You'd give me $2m if you had $300m,"" he said to a reporter in what sounded like half-jest as he ran through his pitch deck. ""So I have to find the people who have that.""

Once he has raised the $2m he estimates he needs to launch the first Community Kitchen outpost, he will work to raise another $25m to build five locations over the next five years. And then? ""I hope that somebody else picks it up and runs with it. I want to get it started and I don't want to run it forever.""

It's a lot of big asks, and a big task he's laid out for himself. ""Sometimes we get it wrong. And with industrial food, we've definitely gotten it wrong,"" Bittman said. ""Let's show everybody how to do it right.""

Queen Elizabeth II ate jam sandwiches daily, so I'm not alone in craving the same food time after time. If only I could persuade my wife that spuds are the perfect meal

Variety may be the spice of life, but have you tried a baked potato? In my opinion, a jacket potato with cheese and peas is the perfect meal. It's tasty, it's moderately healthy, it's super-easy and it's cheap. Well, it used to be cheap until food prices went berserk. Do you know how much one moderate-sized potato costs in my local supermarket? One dollar (81p)! And it's not just my Philadelphia grocery store where spuds are so expensive: potato prices have spiked around the world, thanks, in part, to extreme weather ravaging crops.

Anyway, this wasn't meant to be about the food system's vulnerability to climate crisis. Nor was it meant to be a reflection on how the cost of living is out of control and there doesn't seem to be any sort of plan, in either the UK or the US, on how food prices can be brought down. (Instead of a plan, there are patronising comments from people such as Ann Widdecombe on how nobody has a God-given right to eat delicacies such as cheese sandwiches.) No, this was meant to be about my passion for potatoes: an extremely versatile vegetable. Much to my wife's dismay, I would gladly eat a baked potato for dinner every day. To be clear, I have never done this: my streak is probably three days in a row. But if it wouldn't ruin my marriage, I would.

Is this weird? Am I odd? Do I have an exceptionally bland palate? I don't think so. Rather, I think I'm in good, albeit dead, company. Apparently, Queen Elizabeth II ate jam sandwiches every day - and it was not because she couldn't afford cheese sandwiches. A 2021 study commissioned by KitchenAid (a company with an incentive to get people cooking) also found that 59% of British people cycle through the same six meals on a loop. Although, to be fair, most of them weren't exactly proud of that fact; they were just stuck in a rut. Embrace the rut, I say. Ruts can be very tasty.

A moment of clarity in Brisbane helped inspire Jamie Crummie to co-found leading sustainable food app Too Good To Go

Breezing past a bakery just before closing time to pick up cut-priced loaves has long been a thrifty-living hack. But it's a time-consuming process that doesn't always bring home the bread.

In the UK and 16 other countries, there's an easier way: Too Good to Go. The app allows consumers to buy a ""surprise bag"" that contains food towards the end of its shelf life at a discounted rate. Restaurants and cafes can also use the app to sell ready-made meals, with time slots for customers to drop by and collect them.

In the first half of 2022, the app was ranked alongside McDonald's and Uber Eats in the top 10 of food apps downloaded worldwide.

Too Good to Go is yet to launch in Australia, but co-founder Jamie Crummie credits the sight of 150-litre bins piled with food, while working in the events industry in Brisbane, as a point of inspiration for the business. That was 10 years ago. At the time, the British businessman was working part-time while studying law in Australia.

""As someone who likes to challenge, I thought, ""˜Could this food be redistributed? Could it be recycled?' As far as I could see, this food was just going to waste.""

Crummie has dabbled in simply fishing food out of the bin, but he was cognisant that this practice isn't for everyone.

It was at a human rights event in Britain the following year, which was catered for by dumpster divers, where he twigged that the market for ""this amazing spread of food"" was larger than the proportion of the population willing to fish through bins.

He thought about his mother - a long-time activist, who would bring him along to picket lines as a child - as an example of someone who would relish the opportunity to live more sustainably.

""[I got] thinking of how we can get this food to people before it hits the bin in the first instance.""

Too Good to Go launched in the UK in 2015. It claims to have rescued more than 230m meals from going to waste, and saved 592,000 tonnes of CO2 from being emitted into the atmosphere.

Crummie calls food waste ""one of the world's dumbest problems"", saying humans waste about 40% of the food we produce. It's also responsible for 8-10% of the world's carbon emissions. If food waste were a country, it would be the world's third-largest emitter behind the US and China.

While Too Good To Go is a for-profit business, Crummie says the company's mission is ""very much about democratising accessibility to food and accessibility to a sustainable lifestyle"".

In 2021, the company partnered with brands including PepsiCo and NestlÃ© on a campaign that encouraged consumers to ""look, smell, taste, don't waste"" - rather than blindly following ""best before"" labels.

It's a problem that Alex Elliott-Howery - co-author of The Food Saver's A-Z and co-owner of Cornersmith cafe in Sydney's Annandale - is also concerned with. ""People don't want to waste food but the industrialised food system has taught us to waste food,"" she says. ""People want places where they can do better.

""We're in a climate crisis, and we're in a cost-of-living crisis, so [food waste] is a really important issue,"" Elliott-Howery says.

While Crummie's app is not available in Australia, other food waste apps, including Foody Bag, Y Waste (which partnered with Foodbank during the pandemic) and Bring Me Home, have been developed in recent years. The latter two, however, are no longer available in the app store.

None have achieved the cut-through of Too Good To Go, which is used more than the Domino's or KFC apps in the UK.

In Australia, the work of rescuing food destined for the tip is largely done by charities, such as OzHarvest and Foodbank, who have distributed millions of otherwise wasted meals to the needy.

Chef Boris Portnoy, who owns Melbourne-based wine bar Gray and Gray and bakery All Are Welcome, would also like to see more avenues for businesses and consumers to tackle food waste.

Portnoy says his venues do their best, but it can be hard to find destinations other than landfill for perishable goods such as bread.

""I wish my council thought about composting for traders,"" he says. ""If the council had weekly compost collection, then I think people who have very small businesses would benefit and produce less waste.""

Jamie Crummie is giving a keynote speech about using e-commerce for social good at the Online Retailer conference in Sydney on Thursday

This article was amended on 19 July 2023 to reflect that Y Waste operated in partnership with Foodbank, and that Y Waste and Bring Me Home are no longer available in the app store.

189,"The best way to raise cows sustainably? Set them free","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/18/cows-sustainable-farming-silvopasture","The best way to raise cows sustainably? Set them free

An old farming technique called silvopasture, which allows cows to graze on a variety of plants in forests and tree-filled pastureland, is seeing a resurgence across the world

Brett Chedzoy and his wife, Maria, live on a 300-acre farm in Watkins Glen, a small town along the Finger Lakes in New York, with 100 cows - primarily Black Angus, with a few White Galloways scattered throughout the herd.

The farm, Angus Glen, has lush green pastures and wooded areas, where black walnut and black locust trees stretch skyward out of rolling seas of tall grasses, shrubs and clovers. When Chedzoy, 54, walks through the pasture at sunset, the cows pop their heads up, follow him and wait patiently at the gate. As he pulls it aside, the cows rush forward into the wooded area to nibble on tree branches and shrubs, before turning their attention to the emerald grass around the trees.

Here, the cows don't only live on pastures, as you'd expect - they also live in the woods.

""When you move into a fresh paddock, it's fun to watch them for the first five minutes because they'll walk over and they'll take a little bit of this and a little bit of that,"" said Chedzoy, also an agroforestry educator at the Cornell Cooperative Extension. ""They instantly know that's good for me, that's not good for me - they're self-medicating.""

It's an old farming technique called silvopasture, in which cattle graze on a variety of plants, either in forests that have been thinned and planted with grasses and shrubs, or pastureland that's been planted with widely spaced trees.

Considered better for the environment and less emissions-intensive than most other forms of cattle production, silvopasture is seeing a resurgence around the world with major efforts to expand its usage in Canada, Brazil and the Mediterranean. And now, in part through Chedzoy's work, in the US as well.

Chedzoy first learned about silvopasture while serving in the Peace Corps in Argentina in the early 1990s. Beef is a staple of the diet there, but cattle are also used to provide key fire-prevention services by grazing away potential fuel in forests.

""That opened my mind,"" said Chedzoy.

When he moved back to New York, on to poor-quality farmland that his father had bought years before, he and Maria wanted to use the land. Not satisfied with the quality or price of grocery store beef, they started with just two cows and their calves in 2003. As the herd grew, he ran out of space in the old dairy barn he'd been using to hold them in winter. The solution was raising them on silvopasture instead.

Rather than building another barn, he started using forests as a natural shelter to keep his cows protected from the wind and snow in winter, and the heat of sunshine the summer. In addition to saving him money, doing so has been found to help cattle reach their target body weight quicker than those in direct sun, since they need to spend less energy on regulating their body temperature.

There are many other benefits to silvopasture for cattle, farmers and ecosystems.

Silvopasture gives cows choice in where to be and what to eat, which Karolini Tenffen de Sousa, a postdoctoral fellow at Instituto de Zootecnia in Brazil who specializes in cattle behavior, says can improve their health. Cows can be in the shade when they want, drink water when they want, and graze when they want. ""If they don't experience stress their physiology will be good,"" she said.

According to a 2017 study from the Center for Agroforestry at the University of Missouri, silvopasture can also extend the grazing season, so that it starts earlier in spring and lasts longer in fall compared to open pasture. Forage also grows better in silvopastures during the hottest times of the summer compared to open pasture, the study found.

""The silvopastures are gold during droughts,"" Chedzoy said. ""The plants don't wither and burn up like they do in the shadeless pastures.""

Chedzoy says the cows' diet of grass, forage and hay that he harvests in the summer means he doesn't need to supplement his feed with protein meal or additional roughage the way many farmers do. And having the cows spread out across the forest all year long - instead of being stuck in a barn during the winter - means their waste doesn't pollute the local watershed.

And silvopasture allows for many layers of biodiversity compared to grasslands. They support a wider variety of bird species, more pollinators, bigger and more diverse mammals, and a much wider variety of plant life with more varied root systems.

But it also requires careful management and daily rotation, as livestock can damage trees by trampling roots. This wear and tear can go unnoticed for years, and once the damage is visible, it can be too late to save those valuable trees.

While research is still in early stages, Project Drawdown, a leading organization promoting climate solutions, has heralded silvopasture as an agricultural solution to the climate crisis due to hopes it can increase carbon sequestration through plants pulling carbon from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, sinking it into soils, and holding it in their own biomass.

Alix Contosta, a research assistant professor at University of New Hampshire who focuses on the relationship between land use and climate, says that her research has shown that carbon and nitrous oxide emissions were lower in silvopastures compared to areas that were clear cut or in treeless pasture, meaning cattle on silvopasture has lower emissions. In addition, most silvopastures, like Chedzoy's, don't require emissions-intensive fertilizers or feed that has to be grown and shipped to the farm, further reducing the impact on the climate.

But farmers often need support in getting silvopastures off the ground. Some experts point out that while there is federal funding available to help farmers start silvopastures, it's often difficult to access because of bureaucratic red tape and the time-consuming application process.

Still, the technique is gaining popularity. Chedzoy has been encouraged by the increasing popularity of his courses and trainings and by young farmers following in his footsteps who are committed to regenerating their land with agroforestry.

Katherine Carestio considers him a mentor. She's a young farmer who first encountered silvopasture at Angus Glen. She now runs Backbone Farm in Trumansburg, New York. Along with her husband Jamie, she owns a small herd of Red Devons mixed with Chedzoy's Black Angus. She said Chedzoy helped them set up their farm and silvopasture, guiding them through questions about infrastructure and management and lending them a bull before they got their own.

In the last two decades, Chedzoy has watched silvopasture go from something nearly unheard of in the region, to a much discussed climate solution. He sees a future with hundreds of thousands of acres of silvopasture in New York. ""We can grow more of what we need in our own backyards,"" he said.

'Failure is not an option' - Al Jaber

Sultan Al Jaber, president of Cop28, made a last-ditch call for all countries to come together this afternoon in Dubai, to find common ground amid deep disagreements over the future of climate action.

Everyone would be listened to, he said, emphasising as he has done from the start that this must be an inclusive process. ""Everyone's experience and national circumstances have merit and will be taken in consideration. We will not ignore anyone. As I've said many times, we will not neglect any issue, we will not neglect or undermine or underestimate any of the views or the national circumstances of any region or any country. And I promise that they will all be heard,"" he said.

That chimes with what we have been hearing from developing countries at this Cop, who have praised the presidency for listening to them.

Many are still unhappy that adaptation, a key issue for them as they grapple with the disastrous impacts of the climate crisis, has not been given enough attention. They find the existing text on adaptation too weak.

The question of the phase out or phase down of fossil fuels is also still unresolved. Al Jaber called on countries to ""switch gears"" to find compromises.

He looked back to the ""very successful"" start of the talks, when an agreement on a fund for loss and damage in poor and vulnerable countries was reached on the first day. ""I've called on everyone to maintain that spirit of positivity, openness, tolerance, acceptance, motivation, delivery, action. This is the same spirit we need to double down on at this point in time. And I want everyone to remember that we have a unique opportunity, it is our opportunity to deliver an outcome that is based on the science lead by the science and equipped by the science that keeps 1.5 within reach. And that will help transform economies for generations to come,"" he said.

""The time has come for all parties to constructively engage, I want everyone to show flexibility,"" he insisted.

This was the first Cop presidency to address fossil fuels, he reminded journalists at a brief media appearance outside the negotiating halls on Sunday afternoon, with the talks scheduled to end at 11am on Tuesday. The presidency has promised a new text on Monday morning, and is convening all parties ahead of that to hammer out a compromise on key issues such as the phase out or phase down of fossil fuels.

""None of this is a surprise,"" he told journalists. ""This is exactly how this particular process works. Ultimately, it all boils down to the need for all parties to come to terms with the fact that we will deliver the highest ambition and to do that we need to be more flexible and we need to accept to compromise and that all parties should come to terms with these facts. I am confident we can work through these issues.""

But he also warned that though compromise would be necessary, it could not mean a watering down of ambition. ""Failure, or lack of progress, or watering down ambition is not an option. I have clearly communicated many, many, many times in the past. And I did it yesterday, and I will do it again today. Failure is not an option. What we're after is the common good. What we're after, is in the best interest of everyone, everywhere. And what I'm going to stay laser focused on is the science and keeping 1.5C alive.""

And he looked forward to a deal, with an optimism that few previous Cop presidents have ever shown at this stage of proceedings. ""I need everyone to do their part to get us to the finish line and celebrate the highest ever ambition.""

Summary

Here's a recap of some of the main developments of the day at Cop28 in Dubai:

Conference president Al Jaber has warned that ""failure is not an option"" as he prepares a final package for delegates.

Vulnerable countries are unhappy at the weak language on climate adaptation.

Human Rights Day marked by civil society complaints about restrictions on protest.

Experts are worried that carbon emissions trading could become a ""black box' due to inadequate transparency.

Global food production will become ""˜problematic' even at 1.5C, a US envoy has predicted.

Argentina is due to swear in a new climate-denying president who has reportedly put the tourism minister in charge of the environment.

Tense days ahead - what former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson used to describe as ""squeaky bum time.""

That's all for today's live blog. Many thanks for following.

Obstructing nations must cease 'subterfuge', says Mary Robinson

Mary Robinson, chair of The Elders, has demanded that ""nations obstructing a liveable future must abandon their subterfuge"" as Cop28 reaches its critical final days.

She called out Saudi Arabia and its allies, as well as naming the US, China, the EU and India, for hiding in the shadows. She urged the countries, and Cop28 president Sultan Al Jaber, to deliver the right legacy at Cop28, including an agreement to ""phase out all fossil fuels"", seen as the critical test of success.

There was uproar at Cop28 a week ago when the Guardian revealed ill-tempered responses by Al Jaber to questions on a fossil fuel phase out from Robinson during an online event shortly before Cop28.

In comments sent first to the Guardian on Sunday, Robinson, a former UN envoy for climate change, said:

""Those at the negotiating table at Cop28 are steering the course of our shared future: their success or failure will resonate for generations. I fear Cop28 is falling short of what is required to stay within the 1.5C warming threshold. The science tells us we are in grave danger of bequeathing our children a completely unliveable world.

There are countries here with the capacity to ensure the outcome of this summit is historic for the right reasons. They need to lean in now with ambition and urgency. Cop28 presents an opportunity for leaders to be on the right side of history.

Nations obstructing a liveable future must abandon their subterfuge. The nations thwarting progress are those with the greatest stakes in fossil fuels but also the most plentiful resources to act. Saudi Arabia and allies are holding talks hostage. However it is not the only country hindering progress: the USA, China, the EU and India have been happy to hide in the shadows cast.

There is still time for these countries to step up with the courageous leadership required to tackle this existential threat. Governments must not leave this summit without an agreement to phase out all fossil fuels and this agreement must not be at the expense of other critical workstreams here. Cop28 will leave a legacy that those here in Dubai will be remembered for: I call on all [countries] and the Cop Presidency to make sure it is the right one.""

At the online event on 21 November, Al Jaber told Robinson: ""There is no science out there that says that the phase-out of fossil fuel is what's going to achieve 1.5C."" He added: ""Show me the roadmap for a phase-out of fossil fuel that will allow for sustainable socioeconomic development, unless you want to take the world back into caves."" His comments were strongly rejected by scientists and called ""verging on climate denial"".

At an emergency press conference on Monday, Al Jaber was forced to clarify his views: ""I have said over and over the phase-down and the phase-out of fossil fuel is inevitable. In fact, it is essential."" He also said: ""I have incredible respect for Mary Robinson.""

The pair met on Saturday. Robinson's post on X said ""they agreed on there being no time to waste delivering an ambitious outcome"" and reiterated her call for countries at Cop28 ""to unequivocally commit to phasing out all fossil fuels"". An official Cop28 post said Al Jaber had sought from Robinson ""guidance and counsel on convening diverse voices to find solutions to shared problems"".


The United States needs to step up at this crucial stage in the talks because it is more to blame for emissions than any other country. So says Jean Su, energy justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity:

""The US needs to shift into high gear in this final lap of Cop28, where it is a key driver in the race to a fossil fuel phaseout commitment. The US has climate diplomacy heft like no other, and unmatched responsibility as the world's largest oil and gas producer and historical emitter. These are the final hours for Secretary (John) Kerry to bring big main character energy and lead this COP to a breakthrough fossil fuel phaseout with a 2030 deadline and no weasel words on abatement. A fossil fuel phaseout is the test of this COP's success, and failure is not an option.""

Natalie Jones, a climate policy adviser at the International Institute for Sustainable Development, has posted a useful thread on both the ""theatre"" of the climate talks and the latest twists and turns in the negotiations.

She notes that the ministers shepherding the global stock take and discussions on phasing out fossil fuels had ""nothing substantive to say about the energy package"" when they had a chance to report back last night beyond there being a divergence of views on whether fossil fuels should be phased out or phased down.

Fascinatingly, Jones also described how this stage of the talks works. They are organised as ""majlis"", which is a very small circle of ministers and heads of delegation with Cop28 president Al Jaber at the centre.

It is open to observers, which is remarkable. Jones provides many juicy details, including an impressive intervention by Colombia that brings 2030 into the discussion. A welcome change from the tactic of other countries to push everything back to 2050.

Based on her nine years as a COP watcher, Jones expects the talks to run past Tuesday's nominal final day, and extend well into Wednesday and possibly Thursday. There goes my plans for the week.

I highly recommend the entire thread.

So. The Ministers & HoD are all gathered here.

TheÃ½'re here to talk about the entire COP deal.

Not just fossil fuel phase out. Not just the energy package. Not just the global stocktake. The whole thing.

That includes adaptation, finance/means of implementation.....

Argentina's Milei to put environment under tourism ministry

Argentina's new far right president elect, Javier Milei, will be inaugurated in Buenos Aires later today, ushering in an uncertain future for the environment in the South American country.

The chainsaw-wielding economist is a climate change denier and the country's environment ministry is among those that will cease to exist from today once Milei is in the Casa Rosada.

The Guardian understands a representative from his government is on their way to Dubai for Cop28. Instead of having an environment minister, Milei has allocated responsibility for the environment to his tourism minister, who will also oversee sport, according to Argentine media.

From swathes of the Chaco dry forest - South America's second largest - to the disappearing glaciers of the Andes, Argentina is home to numerous environmental wonders. My colleague Sylvia Colombo reports, they and Argentina's indigenous communities face growing threats under new leadership.

Is it too early to start thinking about the next COP, which will take place in Azerbaijan?

The decision, announced yesterday, will mean the climate summit has been hosted by three of the world's top 40 petrostates in a row, according to the definition provided by Carbon Tracker.

Azerbaijan is also involved in a conflict funded by fossil fuels as The Guardian's energy correspondent Jillian Ambrose reported in an exclusive last month.

The United Nations works in mysterious ways, but surely there was a safer pair of hands for the world's fragile climate.

Cop28 using an out-of-date number for global heating, warn scientists

The Cop28 negotiating text is using an out-of-date number of 1.1°Celsius for the global heating caused by humanity to date. The true figure is about 1.3C, according to Richard Betts at the UK Met Office.

That matters, he told The Guardian: ""It's important because it shows we're actually closer to 1.5C. So the urgency is even greater, both for reducing emissions and also for adaptation as well."" The 1.5C is the limit in the Paris Agreement, set to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis.

The 1.1C figure for the temperature rise caused by global heating is from the most recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. But it is the average for the period from 2011 to 2020, meaning it effectively represents 2015.

But emissions and global heating have continued to surge since 2020. A new analysis by Betts and colleagues finds the human-caused temperature rise today is 1.3C.

This assessment is based on the average across 20 years: the decade up to 2023 and the projected future temperatures to 2032. That 20-year method is in fact consistent with the way the IPCC already deals with future temperatures, Betts said.

Global food production 'problematic' even at 1.5C, warns US envoy

Farming and food production around the world will suffer severe impacts from the climate crisis even if the world does manage to hold global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the US special envoy for global food security, Cary Fowler, told the Guardian at Cop28.

""Agriculture will have significant problems at 1.5C, it's going to be even more problematic than today,"" he warned. ""The worst years climatically for agriculture in the past will be the best years for agriculture in the future. That is pretty sobering. We have to do everything we can to reduce global warming.""

Temperature rises will affect all aspects of food production, he warned. ""Heat affects all aspects of a plant's growth cycle,"" he warned, from germination to ripening, and the timing of the plant's development.

He said more research was needed into how to make food crops more resilient to extreme weather. ""In many countries, we've had stagnation in agricultural research and development,"" he said. ""If you look back, we have counted on incremental increases in agricultural productivity, but we can't do that now.""

He said agricultural productivity had been declining in some areas of Africa, and globally was increasing by about 1.14% a year, when it needed to increase by about 1.91% a year to meet the world's food needs by 2050.

Fowler is also particularly concerned about poor diets. In parts of Africa, childhood stunting impacts about a third of children, which is storing up massive problems for their future mental development and the fate of those countries. The key to preventing childhood stunting is diversity in the diet - this is not just a question of getting more calories to children, but in getting different sorts of foodstuffs, such as a variety of fruits and vegetables as well as starchy staples, into their diets.

""This is somewhere we really need to make a difference,"" he said.

Emissions trading could become ""˜black box', experts warn

Proposals on country-to-country emissions trading could become a ""black box"" that undermines the integrity of the Paris agreement, experts have warned.

Alongside language on fossil fuels and climate adaptation, governments are negotiating the rules for the carbon market that underpins the Paris agreement in Dubai.

Once operational, large polluters like the UK and Saudi Arabia will be able to purchase carbon credits from states with major carbon sinks such as Brazil and Indonesia to meet their own national contributions towards limiting global heating. But there are concerns that if countries agree on weak rules, worthless credits could be generated by the system - undermining efforts to tackle the climate crisis.

New text on country-to-country emissions trading was published on Saturday evening, covered by Article 6.2 of the Paris agreement. It no longer includes rules or guidance on confidentiality of carbon deals, meaning that governments would never have to make public details of the agreement, provoking widespread concern.

Erika Lennon, senior attorney with the Center for International Environmental Law, said:

""Even after a year of scandals exposing widespread failure and fraud in the carbon market, negotiators seem not to have learned any lessons. The latest proposals for carbon trading under discussion lack any meaningful oversight and transparency. Accepting them would be a win for carbon cowboys and a massive loss for people and the planet.""

Gilles Dufrasne, policy lead with Carbon Market Watch, said:

""Article 6.2 is about to become a black box. To shine a light on carbon trades, we need at least to have clear limits on confidentiality provisions, real consequences for countries that don't play by the rules and guardrails against countries that want to backtrack on the activities they have authorised. The current text doesn't include any of that.""

Climate Policy Analyst Catalina Gonda said:

""The decisions made by countries at COP28 regarding the rules for carbon markets will have direct and substantial consequences for both the climate and communities on the ground. The eagerness to implement Article 6.2 should not come at the cost of compromising on robust rules. The text we have today undermines the Paris Agreement, and jeopardizes transparency and accountability"".

Joab Okanda, Senior Climate Adviser at Christian Aid in Kenya, was similarly scathing:

""A blank sheet of paper would be as effective as the UNFCCC carbon market rules as they stand. It's an insult to the people in parts of Africa that are facing the very real threat of losing their homes and access to their land. If the negotiations end like this, the carbon colonialists will come knocking, and being able to do anything about it will become incredibly difficult.""

Many of us have for years been researching and writing about the women who worked the land, writes Prof Nicola Verdon of the British Agricultural History Society

The article by Rebecca Smith (Here's what's missing from the history of rural Britain: the hidden stories of women who shaped it, 30 August) rightly points to the vital contribution that women have made to rural society.

But while I agree that female stories have been marginalised historically, it is also the case that the history of women and gender is an important and vibrant part of rural and agricultural history. Many of us have for years now been researching and writing about women who worked the land, who owned and managed land, who farmed the land, who cleaned the grand and not-so-grand country houses, and who joined in the fight for votes, better wages and better housing.

An easy way into this research would be to visit the pages of the British Agricultural History Society at bahs.org.uk, where publications such as Agricultural History Review and Rural History Today include many stories of rural women over the centuries.

198,"MS Swaminathan obituary","https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/oct/09/ms-swaminathan-obituary","MS Swaminathan obituary

In the 1950s Monkombu Sambasivan Swaminathan, who has died aged 98, set about leading India's journey from an being agricultural ""basket case"" to a ""bread basket"". The resulting transformation became known as its green revolution.

When he started, rises in India's food grain production were driven primarily by increases in cultivated area. But by the early 60s, no new areas were available for cultivation and the population was still growing. Frequent droughts triggered bouts of food price inflation. In 1965, the prime minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri, urged Indians to skip a meal every week. Wheat imports from the US under the PL-480 aid scheme provided the only solace. It was imperative that India's food grain production should rise decisively, and quickly.

But yields in India's food grains were low. The country's soils were deficient in organic matter and critical nutrients. Traditional wheat and rice varieties were tall-statured, leading to crop losses through lodging (bending or breaking of stems); were of long duration, ruling out an additional crop in the same year; were photoperiod-sensitive, which affected flowering when day lengths shortened; and were susceptible to pests and diseases.

In close association with the American agronomist Norman Borlaug, Swaminathan demonstrated that these limiting and reducing yield barriers could be genetically transcended. They identified dwarf traits in the Japanese wheat variety Norin 10 and the Chinese rice variety Dee-geo-woo-gen. These varieties were also photoperiod-insensitive and responsive to the application of fertilisers. They were crossed with Indian varieties to produce new varieties suited to Indian conditions.

Swaminathan first met Borlaug in 1953 as a postdoctoral research associate in genetics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. At their first meeting, they struck up a friendship over a cup of coffee that was to grow into a remarkable association that continued until Borlaug's death in 2009, when Swaminathan reminisced: ""He was like my elder brother.""

Swaminathan led the development of several wheat and rice varieties - the ""miracle grains"" - that were to help India take great leaps forward in food grain production. India doubled its wheat production from 10m tons in 1963-64 to 20m tons in 1969-70. The remarkable increase was why the green revolution deserved to be known as a revolution, Swaminathan would argue, as opposed to the traditional pathways of evolution.

This revolution helped India become self-sufficient in food grain production - though successive governments faltered in distributing these food grains to the hungry. As yields increased, India raised its overall food grain production from 89m tons in 1963-64 to 331m tons in 2022-23, even as the cultivated area remained largely unchanged: 117m hectares in 1963-64 and 130m hectares in 2021-22. Consequently, the green revolution was also ""forest-saving"" - an unintended outcome then, but acknowledged as valuable in today's times of global warming.

Swaminathan was born in Kumbakonam, a village in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu. His father, Monkombu Kottaram Sambasivan, a renowned surgeon and a follower of Mahatma Gandhi, died when Swaminathan was 11 years old. In 1940, after Swaminathan had left the Catholic Little Flower high school in Kumbakonam, his mother, Parvati Thangammal, sent him under the care of his father's brothers to Travancore, a part of today's state of Kerala, for further education. He graduated with a BSc in zoology from University College, Thiruvananthapuram, in 1944.

In 1942, Gandhi had called for a ""Quit India"" movement, which inspired many among India's enlightened youth to dream of a ""free India"". The Bengal famine - a tragic legacy of colonial plunder - struck in 1943. An estimated three million Indians died in it, presenting Swaminathan with two choices: to join a course in medicine or a course in agricultural science. Fired with a vision of a famine-free India, in 1944 Swaminathan joined the Agricultural College, Coimbatore (now Tamil Nadu Agricultural University), for another BSc, and the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi, as a graduate student in 1947. From there in 1949 he went to Wageningen agricultural college in the Netherlands as a fellow. In 1952, he obtained his PhD in genetics from Cambridge University, and the following year went to the University of Wisconsin-Madison's laboratory of genetics, where he encountered Borlaug.

He returned to India in 1954, and joined the IARI, where he would serve for 18 years - rising from an assistant cytogeneticist to the institute's director. It was where Swaminathan led the breeding of high-yielding rice and wheat varieties from. He was appointed the director-general of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research in 1972 and principal secretary of agriculture to the government of India in 1979.

A new phase in Swaminathan's career began in 1982, when he was appointed director-general of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines. At IRRI, Swaminathan was involved in strengthening its International Rice Germplasm Centre, a global gene bank that presently holds about 132,000 accessions from about 150,000 types of rice seedlings. In 1986, he was instrumental in ensuring that the war-torn Cambodia (then Kampuchea) was supplied with copies of traditional rice seeds from the gene bank that had been lost in the long years of conflict.

In 1987 Swaminathan was awarded the first World Food prize. He used his prize money to establish the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) in Chennai in 1988, and served as its chair until 2012. MSSRF undertakes important fundamental research on coastal systems, biodiversity, biotechnology, ecotechnology, nutrition and climate change.

Between 1984 and 1990, Swaminathan served as the president of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In 1983, he was appointed chair of the advisory panel on food security under the World Commission on Environment and Development (the Brundtland Commission). In both positions, Swaminathan's interventions were significant in evolving a global consensus around the objectives of ""sustainable development"" and ""sustainable livelihoods"".

In 2015, Kenneth M Quinn, president of the World Food Prize Foundation, wrote that Swaminathan belonged to ""the rarefied pantheon of the world's most outstanding agricultural leaders and humanitarian heroes"".

The government of India bestowed its highest civilian honours on him: Padma Shri (1967), Padma Bhushan (1972) and Padma Vibhushan (1989).

In 1955, Swaminathan married Mina Bhoothalingam, an educationist. She died in 2022. They are survived by three daughters, Soumya, Madhura and Nitya.

Ursula Von der Leyen calls for action as attacks on livestock prompt rise in complaints from farmers

The EU is to review the conservation status of wolves on the continent after a remarkable comeback of the carnivore species raised protests from farmers whose livestock have become prey.

""The concentration of wolf packs in some European regions has become a real danger for livestock and potentially also for humans,"" the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said. ""I urge local and national authorities to take action where necessary. Indeed, current EU legislation already enables them to do so.""

It is a subject close to Von der Leyen's heart after her pony, Dolly, was killed last September by a wolf that broke into a well-guarded compound in north-west Germany.

Complaints about wolves have been growing, with some farmers' organisations calling for the right to shoot them.

A consultation process is designed to balance the interests of rewilding with commercial agriculture and public health concerns.

The commission is inviting all interested parties to submit data on the experiences of member states, and is seeking to update data on the wolf population as well as how the conservation status works in practice.

""The return of the wolf to EU regions where it has been absent for a long time is increasingly leading to conflicts with local farming and hunting communities, especially where measures to prevent attacks on livestock are not widely implemented,"" the commission said.

Wolves are a protected species under conservation laws but farmers have complained that the numbers have increased so much they no longer need such protections.

They want the commission to revise the habitats directive to reflect the increased numbers of wolves, particularly in alpine and forested regions of Scandinavia and central Europe.

Environmentalists have argued that instead of changing the laws to allow wolves to be culled, farmers can take preventive measures with electric fencing.

The farmers' association Copa-Cogeca estimated wolf numbers increased from just over 12,000 in 2013 to as many as 18,000 last year.

Campaigners at Rewilding Europe say that in some areas of Europe the population of the Eurasian wolf (Canis lupus lupus) had been stable until the mid-20th century, when hunting and ""persecution"" meant it had virtually disappeared as a species.

""Spreading outward from strongholds in Poland and the Carpathians, Eurasian wolf packs and individuals have now been spotted as far west as the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. In total, the grey wolf population in Europe is estimated to be at least 17,000 animals (excluding European Russia) in 28 countries,"" it says on its website.

With certain exceptions, including threats to life, the deliberate killing of wolves is illegal under the directive but the commission says it needs to update evidence from the last big data sweep in 2018.

The EU already has an infringement proceeding outstanding against Sweden, which culls wolves - but it has been open for more than 10 years, leading the EU ombudsman to launch an investigation this summer into why it is taking so long.

An EU-backed project to improve the coexistence between wolves and farmers ran between 2013 and 2018 with tailormade intervention strategies to protect livestock, including fencing, guard dogs and repellent acoustic devices.

The EU will use the fresh data from farmers' organisations, rewilding experts and national environment departments to come up with a proposal, probably within the next six months.

""On the basis of the data collected, the commission will decide on a proposal to modify, where appropriate, the status of protection of the wolf within the EU and to update the legal framework, to introduce, where necessary, further flexibility, in the light of the evolution of this species,"" it said.

Transparency group US Right to Know finds members linked to NestlÃ©, Coca-Cola and others, raising conflict-of-interest questions

Almost half of a federal government panel that helps develop US nutritional guidelines has significant ties to big agriculture, ultra-processed food companies, pharmaceutical companies and other corporate organizations with a significant stake in the process's outcome.

The revelation is part of a new report from US Right to Know, a government transparency group that looked for ties to corporate interests among the 20-member panel of food and nutrition experts that makes recommendations for updating the US government's official dietary guidelines.

It found nine members had ties to NestlÃ©, Pfizer, Coca-Cola, the National Egg Board and other prominent food lobby groups, among others. The findings raise questions about whether the panel is looking out for Americans' health or corporate profits, and ""erodes confidence in dietary guidelines"", said Gary Ruskin of US Right to Know.

""Millions of Americans' lives are affected by this report and it's crucial that the report tell the truth to American people and it's not degraded into another sales pitch for big food and big pharma,"" he said.

The panel, called the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DAGC), makes the recommendations to the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department Of Health and Human Services (HHS). The guidelines are considered the ""gold standard"" for dietary advice in the US and around the world, and influence which foods are served in institutional settings such as schools, hospitals and military facilities.

They inform how healthcare professionals and nutritionists treat people, and influence how federal food aid is distributed, nutrition labeling, and how food products are formulated.

""The guidelines affect the entire US food system quite strongly, "" Ruskin said.

The agriculture and health departments did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

US Right to Know scoured public records dating back five years for conflicts of interest among the 20 panel members. In addition to the nine it found with ""high-risk conflicts of interest"" and connections to the food and drug industry, it found four more members who have possible conflicts of interest. It applauded the agencies for appointing seven members who did not appear to have any conflicts.

At least four panelists have connections to at least two companies each among Abbott, Novo Nordisk, the National Dairy Council, Eli Lilly and Weight Watchers International. One panel member has received about $240,000 in grant funding from Eli Lilly.

Industry attempts to place allies on advisory panels such as the dietary committee are not new. US Right to Know has co-authored 15 peer-reviewed studies revealing how the food and pharmaceutical industries attempt to shape public opinion, scientific research and government policy.

Earlier this year, it detailed how industry-linked groups appear to have influenced the World Health Organization's decision to downplay cancer risks posed by aspartame.

""The last thing that a food or pharmaceutical company wants to have is a federal agency that says ""˜Don't buy this stuff, don't buy those products,'"" Raskin said. ""That could potentially be a mortal threat to companies' profit stream. So they are extremely attuned and sensitive to that possibility, and lobby in lots of ways to make sure that never happens.""

The revelation comes amid US public health crises related to diabetes, obesity and other problems that are in part caused by the kind of ultra-processed products and unhealthy foods produced by some of the companies that have relationships with panel members.

The report notes how the USDA and HHS earlier this year for the first time issued ""disclosures"" of conflicts of interest among its panel members for the 2025 dietary guidelines. The disclosures were a response to pressure from public health advocates and the Republican senator Chuck Grassley, who Ruskin said sent a letter to the agencies urging them to be transparent about panel members' potential conflicts of interest.

But the disclosures only covered the last year, were aggregated and did not identify each individual member's conflicts, and Ruskin characterized the disclosures as ""an affront to the public"".

The new report aims to ""fill in the gaps"" left by the government's vague disclosures.

The agriculture and health departments can overrule the panel's recommendations and has done so in the past, and Congress has also gotten involved. US Right to Know made a range of recommendations, among them a requirement for stronger disclosures, notification of appointees prior to appointment and an expansion of the Physician Payments Sunshine Act - which requires doctors to report money received from drug companies - to cover the nutrition field.

The easiest step, however, would be for the agencies not to appoint people with high-risk conflicts of interest.

""This is an avoidable problem,"" Ruskin said. ""It would be far better for public health if they picked experts with no conflict of interest. They can do that but they don't.""

218,"Has this food actually expired? Why label dates don't mean what you think","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/13/food-labels-expiration-dates-safe-to-eat","Has this food actually expired? Why label dates don't mean what you think

While many in the US rely on the label for guidance to keep or toss food, experts say ""˜there are no standards'

When that bag of languishing lettuces starts to go a little limp or an old carton of yogurt is discovered in the depths of the fridge, most Americans will look for guidance from the date printed neatly on the food label.

But with the exception of infant formula, these labels are not actually a gauge of food safety. In the US, the marked dates are only intended to indicate quality and they are not regulated by any federal agency.

""Food date labels are really like the wild west - there are no standards,"" said Jeffrey Costantino, a spokesperson at ReFed, a non-profit advocacy organization working to reduce food waste.

Consumer confusion can take a toll on the climate and on household budgets.

Roughly a third of the US food supply - a whopping 80m tons - goes uneaten according to recent estimates done by ReFed. Wasted food accounts for roughly 149bn meals, uses close to a quarter of freshwater resources and 16% of US cropland, contributing 6% of the total US greenhouse-gas emissions, the group also found. Food label confusion certainly isn't the only culprit behind these staggering numbers and the figures include waste from various stages of the supply chain, but close to half happens after food gets to households.

Sicknesses associated with mold and bacteria found on bad food can be serious and the fears are warranted, but the labels do little to ward off risks, experts say.

""There is nothing concrete for these dates related to food-borne illness,"" said Dr Andrea Glenn, a postdoctoral research fellow and registered dietitian at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. She notes that both a global food system where products travel farther, and food handling practices can play a larger role in food safety.

""These dates generally refer to when a product will have the best flavor or quality or when to sell the product by and are not related to safety of the food,"" she said. It's far more useful instead to look for signs of spoilage. Odd or off odor, flavor, color or texture are better indicators of potential danger.

However, an overwhelming majority of Americans still rely on the dates for food safety decisions.

A study published in 2019 that relied on surveys of more than a thousand people across the US found that 84% have tossed a food because the date marked on the package had passed. The same study found that more than a third also believed the dates were federally regulated, with an additional 26% reporting they were unsure.

""This is an indicator that the current system is misleading consumers,"" said Emily Broad Leib, the director of Food Law and Policy Clinic at Harvard Law School and one of the researchers behind the study, noting that an absent federal standard has only amplified confusion and misuse. ""No two states have the same rules which means they are clearly not based in science.""

According to Broad Leib, part of the study's aim was to identify what labels would work best if they were applied more broadly. There have also been moves to try to push out the labels entirely, but consumer advocacy groups quickly rebuked the idea.

""Consumers really want this and they demand it,"" she said, adding that as people are increasingly far-removed from food production, there are concerns over not knowing how long something might last.

So, now the challenge is ensuring broader understanding of the labels - and a more standardized system. But the labels themselves, Broad Leib said, ""are meant to be liberating"". With one easy-to-grasp quality-based date, consumers could better discern when something will be at its best without adding on fears of getting sick. ""You should feel like as long as it tastes and smells good and you enjoy it, you can eat it.""

On Tuesday, a bipartisan and bicameral trio - Representatives Dan Newhouse, of Washington, and Chellie Pingree, of Maine, and Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut - again took aim at the issue and reintroduced the ""Food Date Labeling Act"", a bill that would create a national standard around the labels. The legislation was originally introduced by the same coalition in 2021 without success.

Similarly, California legislators took up the cause, proposing legislation to ban sell-by dates and add distinctions to clarify that ""best if used by"" was a quality indicator, while ""use by"" would denote food safety. This measure too is modeled on one that died in committee after being introduced in 2016.

But, according to Broad Leib, this time things might turn out differently. ""It is hard to get Congress to take action unless there is an emergency,"" she said, adding that advocates have been pushing for standardization for more than a decade. ""It took a while to socialize the concept for why this is needed.""

Even if new rules are implemented, consumers will need to be brought up to speed.

""There needs to be some sort of explanation for consumers on what they mean,"" Costantino, from ReFed said. ""There are so many different things manufacturers say that it does cause confusion.""

Still, like Broad Leib, he's optimistic. Even though the numbers are still high, per capita, food waste has decreased slightly in recent years.

""No one likes to throw away food,"" he said, noting that people need stronger support to ensure they can easily, affordably and conveniently cut back on food waste at home. ""We are optimistic about the next few years because there are a lot of solutions out there,"" he added. ""We know what needs to be done and it is just a question of making it happen.""

221,"Top 10 hedge funds made £1.5bn profit from Ukraine war food price spike","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/14/hedge-funds-profit-ukraine-war-food-price-surge","Top 10 hedge funds made £1.5bn profit from Ukraine war food price spike

Analysis covering first quarter of last year raises questions over role of speculators in inflating food prices

Hedge funds have emerged as some of the biggest winners from the global food price spike that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the world's 10 biggest hedge funds alone making profits estimated at nearly $2bn.

Analysis of the profits of the top 10 hedge funds for the first quarter of last year shows they are likely to have made about $1.9bn (£1.5bn) from trading in two food commodities, grain and soya beans, in the run-up to and immediate aftermath of the invasion.

The findings, compiled by Unearthed, Greenpeace's investigative journalism unit, and the non-profit journalism organisation Lighthouse Reports, have raised fresh questions over the role of hedge funds and other speculators in inflating food prices, as a global cost of living crisis continues to bite. After the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, moved to invade last February, prices of many key commodities - many of which had already been on the rise as the world recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic - shot up in response.

Olivier De Schutter, co-chair of the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems and UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said: ""Hedge funds and financial speculators have made obscene profits by betting on hunger and exacerbating it. That cannot be right. At the start of the Ukraine war, financial investors piled into grains and commodities in large numbers, seeking to capitalise on uncertainty and rising food prices, and they hit the jackpot.""

He said the jolts to the food market since the Ukraine invasion showed how dangerous speculation in food commodities could be, with the effects of these extraordinary profits being felt by vulnerable people. It is difficult to disentangle the impact of speculation from food prices that may already be rising for other reasons, but De Schutter said speculation was likely to have played a key role.

""The signs are they helped inflate a price bubble, putting upward pressure on food prices - that were not in proportion to agricultural market fundamentals, to the actual supply of food - and this has affected hunger levels of the world's poorest people,"" he said.

Doug Parr, the chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said governments must put into action the measures they had already agreed during the last food price crisis in 2008-09. ""Windfall profits causing misery to millions are not confined to price spikes from fossil fuels,"" he said. ""Badly regulated food commodities, and their trading, are also engines of economic, social and environmental destruction. It's 14 years since G20 governments committed to improve the regulation and transparency of commodity markets and yet still we have a trading system driven by profit rather than purpose, and an international market with, essentially, no rules.""

Fossil fuel prices rose sharply when Russia advanced into Ukraine, and with them the price of grain and other staple foods, and fertiliser. Ukraine is one of the world's biggest suppliers of wheat, maize, sunflower oil and other important commodities, and of chemical fertiliser.

In the days after the invasion, food prices leapt to record highs. They have fallen back in the past year, but not yet to the levels of 2021. The crisis is far from over, with the International Monetary Fund warning last month that ""many vulnerable countries still face heightened food insecurity"".

Hedge funds closely guard the details of their investments, so it is not possible to say which funds did best from trading in food commodities. To come up with their estimate of $1.9bn in profits from the food price rise in the first quarter of 2022, Greenpeace and Lighthouse Reports examined the returns made by Societe Generale's SG Trend Index for that period.

This covers the run-up to the invasion on 24 February last year, as well as the immediate aftermath, because many funds had bet on a potential invasion as it was clear for some weeks that Putin might have been planning an offensive.

The daily returns of the SG Trend Indicator and data from SG showing the hedge funds' assets under management were combined with estimates of how much such funds are weighted towards commodities. The analysis stripped out non-food commodities and homed in on grains and soya beans.

The $1.9bn in returns on grains and soya beans from the top 10 hedge funds in the first quarter of 2022 was significantly higher than the returns on those same commodities in the first quarter of any of the previous five years.

Food companies have also made bumper profits. Greenpeace calculates that the world's 20 biggest food companies delivered $53.5bn (£42.8bn) to shareholders in the last two financial years, with windfall profits the result of rising food prices during the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Davi Martins, a campaigner at Greenpeace International, said: ""What we are witnessing is an enormous transfer of wealth to a few rich families that basically own the global food system, at a time when the majority of the world population is struggling to make ends meet. These 20 companies could literally save the world's 230 million most vulnerable people and have billions of profit left over in spare change. Paying more to shareholders of a few food corporations is just outrageous and immoral.""

The EU is reviewing its rules on excessive speculation but there are doubts over how much appetite regulators have for intervention. Governments may feel under less pressure on food as the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization announced last week that prices had declined steadily over the last 11 months.

But De Schutter warned there could be no complacency and governments should act urgently. ""This is not gold or silver we're talking about, its people's daily bread - driving up food prices affects millions and millions of people. It's a scandal and it shouldn't be allowed to happen - but deregulation over the past several decades has enabled excessive speculation on food to take place,"" he said.

""These hedge funds have nothing to do with the production, buying and selling of food, they're simply profiteering, but their herd-like behaviour can corner markets, make upward price swings higher, and distort market prices - and this is inflaming price volatility of the food we eat.""

He said the price volatility, driven by speculation, showed an urgent need for stricter regulations, including restrictions on how big a position investors could take in the market for food commodities, and better transparency in those markets. Commodity traders should have to provide information to the Agricultural Market Information System, he said.

There are also concerns in the US over the impacts of speculation on food prices. Cindy McCain, the former US ambassador to the UN agencies for food and agriculture, who has since been appointed head of the World Food Programme, told the Guardian earlier this year of her fears. ""You can't tolerate it [speculation] - people are starving. Speculation does nobody any good during a crisis,"" she said. ""[We need to] keep reminding the world that food security is a national security problem. This has not only community effects, but has national security implications.""

The top 10 hedge funds were the Managed Futures Offshore fund, run by AQR Capital Management; the Managed Futures fund, run by AlphaSimplex Group; Diversified, run by Aspect Capital; BlueTrend run by Systematica Investments; Tactical Trend A, run by Graham Capital Management; Systematic Trend, run by ISAM; Lynx Bermuda D, run by Lynx Asset Management; Man AHL Alpha, run by Man Investments; DTP Enhanced Risk, run by Transtrend BV; Winton Trend, run by Winton Capital.

The Guardian approached all 10 companies for comment.

A spokesperson for Natixis Investment Managers, of which AlphaSimplex is an affiliate, said: ""The research is based on an index and includes a number of assumptions and hypothetical returns. While we do not comment on hypothetical returns, we can say the hypothetical returns suggested by this research do not accurately represent the source of returns for our investors.""

Man Investments declined to comment. Aspect Capital declined to comment.

Film-maker Aardman says Dawn of the Nugget doesn't aim to preach but campaigners hope movie can help change diets

A trip to the cinema followed by a bite to eat is a staple treat of the school holidays. But the plot of one of this season's big family films may mean the traditional stop-off afterwards suddenly seems less appetising.

In Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget, in cinemas on Friday, thousands of hens must be rescued from a nugget factory where they are kept in a state of stupefied joy by remote control lobotomising collars. This, a scientist explains, is because when a bird is frightened, ""its muscles tense and the connective tissue forms knots"", resulting in ""tough, dry and flavourless meat"". Reprogramming a chicken's response to the horror of being ""processed"" should radically improve flavour and sales.

Children attending a preview screening in London on Sunday appeared to enjoy the new Aardman film. None were heard leaving the cinema expressing eagerness for a bucket of nuggets.

""It's really pushing the needle,"" says Matthew Glover, founder of Veganuary and meat-alternative range Chick'n. ""I've never seen a cartoon like this.""

""I'm a big fan of the approach,"" says Richard McIlwain, CEO of the UK Vegetarian Society. ""Whether or not they've set out to make a vegan morality tale, the reality is that this is what happens in poultry farms. They're not making it up.""

The film-makers have rejected claims that they are ""here to preach"", and said that any dietary reassessment would be just a happy accident.

""We want the film to be engaging and entertaining and a great ride, mostly,"" the film's director, Sam Fell, has said. ""But yes, if you come away and you think a little bit more like a chicken by the end of it, then that's not a bad thing.""

Some of the film's key cast members - including Thandiwe Newton and Bella Ramsay - are passionate spokespeople for veganism, and Fell himself became a vegetarian during production.

This echoes the experience of the actor James Cromwell, who turned vegan while shooting 1995 film Babe, about a pig who thinks its a sheepdog. That film is credited for the biggest spike in vegetarianism in living memory.

""It's aged really well,"" says Richard Makin, author of Anything You Can Cook, I Can Cook Vegan. ""And is responsible for a lot more compassion than we give it credit for."" Babe stood alone in its influence on young people until 2017's Okja, another Netflix film, about a girl who befriends a porcine monster, which caused Quorn sales to spike.

""It certainly did have an impact,"" says Jon Ronson, who co-scripted the film with director Bong Joon-ho, who also converted to vegetarianism during production. ""I remember loads of people tweeting that they were never eating meat again.""

The new Chicken Run is, Ronson thinks, likely to do the same: ""This will have an impact. It sounds quite upsetting and traumatising but I trust Aardman to do it in a fun way.

""All over the world you've got these vast numbers of animals confined indoors. Art is supposed to reflect a dark reality. So all power to them.""

The reach of Chicken Run 2 is hard to overestimate. The first film remains the most successful stop-motion movie ever made. It took £180m ($225m) at the box office in 2000; more than £400m when adjusted for inflation. Its sequel is also out on Netflix at the same time as in cinemas.

Netflix, says McIlwain, is becoming an ""arbiter of change"" in the field. Over the past few years, he says, the Vegetarian Society's membership has been significantly swelled by people affected by two Netflix documentaries: Cowspiracy, about the environmental footprint of the meat industry, and Game Changers, about the health benefits of veganism.

""And just this week you had David Attenborough extolling the virtues of a plant-based diet on Planet Earth 3. So we're at the cusp of a wave. This messaging is becoming more mainstream.""

Children's movies from studios such as Disney, Pixar and DreamWorks have tended to avoid the issue, perhaps with an eye on fast-food outlet tie-in deals, which form a key pillar of such films' merchandising and promotional push. Even figurines from the fish-friendly Finding Nemo were given away with McDonald's Happy Meals - Filet-O-Fish included.

Aardman's independence allows it more editorial scope. And, Wallace's Wensleydale habit aside, its films have long advocated for more symbiotic relationships between humans and animals. It's also worth remembering that the first Chicken Run equated an egg farm with a prisoner-of-war camp.

The new film is set a few years later, in the early 1950s, at the birth of fast food. The chicken nugget factory is a vast, Dr Strangelove-meets-Bond-villain concrete complex, with the chickens helter-skeltered into a Day-Glo faux-funfair. Their only escape is a pink and blue escalator, complete with lights and music, which transports the beatific chosen ones to the nugget-maker.

While other films have expressed scepticism about eating meat more widely, Chicken Run 2 ups the ante by putting a specific foodstuff in the crosshairs. About 2.3bn servings of chicken nuggets are consumed in the US each year, and the product is a key offering of chains including McDonald's, KFC and Burger King - only the last of which offers a vegan nugget alternative.

A 2013 study in the American Journal of Medicine found at least half the content of the chicken nuggets sold by two fast-food chains in the US was fat, with muscle second, followed by tissue and bone.

A survey conducted last month in the UK found that almost a fifth of 2,000 adults ""couldn't live without"" nuggets, while 13% would choose them as a final meal. Commissioned by plant-based manufacturer Impossible Foods, the survey also suggested 16% of people preferred vegan nuggets.

Reis Esiroglu, the founder of the UK's first nuggets-only restaurant, Nugs, in Romford, east London, would dispute such findings. He reports that the chicken variety accounts for 95% of his sales. A shift towards vegan alternatives would be welcome as profit margins on cauliflower nuggets are considerably higher, ""but I don't really see demand going down for chicken nuggets in our company.""

""I do hope McDonald's have a drop-off though,"" he said. ""I hate to think how they make them. Ours are high-end top quality.""

All the major fast food outlets contacted by the Guardian, including McDonald's, Burger King, KFC and Nando's, declined to comment, as did the National Farmers' Union and a range of nugget retailers and producers, including Findus, Birds Eye and Iceland.

Veganuary's Glover says that public inertia over demanding higher welfare standards -around 95% of the chickens eaten in the UK are factory-farmed - is down to the meat industry's monopoly on lobbying and skill at sugarcoating. ""People want to know where their food is coming from but they also don't want to know. People would prefer to trust what is told to them rather than delve deeper.""

Concerns over climate change have further fuelled chicken consumption as people anxious about the emissions involved in beef and lamb production switch to poultry. ""So the number of animals affected in the system increases substantially. A chicken has two legs and two breasts. A cow would feed a lot of people.""

For Makin, the Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget comes at a crucial time. ""There's definitely been a deceleration in excitement about veganism,"" he says. Turkey Twizzlers - the much-decried Bernard Matthews meat spirals - began manufacture again in 2020, 13 years after Jamie Oliver spearheaded a successful campaign to get them off the shelves.

Makin hopes a new generation will seize the ethical baton - and that their parents may this time run with it. ""We do a lot of disassociating from our feelings about food in general. We can't all cope with the emotions that come with knowing about the human or animal suffering involved in an industrialised food system.""

Sticking to our first instincts could be the answer. ""We all do a lot of blinkering and unlearning. Perhaps we should look to children more as I think how they feel when they first learn where meat comes from is probably what a lot of us feel deep down.""

The sinister factory at the centre of Chicken Run 2 bears the enigmatic slogan, ""Where chickens find their happy endings."" Many hope the film may hasten just that.

This article was amended on 11 December 2023. An earlier version referred to Finding Nemo as ""gently pescatarian"", when the intention was to say the film creates an affinity with fish as friends rather than a food source.

Spoiler alert: this column contains details from Succession season four. Don't read on unless you've watched the finale, episode 10.

Power. Money. Love. Betrayal. In the HBO hit Succession, these elements crash into each other like dodgem cars as they warp and rip family relationships asunder.

The ultimate goal is who gets to wear the crown wrestled from the ageing patriarch.

It reminds me of some Australian farm families.

I once ran into a farmer in the street. When I asked how he was going, he said with a deadpan stare, ""Nothing a dead father wouldn't fix.""

As many people have noted, the bones of this story echo King Lear, the patriarch. Like media empires, farming often centres around a patriarch. As he buries his father, Kendall describes Logan as a man with ""a fierce ambition"".

""My father was a brute. He was. He was tough. But also, he built. And he acted ""¦ There are always ""¦ a thousand reasons to not act, but he was never one of those ""¦ He had a vitality, a force, that could hurt. And it did,"" says Kendall.

He reminds the presidential candidates, the clutchers and schemers who come along to mourn Logan (or check that he is dead) that he may have had money but he built his business with his own hands.

The doing, the building, always justifies the means. If you are the ruler of your own domain, however small, your authority trumps. So it is with farming. Whether family inheritances are worth billions or millions or thousands, these succession dramas still play out.

Sorting out the succession in farming is often the biggest hurdle to making the business last past one generation. Since the culture (thankfully) has mostly moved past giving land to the eldest son, things are necessarily more complicated.

In more recent times, farm succession has spawned an industry, used by banks, lawyers and accountants.

One of its pioneers, Lyn Sykes, has conducted hundreds of meetings for families trying work through the succession puzzle to distribute the family's assets to the next generation. She is interested in people, not farming.

Sykes is always surprised at the focus on legal and accounting structures to protect the farm business while the relationships are ignored. Just like the Roy family, if the relationships don't work, it doesn't matter how good the accounting is. It's likely to fall apart.

Sykes has regularly seen the economic ties of a family business stunt the capacity of its members to develop communication skills. Bosses are parents and employees are children and they swap between roles.

""Parents continue to act like parents in the business, and when they do, their children tend to react like children. Many don't learn to communicate adult to adult,"" Sykes said.

This dynamic plays out so many times in Succession, when the Roy siblings slip into their childhood selves. Even in the final episode in their mother's kitchen, as Kendall is handed the ""bauble"" of leadership, ""haunted and cursed"", Shiv forces him to drink a potion made of disgusting pantry combinations - iced with a dollop of her spit.

In farming, parents and children can be proud of each other but critical of their actions in the business. But criticism from the boss can land as criticism from a father, and criticism from adult children can sound like a lack of gratitude.

Sykes has seen farming parents create a dynamic that reaffirms their roles and way of behaving.

""Whether the message is that good people farm or good people run newspapers, that's about an affirmation for the older person of what they do,"" she says.

Likewise, failing to work out succession plans before the older generation passes away can lead to what Sykes describes as a ""contaminated grieving process"".

Most of Succession's final season is one extended nuclear contamination zone; grief intertwined with business manoeuvres, punctuated by the briefest glimpses of capitulation. In the final episode, all three children insist ""Dad said it would be me!""

Advisor Dr Mike Stephens has spent years studying as well as working in and with farming businesses. His conclusion from that research is that only a minority of farms will ever be handed down to the next generation.

Skyrocketing farmland prices will increase the degree of difficulty in family succession conversations, and children's expectations can be just as high.

Rural Bank's Australian Farmland Values for 2023 showed sharp rises across the country - a median price rise of 20% per hectare - combined with steep declines in transaction volumes. People are paying more for farmland at a time when there are fewer properties coming on to the market.

As a result, the farm portion of a family's assets is going to make up a bigger piece of the pie. Splitting the assets starts to look as fraught as a Roy family board meeting.

Stephens said 10 years ago he was working with clients whose assets were $6-$10m.

""Now we're typically talking $20 to $40m"".

The scale might be of another magnitude to the wealth of the Roys, but to most people, the assets held by a successful family farm are still very significant. That can lead to Succession syndrome, a real thing whereby successful and wealthy households ""create a deep-rooted fear of weakness and failure"" in children.

The final episode of the Roy family melodrama was a good reminder to maintain perspective. Poor Kendall, he didn't get the crown. He only got a few billion dollars. Who wants to be that family?

226,"""˜Like a 40-metre pizza': the seaweed farms that could feed us all - at a cost","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/16/artificial-upwelling-climate-foundation-seaweed-farms-blue-carbon-geoengineering","""˜Like a 40-metre pizza': the seaweed farms that could feed us all - at a cost

Efforts to grow seaweed are springing up in the Philippines and beyond, vying for a share of Elon Musk's $100m Xprize. However, the Climate Foundation's plans for the ocean have troubled some scientists

A white metal platform on the surface of the Pacific Ocean faces another, smaller one some distance away. Sam Donohue stands on the big platform, Gorio Pepito on the small one. They press buttons, and a high-pitched whirring sets in.

Pepito and Donohue release the buttons. The whirring stops. They communicate by walkie-talkie. Everything's OK. A crab walks across the big platform: that's their pet, Donohue says. They press the buttons again.

At first nothing happens, but then it appears on the surface of the water, cresting like the back of a whale: a large ring, from which countless lines are stretched out in a star shape.

It's seaweed, glowing in the light of the rising sun. Four dolphins leap from the water as if they had been ordered there for this moment.

This is Brian von Herzen's plan for ""saving the Earth"", according to his website. The founder and director of the Climate Foundation, Von Herzen wants to use highly engineered platforms to ""reforest"" the oceans with seaweed, thereby solving everything at once: feeding humanity, rehabilitating ecosystems and ending the climate crisis.

Last year, the Climate Foundation won a $1m Milestone award from the Xprize, sponsored by Elon Musk's foundation, alongside 14 other teams. The teams are now competing for a share of a $100m prize fund - which Musk calls ""the largest incentive prize in history""- to see who can most effectively extract carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere.

The elephant in the blue carbon room

The prototype ring is located about 20 miles north of Cebu City in the Philippines. ""Imagine a pizza with a dozen slices and a diameter of 40 metres,"" said Von Herzen. The 64-year-old had described the ring in advance, before advising on snorkelling gear for the visit. ""For me, it is like being in space and working on a space station,"" he says. ""When you look down, there is 1,000ft [300 metres] of blue water below you.""

The hi-tech ring has the patina of an old shipwreck: the sea has claimed it as its own. On its edges grow countless goose barnacles, their lobes pulsating like fans.

At 120 metres, it was in cooler 24C (75F) water (compared with about 30C on the surface) and immersed in nutrients, both of which it needs to grow. But Pepito and Donohue must raise the ring again every morning because the seaweed also needs light. It uses light to photosynthesise CO2 into sugar and oxygen, which is why the Climate Foundation is making all this effort - to help the seaweed store CO2.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is clear that to stop global heating we must sequester CO2 in some way. We can plant trees to store it; scatter crushed rocks to absorb it; remove it from industrial emissions and bury it underground - or plant masses of seaweed. Each involves risks and questions about how long it can store CO2.

Von Herzen has not visited the Philippines rig since the pandemic. Instead, the American tries to explain it all from Australia, where he now lives, via video call.

""Every major ocean state has an exclusive economic zone that stretches at least 200 nautical miles from the coastline,"" he says, against a background image of fish swimming through seaweed. ""It is mostly empty sea and often much deeper than 300ft [90 metres]. All waters deeper than 300ft are accessible to marine permaculture.""

Algae have been called ""the elephant in the blue carbon room"" because they grow so fast: giant kelp can grow 50cm a day. The Climate Foundation's seaweed grows up to three times faster than seaweed growing on the surface, Von Herzen claims.

""We could change humanity's relationship with the ocean, from extraction to regeneration,"" he says.

There are just two problems: seaweed, like coral, cannot withstand high water temperatures. And the whole thing has to pay off.

Heat is followed by ice

Filipinos have long farmed seaweed themselves, off the coasts of the country's more than 7,600 islands. They use the simplest of means: they stretch plastic ribbons and tie seedlings (such as red gracilaria, green caulerpa, or brown gulf seaweed, also known as sargassum) to them. Empty plastic bottles are used for buoyancy.

More than a million people nationwide grow seaweed in this way. A one-hectare farm might earn about â‚¬140 (£120) every 45-day cycle. Some of it ends up in colourful baskets at fish markets, illuminated by LED lights and kept fresh by whirring fans. But much more money can be made with a prized export: carrageenan, a food additive extracted from red seaweed. Most of us consume it daily as a thickener and stabiliser - better known as E407 - in toothpaste, sweets, spreads or cream.

But the sea is now getting hotter than the seaweed can bear, causing it either to stop growing or to develop ""ice-ice"" disease, in which it bleaches like corals. Since 2011, seaweed production in the Philippines has fallen by about 20%. The higher temperatures also bring the natural upwelling of water - which normally mixes the colder, nutrient-rich deep water with the surface water - to a halt.

There are then two options: bring the seaweed to the deep water, or bring the deep water to the seaweed.

The latter method is highly controversial: it is called ""artificial upwelling"" and is a form of geoengineering. Von Herzen initially claims that, after experimenting with both methods, they are only proceeding with the former - what he calls ""deep cycling"".

Their DIY methods are inventive. The energy from the solar panels is stored in 56 motorbike batteries; the buoys at the edges of the ring are discarded car-coolant tanks filled with gas; the mill which they use to grind the harvested seaweed is designed for maize (it began to rust because of the seawater and they are rebuilding the funnel from stainless steel).

Something is always going wrong, however: the team were recently surprised by a thunderstorm and, lacking a lightning rod, jumped off the platform into the water.

""Everything we work with is recycled, old or repurposed,"" says Donohue, 37, the Australian head of engineering. Before meeting Von Herzen by chance in the Philippines, he worked in gold and silver mines around the world.

""But since I met Brian, I had the opportunity to do something good for the Earth,"" he says. Eight dogs and five puppies are constantly jumping between the workers' legs, lying in tool boxes and on fishing nets.

Meanwhile, on the neighbouring island of Bohol, the Climate Foundation uses its seaweed to produce fertiliser which it sells to local rice and fish farmers.

Crestito Garcia, an aquaculture farmer, says he mixes the seaweed into the feed for his fish and shrimps, and has since had better yields; Gliceria Limbaga says she has been able to stop using pesticides on her rice farm because the seaweed fertiliser keeps insects away.

Previously, she used a synthetic nitrogen fertiliser, which not only harms and acidifies the soil but, according to researchers at Cambridge University, is responsible for 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

""We don't produce enough rice here in the Philippines,"" says Pepe Tubal, part of the foundation. ""If all the rice farmers use our product and increase their yields, I think we won't need to import rice any more.""

He also mentions, almost in passing, that the foundation is planning several artificial upwelling projects in the region.

When pressed, Donohue and Von Herzen admit it - saying they plan to pump water to the surface through long pipes. But Von Herzen argues the term is wrong. ""There is nothing artificial about restoring a natural process regionally,"" he says. ""We are restoring a natural process.""

However, others - including the Heinrich BÃ¶ll Foundation, a German thinktank - say it is incorrect and dangerous to equate complex natural upwelling phenomena with artificial ones.

""The ocean is highly stratified, and that's a good thing because it stores an incredible amount of CO2 in the depths,"" says Andreas Oschlies, head of the biogeochemical modelling research unit at GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel.

""We don't actually want to bring this CO2 up. But when we bring artificial upwelling into the climate models, it shows that a lot of CO2 is pumped up with the nutrients.""

This then gets back into the atmosphere at the surface and could cancel out the gain in newly stored CO2. ""And all the nutrients that these seaweeds take up are missing somewhere else,"" Oschlies says.

""So you have a seaweed farmer somewhere who earns great money, but next door or maybe half a continent away, the fishermen suddenly catch less because less seaweed grows there because of fewer nutrients and therefore there are fewer fish.""

And the list of problems with upwelling is even longer: the deep water actually cools the atmosphere, but at the same time displaces warm surface water downwards, which can harm plants and animals below.

It can encourage the blooming of undesirable toxic algae, cause oxygen depletion in the water, and alter ocean currents (which in turn can affect weather patterns).

Even a positive effect can have deadly consequences: ""Some of the marine animals that love to live in seaweed forests form calcium carbonate shells, a process that emits CO2. This can cancel out 10-30% of the seaweed's CO2 uptake,"" says Oschlies. As a member of an international expert group advising the UN, he concludes: ""This method has ""¦ only a very limited potential for carbon sequestration and the risk of considerable side-effects.""

Von Herzen knows these risks. ""Whether we like it or not, we have already perturbed planet Earth,"" he says. ""Every time you fly in a fossil fuel-powered plane or drive a car, it's an act of geoengineering. We know the consequences of releasing more carbon into the atmosphere, and yet we keep choosing to do it.""

He claims we take a greater risk in knowingly continuing to destroy the planet than in trying to save it: ""In a worst-case scenario, if there was a problem with the upwelling, we can turn off the pumps and everything goes back to the way it was before.""

Unfortunately, critics say it is not that easy. Simulations by GEOMAR, an ocean research centre in Kiel, Germany, showed that the pumps, once started, should not be stopped - because doing so would actually lead to even more CO2 and hotter temperatures than if the pumps had never been turned on. Oschlies compares it to Goethe's Sorcerer's Apprentice, who cannot get rid of the ghosts he summons.

Saving the world must pay off

Eventually, the Climate Foundation team want to work with seaweed farmers whose own crop is failing due to rising sea temperatures. The plan is for farmers to lease the systems from the Climate Foundation, which in turn will buy their entire harvest, and use it to make biofertiliser and carrageenan.

But like a forest on land, seaweed only stores CO2 as long as it is not harvested and processed. To extract as much CO2 as possible out of the atmosphere, the Climate Foundation would have to let it sink to the seabed, where it would be eaten, decomposed or buried in sediment. The deeper the seaweed sinks, the longer the CO2 is stored. At a depth of about 900 metres, it takes about 1,000 years, at about 300 metres only about 100 years. The deep-cycling platform off the coast of Cebu hangs in just 220 metres of water.

But if you let all the seaweed sink to the bottom of the ocean, you cannot earn money from it. As far back as 2010, the Climate Foundation has looked at trying to make the finances work by selling carbon-removal certificates, but concluded at the time that it was not profitable on its own. So, only the seaweed that falls off naturally (""like leaves from trees"", as the Climate Foundation describes it) will store any CO2 over the long-term. Von Herzen estimates that is about 20-40% of the crop.

The team in Cebu wear new T-shirts with an image of seaweed growing upwards; on the back is written: ""Food security, ecosystems, carbon removal"", in that order. Should climate really come last? ""Let's focus on making sure we can feed humanity through the climate-disrupted decades to come,"" Von Herzen says.

""We can measure the seaweed that sinks down from the platform. We can measure the carbon removals and the emissions avoided through agricultural intervention and document those benefits. But we need to provide food security and ecosystem regeneration, so that we can regenerate healthy ecosystems on land and in the ocean for future generations.""

Asked how local people react to the Climate Foundation, one of the staff makes a telling remark: ""They are under the impression that we are in the seaweed business.""

This article was amended on 17 & 20 November 2023 to clarify that the prototype ring is not made of metal. An earlier version also said that the Climate Foundation previously looked into selling carbon-offsetting certificates when it only considered selling carbon-removal certificates. It was also amended to make it clear that the Climate Foundation won a $1 Milestone prize and are now competing for a share of a $100m prize fund.

A version of this story is also published in the German weekly newspaper Der Freitag

It could have been a gift from a runaway enslaved person. Maybe it wasn't

The oral history of Aunt Lou's Underground Railroad tomato could easily fit on an index card, with room to spare. As the story goes, a Black man entered Ohio from bordering Kentucky. No details about when he made this journey are available, but it may have been during slavery or well after emancipation. His travels took him to Ripley, a town that slavery's proponents characterized as infested with that most odious species: abolitionists. While there, he gave tomato seeds he'd been carrying to a white woman. Years later, her great-nephew, Francis Parker, began sharing the seeds for what had become ""Aunt Lou's tomato"" with fellow gardening enthusiasts. Passed from person to person, the seed spread in the small corner of Kentucky and south-west Ohio connected by the Ohio River, a region known for Underground Railroad stops from which runaway enslaved people were secretly ferried to free states.

At some point, the Kentucky tomato guru Gary Millwood proposed a revision of the plant's name to fellow seed keepers who knew of the variety. Millwood, who was white, suggested adding the ""Underground Railroad"" part to reflect the anti-slavery activity in the plant's apparent home ground, and to acknowledge how enslaved people helped build the nation's agricultural wealth in captivity. Despite centuries of forced farming that transitioned into sharecropping and other exploitative labor systems, few plants bear the names of the Black Americans who stewarded flora and fauna in fields and provisioning grounds. Black workers tilled the land, but white Americans have typically gotten credit for importing, breeding and cultivating crops that became critical to the US diet and economy. Millwood's move cemented the pinkish beefsteak tomato's place in history as one of the few vegetable varieties whose name references, however obliquely, slavery or Black contributions to what we grow and eat.

Aunt Lou's Underground Railroad tomato illustrates the difficulty of constructing a more inclusive and accurate historical record. Documenting the lives of African Americans, who were denied in slavery three things that make people more ""trackable"" - surnames, property ownership and literacy - often leads to a maddeningly long list of dead ends. Still, an ever-expanding host of farmers, seed keepers and historians have dedicated their work to excavating, whenever possible, how Black Americans stewarded and preserved plants.

Amirah Mitchell, one such excavator, is the founder of Sistah Seeds, a farm that grows and sells seeds of cultural import to African diasporic communities. Among the seeds she offers are the large, curvy cushaw squash that her North Carolina ancestors grew; a Caribbean tomato that may have been carried to the US by migrants fleeing the Haitian Revolution; and a fish pepper collected by the early 20th-century folk artist Horace Pippin. After seeing the Aunt Lou's Underground Railroad tomato in the Southern Exposure Seed Exchange database, Mitchell added it to the inventory of Truelove Seeds, a company that partners with 50 farms nationwide to produce seeds. She appreciates the hard-to-find, often flat and creasy tomato for its lower acidity, prolific fruit production that can make trellises sag under the weight, and how it makes a substantial slab for a sandwich. Squirrels also seemed to have a special hunger for them, she added. Even though the Underground Railroad tomato's story is far from complete, ""the Aunt Lou story is more fleshed out than most of the others we have,"" she said. ""Some seeds I steward have way less detail. It is really striking how few have that explicitly stated connection to diaspora, even though they are our heritage.""

The connections between a common foodstuff and slavery may not be obvious, but the global slave trade trafficked in plants as well as people. Slave ships carried yams and peanuts as food for the captives. Tough grasses from Africa, which functioned as bedding in the fetid quarters of the vessels, took root in coastal South Carolina (and now are having a rebirth as highly desirable and durable golf-course turf). Some enslavers sought people from west Africa's ""Rice Coast"", including present-day Senegal and Sierra Leone, for their specific expertise with the crop, in hopes of firmly and profitably ensconcing that grain on the American continent. And when Africans landed in the Americas, they engaged with new plants, translated Indigenous knowledge into their new lives, and became the most important and involuntary farming workforce in the Americas.

In the worlds of plant biology and zoology, the person who breeds, ""discovers"" or introduces a variety or species often gets to name it. But as enslaved people were classified as property themselves, they had no claims to intellectual property. Perhaps the most famous example is a Louisiana man named Antoine, who did what no one else could do in the 1840s: graft a pecan tree. His work ensured the successful reproduction of the trees, spawned scores of varieties, and established a business that thrives to this day; the United States produced about $490m worth of the crop in 2022, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Antoine's work was displayed decades later in a national expo, and his pecan variety was named Centennial after the event.

At least that story has a name attached to it. An 1863 encyclopedia of fruits and vegetables listed a watermelon with this note: ""This remarkably large melon originated with a negro man on the property of Col. [Adam Summer], of South Carolina,"" the owner of Ravenscroft Plantation. Like the unknown man who landed in Ripley, Ohio, this man's status as an enslaved or free person is a mystery. Free people were a tiny sliver of the South Carolina population pre-1865, but a small enclave lived very close to Ravenscroft in Newberry county. For growing an almost 60lb specimen, Summer's friend, Milton Odell, got the props and the produce named after him. But the South Carolina-based scholar James Kibler, who studies the horticultural heritage of the Summers family plantations, disputes that notion: ""Milton Odell didn't develop that watermelon,"" he told me. ""And neither did Adam Summer. It was just a chance freak watermelon that a Black gentleman had enough sense to say, ""˜My God!' and took it to Adam. That's probably close to the story."" For her part, Mitchell offers this plant's seeds on her website, but she intentionally avoids the Odell moniker in favor of ""large, white watermelon"". She's searching for a better way to identify the plant for people who have heard about it and to reflect its origin.

Christopher Bolden Newsome, a co-owner of Truelove Seeds with his husband, Owen Taylor, told me there needed to be a concerted effort to research the roots of plants. Rather than resting on a claim that a modern-day explorer uncovered an unusual pink-striped peanut in the Ecuadorian Amazon, Truelove enlisted an Ecuadorian colleague and South American partners to trace it. And trace it they did, back to the Shuar and Achuar Indigenous communities to which Truelove donates some seed proceeds. Newsome observed that that kind of knowledge doesn't always reside in a book. ""The problem with a more literal, letter-based society is that we want to have written proof,"" he said. ""That is a function of a type of European thinking, If it wasn't written down, it didn't happen."" He added that stories are just as important to heirloom plants as the literal seed itself. Descendants might not have the exact origin stories, he said, ""but it's easy to make new ones. The food that the seed produces quickly gets associated with human activities and emotions"": a meal after a milestone, the last seeds planted before losing a family farm.

Like seeds, narratives are dynamic. They grow and travel, sometimes unpredictably. New information can emerge. Stories drop and pick up details. They change in the telling, the listening, the recording and the erosion of time. Taylor constantly thinks about botanical storytelling; he writes all Truelove seed descriptions. He wants to include accurate data, while simultaneously understanding that oral histories are valid, that archival evidence is not necessarily authoritative, and that people yearn for meaning. ""There's a blurry line between powerful metaphor and history,"" he told me. ""I am not a historian. I like to understand history as much as I can, but there is a hunger for a reclamation of a story of power and liberation.""

That was the case with Jay Erisman, a Cincinnati distillery owner with a broad interest in heirloom grains and a specific one in Aunt Lou's Underground Railroad tomato. He felt drawn to the story, and he submitted the tomato to the Ark of Taste, a global listing of endangered or distinctive foods. A hobbyist historian, Erisman tried to trace the Aunt Lou's Underground Railroad tomato and hit the expected roadblocks. He couldn't pin down details of the various narratives he'd heard: did Aunt Lou actually say the man was formerly enslaved? If so, what did that mean: that he'd liberated himself on the Underground Railroad or simply that they'd met after slavery was abolished? ""I think naming it this honors really where it came from, not just Francis and Aunt Lou, but the [maybe] enslaved person who delivered it,"" Erisman said. ""I started developing this image in my mind of how he's wading across the Ohio River. His possessions are in a bag on top of his head, and it includes these tomato seeds. Whether that was really the case or not, we don't know.""

In the end, Erisman decided the most valuable thing about Aunt Lou's Underground Railroad tomato was not the pursuit of truth or sussing out the ""real"" story. Instead, it was people in different eras engaging in an age-old practice - gifting each other precious seeds, an act of kindness and community.

232,"Gina Rinehart says renewable energy could use one-third of Australia's prime agricultural land. Is she right?","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/dec/22/gina-rinehart-says-renewable-energy-could-use-one-third-of-australias-prime-agricultural-land-is-she-right","Gina Rinehart says renewable energy could use one-third of Australia's prime agricultural land. Is she right?

The figure is based on an Institute of Public Affairs report, but its extrapolations have been described as ""˜ridiculous'

Wind and solar farms are popping up in renewable energy zones and designated development areas around Australia. Within those zones, it can feel as though new projects are everywhere: on your property or your neighbour's, on the hills into town.

Fuelling this narrative is Australia's richest person, Gina Rinehart, who said at an event naming her as the Australian Financial Review's 2024 business person of the year that one-third of Australia's ""prime agricultural land"" could be ""taken over"" by renewable energy projects, particularly solar.

That figure comes from a report released this month by the Institute of Public Affairs. The report by the rightwing thinktank, which has consistently advocated against emissions reductions policies and called for Australia to pull out of the Paris agreement, claims that one-third of Australia's agricultural land would ""have to be sacrificed"" to renewable energy developments to meet Australia's energy needs with a 50:50 mix of wind and solar by 2050.

According to the Australia Institute, the Clean Energy Council and projections by the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo), both the IPA's prediction on the amount of area required and the demand assumptions it is based on are incorrect.

""I can't overstate how ridiculous the extrapolations in this report are,"" says Australia Insitute principal adviser Mark Ogge.

The energy demand claim

The report forecasts that energy demand in Australia will grow to 15,459 terawatt hours by 2050 - more than 30 times the projections by Aemo and the Net Zero Australia report of 420TWh and 450TWh respectively.

Nicholas Aberle, director of energy generation and storage at the Clean Energy Council, says basing energy demand calculations not on actual demand but on the potential energy value of fossil fuel resources has ""fabricated a scenario which forecasts more than 30 times the energy requirements detailed in expert analysis by the Australian Energy Market Operator and the Net Zero Australia report"". The analysis contained in the IPA's report also ""ignores critical facts that do not support a pre-determined view of Australia's clean energy transformation"", Aberle says.

Dr Kevin You, the author of the IPA's report and a senior research fellow at the institute, rejected criticism of his analysis, describing it as ""weasel words from the climate lobby"" that are ""desperate and have no credibility"". He argued critics of the analysis had grossly misrepresented the report.

A spokesperson for Rinehart confirmed her comments were in reference to information published by the IPA, and said they related to the loss of prime agricultural land - not agricultural land as a whole. They said the IPA was ""renowned over many years for their meticulous research"".

The IPA report does not refer to ""prime agricultural land"", but a press release that accompanied its release did so.

The IPA analysis is based on the assumption that renewable energy will have to ""proportionally replace all the energy attributable to Australia's hydrocarbon fuel production as of today, including for export purposes"".

Ogge says the report is based on primary energy - all the energy used in the current processes of power generation - not energy demand or even the current delivered energy output of coal-fired power stations. He says that results in a ""200% exaggeration of demand figures"".

""With fossil fuels, most of the energy is lost as heat - in coal-fired power stations, 60% is lost as heat,"" Ogge says. ""They are saying that renewables have to generate enough energy to cover the heat lost by fossil fuels. It's a crazy assumption.""

The land claim

After making these assumptions about energy demand, the report sets out to calculate ""how much land will be required if energy from wind and solar were to replace all the energy contained in the hydrocarbon fuels (coal, gas, and oil) produced in Australia each year"". The figure it arrives at is between 57m and 181m hectares by 2050.

According to the Clean Energy Council, replacing all Australia's coal-fired power stations with solar farms would take less than 0.016% of the country's land area, equivalent to 0.027% of agricultural land, on a calculation of two hectares per 1MWdc of installed solar capacity. But it notes it is ""unlikely"" that the 50GW of renewable energy needed to replace retiring coal-fired power station would be generated by solar farms alone.

It says this impact can be further minimised by pursuing solar projects that can be integrated with agricultural production.

In New South Wales, where concentrated development in renewable energy zones has caused angst in some local communities, a 2022 report by the NSW agriculture commissioner says it ""it seems unlikely"" that the total area of rural land to be converted to renewable energy production would exceed 80,000ha and is ""more likely"" to be about 55,000ha. That's 0.1% of rural land in NSW. However, the commissioner notes there will be ""many small local effects ""¦ and it is important these local impacts be minimised"".

The IPA's report also does not include rooftop solar - which in the first quarter of 2023 was the single biggest contributor of renewable energy to the National Electricity Market - nor does it include offshore wind, hydro or other electricity generation sources. It also does not account for greater efficiency in energy use due to electrification.

According to Aemo, one-third of all detached homes in the national grid - most of which are in cities - have rooftop solar panels. By 2050 rooftop solar is expected to account for 72GW of Australia's energy production, compared with 70GW from utility-scale wind and 55GW from solar farms.

What about shared land use?

The suggestions around loss of agricultural land assume that all renewable energy would be built on agricultural land and do not account for mixed use under solar and windfarms.

About 97% of land under onshore windfarms is either grazed or cropped, says Karin Stark from Farm Renewables Consulting, and there is growing work on using the land under solar farms.

""You can't really include the area that a windfarm covers as being taken out of farming,"" she says.

Stark co-authored a report released last month called Pursuing an Agrivoltaic Future in Australia about the opportunities associated with integrating solar developments and agriculture, and the policy settings required to help it along.

Grazing sheep under solar panels is already a common practice and has the dual benefit of keeping grass low to reduce the fire risk as well as providing shade and protection from predators for sheep, resulting in increased soil moisture, increased grazing time and a reduction in lamb loss.

But Stark says most of these arrangements have been put in place after the solar farms were developed and that considering agricultural co-design earlier in the design process would allow for more productive shared use. There are examples in the US and Europe of co-locating solar panels and horticultural crops, particularly berries and leafy greens.

""Farming can actually benefit from having solar on the land because of the increased soil moisture, reduced irrigation demands and partial shade, which is becoming more and more important in Australia as the climate warms,"" Stark says.

Hosting a renewable energy project also allows farmers to diversify their income and increases resilience through unproductive years.

Stark, who lives on a farm in the central west Orana renewable energy zone in regional NSW, says she understands the rush of development can feel overwhelming for farmers living in renewable energy zones, and the rollout has not always been handled well.

""It can feel like it's all around you,"" she says. ""Farmers aren't really being supported in this transition to understand their rights.""

That makes it even more important to counter misinformation, she says.

""It is a big deal for regional communities if they see productive land being taken out of supply for energy production,"" she says. ""It's very ideological, so trying to put facts around it doesn't always convince people. We need more meaningful engagement.""

Cary Fowler says world needs to produce 50-60% more food by middle of the century but global heating is expected to reduce yield rates

The world could fall short of food by 2050 due to falling crop yields, insufficient investment in agricultural research and trade shocks, according to Joe Biden's special envoy for food security, Dr Cary Fowler.

Fowler, who is also known as the ""father"" of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, a global store of seeds for the most significant crops, said studies by agricultural economists showed the world needed to produce 50-60% more food by 2050 in order to feed its growing population. But crop yields rates were projected to decline by between 3-12% as a result of global heating.

""We're going to fall fairly short of being able to provide that kind of increase in food production by mid-century,"" Fowler said.

Asked by Guardian Australia whether he described the situation as an ""existential crisis"", Fowler replied: ""It's pretty close to it, isn't it?""

Fowler was in Canberra on Tuesday to give the keynote address at the Crawford Fund's annual conference. The title for the conference is Global Food Security in a Riskier World.

He was appointed to the role of special envoy by Biden in 2022. His previous roles include with the Global Crop Diversity Trust and the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development.

Fowler said Australian agriculture had much to offer globally in research and development around food security in a warming, drying climate, having built a world-leading industry despite poor soils and a challenging climate. The growing industry around Indigenous crops had also attracted global interest.

But he warned that many countries had become lax about the challenge ahead off the back of huge gains in productivity that saw a massive increase in food production in the past century.

""We are in the midst of a global food crisis,"" he said. ""More than 700 million people were undernourished in 2022 compared to 613 million in 2019. It's an incomprehensibly large number and a human tragedy. Every country is affected, including countries like Australia, but especially the most vulnerable around the world.""

The crisis has been exacerbated by supply chain disruption from the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, high fertiliser prices and low grain supplies on hand. Given 131 of 196 countries in the world were net food importers, Fowler said, any shocks to a global system would immediately impact trade.

""As a result of all of those things, a number of countries took action to restrict trade, and that made the problem even worse,"" he said.

""Because typically, trade is how you make up for short-term deficits in your own production. So if you ask the question of what the causes are, then you have to look at climate, stockpiles, trade and conflict.""

Fowler said countries needed to increase their investment in agricultural research, including on longer-term ""moonshot"" projects with no near-term payoffs. The United States agricultural research and development budget was at the same level it was 50 years ago, when taking into account inflation.

""Many developed countries, and I put the United States in that category, have ""¦ fallen behind China in terms of public investment in agricultural R&D,"" he said.

While some of that research funding had been picked up by the private sector, he said, in recent years much of that was focused on developing and marketing new food and beverage products rather than public sector plant-breeding programs, or the effects of drought or climate change on food production crops.

""All dollars are not invested equally, if we are trying to fix those outcomes.""

235,"Unprecedented â‚¬2.2bn drought response plan approved in Spain","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/11/spain-approves-unprecedented-drought-recovery-plan","Unprecedented â‚¬2.2bn drought response plan approved in Spain

Package of measures will help farmers maintain production and avoid food shortages after hottest April ever

The Spanish government has approved a â‚¬2.2bn (£1.9bn) plan to help farmers and consumers cope with an enduring drought that has been exacerbated by the hottest and driest April on record.

The measures, described as unprecedented by the government, were
signed off by the cabinet on Thursday. They include â‚¬1.4bn of funds from the environment ministry to tackle the drought and increase the availability of water, and â‚¬784m from the agriculture ministry to help farmers maintain production and avoid food shortages.

The plan came a day after the Socialist-led coalition government announced legislation that will mean outdoor workers such as refuse collectors, street sweepers and builders will not have to work when the Spanish meteorological office issues high temperature alerts. The move follows the deaths of a street sweeper and a leaflet delivery man during last July's heatwave in the Madrid region.

Spain's environment minister, Teresa Ribera, said her department would spend â‚¬1.4bn on building new infrastructure such as desalination plants; on doubling the proportion of water that is reused in urban areas from 10% to 20% by 2027; and on subsidising those whose irrigation water supplies would be reduced.

She said: ""Spain is a country that is used to periods of drought but there's no doubt that, as a consequence of the climate change we're experiencing, we're seeing far more frequent and intense events and phenomena.

""And we need to prepare for that by taking advantage of all the technical capacity that Spain has accrued and developed over many years. We need to deal with episodes such as the present one - and that requires planning, structural measures and also, obviously, short-term and immediate help plans.""

Ribera said promising more water was not the answer, stressing that investments had to be made to manage demand and drive efficient use of the resource.

The agriculture minister, Luis Planas, said most of the â‚¬784m promised by his ministry would go on direct help to livestock and grain farmers, who would also receive tax breaks.

He said: ""The main objective is to secure the productive continuity of our primary sector - of our crop and livestock farmers - so that they can produce food, which is a fundamental element when it comes to providing for our citizens, but which is also very important when it comes to food prices.""

While the government said it had approved the measures in response to the drought, high temperatures and the war in Ukraine, the opposition conservative People's party (PP) accused it of trying to con voters as Spain prepares to vote in regional and municipal elections on 28 May.

The PP's leader, Alberto NÃºÃ±ez FeijÃ³o, said the government had responded too late to the water shortage and called instead for an urgent meeting of regional presidents and the creation of a national water authority to oversee improvements to infrastructure.

Nevertheless, the PP, which governs the large southern region of AndalucÃ­a, has recently faced bitter domestic and international criticism over its plans to legalise strawberry farms that could threaten the survival of one of Europe's most important wetlands.

Water supplies to the DoÃ±ana natural space, whose marshes, forests and dunes extend across almost 130,000 hectares (320,000 acres) and include a Unesco-listed national park, have declined drastically over the last 30 years because of climate breakdown, farming, mining pollution and marsh drainage.

Last week, however, the PP regional government shrugged off such concerns - as well as warnings from Unesco, the European Commission and many wildlife and conservation groups - and began fast-tracking a new law that would increase the amount of irrigable land around DoÃ±ana by 800 hectares. The legislation, proposed by the PP and the far-right Vox party, will also serve as an amnesty for the strawberry farmers who have already sunk illegal wells there.

While all of Spain has been in drought since January 2022, water supplies in Catalonia have fallen so low that authorities introduced laws in March including a 40% reduction in water to be used for agriculture, a 15% reduction for industrial uses, and a cut in the average daily supply per inhabitant from 250 litres to 230 litres.

From mining to cattle ranching and soya farming, some of the world's largest companies exploit the region, though many also claim to be giving something back

Vale

CEO: Eduardo Bartolomeo
Main business: Mining - iron, copper, nickel. Also manganese and gold
Ownership: Shareholders
HQ: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

Major operations in the Amazon: CarajÃ¡s, Vale's iron-ore mine in the state of ParÃ¡, is the largest in the world. Vale also controls Mina do Azul (manganese), Mina OnÃ§a Puma (nickel), Mina Sossego (copper and gold). It also controls Mina Salobo in ParÃ¡, the largest copper deposit ever found in Brazil.

Any links to deforestation, environmental issues and human rights conflicts? Linked to deforestation in a 2017 scientific paper. In 2018 was ordered to repair environmental damage to land in ParÃ¡. In 2020 an investigation revealed that Vale had 236 applications registered with the national mining agency (ANM) for mineral exploration in Brazil's Amazon basin, 214 on Indigenous territory. It withdrew all the applications the following year.

Ways it gives back to the Amazon: Protects more than 800,000 hectares (2m acres) of rainforest in the state of ParÃ¡, in partnership with Instituto Chico Mendes de ConservaÃ§Ã£o da Biodiversidade. Planning and design for the mines focused on reducing environmental impact and water use. The company funds extensive health, education, cultural and sports programmes across the region. It runs the Fundo Vale scheme, which supports green businesses and works to restore and protect thousands of hectares of forest. It also funds a research scheme - the Instituto TecnolÃ³gico Vale - which studies the Amazon's biodiversity.

Has announced $2bn (£1.6bn) plans to reduce its emissions. In 2021 announced a ""social ambition"" programme to work with neighbouring communities.

Alcoa

CEO: Roy Harvey
Main business: Mining - aluminium and bauxite
Ownership: Shareholders
HQ: Pittsburgh, US

Major operations in the Amazon: Runs the Juruti mine in ParÃ¡, which has been assessed as having a 700m-ton deposit of bauxite (the raw material used to make aluminium) - one of the largest in the world.

Any links to deforestation, environmental issues and human rights conflicts? Brazilian federal and ParÃ¡ state prosecutors sued Alcoa's Brazilian mining subsidiary in 2005 in an effort to block the Juruti mine. In 2009 a Bloomberg report concluded that it would consume 10,500ha of primary rainforest in the Amazon and suck 500,000 litres of water an hour from the Amazon.

Ways it gives back to the Amazon: After some negotiation, the government granted full collective land rights, and Alcoa agreed to pay rent for occupying community land, compensate for losses and damages, and give local people an annual share in mine profits. According to Mongabay, ""more than 10 years on, Alcoa has reformed its corporate image and ways, earning an enviable collection of sustainability certificates along with a reputation for dialogue with local communities."" Alcoa's GÃªnesis Costa told the publication: ""We've invested 73m Brazilian reals [$14m] in Juruti in installations like the hospital, which seems set to become an [example] for the region.""

MRN

CEO: Guido Germani
Main business: Mining - bauxite
Ownership: Joint venture between Rio Tinto, Alcoa, Norsk Hydro, Vale
HQ: Porto Trombetas, ParÃ¡, Brazil

Major operations in the Amazon: The OriximinÃ¡ and Terra Santa mines in ParÃ¡, which produce bauxite ore.

Any links to deforestation, environmental issues and human rights conflicts? Scientific report in 2017 linked MRN to deforestation. A Christian Aid report in 2022 alleged that MRN's mining operations in OriximinÃ¡ had ""caused the deforestation of extensive areas of tropical forest"" and ""polluted watercourses"", and argued that tax exemptions given to the company ""cut directly into the budgets of the state and municipalities tasked with providing public services and investing in sustainable development"".

Ways it gives back to the Amazon: Company has rehabilitated Lake Batatain OriximinÃ¡, and helped establish the Saraca-Taaquera national forest and Trombetas biological reserve to prevent further forest loss and environmental degradation. Has reforested 7,500ha, and invested more than $4m in social environmental projects.

Norsk Hydro

CEO: Hilde Merete Aasheim
Main business: Mining - aluminium
Ownership: Shareholders
HQ: Oslo, Norway

Major operations in the Amazon: Owns four companies in ParÃ¡: MineraÃ§Ã£o Paragominas, which explores for bauxite in the Paragominas region; the Alunorte alumina refinery; the Albras aluminium factory and the Companhia de Alumina do ParÃ¡, all three in the Barcarena area.

Any links to deforestation, environmental issues and human rights conflicts? Linked to water contamination in 2018 after heavy rainfall led to local flooding but stated that other factors had been responsible. A Dutch court ruled in 2022 that a case against the company related to the events could proceed. The company strongly disputes the allegations.

Ways it gives back to the Amazon: Has developed new techniques that safeguard communities and the environment. The $100m Hydro sustainability fund supports community investments. A rehabilitation programme is being operated around the Paragominas mine with the support of local universities. Since the 2018 storm, it has been building stronger links with local communities.

JBS

CEO: Gilberto XandÃ³
Main business: The world's largest meat-processing company
Ownership: Shareholders
HQ: SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil

Major operations in the Amazon: Owns multiple abattoirs in the Amazon and sources livestock directly and indirectly from hundreds of farms throughout the forest.

Any links to deforestation, environmental issues and human rights conflicts? Has been linked to deforestation. A report by Global Witness in 2022 highlighted failures by JBS, Marfrig and Minerva Foods to monitor their supply chain properly, and also raised issues with the auditors. In 2018 Norway's state pension fund divested from the company over these concerns.

Ways it gives back to the Amazon: In 2020 the company pledged to build the Green Platform, which would allow it to monitor all suppliers by 2025. Runs the JBS Amazon Fund, backing initiatives to promote sustainable social and economic development in the Amazon. In 2021 promised to publish a net-zero action plan, with targets consistent with the criteria of the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), a partnership between CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), the UN Global Compact, World Resources Institute and the World Wide Fund for Nature.

Marfrig

Chairman: Marcos Antonio Molina dos Santos
Main business: Processing meat
Ownership: Shareholders
HQ: SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil

Major operations in the Amazon: Owns abattoirs and sources directly and indirectly from multiple farmers.

Any links to deforestation, environmental issues and human rights conflicts? Has been linked to deforestation. Discussions over a $200m loan from the Inter-American Development Bank - tied to environmental targets - were broken off because, according to the IDB, conditions were ""not ideal"". Marfrig said the talks were ended mutually due to a disagreement over ""financial conditions"" and methodologies. In December 2021 the Norwegian state pension fund placed Marfrig under observation ""due to risk that the company contributes to serious environmental damage"".

Ways it gives back to the Amazon: Took the industry lead with the Marfrig Verde + pledge in 2020 to have full traceability of its Amazon cattle by 2025. Marfrig created a risk-mitigation map for the Amazon and other Brazilian biomes, for direct and indirect suppliers, to identify the areas most exposed to deforestation and social conflicts. The company says it now monitors 100% of direct suppliers, while for indirect suppliers, traceability rates have reach 80% in the Amazon biome and 74% in the Cerrado biome.

Minerva Foods

CEO: Fernando Galletti
Main business: Beef producer and exporter, also in processed foods
Ownership: Shareholders
HQ: Barretos, Brazil

Major operations in the Amazon: Owns numerous abattoirs and sources from farmers.

Any links to deforestation, environmental issues and human rights conflicts? Has been linked in the past to deforestation. The company says that it uses the best-available technology in its traceability practices to ensure compliance with environmental, labour and land tenure regulations within its portfolio of producers.

Ways it gives back to the Amazon: Minerva is the only company to monitor all of its direct supplier farms, according to its reports. Pioneered the wider application of geospatial monitoring technology, tracks the condition of ranches, ensuring that cattle bought by Minerva do not originate from illegally deforested ranches; or possess environmental embargos (punitive measures imposed by inspectors to stop activities that degrade the environment). Is working with suppliers to get them into its low-carbon emission ""Renove"" programme.

Brasil Biofuels

CEO: Milton Steagall
Main business: Agribusiness, biofuels and renewable energy
Ownership: Privately owned
HQ: SÃ£o JoÃ£o da Baliza, Roraima, Brazil

Major operations in the Amazon: Sustainable cultivation of palm oil, biotechnology lab, biodiesel plant, renewable energy thermoelectric plants, and biorefinery under construction to produce hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) biofuels.

Any links to deforestation, environmental issues and human rights conflicts? Biopalma, bought by BBF in 2020, was the subject of a federal investigation into the impact of pesticide contamination from the plantations. A police investigation cleared the company. BBF was also accused of violence and intimidation by a neighbouring community. The company counters that in fact they have been the victims of theft and assault and state that good relationships with local communities are a vital part of their working philosophy.

Ways it gives back to the Amazon: The BBF Group sees its mission as ""decarbonising the Amazon forest and changing the energy matrix of the northern region of Brazil"". Developing a sustainable model for producing palm oil is one of the prime goals. According to the company, under the strict Brazilian palm-oil regulatory system, plantations can only be on land previously defined as degraded.

More than 6,000 jobs created in the Amazon. The company estimates that more than 25m tons of carbon have been stored by the 11m trees it has planted. The biofuels produced by the company and used by Amazon residents lead to a significant amount of avoided emissions. The company says its biofuel-powered thermoelectric plants produce clean energy for remote Amazon communities. Also supports local communities with transport and technological projects.

after newsletter promotion

CEO: Beny Fiterman
Main business: Biofuels
Ownership: Part of Alfa Group, privately held
HQ: Belem, ParÃ¡

Major operations in the Amazon: Plantations, extraction plant and refinery in ParÃ¡.

Any links to deforestation, environmental issues and human rights conflicts? Faced allegations of landgrabbing. The company says all their land was acquired in good faith but is continuing to look into possible issues predating their purchase.

Subsequently, the IBD certification of their plantations has been temporarily suspended. The company says it remains a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, which runs the certification process, and expects to have the suspension lifted soon.

Ways it gives back to the Amazon: The company says it is committed to zero deforestation: since 2002, the company no longer converts forests into palm plantations. Primary responsibility for a 64,000ha Amazon forest reserve. Has pioneered palm oil family farming and is committed to providing formal employment for families to help them into guaranteed and sustainable work. Runs a school for 500 children. Partnered for 15 years with Conservation International to develop a sustainable production model that has registered 1,029 species of Brazilian fauna in Agropalma's forest reserves.

Suzano

CEO: Walter Schalka
Main business: Eucalyptus pulp
Ownership: Shareholders
HQ: SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil

Major operations in the Amazon: The Suzano factory in Imperatriz, MaranhÃ£o, lies on the border between the Cerrado, a large area of tropical savanna, and the Amazon, and sources from both biomes.

Any links to deforestation, environmental issues and human rights conflicts? ""Coconut breakers"" - women who harvest coconuts - complain that Suzano's expansion is displacing the palms they depend on; the company denies this. Eucalyptus production is also water intensive, and local populations have complained that river levels are affected.

Ways it gives back to the Amazon: Suzano has a regenerative business model, planting more than 1.2m trees every day in degraded land, only harvesting what it plants, with 40% of its land (nearly 1m hectares) set aside for permanent conservation. Eucalyptus plantations are being seen as a way of achieving reforestation and carbon capture goals, supported by the regional government, which has announced that it will use eucalyptus to help replace some of its lost forests. The plantations can help solve the climate crisis, the company says.

In 2022, Suzano began a project to connect 500,000ha of priority conservation areas through biodiversity corridors, and also announced the launch of a new forest restoration venture to restore and conserve 40,000 sq km of Brazilian forest, which will involve planting 2m trees of native species. Runs a number of social programmes with local communities.

Cargill

CEO: Brian Sikes
Main business: Commodity traders
Ownership: Largest privately owned US company
HQ: Wayzata, Minnesota

Major operations in the Amazon: Cargill buys from a number of plantations in the Amazon.

Any links to deforestation, environmental issues and human rights conflicts? Has been linked to deforestation in the Amazon and the neighbouring Cerrado. Named as the ""world's worst company"" by Mighty Earth in 2019. In the report's foreword, the former US congressman Henry Waxman wrote of their exchanges with the company: ""We've successfully worked to improve the environmental and human rights practices of dozens of companies, but have never encountered a company that has such difficulty translating high-level commitments into action.""

The environmental law charity ClientEarth has now filed a legal complaint against Cargill over its failure to adequately deal with its contribution to soya-driven deforestation and human rights violations in Brazil. The company says it has ""an unwavering commitment"" to eliminate deforestation in Brazil.

Ways it gives back to the Amazon: One of the original signatories to the Amazon Soy Moratorium (ASM). Supported the CoalizÃ£o Brasil, which pleaded with Brazil's far-right former president, Jair Bolsonaro, not to leave the Paris climate agreement or dismantle the environment ministry.

Has accelerated its commitment to eliminate deforestation in its soya supply chain in the Amazon, Cerrado and Chaco biomes by 2025. Is investing in programmes and training to help farmers, increased technology to improve traceability, and investments in teams in Brazil and throughout South America in order to accelerate deforestation efforts. Committed $30m to launch the Land Innovation Fund for Sustainable Livelihoods, which funds projects that empower farmers and protects forests across South America.

It is the plant that changed humanity. Thanks to the cultivation of wheat, Homo sapiens was able to feed itself in ever-increasing numbers, transforming groups of hunter-gatherers struggling to survive in a hostile world into rulers of the planet.

In the process, a species of wild grass that was once confined to a small part of the Middle East now covers vast stretches of the Earth. As the historian Yuval Noah Harari has observed: ""In the great plains of North America, where not a single wheat stalk grew 10,000 years ago, you can today walk for hundreds upon hundreds of kilometres without encountering any other plant.""

Wheat now provides 20% of the calories consumed by humans every day, but its production is under threat. Thanks to human-induced global heating, our planet faces a future of increasingly severe heat waves, droughts and wildfires that could devastate harvests in future, triggering widespread famine in their wake.

But the crisis could be averted thanks to remarkable research now being undertaken by researchers at the John Innes Centre in Norwich. They are working on a project to make wheat more resistant to heat and drought. Such efforts have proved to be extremely tricky but are set to be the subject of a new set of trials in a few weeks as part of a project in which varieties of wheat - created, in part, by gene-editing technology - will be planted in field trials in Spain.

The ability of these varieties to withstand the heat of Iberia will determine how well crop scientists will be able to protect future arable farms from the worst vicissitudes of climate change, and so bolster food production for the Earth's billions, says the John Innes Centre team.

Wheat was not the only botanical agent to fuel the agricultural revolution. Other staples, such as rice and potatoes, played a part. But wheat is generally accorded the lead role in triggering the agricultural revolution that created our modern world of ""population explosions and pampered elites"", as Harari puts it in his international bestseller Sapiens.

Two main forms of wheat are grown in farms: pasta wheat and bread wheat. Together they play a crucial role in the diets of around 4.5 billion people, said Professor Graham Moore, a wheat geneticist and director of the John Innes Centre, one of the world's leading crop research institutes. ""Of these, around 2.5 billion in 89 countries are dependent on wheat for their daily food, so you can see how vitally important the crop is to the world,"" he added.

The problem that has faced crop scientists, who have been seeking to improve the resilience and productivity of wheat varieties, has been the complexity of wheat genetics, Moore added. ""Human beings have a single genome that contains our DNA instructions. But pasta wheat has two different ancestral genomes while bread wheat has three.""

This complexity has had important consequences. In order to control their differing genes and chromosomes, wheat has acquired a stabilising gene that segregates the different chromosomes in its various genomes. This has ensured these forms of wheat have high yields. However, the gene also suppresses any exchange of chromosomes with wild relatives of wheat, frustrating the efforts of geneticists trying to make new varieties with beneficial properties.

""Wild relatives have really useful characteristics - disease resistance, salt tolerance, protection against heat - attributes that you want to add to make wheat more robust and easy to grow in harsh conditions. But you couldn't do that because this gene stopped these attributes from being assimilated.""

This gene was known as the ""holy grail"" of wheat geneticists, added Moore. ""Wheat - despite its critical importance to feeding the world - has proved to be the most difficult of all the major crops to study because of the complexity and size of its genome. Hence, the importance of the search to find the gene that was the cause of this problem.""

It has taken several decades but scientists at the John Innes Centre have now succeeded in their hunt for their holy grail. They identified the key gene, labelled it Zip4.5B and have created a mutant version of it, one that allows the gene to carry out its main function - to allow wheat chromosomes to pair correctly and maintain yields - but which lacks its ability to block the creation of new variants with attributes from wild grasses.

""A key tool in this work was gene editing, which allowed us to make precise changes in wheat DNA. Without it, we would still be struggling with this. It has made all the difference.""

Jones Innes scientists have since discovered that there are at least 50 different versions of Zip4.5B. ""We are now going to test these in different varieties of wheat that we have created,"" added Moore.

""These will then be grown in Spain, on land near Cordoba, to see how well they do. The aim will be to identify which varieties will do best at surviving the higher temperatures that our farmers are to experience in coming decades.

""Wheat has played a remarkable role in human history. Hopefully, this work will help it to maintain its importance as a foodstuff for the future.""

The Central American country that inspired nature defenders for decades now faces a ""˜loss of direction', experts fear

From his home, JosÃ© Sanchez looks out at the mountain Cerro PasquÃ­, in Cartago province, Costa Rica, across ever-expanding fields of cabbage and potato. It wasn't always like this. Sanchez, 68, recalls a time when the hills were covered in forest, not just farmland for cattle and vegetable crops.

With the rise in crops has come an increase in the use of agrochemicals. Laboratory tests have confirmed that residues of chlorothalonil, a fungicide banned in Europe - and in Costa Rica in recent times - have seeped into the springs of Santa Rosa de Oreamuno, a small agricultural district in the north-eastern hills of Central Valley, and the neighbouring town, Cipreces, affecting a population of nearly 9,000 people.

A truck has been delivering water to Santa Rosa and Cipreces since the end of 2022 because the tap water is no longer safe to drink. But, as the person in charge of managing the water supply in the district, Sanchez fears a larger problem: that the chemical contamination could extend to an entire mountainous strip, and affect 65,000 people.

""I don't think about myself but about my children and grandchildren, because they will suffer the greater problems,"" he says. ""We say that Costa Rica is a country that respects the environment, but it's not really so.""

Even with the new ban on chlorothalonil, water and farmland pollution will remain two of the most pressing environmental challenges facing Costa Rica. The country has one of the highest intensities of pesticide use in the world, and, despite being rich in natural resources, the proportion of its population served by the water supply fell below 90% in 2022.

For decades, pioneering policies in forest protection and conservation have burnished the international image of a sustainable Central American country. But longstanding challenges remain, including high fossil fuel consumption and urban growth.

In recent years, environmental programmes have suffered from financial cuts while ecosystems have been overwhelmed by a rise in tourism. Experts say that Rodrigo Chaves's new government tends to prioritise economic development over environmental protection, which has put previously resolved issues, such as exploration for fossil fuels, back on the table.

""We are in a rough patch,"" says Carlos Manuel RodrÃ­guez, who has served twice as environment minister and now leads the environmental fund Global Environmental Facility (GEF). The urgency to accelerate the economy after the pandemic seems to have changed priorities. ""Everything must have a productive logic,"" the current environment minister, Franz Tattenbach, has said.

The country's foreign minister, Arnoldo AndrÃ© Tinoco, told delegates at Cop28 in Dubai: ""Costa Rica's ocean territory is 10 times larger than its continental territory, and thus we have historically underestimated our valuable marine resources, which require sustainable management. It's not about absolute conservation, but about long-term sustainable use in favour of coastal populations.""

Recent analysis by the local research centre State of the Nation, sponsored by public universities, highlights the resurgence of ""anti-environmentalist"" narratives that risk the return of unsustainable water, energy and soil management patterns.

The country's energy matrix is an example. Costa Rica has long been known for its almost 100% renewable electricity, mainly hydroelectricity, but unusual rainfall patterns due to La NiÃ±a reduced this capacity. Last year, the government imported more fuels for thermal power stations and 50% more petroleum derivatives than in 2000, spending the highest amount in history on fuels.

Greenhouse gas emissions from road transport - one in four Costa Ricans has a car - increased by more than 30% in the past decade, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). As a consequence, more than 88% of the population is exposed to harmful levels of air pollution.

""Costa Rica is globally known as a green country and ecotourism destination. It should be commended for reversing deforestation, producing all of its electricity from renewables and committing to net zero by 2050,"" says the OECD report. ""However, energy use and related greenhouse gas emissions rose. Air quality is of concern in major urban areas. Increasing population, urbanisation and tourism have strained the undersized water, waste and transport infrastructure and services. Pressures on the environment are likely to grow with rising living standards and climate change.""

One protected area reflecting the imbalance between nature conservation and tourism is Manuel Antonio national park, the park most visited by foreigners. Located in Quepos, on the central Pacific coast, it has received more than half a million visitors in a year, endangering the mangrove, marine environment and tropical rainforest, according to some.

This year, Costa Rica's constitutional court ordered a cut in the maximum number of the park's daily visitors from 3,000 to 1,200, angering Chaves. The president argued that the income from tourism was necessary for inhabitants of this coastal region.

Rafael GutiÃ©rrez served as environment vice-minister in the first year of Chaves's government before resigning over the government's environmental policies. ""We did very good things decades ago, and we still have good results from that, in addition to having developed the tourism industry,"" says GutiÃ©rrez, who also served as national director of conservation areas.

""But we stopped doing it a long time ago. Controls have been weakened, and budgets have been reduced. In some sectors, the idea that the environment is an obstacle to development has grown.""

GutiÃ©rrez cites Chaves's request of Norway to help identify potential fossil gas deposits as a first step towards fossil fuels exploration. Decisions such as these, says RodrÃ­guez, are being closely watched by the international community, given Costa Rica's reputation as a green country. He warns that it may be risking its credibility as co-organiser of the World Ocean Conference 2025 with France.

""We have been a country that gives hope to the world,"" he says. ""We used to show that paradigms can be broken.""

Drought in Mexico and depleting water supply in the Colorado River has led to a scarcity in red jalapeÃ±os, the key ingredient

Sriracha lovers everywhere are feeling the not so pleasant sting of the beloved hot sauce shortage, now in its second year. Drought in Mexico has resulted in a scarcity of chilli peppers - in particular, red jalapeÃ±os, the raw material of sriracha - leading Huy Fong Foods, the California-based maker of the iconic condiment, to scale back production.

""It is a challenging crop to grow,"" said Stephanie Walker, a plant scientist at the New Mexico State University, who serves on the advisory board of the Chile Pepper Institute. ""JalapeÃ±os are really labor intensive, requiring people to de-stem them by hand before they go for processing.""

The special care the chilis require renders them that much more vulnerable to extreme weather conditions, such as the persisting drought in northern Mexico, fueled by the depleted water supply in the Colorado River.

""Normally the pepper is grown by irrigation,"" said Paul Gepts, a crop researcher at the University of California, Davis. ""But the supply of water has been decreasing and if you don't have a certain minimum amount of water to irrigate your crops, unless there is rain, there won't be a crop.""

There are five species of the chilli pepper, spread over the Americas, from Mexico to Bolivia, that have the hotness required for the Sriracha sauce. Some of these varieties are used for other hot sauces and Sriracha dupes.

But the fans of unmistakable green-capped sauce can spot the difference and are staying loyal to the original.

""For Sriracha, its particular flavor and quality really dictates how you have to have jalapeÃ±os, because of the unique flavor profile that consumers love,"" Walker said. ""Those very pungent, kind of tangy, almost citrus notes of the chili.""

Phans 55, a Vietnamese restaurant in Orange county, California, has been running low on the limited Sriracha supply for the past three months.

""Now it's all gone,"" said Andre Nguyen, who works as a server, adding that the sauce is essential for a variety of dishes, from pho to rice.

""The taste of Sriracha is so unique, it's hard to mimic,"" Nguyen said. ""Everyone would prefer to have Sriracha over another off brand trying to copy it.""

Resellers on Amazon, eBay and Craigslist are pricing bottles of hot sauce for as high as $120. A representative for Huy Fong Foods said in a statement to the Guardian that while ""limited production has recently resumed"", the company has ""no estimations of when supply will increase"", or when it will again hit supermarket shelves.

Moving the crop to an area that is less affected by extreme weather and breeding new varieties of the chilli that is tolerant to heat and drought could help avoid future shortages. Still, that is a longer term solution to the problem hitting American shelves imminently.

""We're going to see these disruptions more often because of climate change,"" Gepts said.

Rural Aid charity says requests for mental health support, financial counselling and emergency livestock feed doubles in a month

Demand for emergency rural aid is rising as farmers face a dry and unproductive summer ahead.

The latest Australian agricultural seasonal outlook forecasts farm incomes will plummet by 41% on average this financial year.

The chief executive of Rural Aid, John Warlters, said requests to the national charity for mental health support, financial counselling and emergency livestock feed had ""effectively doubled"" in the last month.

""That's absolutely a symptom of the rapid dry off,"" Warlters said.

In June, Rural Aid made 27 emergency deliveries of drinking water to properties that rely on rainwater. Last month it made 147.

Australia is predicted to experience unusually high maximum temperatures and below average rainfall over summer, according to the Bureau of Meteorology's seasonal outlook.

""There is this beautiful throwaway line that gets tossed around: ""˜We've had two or three wet years so everyone in agriculture should be humming along again',"" Warlters said.

""There are certainly individuals who've done very well out of it ""¦ but what we see at Rural Aid is that it's clearly not the case for everyone.""

On a property outside Toowoomba in southern Queensland, cattleman Sid Plant, 78, gazes at fields of brown grass in the bare midday sun.

""We are vulnerable,"" Plant said. ""We can't sell cattle because they are not market ready.""

Plant said the area had not received ""useful"" rain since February, leaving him with barely enough grass for his cattle to continue gaining weight.

""We've just got to keep going and hope we don't run out of feed and hope that there's a market there when they are ready,"" he said.

In June, Plant applied for a free water tank from Rural Aid to bulwark the property against future dry spells, which he received a few weeks ago.

""We don't want to seem like we are accepting a free kick,"" Plant said. ""We were hoping to do it ourselves anyhow but it made it a whole lot easier for us.

""We really appreciate it, they are doing a damn good job.""

Last month, the charity offered up another 50 free water tanks, though this time stock was exhausted in just four hours after almost 100 applications.

The recently declared El NiÃ±o climate pattern, collapse of livestock markets and rising farm debts are putting additional pressure on producers, although increasing land values are likely to offset some of the pain.

""I've been studying climate change ever since I got my pilot's licence in 1966,"" Plant said. ""Here, rainfall decline each decade is real. There's a lot of writing on the wall and we need to respond to it.""

Plant's daughter is beginning to take over the farm's operations and one of his teenage granddaughters has proclaimed that she wants to be a farmer too. ""I'm trying to do all I can to help them while I'm here so they can survive,"" he said.

The Department of Agriculture has recorded a ""moderate rise"" in applications for the Farm Household Allowance scheme that provides payments to farmers under financial stress.

Bob Musgrave, a rural financial counsellor in northern New South Wales, said the number of producers seeking assistance with destocking strategies as conditions worsen had risen sharply.

""I've been taking an inquiry every second day for the last month. Prior to that it was probably once a week, and towards the start of the year nothing at all,"" Musgrave said.

""Droughts, floods, pestilence and disease, they're generic issues that the primary producers face ""¦ but they're getting more severe.""

Farmers express concern for their livelihoods after series of deadly attacks on farm animals

German farmers, conservationists and politicians have met at a wolf summit to discuss the animal's future amid concerns that its population is out of control.

The farmers' union is calling for a relaxation of rules over when wolves, strictly protected under EU law, can be shot, after a series of highly publicised deadly attacks on farm animals.

It has said that people in rural areas are fearful for their lives as well as the lives of their animals, with many farmers expressing concern for their livelihoods.

Germany is home to an estimated 161 packs of wolves (of between eight to 12 animals each) according to the Federal Wolf Documentation and Advisory Office. A further 43 pairs and 21 individual animals were also registered.

Numbers have increased year on year since the wolf was placed under species protection in 1990, after it was considered to have more or less become extinct at the end of the 19thcentury.

The southern state of Bavaria has already taken its own decision to allow farmers to actively kill wolves where livestock is thought to be under particular threat.

Its leader, Markus SÃ¶der, visited an alpine village on Thursday that has reportedly been the scene of attacks on grazing animals, where he said the future of farming was in danger if wolf populations were not brought under control.

""I'll say it quite clearly, the wolf does not belong here,"" SÃ¶der told a gathering of farmers and their families in Oberaudorf. ""We have introduced a new wolf bylaw ""¦ one breach is sufficient and the wolf can be removed from a region.""

His Christian Social Union (CSU) has said it would like to see the elimination of all wolves from Germany. Its larger sister party, the centre-right CDU, has called for hunting rights to be expanded to include wolves.

Harald Ebner, of the Greens party, head of the federal committee for environment and nature protection, said it would be wrong for such permission to be granted. ""The quick call to arms is no solution and the perpetual appeal for wolf-free zones and quotas contravenes EU law and will bring no relief to keepers of grazing animals,"" he said.

The environment minister, Steffi Lemke, also of the Greens, has argued for increasing protection both for grazing animals and wolves. ""We cannot in good conscience, call for the protection of animals in African countries at the same time as saying here that it is not possible to protect the wolf,"" she said

The farmers' union in Brandenburg, northern Germany, home to the largest number of wolves in the country with an estimated 47 packs and 14 pairs, is calling for a quota that could be shot legally each year, drawing on wolf population control measures in Finland and Sweden.

Brandenburg permitted wolves to be shot in specifically defined cases in 2022, after a series of livestock killings. A male wolf was killed in March after 76 livestock deaths were attributed to it.

253,"Ethiopian drought and child marriage - in portraits","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/10/ethiopian-drought-and-child-marriage-in-portraits","Ethiopian drought and child marriage - in portraits

A series of double exposure portraits by Maheder Haileselassie Tadese, winner of the 2023 Contemporary African Photography prize, represents the impact of severe drought on the lives of girls in Ethiopia







Maheder Haileselassie spent time with girls in the Somali region in eastern Ethiopia, capturing their experiences on the frontline of climate change. Girls in parts of the country hit by drought and food shortages are increasingly being forced into child marriage, with rates rising by 119% in 2022. Bone-dry water sources, decimated crops and dying livestock have combined with vicious conflict to make early marriage a threat to them. Mahader said: ""Listening to the girls' experiences of child marriage it struck me that each story was linked to the changing climate. Recurrent drought in the Somali region means that the earth no longer provides families with the water and nutritious food that they need. This is why I made the drought-affected landscape and dried river an integral part of each portrait, to represent how child marriage and climate change intertwine.""

A new report by Save the Children - Girls at the centre of the storm: Her planet, her future, her solutions - reveals that the number of girls living in high-risk ""hotspots"" for child marriage and climate change is set to increase by a third, to nearly 40 million by 2050.

Twenty-year-old Aida (all the girls' names have been changed) was married at 15 after being displaced due to conflict and drought. She was devastated at the time and had to leave school. After a few months in this forced marriage, she became depressed and with the support of her uncle, she fled to the nearby city to escape before returning to live with her family when it was safe.

Since being displaced, life has been difficult. We used to live a beautiful life. We lived comfortably. We used to plough in our fields. We used to have everything we needed. We made a good living. We didn't struggle. We grew and ate whatever we wanted from our garden. Now we have nothing to eat, we are suffering a lot, we live in a shack house and the heat is terrible. We don't have electricity like we used to. We are just living here in the hope that it will pass.

I was married at the age of 15. My parents married me off thinking our problems would become easier. They gave me to this man to alleviate our troubles. I told them that I would rather die than live with this man. I told them that they have ruined my plans, I am not ready for marriage, how could you marry me to this man?

Salma, 13, campaigns against early marriage in her community in Ethiopia's Somali region.

Before the drought we have eight goats but now we only have three left. Our life was better then, we had three meals a day sometimes but now we only have two. Sometimes we don't have any.

I have some friends who have been married early, when the drought affected their family, they think that they are helping their families by marrying early. I don't want to be like my friend in school who got married last year when she was only 15 and her parents forced her to marry. She is not happy with what happened. The primary justification for marriage that many parents give their kids is the financial difficulties they experience. They are unaware of the harm it may do to their girl's physical and mental health. Early marriage is still a big problem in our village, and we need to do a lot to address it.

Halimo believes that the climate has changed in her lifetime and as a result, her family are no longer having three meals a day. She is a member of Save the Children's anti-violence club and campaigns against female genital mutilation (FGM) and child marriage in her community.

Yes the climate has changed in my lifetime. Before the drought we eat three meals a day but now we only have two but it's hard for us to even get two meals a day.

Asma, 15, has managed to avoid early marriage. Her family lost their livestock due to drought in the Somali region, and her parents believed that early marriage could offer her a better life.

The drought affects my family because our animals are our only income. Without animals we cannot make any money. Due to lack of rain as there was no water, it would take us a whole day to get enough water home. We had to carry the water on our backs using wooden containers which often led to conflicts. Sometimes, there were even attempted rapes during these trips. Before the drought we had milk and meat, but when drought comes there is no milk, there is no meat. And there is a serious problem with scarcity of water and our livestock have no water to drink.

When I was 14 years old, a man wanted to marry me and my parents agreed. I became unhappy and withdrawn at school, I was depressed. Because he was a wealthier person than us, my parents advised me that if I got married to him my life would become better than theirs.

It would be a comfortable life and I could get whatever I want. So that's why they were pushing me to marry him. But I declined and told them that I wanted to continue my education. I wanted to complete my studies [and] I was uncomfortable about getting married at 14.

Aisha's family lost 25 out of their 30 animals in the drought - this had a big impact on them and their community as they are pastoralists who depend on their livestock for income. Save the Children helps all six children attend school (by providing them with books and school supplies) and also runs a parenting without violence club at Aisha's school, where she learns about the risks of early marriage and FGM. Due to the drought, Aisha's family have to pay for water for their five remaining animals.

Fifteen-year-old Lelo's family are pastoralists who used to depend on their livestock for income, but since the droughts began her mother has opened a tea shop in their community to support their family. When Lelo was 14 years old, an older man asked her to marry him. Lelo's parents agreed to the marriage because their family were struggling economically during the drought. However, Save the Children's anti-violence school club negotiated with her mother to cancel it.

When I was 14, I was proposed to. The man proposed to my family, and I was informed when I arrived home. I was demoralised. I confided in a friend who informed the teacher and the leader of the girls' club about the marriage. They went to my parents and told them that I do not agree with this marriage, finally [after a lot of negotiation] my parents agreed to cancel this marriage. I want to complete my studies and get married when I'm older. I aspire to become a doctor, especially in the field of surgery.

Saeda, 16, lives with her parents and her younger sister. Her family were displaced by drought two years ago when they lost three camels, six cows and five goats. Saeda has witnessed the negative impact of drought on girls in her community, including increased rates of gender-based violence during water collection, and friends who have been forced to drop out of school to marry early.

Many children drop out of school because they feel pressured by their parents to get married. This is mainly due to their parents' financial struggle and the expectation of receiving livestock as dowries. Living in rural areas, if a rich man asks for a girl's hand in marriage, the father would consider it to secure [a better future for] the rest of the children. He might agree to such marriages for the wellbeing of the family. To protect the rest of the children. I would like to offer some advice. Drought is a natural occurrence and doesn't happen all the time. It can be overcome with patience. And we should put an end to child marriage.

Fardowsa

Fardowsa, 12, is in seventh grade at a primary school which is supported by Save the Children. She is one of the young activists working in her Somali community to end child marriage and other harmful traditional practices including female genital mutilation. The photographer uses a yellow flower in this image which grows close to Fardowsa's home, as it represents the new year in many parts of Ethiopia.

I believe that early marriage is not good but most young girls are interested in it because it is the easiest way to get money and a better life. At Save the Children's school club we learn not to marry early and focus on school. We also study a book which gives us information about how early marriage and FGM impact girls in a negative way.

My message to girls getting married early is to remember that it has no advantage for you, it is better to focus on your education and your own life.

UK food tsar: ""˜Stand up to the big food companies'

Henry Dimbleby, UK food tsar, is at Cop28 to talk about global food systems. He told us governments would need to step up, and stand up to the big food companies. ""In the end, what you need is regulation."" He said food had been largely ignored at previous Cops, including Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021, so it was good to see the issue highlighted in Dubai, but governments were still long on talk and short on action. ""We need to look at this globally, at how we share resources such as land and how to create incentives to shape a food system that feeds the world, sequesters carbon and restores biodiversity.""

Human Rights Day unease at restrictions on protest

My colleague Nina Lakhani reports civil society groups have been extremely frustrated at the restrictions placed on public protest at Cop28 particularly in relation to calling out human rights violations in the UAE and Palestine. Still, every day, frontline activists have done small actions calling for a cease fire in Gaza. ""There is no climate justice without human rights,"" has been the rallying call. Today the protest is also calling for the release of human rights and environmental defenders across the world including British Egyptian campaigner Alaa Abd el-Fattah who is imprisoned in Egypt.

Others noted that today is the 75th anniversary of the universal declaration human rights. Asad Rehman, director of War on Want, said:

""Our struggle for human rights is connected to all movements and struggles for economic justice, for social justice and gender justice. Our message to the people negotiating is that we have a different vision of the world because we believe in the power of the people to transform this society into one that is fair and just.""

Earlier, the climate campaign group 350.0rg disrupted the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) at their youth event at Cop28. In a statement, the group urged organisers to include vulnerable communities and campaigners in the discussion on how to address global heating:

""Civil society and communities most impacted by the climate crisis must be at the forefront of conversations in spaces like Cop28 and it's imperative we have the freedom to publicly critique government policy, protest and lobby for climate justice""

Vulnerable countries concerned about ""˜weak' adaptation text

Delegates from vulnerable countries are very concerned about the weak progress being made at Cop28 on adaptation i.e. the plans and funding desperately needed to protect people from the escalating impacts of the climate crisis. The UN Environment Programme said in November that $215bn - $387bn a year is needed - in 2021, but just $21bn was provided. (See also earlier posts today from Nina Lakhani and a guest post from Mohamed Adow.)

Sandeep Chamling Rai, at WWF:

""Vulnerable communities desperately need more finance to build resilience to the impacts of the climate crisis. However the text only reiterates the longstanding call for developed countries to double adaptation finance without providing a clear roadmap to deliver it.""

""The text is also missing concrete global targets. It is also concerning to see the target to protect 30% of land by 2030 now missing. Nature is an ally in limiting the impacts of the climate crisis and that must be recognised and acted on.""

Obed Koringo, based in Nairobi for CARE Denmark:

""It is disappointing to see that negotiations on adaptation are hurtling towards a damaging global failure. We are afraid that it will have catastrophic consequences for communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis, especially in Africa.""

""Developed countries have committed to at least double adaptation finance by 2025 - a detailed roadmap is the only way to achieve this. This must set out what individual developed countries plan to provide by 2025 and how this adds up to $40 billion annually.

""Failure to invest in adaptation, including early warning systems, flood defences and drought-resistant crops, will only increase the costs of loss and damage in the long run.""

Cop28 president: ""˜The time has come for us to switch gears'

The Cop28 president Sultan Al Jaber is speaking in a media scrum that includes my colleague Fiona Harvey. She says he is calling for consensus on two key issues: fossil fuels and financing for a just transition.

""The time has come for us to switch gears,"" Al Jaber said. ""We need text agreed by everyone on greenhouse gases. That is a point I will keep pressure on ""¦. None of this is surprise. That is how this process works. It boils down to the need for all parties to come to terms (with the fact) that we will deliver the highest ambition. All parties should come to terms with this fact.""

Hello everyone. This is Jonathan Watts taking over the liveblog from my colleague Natalie Hanman.

With just over two days remaining of the official schedule, Cop28 is now immersed in the nitty gritty of the negotiations. This is the part that will determine whether Dubai is a success or a failure. There is a lot of work to do. The texts are riddled with brackets denoting disagreements and unresolved alternatives, including on the crunch question of whether to phase out, phase down or otherwise come to terms with the root cause of climate breakdown: fossil fuels.

Thirty one years after the Earth Summit that launched these discussions, isn't it astounding that it has taken until now to get to this fundamental issue?

Feel free to email me at jon.watts@theguardian.com with comments and suggestions on this or anything else.

Thank you for reading the liveblog. I am now handing over to Jonathan Watts (jonathan.watts@theguardian.com). Here's a brief summary of developments so far today:

The Cop Presidency is now said to be preparing a final package for delegates, at a crunch point for Cop28, with only two and a half official days of negotiations left.

A draft text on the global goal on adaptation was published. It has been described as ""disappointing"" and ""weak"".

The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation published the first instalment in its roadmap on reforming food and farming. Thin on detail, the report is not enough to get us off the ""high-pollution, high-fossil-fuel, high-hunger track we are on"", said one expert.

A spokesperson from the bloc of Like Minded Developing Countries told the Guardian that any fossil fuel phase out target must be fully financed and centred on the equity principles enshrined in the climate convention and the 2015 Paris agreement.

Reaction is coming in to the UN FAO's first instalment of a roadmap towards farming that can feed the world while not driving global heating past 1.5C. You can read Fiona Harvey's news story on the road map here.

Craig Hanson, Managing Director of Programs, World Resources Institute:

""How to feed the planet by 2050 without destroying it in the process is one of the grand challenges of our time. This roadmap is a welcome reminder that the answer involves sustainably boosting crop and livestock yields, reducing food loss and waste and shifting diets - all amidst a changing climate.""

""Rich countries will need to nudge people toward less meat-centric diets, and advance technologies and practices to drive down agricultural emissions. Low-income countries will need to sustainably boost crop and livestock productivity. Smallholder farmers will need far more assistance to adapt to extreme weather. And all these changes will need to happen without further sacrificing forests for agriculture.""

Emile Frison, member of the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems:

""Laying out a plan to eliminate extreme hunger and the third of greenhouse gas emissions from food systems is not an easy task. This roadmap puts a huge emphasis on incremental improvements to the current industrial food system - but this is a flawed system that is wrecking nature, polluting the environment, and starving millions of people. These efficiency-first proposals are unlikely to be enough. The next stage will need to go much further in ""¦ tackling the massive power inequalities imposed by the handful of companies that define what we grow and eat.""

Sophia Murphy, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy:

""FAO's roadmap offers a welcome focus on the right to food in the cacophony of food interests that have descended on COP. The report mentions a host of critical issues, including farm income, farm worker rights and women's empowerment. Disappointingly, the report neglects to call on big agricultural companies to make real emissions reductions, especially in rich countries where cutting methane and nitrous oxide emissions from industrial animal operations is a low-hanging fruit.""

Appolinaire Djikeng, International Livestock Research Institute:

""The [FAO] strategy makes valuable and pragmatic recommendations for increasing climate finance to help improve the productivity of livestock systems in low-income countries. This would strengthen a sector that provides vital and scarce sources of high quality nutrition and rural livelihoods for almost two billion people. A new African narrative for livestock is needed to fully differentiate the needs and challenges facing small-scale producers from the industrialised systems in the Global North.""

Developing countries bloc say fossil fuel phaseout must be fully financed and fair

A spokesperson from a negotiating bloc that represents more than half the world's populationsaid that any fossil fuel phase-out target must be fully financed and centred on the equity principles enshrined in the climate convention and the 2015 Paris agreement.

""As a group we want to see the developed countries taking the lead on mitigation. In each session they are pushing and pressuring developing countries to do more and more, without providing the means of implementation, without accepting that a phase out has to be differentiated to be fair and equitable - and while they are still expanding fossil fuel production,"" said Diego Pacheco, a Bolivian negotiator and spokesperson for the bloc of Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC).

The bloc of 20 nations - which includes India, China, Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Syria, Sudan and Vietnam - are politically, socially and economically diverse but like minded in terms of insisting that international climate action respect the convention and the Paris Agreement, particularly in relation to the principle of equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR) enshrined in the Paris agreement and the UNFCCC.

Developing countries have for years called out wealthier countries for cherrypicking from the convention, Paris Agreement and the IPCC reports. According to Pacheco, global emission reduction targets should take into account CBDR and equity, but developing countries face a constant fight to get these core elements into the text. ""The Paris agreement is based on a bottom-up approach, so each country will address issues according to their own national circumstances. The only acceptable qualifier would be a fossil fuel phase out financed by developed countries, based on equity and CBDR,"" said Pacheco.

In 2021, India and China were blamed by the US, UK and other developed countries for watering down the historic agreement to phase down - rather than phase out - coal at Cop26. The UK and US have already moved away from coal, but continue to expand oil and gas production.

India, the world's most populous country (1.4bn) and the fifth largest economy, is the driver behind equitable access to carbon space, pushing for historic CO2 contributions to be taken into account in any discussion about phase out and mitigation.

Meena Raman, a climate policy expert and head of programmes at the Third World Network (TWN), said: ""Many countries including India are energy poor, and while they are actively promoting solar and other renewable energies, they need more time and finance to transition away from coal, that is the reality. We need to be honest about what countries need to implement mitigation - finance, capacity building, technology - so they can achieve their NDCs and keep the hope of 1.5 alive, adapt to climate change and still meet the basic needs of their people. Otherwise any new target will just be playing to the gallery.""

The US is this year's number one producer of oil and gas, and the number one exporter of gas and petroleum products. A recent report by Oil Change International found that five countries - UK, US, Norway, Canada and Australia - account for more than half the planned oil and gas expansion between now and 2050.

Meanwhile civil society groups are warning that the US, UK and other allied developed economies appear to be embracing fossil fuel phase out language, while simultaneously blocking fair climate finance and pushing to erase any reference to equity and just transition from the final text. Rachel Rose Jackson from Corporate Accountability said:

""The stage is set for the US to save the day again while blaming global south countries simply for demanding equity and fairness. At Cop28 the US is continuing its legacy of hocus pocus.""

Machines to magic carbon out of the air, artificial intelligence, indoor vertical farms to grow food for our escape to Mars, and even solar-powered ""responsible"" yachts: the Cop28 climate summit in Dubai has been festooned with the promise of technological fixes for worsening global heating and ecological breakdown, writes Oliver Milman.

But this fixation has alarmed some scientists and climate activists, who warn that technologies are being used to distract from the primary task of stopping fossil fuels being burned.

Total current technology-based CO2 removal, excluding nature-based means such as planting new forests, removes just 0.01m tonnes of CO2, according to recent research, which is more than a million times smaller than current fossil fuel CO2 emissions.

Despite its small scale, voluminous carbon removal techniques are relied upon in many climate models and plans by countries and companies to avoid breaching a 1.5C rise in global temperatures since pre-industrial times and unleashing catastrophic heatwaves, droughts, floods and other impacts.

Read the full story here.

Colombia's environment minister Susana Muhamad has said she is helping to build a coalition of countries in favour of ambitious language on phasing out fossil fuels at Cop28 ahead of tense final negotiations.

Muhamad, whose president Gustavo Petro announced Colombia was backing a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty in the climate summit, said the group would then speak with Saudi Arabia, India and other influential countries as a bloc.

""We want a phase out of production and consumption. We want 1.5C. We want a 43% reduction [of fossil fuels] by 2030. If we don't reach 2030, there is not another opportunity to do this,"" she told the Guardian. ""We should not be hostage to the economic plans of countries when this is the requirement. ""

Muhamad has been a leading voice at the climate summit in plenaries calling for strong language on cutting emissions.

El compromiso para alcanzar las metas del Acuerdo de ParÃ­s, debe ser de todas las naciones. Para lograrlo debemos avanzar en la reducciÃ³n progresiva de los combustibles fÃ³siles y mirar un nuevo modelo econÃ³mico.
Esta fue mi intervenciÃ³n en la Plenaria Oficial de la #COP28. pic.twitter.com/8o4hc33b0z

""We are working on building a consolidated position and common thinking around these issues so we have a stronger voice. We're trying to align a bloc of countries to land some text around [fossil fuels] that we can then use to start engaging with China, Saudi Arabia and India in the potential negotiations,"" she said.

""Adaptation is the most important thing for us. Some countries are putting a lot of obstacles into this so that they can negotiate on the other parts of the agreement. For us, adaptation goals have to be agreed at this Cop. Otherwise it's a message that the lives of people in the Global South don't matter. We are already in the process of adaptation. The climate is already changing. That's why 1.5C is critical. After 1.5C, adaptation will be super expensive or impossible,"" said Muhamad.

""The Sultan is being very clear that he wants 1.5C to be alive and on a 2030 delivery. So, it's obvious we need to talk about fossil fuels. I think we can get an agreement. We have to make future arrangements for a future phasing out,"" she said.

Taro, amaranth and kelp are sustainable crops that could become staples if you know how to bring out the best in them

Every time I come across a climate-friendly ingredient that's new to me, I want to start cooking with it immediately. But in a world where just a few species dominate our food system, it can take some work to figure out how.

Of the thousands of edible species in the world, humans globally rely on just 15 of them for 90% of our calories. Some of those species are grown in environmentally destructive ways, and others may not be well-equipped to continue to serve as cornerstone foods as the planet warms - which is why many advocates and sustainability-minded chefs are calling for a shift toward foods that are more naturally climate-resilient and require fewer harmful inputs, like fossil fuel-based fertilizers.

So what if you, like me, want to embrace some of the alternative foods that experts say are better suited to our planet's changing climate? Where can you buy them, how do you cook them, and what does it take to make their flavors shine?

Even if you know a food is better suited toward our changing climate, it can be hard to start eating it if you don't know how to cook with it. As Joseph Yoon, a chef and edible insect ambassador, told me last year while serving up cicada stir-fry, there's a learning curve with any ingredient. If someone encouraged you to try garlic for the first time and you didn't know any better than to eat it raw, for example, you might hate it. But once you learned to work with it properly - roast it, sautÃ© it and add a few cloves to savory meals - it might just become a kitchen staple.

To move toward a menu that can last on our warming planet, the same approach needs to be taken with climate-resilient foods. Think amaranth, a so-called ""weed"" that thrives in the face of drought; taro, a root vegetable that can weather heavy flooding; and kelp, the ""tofu of the sea"" that fights ocean acidification. Read on to hear from a restaurateur, a home chef and an expert forager for their tips on how to cook with these 21st-century-ready crops.

Amaranth: wilted greens, pancakes and chocolate bark

What it is: Most amaranth species are native to Mesoamerica, but they're grown all over the world, from India and China to west Africa. The entire plant is edible: the seeds are consumed as a pseudo-cereal akin to quinoa or buckwheat in the Americas, while the leaves and stems are often eaten as a green vegetable in Asia and Africa.

The plant has proved its resilience time and again. When Spanish colonizers tried to ban the Aztecs and Maya from growing it, amaranth continued to grow as a ""weed"" and via seeds passed down from generation to generation.

Why you should eat it: Today, amaranth's hardiness has continued to help it thrive: the crop is naturally drought-resistant, making it ""a suitable crop for nutritional security in a rapidly changing world"", according to recent research.

Plus, according to Tama Matsuoka Wong, a professional forager based in New Jersey, amaranth is already growing in all kinds of places. ""We just think it's a weed, so we disregard it completely and we spray it and try to eradicate it,"" she said.

Wong, who supplies foraged ingredients to Michelin-approved New York restaurants like Daniel and Oxalis, has seen examples of amaranth's hardiness up close. Last year's drought made it difficult for her neighbor, an organic farmer, to keep his corn adequately watered, she said. But even as the corn fields turned brown, the amaranth growing uncultivated nearby was doing just fine.

How to prepare it: Wong's favorite way to eat it is to follow the lead of Chef Phet of the New York City-based Laotian restaurant Khe Yo, where leaves and stems of young amaranth plants are sautÃ©ed with ginger and fish sauce. From there you can stir in ground beef and corn and serve over rice for a full meal, she said, or add the wilted greens to eggs or ramen for a boost of fiber and vitamins. Amaranth just needs to be paired with ""something a little stronger, because it has a really mild flavor"", she said.

Amaranth seeds can also be ground down into flour, which can be used as a gluten-free substitute in pancake mix, cookies and more, while the seeds can be cooked into a porridge and eaten like oatmeal, added as a thickener to stews and soups, or popped like popcorn and added to homemade chocolate bark. And if you're not in the mood to cook, just grab some granola from a brand like Kind.

Where to get it: The best way to find amaranth greens in the US is to forage like Wong does - they're not generally sold at grocery stores or farmers' markets. But if that's not possible, Wong notes, you can try talking to a farmer at a market and asking them to bring amaranth next week - there's a good chance they may already have some growing on their property.

And if you can't get your hands on the fresh greens to eat as a vegetable, you can always try amaranth seeds or flour, which are sold by grocery store brands like Bob's Red Mill.

Kelp: the flavor of ""˜beautiful clean ocean air'

What it is: Nicknamed the ""tofu of the sea"" for its versatility, kelp has long been grown as a food source in Japan and Korea, and some Native groups in what's now called the US have had long relationships with kelp, too. But the crop has begun to take off more widely as an industry within North America in the last few decades as dwindling fish stocks and more intense storms render other forms of aquaculture more uncertain.

Why you should eat it: Kelp is appealing from a sustainability perspective because it doesn't require fertilizer or pesticide. Plus, it provides a host of ecosystem services: the sea vegetable grows rapidly, drawing excess nitrogen and carbon dioxide from the water, battling the ocean acidification that threatens shellfish and other marine life.

How to prepare it: According to Emily Mingrone, the chef and restaurant owner behind New Haven, Connecticut, establishments like Tavern on State and Fair Haven Oyster Co, kelp is delightful to cook with. ""You know when you sit on a beach and you smell beautiful clean ocean air? It's like that, in flavor form,"" she said. Plus, ""it's surprisingly forgiving and versatile"" to work with - because it contains so much moisture, it's almost impossible to overcook.

Though the forms of seaweed people might be most familiar with in a culinary setting - think Japanese nori - aren't actually kelp, kelp can be served in many of the same ways. Mingrone recommends blanching and julienning fresh sugar kelp and mixing it with cucumber and snap peas for a crunchy salad, wrapping grilled fish in it to infuse the meat with a briny flavor, or adding it to soups and stocks for a hit of umami.

Where to get it: Mingrone is lucky enough to share a marina with a kelp farm, so she has no problem getting her hands on it, but she recommends asking any local fishmonger for recommendations if you're having a hard time finding it fresh in grocery stores.

And even if you're landlocked, you've still got plenty of options to choose from. Akua kelp burgers are stocked in the freezer section of many grocery stores nationwide, as are a variety of kelp condiments made by Barnacle Foods, which incorporates kelp into everything from BBQ sauce to pickles (my personal favorite is the kelp chilli crisp).

Taro: peel, cook, pound and ferment

What it is: While taro is new to some mainland Americans, it's a part of everyday eating for many Hawaiians. According to Relle Lum, a Native Hawaiian, home cook and recent contestant on PBS's The Great American Recipe, mashed taro - or kalo, as it's called in Hawaii - is often the first solid food a baby is fed, and something Hawaiians of all ages will continue to eat throughout the rest of their lives.

The starchy root vegetable is native to south-east Asia, where it is still commonly grown and eaten, and is also enjoyed throughout Africa and the Caribbean.

Why you should eat it: Taro's sustainability chops stem from the fact that the crop can produce a high yield with just a little bit of land, and it can be grown in either wet or dry fields, making it a good choice in areas with uneven rainfall or flooding (a taro corm - the part of the plant most commonly eaten - can survive for at least a week underwater).

How to prepare it: One challenge of cooking with taro is that it contains calcium oxalate, ""which can cause a very irritating itch if you don't cook it down well"", said Lum. But she doesn't think that you should let that intimidate you. ""Just don't eat it raw,"" she said, and the problem is solved. Her other tips include oiling your hands while working with mashed taro, since it can get quite sticky, and submerging peeled taro in water with a squeeze of lemon if you're going to leave it out for a bit so it doesn't oxidize and change color.

Lum's favorite way to eat taro is one of the most common in Hawaii: peel, cook, pound and ferment it into a paste to make poi, which is a mild-tasting starchy side that can take the place of rice or mashed potatoes. She also likes adding taro leaves to beef luau stew and incorporating bright purple taro into homemade dinner rolls. For dessert, her favorite treat is fried mochi balls made with poi, or kulolo, a taro pudding, that she whips up in her Instant Pot.

Where to get it: Mainlanders can often find taro in Asian grocery stores, and Lum also recommends Taro Brand frozen poi, which can be shipped to the mainland, for people who don't want to make their own. My family also loves Terra taro chips - like potato chips, but with a hint of sweetness - that are sold nationwide.

""It's important to be able to find ways not only to nurture yourself, but the land, too,"" said Lum. ""So it would be great to put kalo on the map more so people can learn about it and realize how yummy it is.""

266,"US dairy policies drive small farms to ""˜get big or get out' as monopolies get rich","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/31/us-dairy-policies-hurt-small-farms-monopolies-get-rich","US dairy policies drive small farms to ""˜get big or get out' as monopolies get rich

Exclusive: Misguided policies have hurt small-scale farms while enriching agribusinesses and corporate lobbyists, analysis shows

Two decades of misguided US dairy policies centered around boosting milk production and export markets have hurt family-scale farms and the environment while enriching agribusinesses and corporate lobbyists, new research has found.

The average American dairy turned a profit only twice in the past two decades despite milk production rising by almost 40%, according to analysis by Food and Water Watch (FWW) shared exclusively with the Guardian.

More milk has not meant more profits for most farmers - or cheaper prices for American shoppers - because production costs have risen while milk prices have remained low so US exporters can compete on the global market.

In the past 20 years, US dairy exports rose eightfold - more than almost any other commodity - which has coincided with rapid consolidation across the industry, according to the FWW report.

The US Dairy Export Council (USDEC) claims booming exports have helped farms of all sizes, but two-thirds of family-sized commercial dairies were lost between about 1997 to 2017 as factory farms, exporters and a handful of powerful cooperatives came to dominate dairy. Trade association executives are making huge salaries as ordinary farms go under.

Dairy monopolies are also bad news for the climate. Even though the number of cows remains stable, planet-warming methane emissions from dairy manure have more than doubled since 1990, thanks to the way factory farms manage waste, the FWW report found.

It warns of a vicious circle in which economic hardship caused by low and volatile milk prices is driving family-scale farmers to ""get big or get out"". In other words, the only way for many ordinary farms to survive is to expand their herds and factory farm which increase greenhouse gas emissions and endanger air and water quality - or sell-up to mega-dairies that do the same.

Curbing overproduction is crucial as current state and federal dairy policies are driving family-scale farms to extinction while fueling the climate crisis, according to the FWW report, Economic Cost of Food Monopolies: The Dirty Dairy Racket.

""The big picture of the economic cost of dairy consolidation is that it's a story filled with the incredibly orchestrated and devastating farmer loss and hardship, and a worsening environmental outlook,"" said Rebecca Wolf, food policy analyst at FWW. ""But it wasn't always this way, and it doesn't have to be this way ""¦ we have to reject false solutions and instead reform policies to support farmers, the environment and the US economy.""

Consolidation in the US dairy industry has occurred at a faster pace than in every other agricultural sector apart from hog and egg production. It's happening at both the farm level - fewer farms, more mega-dairies - and at the processing level - fewer but larger corporations and cooperatives that purchase, process and market dairy products.

Nationally, the total number of US dairy farms fell by more than half between 1997 and 2017, while the average number of cows per farm increased by 139%, according to analysis of USDA data. More than 70% of US milk is produced on farms with at least 500 cows, with the largest dairies boasting herds of more than 25,000.

Larger farms are less likely to graze their cattle, instead relying on purchased feed - the single largest source of greenhouse gases from industrialised agriculture. In addition, factory farms store manure in liquid form which encourages the release of methane - unlike field cattle whose manure decomposes with minimal emissions.

Methane is a short-lived but powerful heat-trapping gas that accounts for about a third of the rise in global temperature since the pre-industrial era - and nearly 25% of warming today. Livestock - through cattle burps, manure management and the cultivation of feed crops - is responsible for nearly a third of the global manmade emissions.

In recent years, as scientists have warned about the oversized role played by industrial farming in global heating, agribusinesses including dairy have looked towards unproven industry-led fixes like carbon offset markets and feed additives to lower the methane content in cow burps, rather than addressing the main problem, which is factory farming large herds.

A factor driving dairy farm consolidation is declining returns.

Farmers have struggled to break even due to production costs rising faster than milk prices - which were slightly lower in 2021 compared with 2000. This is partly due to a major shift in US dairy policy away from price stabilization achieved through minimum price guarantees and buying and storing excess milk that would be donated or resold to manage oversupply, to one that encourages production and expanding export markets.

The policy shift - which includes promotion of dairy products in developing countries - helped the US become one of the largest dairy exporters in the world. As exports rose, so did price swings, and in order to stay competitive, US milk prices stayed low.

""This lined the pockets of agribusinesses while leaving farmers captive to volatile international markets ""¦ Clearly, export-focused policies have not improved the welfare of the average US dairy farmer,"" according to the FWW report.

The dairy industry - which includes individuals and Pacs linked to farmers, manufacturers and cooperatives - made $5.1m in federal campaign contributions during the 2020 election cycle, according to Open Secrets, the transparency watchdog. In the same year, the industry spent $6.9m to influence Washington, lobbying hard to protect corporate subsidies among other benefits in the farm bill.

""The get big or get out push from our political and industry leaders has come true, and enabling this concentration has led to the withering of small and medium farms - and had a crushing impact on rural communities across the US,"" said Sarah Lloyd, a dairy farmer in Wisconsin who helps run the family's midsize farm with 450 cows. ""Farms that have hung for a hundred years can no longer keep their heads above water due to this boom and bust system, opening up more space for consolidation ""¦ It's a vicious cycle.""

In the past 20 years, spiralling debts and bankruptcies have been linked to farmer suicides and the decline in rural populations. ""We cannot export or consume our way out of this problem, we need policies to better manage supplies to reflect actual demand so that dairy farming can go back to being a viable livelihood,"" said Lloyd.

But dairy farmers are forced to pay into corporate schemes that work against their interests. FWW estimates that between 2005 and 2018 dairy farmers paid around $4bn into the mandatory Dairy Checkoff program which funds campaigns pushing US milk, butter and creamers to consumers and fast-food firms that mostly benefit mega-dairies.

At the state level, at least $75m in New York taxpayer dollars has flowed to a handful of corporate and cooperative entities in the last 20 years, with the promise of a few thousand jobs - some of which were quickly lost when dairy plants closed.

A spokesperson for the USDEC, which is mostly funded by the federal checkoff program and USDA, said it focused on expanding exports ""on behalf of dairy farmers of all sizes across the country and is driven by the reality that export sales help bolster farm-level milk prices ""¦ the current federal safety net program for dairy is an insurance system that allows farmers to help mitigate the impacts of price volatility.""

""The sector prides itself on its commitment to sustainability"" and is moving towards its 2050 goals of net zero emissions and better water management, the spokesperson added in a statement.

The agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, was appointed chief executive of USDEC after leaving the Obama administration, where he reportedly made more than $900,000 in 2020 - more than 3,000 times the median farm income. Since returning to the USDA under Biden, Vilsack has continued to prioritise expanding US agricultural exports.

A USDA spokesperson said it had implemented a range of new economic and technical support for small and mid-sized farms, including organic dairies which currently account for 2% of milk production, and was working to establish more competitive markets, and strengthen local and regional food systems under the Biden-Harris administration. ""Together, these actions will help ensure small and mid-sized producers have more, new and better income opportunities they can take advantage of to strengthen their bottom line, receive a fair return for their products, and combat consolidation.""

Report argues chickens should be kept in much smaller flocks and given more space

The industrial poultry farming sector needs to be radically restructured to stop the spread of bird flu, says a report that argues wild birds are victims rather than the main vectors of the disease.

Bird flu is spiralling out of control and being spread by intensive poultry farms, according toreport by the campaign group Compassion in World Farming (CIWF).

Overcrowded sheds provide a perfect place for viruses to mutate and spread, it argues. Chickens should instead be kept in much smaller flocks and given more space.

The report suggests a three-point action plan: mass vaccination of poultry to stop the spread; a radical restructuring of the industry to raise healthier birds in better environments; and changing the way pigs are farmed, as it says factory farmed pigs can act as ""mixing vessels"" to create new pig, bird and human viruses.

CIWF has written to the UK, US and various European governments urging them to work with the World Organisation for Animal Health and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization to put these measures in place.

Its chief policy adviser, Peter Stevenson, said: ""Bird flu is like a ticking timebomb. Unless we wake up and take urgent action to end factory farming, we will simply be unable to stop its rapid spread across the globe or reduce the risk of a serious human pandemic developing.

""Cramming animals together in factory farms in not only totally inhumane, it's creating the perfect place for bird flu and other viruses to spread and mutate into more dangerous strains.""

The RSPCA agreed that industrial poultry farm must be reformed. Dr Marc Cooper, the charity's head of farm animals, said: ""We support calls for an end to intensive farming and want to see all farmed animals, including poultry, kept in higher welfare conditions, as well as the use of more robust, higher welfare breeds.

""Improving the welfare of farm animals has multiple environmental and societal benefits, including helping better control diseases. When animals are kept intensively and breeds that have inherent health issues are used, the animals are more likely to have compromised immune systems and be more susceptible to diseases. Higher welfare farming can therefore help reduce disease risk.""

He noted that the use of vaccines was currently experimental. ""We welcome any research into possible vaccinations which would help tackle this destructive disease. However, we believe effective vaccines are currently a long way off coming to fruition, so it's important that bird welfare is much better protected now,"" he said.

""We believe the long-term strategy to eradicate the virus needs to be a combination of vaccinations, higher welfare farming practices, which includes more robust breeds, and excellent biosecurity.""

Richard Griffiths, the chief executive of the British Poultry Council, hit back at the report. He said: ""Avian influenza is carried into the UK by migratory birds. As a result, it spreads amongst the domestic wild bird population. No bird has avian influenza when it goes on to farm. All incidents derive from outside the farm through wild bird incursion. When disease is detected, the farm is culled so disease is not spread. Therefore, indoor production methods do not aid in the spread of disease.

""Conflating disease control with your opinion on how we produce food in the UK is an irresponsible way of approaching our primary concern here: ensuring the health of our birds and the sustainability of a world-class food system producing nutritious and affordable food. In these times, that matters more than ever.""

More than half a billion farmed birds have died or been culled globally due to bird flu since 2021. Many were broilers (meat chickens) that had been confined closely together in huge sheds, or egg-laying hens confined in cages with an area roughly the size of an A4 sheet of paper.

The formidable Indian environmentalist discusses her 50-year struggle to protect seeds and farmers from the ""˜poison cartel' of corporate agriculture

You don't have to look very far to find the essence of life, says Vandana Shiva. But in a society caught up in a blur of technological advances, bio-hacks and attempts to improve ourselves and the natural world, she fears we are hellbent on destroying it.

""Everything comes from the seed, but we have forgotten that the seed isn't a machine,"" says Shiva. ""We think we can engineer life, we can change the carefully organised DNA of a living organism, and there will be no wider impact. But this is a dangerous illusion.""

For almost five decades, Shiva has been deeply engaged in the fight for environmental justice in India. Regarded as one of the world's most formidable environmentalists, she has worked to save forests, shut down polluting mines, exposed the dangers of pesticides, spurred on the global campaign for organic farming, championed ecofeminism and gone up against powerful giant chemical corporations.

Her battle to protect the world's seeds in their natural form - rather than genetically altered and commercially controlled versions - continues to be her life's work.

Shiva's anti-globalisation philosophy and pilgrimages across India have often been compared to Mahatma Gandhi. Yet while Gandhi became synonymous with the spinning wheel as a symbol of self-reliance, Shiva's emblem is the seed.

Now 70, Shiva - who is divorced and has one son - has spent her life refusing to conform to the patriarchal norms so often imposed on women in India, particularly in the 1950s. She has published more than 20 books and when she is not travelling the world for workshops or speaking tours, she spends her time between her office in Delhi and her organic farm in the foothills of the Himalayas.

She credits her spirit of resistance to her parents, who were ""feminists at a higher level than I've ever known - long before we even knew the word ""˜feminism'"". After 1947, when India gained independence, her father left the military for a job in the forests of the mountainous state of Uttarakhand, where Shiva was born and brought up always to believe she was equal to men. ""The forests were my identity and from an early age the laws of nature captivated me,"" she says.

She was about six when she stumbled on a book of quotes by Albert Einstein buried in a small, musty library in a forest lodge. She was transfixed, determined against all odds to be a physicist. Though science was not taught at her rural convent school, Shiva's parents encouraged her curiosity and found ways for her to learn. By the time she was in her 20s, she was completing her PhD in quantum physics at a Canadian university.

Yet as logging, dams and development wreaked ecological devastation on Uttarakhand's forests and local peasant women rose up to fight it - a movement known as Chipko - Shiva realised, on returning to India, that her heart lay not with quantum physics but with a different, nagging question. ""I couldn't understand why were we told that new technology brings progress, but everywhere I looked, local people were getting poorer and landscapes were being devastated as soon as this development or new technology came in,"" she says.

In 1982, in her mother's cow shed in the mountain town of Dehradun, Shiva set up her research foundation, exploring the crossover between science, technology and ecology. She began to document the ""green revolution"" that swept rural India from the late 1960s, where in a bid to drive up crop yields and avert famine, the government had pushed farmers to introduce technology, mechanisation and agrochemicals.

It instilled in her a lifelong opposition to industrial interference in agriculture. Though the green revolution is acknowledged to have prevented widespread starvation and introduced some necessary modernisation into rural communities, it was also the beginning of a continuing system of monoculture in India, where farmers were pushed to abandon native varieties and instead plant a few high-yielding wheat and rice crops in quick-turnaround cycles, burning the stubble in their fields in between.

It also created a reliance on subsidised fertilisers and chemicals that, though costly and environmentally disastrous, lasts to this day. Soil in fertile states such as Punjab, once known as the breadbasket of India, has been stripped of its rich minerals, with watercourses running dry, rivers polluted with chemical run-off and farmers in a perpetual state of deep crisis and anger.

Shiva's suspicions about the chemical industry worsened further when, in the early 1990s, she was privy to some of the first multilateral discussions around agricultural biotechnology and plans by chemical companies to alter crop genes for commercial purposes.

""There was a race on by companies to develop and patent these GM crops, but no one was stopping to ask: what will be the impact on the environment? How will they impact on diversity? What will this cost the farmers? They only wanted to win the race and control all the world's seeds. To me, it all seemed so wrong,"" says Shiva.

In 1991, five years before the first genetically modified (GM) crops had been planted, she founded Navdanya, meaning ""nine seeds"", an initiative to save India's native seeds and spread their use among farmers. Eight years later, she took the chemical monolith Monsanto, the world's largest producer of seeds, to the supreme court for bringing its GM cotton into India without permission.

Monsanto became notorious in the 1960s for producing the herbicide Agent Orange for the US military during the Vietnam war, and subsequently led the development of GM crops in the 1990s. It moved quickly to penetrate the international market with its privatised seeds, particularly in developing, predominantly agricultural countries.

The company, which was bought in 2018 by the German pharmaceutical and biotech company Bayer, became embroiled in legal action. In 2020 it announced a $11bn (£8.7bn) payout to settle claims of links between its herbicide and cancer on behalf of almost 100,000 people but denied any wrongdoing. In 2016, dozens of civil society groups staged a ""people's tribunal"" in The Hague, finding Monsanto guilty of human rights violations and developing an unsustainable system of farming.

Shiva says taking Monsanto to court felt like going up against a mafia and alleges that many attempts were made to threaten and pressure her into not filing the case.

Monsanto finally got permission to bring GM cotton to India in 2002, but Shiva has kept up her fight against chemical multinationals, which Shiva refers to as the ""poison cartel"". Currently more than 60% of the world's commercial seeds are sold by just four companies, which have led the push to patent seeds, orchestrated a global monopoly of certain GM crops such as cotton and soya and sued hundreds of small-scale farmers for saving seeds from commercial crops.

""We have taken on these giants when they said ""˜we've invented rice, we've invented wheat', and we have won,"" she says.

She remains adamant that GM crops have failed. But though the legacy of GM pest-resistant cotton in India is complex and has increased pesticide use, not all would agree that the issue is black and white. Indeed, her outspoken and often intransigent positions on GM organisms and globalisation have earned her many critics and powerful enemies.

She has been accused of exaggerating the dangers of GM and simplifying facts around the direct correlation between farmers' suicides and genetically modified crops, and been called an enemy of progress for her rhetoric against globalisation, given the threats facing the world.

As the global population has ballooned to 8 billion people, and the climate crisis throws agriculture into disarray, even some prominent environmentalists have shifted their positions and have argued that GM crops can underpin food security. Countries including the UK, which had imposed strict laws around GM foods, are now pushing for more gene editing of crops and animals. Last year India approved the release of a new GM mustard seed.

Shiva is scathing of this renewed push for GM organisms, arguing that much of the gene-editing process is still ""dangerously unpredictable"" and calling it ""ignorance"" to think climate-adapted crops can only come from industrial labs.

""Farmers have already bred thousands of climate-resilient and salt-tolerant seeds; they weren't the invention of a few big companies, no matter what patents they claim,"" she says.

For Shiva, the global crisis facing agriculture will not be solved by the ""poison cartel"" nor a continuation of fossil fuel-guzzling, industrialised farming, but instead a return to local, small-scale farming no longer reliant on agrochemicals. ""Globally, the subsidies are $400bn a year to make an unviable agriculture system work,"" she says.

""This industrialised globalised system of food is destroying soil, it is destroying water and it is generating 30% of our greenhouse gases. If we want to fix this, we've got to shift from industrial to ecological farming.""

Nonetheless, while her crusade against the might of chemical corporations will continue, Shiva considers her most important work to be her travels through India's villages, collecting and saving seeds - including 4,000 varieties of rice - setting up more than 100 seed banks, and helping farmers return to organic methods.

""My proudest work is listening to the seed and her creativity,"" she says. ""I'm proud of the fact that a lie is a lie is a lie, no matter how big the power that tells the lie. And I'm proud that I've never ever hesitated in speaking the truth.""

This article was amended on 28 April 2023. A previous version incorrectly stated that Vandana Shiva had no children; she has a son.

Vandana Shiva's latest book, Terra Viva: My Life in a Biodiversity of Movements, is published by Chelsea Green. Shiva will speak at the Extinction or Regeneration conference at the QEII Centre, London, on 11-12 May

Carbon-guzzling trees and crops, genetically altered to boost photosynthesis and store carbon in the roots, could absorb millions of tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere

In an asphalt-surrounded greenhouse at the back of a business park in Hayward, California, on the shores of San Francisco Bay, a sea of more than 200 leafy, green, hybrid poplar saplings are itching to break free from their pots. Among them stands Maddie Hall. The trees are all ""mother trees"", explains Hall, co-founder and CEO of climate biotech firm Living Carbon. They have been genetically altered (there are about 100 different lines) with the aim of making them better at absorbing carbon dioxide (CO2). The startup company propagates cuttings from the mothers either to study or to send to nurseries for larger-scale production.

This spring, clones of four of its leading lines were planted on private land in Georgia and Ohio as pilot projects to monitor their carbon sequestration, through partnerships with willing landowners. Living Carbon's business model includes selling carbon removal credits, with landowners paid for the use of their property. About 170,000 seedlings of different tree varieties were planted over about 120 hectares (300 acres), about 5% of which were genetically modified poplars: the company is starting small, conscious of avoiding monocultures. ""None of what we do matters if it just all stays at the greenhouse,"" says Hall.

There are projects under way around the world to genetically engineer plants - namely crops - for traits such as bigger yields, disease resistance or drought or heat tolerance. But efforts to engineer them to do better at drawing CO2 out of the atmosphere to fight the climate crisis directly are newer.

Living Carbon, founded in 2019 and which has received $36m in venture capital funding to date, is in the vanguard of establishing the technology in trees. Meanwhile, a handful of others, including two world-leading California-based scientific institutions, are tackling how it might be done in agricultural crops. Both the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego and the Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI) in Berkeley, a joint venture between the University of California, Berkeley and UC, San Francisco, have received large amounts of philanthropic funding.

The possible impact of this approach on global CO2 emissions is difficult to quantify - it depends on how significant the gains could be, and how widely it's deployed. But its proponents are bullish that if scaled up it could make a significant contribution and buy the world some time.

Guzzling carbon

It is by increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis - the process by which plants use light, water and CO2 to make sugars that fuel plant growth (with oxygen as the byproduct) - that Living Carbon's trees are able to capture more CO2 than they naturally would. Forests with their woody biomass and substantial rooting systems that last many decades are an important long-term carbon sink - if their trees can photosynthesise even better, that importance becomes supercharged.

But increasing the amount of photosynthesis done by a plant isn't easy. Living Carbon gets round this by short-circuiting an inefficiency most plants also have which - contrary to the general pattern of photosynthesis - sees them regularly take up oxygen and give out some CO2 in daylight. Living Carbon tinkers with that process to channel that CO2 into tree growth. ""We took a lot of learning from what had been shown to work well in crop plants and our big innovation was having a similar trait work in trees,"" says Hall.

In a scientific paper published this April, the company reports that in a four-month-long greenhouse trial its modified poplars increased in biomass by 35-53% over its controls, equivalent to removing 17-27% more CO2 from the air. Several patents are now in the works, says Hall, and, in addition to the pilot plantings, a small field trial involving about 600 of the trees is under way at the University of Oregon to confirm the results.

All Living Carbon's planting is intended to be done on degraded mining or agricultural land where no trees currently grow. It aims to plant about 2,400 hectares (6,000 acres), around 4m trees by the end of spring 2024 - roughly half of which will be photosynthesis-enhanced. But if it could scale that up to 1.6m hectares (4m acres) by 2030, that would mean - assuming a 40-year lifespan and that the enhanced trees guzzle carbon at the top rate observed in the greenhouse trials - more than 600 megatonnes of CO2 sequestered, which is about 1.6% of current global CO2 emissions. There's a lot of potential given that there are 60m hectares (148m acres) of land available for reforestation in the US alone, says Hall. Living Carbon was able to move forward quickly with the pilots because US regulators ruled that the trees need not be regulated as genetically engineered plants: there was no risk the genes being inserted could make them more invasive.

Meanwhile, arming crops to be better at removing CO2 requires a different approach. They are shorter-lived and harvested seasonally; what's left both above and below ground decomposes quickly, releasing CO2 back into the atmosphere. The focus for crops then is on engineering them so they are better able to store more carbon below ground for longer. It is also possible to stack traits - making plants better at both capturing and storing carbon.

Plant scientists at the Salk have been working to engineer crop plants they call ""Salk Ideal Plants"" since 2017, though it wasn't until 2019 the project ramped up. The work, under the rubric of the Harnessing Plants Initiative (HPI), has received more than $127m in funding to date from the TED Audacious Project, the Bezos Earth Fund and the Hess Corporation, an oil and gas exploration and production company.

Soya beans, rice, wheat, corn, rapeseed/canola, sorghum and CoverCress (a strain of field pennycress) are the current target crops. That they are planted on so much land already means there is capacity to have a large impact, say plant scientists Joanne Chory and Wolfgang Busch, the HPI founding director and executive director respectively.

The focus is on modifying the crops in three ways that they hope will create dramatic changes. Those are: larger roots (more root mass means more carbon sequestered); roots that penetrate deeper into the soil (further down, microbial activity is lower so it takes longer to decompose and there are typically more minerals that the carbon can associate with to lock it away); and roots that produce more of a carbon-rich polymer called suberin. Produced by all land plants and the main component of cork, suberin is difficult for microbes to decompose so it could keep carbon locked underground far longer. ""Salk Ideal Plants will be the world champions of carbon sequestration,"" says Busch.

Although things will vary with soil type, the scientists aim to develop crops that will be able to stabilise about 30% of the carbon that gets fixed from the air in the soil, up from very little, and they hope to have the plants grow on about 70% of the area where they grow currently. Particularly thanks to suberin and deeper roots, at least some of that would remain for decades.

So far, the group have found tens of genes in other plants that they believe could enhance the traits, and they are now doing small-scale proof-of-concept experiments to test whether employing them in the crops or changing the equivalent genes in the crops can work. The aim is to make the plants available by the late 2020s or early 2030s and a company called Cquesta is being set up to take forward commercialisation.

Meanwhile, about 500 miles north of the Salk and not too far from Living Carbon's greenhouse, is the IGI. It too has a crop effort under way, launched last year and funded by $11m from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. The goal is ""taking more carbon out of the atmosphere, funnelling it into the soil and trying to keep it there"", says Brad Ringeisen, the IGI's executive director. And it doesn't start from scratch but brings together the ongoing work of several researchers at the IGI's partner institutions in both roots and leaves.

Others on the scene include UK-based startup Wild Bio, a spin-out of Oxford University's Oxford Centre for Plant Science Innovation, founded in 2021. It hopes to genetically alter crops to produce more food and leave behind more carbon in the soil, drawing inspiration from plants in the wild. Legislation passed this March, which removes crops that are gene edited only from the regulatory system for genetically modified organisms in England - the US made a similar move in 2021 - will help the company, says Ross Hendron, its co-founder and CEO. The new law allows genetic changes in crop plants that could have been produced naturally, or by traditional cross-breeding - while stricter regulations for introducing genetic material from other species remain in place.

Unproved at scale

Yet moving these new superpowered plants forward commercially faces hurdles, starting with demonstrating they work in the real world. While Living Carbon may be planning to scale up planting, it remains to be seen whether the carbon-sequestration gains seen in the greenhouse trials translate outside, where conditions such as temperature, available water and nutrients aren't controlled, say experts. This environmental variability can make a ""huge difference"" to how things grow, says Christine Raines, a professor of plant biology at the University of Essex. It will also, she adds, take time to see - because conditions can change markedly from one year to the next.

There are other factors. It has been found, for example, that trees now growing in warmer conditions because of climate change grow faster because they suck up more CO2 anyway - though the trade-off is that they might die sooner.

Meanwhile for the Salk project, suberin - touted as a star for its potential to store carbon longer-term in the soil - may not work out as hoped. A possible problem noted by Raines and others is that by locking away carbon, it could reduce what's available to the crop to put towards yield. It may also interfere with root performance. The Salk scientists acknowledge there is work to do on suberin, and they are exploring how they might add enhanced photosynthetic efficiency to counter the potential yield problem.

Others doubt that developing such technology is the best way to proceed at all. There is no proof that it will work at scale, and it could take decades to develop, say campaign groups. Friends of the Earth Europe also says that no one knows the long-term impacts of modifying the genes of trees and plants through technologies. Better, they say, to focus on what has a proven record of cutting emissions - such as significantly increasing the number of trees and using low-till agriculture, which reduces soil disturbance and so promotes the storage of carbon in the soil naturally. ""Like so many novel tech approaches to tackling CO2 ""¦ [the development of such plants] represents a significant distraction,"" says Ben Raskin, the Soil Association's head of horticulture and agroforestry.

Yet for the proponents of superpowering plants to directly counter the climate crisis, the world hasn't been reducing emissions at the rate required, and even if it were to reduce them to zero tomorrow, it would still need to remove carbon. Hall adds it would be a shame if the technology was prevented from moving forward because of concerns about genetic modification not founded in science. ""We are in a climate emergency,"" she points out.

After India imposed an export ban on rice following destructive rains, prices have soared - now rising temperatures put crops across south-east Asia at risk

Normally by mid-August Thongpoon Moonchansong's fields are submerged in still waters, with scattered rice plants reaching up to her knees. The waters are usually so abundant that if you plunge a net into the fields, you can draw out fish and crab to eat.

This year, though, things have been different. Rain has been falling in her village in Uttaradit province in the north of Thailand, but it has not been heavy or consistent enough. The canal next to Thongpoon's family home is dry.

Her family has given up hope of harvesting any rice. ""Usually it would be heavy rain and it would be flooded in the canal - this year there has been no water at all. We had to sow dry,"" says her daughter, Thanunkan Potudomsin. ""Even if it does rain a lot now, the time when the rice would grow to give a yield has already passed,"" she says. ""It's all dried up.""

Across south and south-east Asia, unpredictable weather is threatening supplies of rice, a staple food for more than half the world's population. In July, India, the world's largest rice exporter, imposed an export ban on non-basmati white rice after crops were damaged by heavy rains. The ban - along with concerns over the arrival of the El NiÃ±o phenomenon, which brings hotter, drier weather across the region - has caused prices in key exporting countries Thailand and Vietnam to soar by about 20%, according to a recent Reuters report.

The ripple effects have been felt widely. Over recent weeks, the United Arab Emirates suspended rice exports and re-exports for four months, Myanmar said it plans to temporarily halt exports, and Indonesia said it wants to import more from neighbouring countries to buffer its stocks.

In the Philippines, the government has imposed a rice price cap to protect the poorest consumers, with the country's National Economic and Development Authority warning of ""difficult times"" and referring to El NiÃ±o as a ""major disruptor"".

El NiÃ±o is a naturally occurring climate phenomenon in which sections of the Pacific Ocean heat up, typically causing hotter temperatures across many parts of the world. The impact this El NiÃ±o will have on rice is unclear. When the last major El NiÃ±o event occurred in 2015-2016, south-east Asia experienced an output decline of 15m tonnes of rice compared with the preceding two years, according to a report by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, in Singapore. The weather event drove an increase in disease, brought drought and fuelled huge forest and peatland fires that led to a haze crisis across the region.

It is still unclear how severe this El NiÃ±o is, says Prof Benjamin Horton, director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore. ""The concern is that the rate of warming of ocean temperatures in the Pacific has never been seen before. That indicates that we may get a major El NiÃ±o on top of climate change, which would take us really into uncharted territory.

""I hope El NiÃ±o is just a little blip,"" Horton says. If it isn't, the prospects for agriculture would be ""petrifying"".

A major El NiÃ±o would have ""significant effects on the air that we breathe; the haze will be so bad that we will not be able to go outside. It will affect the water that we drink - we will not have the availability of water - and it will affect the food that we eat, because we won't have the food,"" says Horton, adding that governments needed to prepare.

Surasri Kidtimonton, the secretary-general of Thailand's Office of the National Water Resources, predicted in August that the central plains, the country's rice belt, could face a 40% drop in accumulated rain this season. Indian officials told the media last week that the country was poised for its lowest monsoon rains in eight years.

India accounts for more than 40% of the global rice trade, and supplies many countries in Asia and Africa, where the market for Indian rice has grown over recent years, due to lower prices.

Rice is unlike many other commodities because only a small portion of what's grown globally - about 11% - is traded, says Joseph Glauber, senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington DC. When a very major rice exporter such as India is taken out of the market, then there aren't a lot of suppliers elsewhere to fill the gap, he added.""The real question will be whether or not [the monsoons in India] end early and I think that's always the one of the signs that people will look for as El NiÃ±o strengthens,"" said Glauber.

The current pressure on rice exports comes at a time when domestic food price inflation is already stubbornly high across much of the world, worsened by Russia's war in Ukraine. El NiÃ±o not only threatens rice production, but many key agricultural products - from palm oil, the world's most widely used vegetable oil, to India's sugarcane, soybeans and corn crops.

In Thailand, which has said it has no reason to impose a rice export ban, farmers have been urged to grow crops that consume less water. Campaigns to encourage the public, government and business sectors to use water sparingly will also be launched, local media reported.

Even if El NiÃ±o is not as severe as feared, researchers say there is an undeniable need for farmers to adapt to the hotter temperatures brought by the climate crisis. Rice is especially vulnerable. Too little or too much water can destroy a field, and even a seemingly small fluctuation in temperatures can have a dramatic effect. Researchers at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines, who studied variations in night-time temperatures, found that each time the minimum temperature rose by just 1C, grain yields declined by 10%. Short, sharp cold snaps can also be deadly.

The effect of the climate crisis on rice, both in terms of its quantity and quality, is dramatic, says Dr Siwaret Arikit, director of the Rice Science Center at Kasetsart University in Thailand.

""We have identified so many emerging diseases that were not very severe before. But after climate change, they have destroyed [crops]."" He gives the example of dirty panicle disease, which has become a growing threat to rice farmers. ""This reduces about 20 or 30% the yield in the field if it's infected,"" says Siwaret.

Researchers and farmers are searching for ways to make their crops more resilient. In Thanunkan Potudomsin's village, some have switched crops, growing plants that require less water.

The Rice Center, which collaborates with researchers in the US and UK, is trying to develop a rice that is more nutritious and can withstand the threats brought by global heating. Its researchers are studying a ""diversity panel"" of 400 types of rice, and identifying genes that are associated with more resilient features. This might mean looking for genes that give longer roots that can absorb moisture far deeper into the land, or leaves with fewer pores, known as stomata, which would lose less moisture, allowing them to cope better in drought, and release less methane. In 2022, the centre, in collaboration with researchers in the US, was able to identify genes that are able to better resist the brown planthopper pest.

Forecasters can then work with big data, gathering accurate weather predictions for farmers - whether it's drought, flood or disease outbreaks - and work in collaboration with rice breeders, says Siwaret. ""If you have a very accurate prediction, breeders can prepare and can bring new rice that can be fit to those situations.""

While Thanunkan's area has experienced drought, elsewhere parts of the north-eastern province of Nakhon Phanom were recently declared flood disaster zones, with rice fields inundated.

Thanunkan's mother's rice field is 1.3 hectares (7.4 acres), while the family has 4.8 hectares in total. They normally keep rice for their own consumption, and sell what's left over. They're now waiting for government compensation, but are unsure of how much they will receive.

Thanunkan says she had told her mother not to try to farm the field this year, fearing the weather is too unpredictable. Some in the village are facing debt because they have invested in their fields. But she couldn't persuade her 59-year-old mother to stop. ""The belief of this generation is they feel it's a pity for the rice field [to stand empty]. They don't want it to be abandoned.""

Instead, she says, what's left of the field this year will be fed to the cows.

281,"Should I worry about pesticides?","https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/04/should-i-worry-about-pesticides","Should I worry about pesticides?

Many of them don't pose a risk to humans. But what about the less natural stuff that goes on our food?



Pesticides are far from being a new invention. In the Odyssey, Homer describes how Odysseus ""cleanses all pollution"" by applying sulphur, while Pliny the Elder recommended using arsenic as an insect-killer, as well as mixing it with boar's liver to cure ""carbuncles upon the generative organs"".

We have since learned a lot more about what has an adverse effect on our health, while modern science can mix chemicals in combinations the Romans and Greeks could never have dreamed of. So, just how bad are today's pesticides - and what can you do to mitigate their effects on your health?

To be clear, plenty of pesticides don't pose any risk to humans. Caffeine is an insecticide, produced by plants for self-protection; many of us glug down a dose that would be fatal to mosquito larvae three times a day. The first real question is: how worried should you be about the less natural stuff going on your food?

""The most important thing to understand is that pesticides and their use are carefully regulated in the UK,"" says Prof Michael Eddleston, a clinical toxicologist who sits on the UK Expert Committee on Pesticides. ""Therefore, the amount of pesticide in and on food grown in the UK is likely to be low and not dangerous. Crops imported from abroad may be contaminated with higher amounts of pesticides, but supermarkets do their best to reduce contamination and to remove hazardous pesticides from the food production chain. So, overall, the direct risk to our health is probably low.""

One problem is that pesticide safety evaluations examine only the toxicity of individual chemicals. There is little understanding of how mixtures of chemicals behave, so the long-term effects of consuming small amounts of several pesticides as residues in food - and the possible combined effects of these residues with other environmental contaminants - are not well understood. ""The general thinking is that risks from very low concentrations are small, since healthy adults are able to process and excrete toxins pretty efficiently,"" says Eddleston. ""But children and unhealthy adults may be more vulnerable.""

What should you do? The benefits of organic food are not clear-cut. One recent study in the US found that levels of glyphosate (a probable carcinogen) found in participants' bodies dropped 71% after just one week of switching to organic. But, of course, even ""natural"" pesticides can be nasty. Arsenic and nicotine are natural, but banned for use as pesticides. There is some evidence that organic food is healthier generally, but that might be related to other factors, such as its nutrient profile.

Running your apples and broccoli under the tap isn't a surefire solution. The UK's Food Standards Agency notes that ""washing ""¦ may help remove residues of certain pesticides"", but when pesticides are used in the germination process (when the seeds are being planted), washing later won't do anything to help. The same is true of peeling, but, in any case, doing this removes some of the food's nutritional value, which may cause more problems than it solves.

Perhaps the biggest concern about pesticides isn't for us as individuals, but rather humans as a collective. ""Insecticides kill off-target insects [insects that they aren't intentionally trying to kill], affecting biodiversity, which is hugely important for future food production and the planet,"" says Eddleston. ""Insecticides, fungicides and herbicides also harm the soil microbiome, which is essential in making nutrients available to plants and in breaking down organic matter: two functions that are fundamental for the sustainability of food production and soil conservation, which in turn is an essential component of climate change mitigation.""

This means that we need to reduce pesticide use, in the UK and globally, through ""integrated pest-management"" tactics, such as producing pest-resistant crops and rotating crops to deter insects, says Eddleston: ""This needs to be accelerated and pesticide use further reduced worldwide. This will not only improve food safety, but also ensure the continuity of food production, which currently and in future largely comes from land-based production. Pesticides kill indiscriminately and the world needs biodiversity for its future."" Even Odysseus, not the world's biggest softy, would probably approve.

Canefield rats eats weeds that grow beneath sugarcane in warm, wet conditions and farmers say the population is the highest its been in decades

Sugarcane growers in the North Queensland town of Ingham are facing major crop losses due to the biggest native rat plague the town has seen in decades.

Numbers of the native canefield rat, Rattus sordidus, have exploded due to a ""perfect storm"" of weather conditions, a scenario that experts say will become more common as the climate crisis worsens.

Lawrence Di Bella is the manager of Herbert Cane Productivity Services, an agricultural not-for-profit company funded by sugarcane growers in the Herbert River region, which is centred around Ingham.'

""I've been in the industry for over 30 years and this is probably the worst I've ever seen it,"" Di Bella toldGuardian Australia.

""Probably the best we can hope for now is if we can actually get some rain and wash the little buggers out of their burrows in the ground.""

Di Bella said the region had had several mild wet seasons that failed to wash the rats out, which combined with a large crop last year created ideal conditions for a population explosion.

""We've really had the perfect storm last season,"" he said. ""We had a large crop that lodged - meaning the crop fell towards the ground, which actually allows the rats to climb on to the end storks and chew away at the stalks, and also allows sunlight into the ground canopy stimulating weed growth.""

""It's the weed seed that is the protein source that allows them to actually reproduce, they actually only eat the cane for fibre.""

With that kind of food source, the rats can breed rapidly.

""For a breeding pair in 12 months, we'll have 450 young,"" Di Bella said.

Local farmers are now using night vision cameras to observe the rats in an attempt to gauge the scale of the problem. They have also been granted permission to lay baits in an attempt to control the numbers, a process that is more complicated than ordinary pest control measures because the rats are a native species.

""We're actually having to bait them now, but that's our last resort,"" Di Bella said. ""We have a management strategy where we're trying to keep the crops free of weeds. So trying to manage their adjacent habitat areas and the weed pressure within the crop.""

The very wet weather in northern Queensland since Christmas has made it nearly impossible to clear the weeds, Di Bella said, but farmers were hopeful that by both using rat baits and controlling the weeds they could get the numbers down before the next harvest, which begins in June.

""We're trying to get our numbers down,"" he said. ""But they are never going to disappear.""

Dr Wendy Ruscoe, a senior research scientist at CSIRO, studied the rat and mice populations in north Queensland for her PhD. She said rat plagues were a common occurrence in the region but it was unusual for them to occur this early in the year.

""What has obviously happened is the weeds have perhaps started to grow earlier, because ""¦ maybe it was wetter and warmer earlier in the spring,"" she said. ""Which has given that the rats a couple of extra months of breeding early in the season.""

Ruscoe said the population increase was part of the species' natural ""boom and bust"" cycle. The best thing farmers could do, she added, was ensure they were properly maintaining their properties and mitigating weed growth.

It is not just crop damage that farmers have to look out for - people who come into contact with rat urine may be at risk of a Leptospirosis infection, which can lead to kidney or liver failure. The disease, often referred to as cane cutters disease, was a common occurrence in the days of manual cane harvesting and was one of the reasons that crops were often burnt before harvest.

""We have to remember that it's a native species that has invaded the crops and it's been doing it for as long as they've been growing cane up there,"" she said. ""As the climate gets more volatile, we will see more periods of very low numbers but then perhaps also more frequent and extreme outbursts.""

287,"Richard Young obituary","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/10/richard-young-obituary","Richard Young obituary

Richard Young, who has died of heart disease aged 73, was a champion of animal welfare and an advocate of the importance of livestock in sustainable food systems. He was one of the early adopters of organic farming in the 1970s, and his deep understanding of sustainable farming principles was derived from direct experience.

Young's rise to prominence within the organic movement owed much to his dedicated engagement with two pioneer organisations that were later absorbed into the Soil Association: British Organic Farmers and the Organic Growers' Association, whose journal, New Farmer and Grower, he edited for several years. He played a pivotal role in the development of the Soil Association's organic livestock standards in the late 1980s, making sure that the rules expressly prohibited feed containing animal waste.

In 1989, his family's farm, Kite's Nest, near Broadway in the Cotswolds, was one of the first to be visited by the then Prince of Wales, who subsequently sought Young's advice on organic agriculture, particularly on ways to reduce dependence on antibiotics in livestock farming.

Visitors to Kite's Nest often got the impression that they were stepping back into another century, or indeed forward to a future where animals, plants, soils and humans are respected as equals. For the Youngs, grazing their animals in wildflower-rich meadows, keeping them in family groups and accompanying them personally to the abattoir represented normal life. Farm-shop customers arriving on a sunny Sunday afternoon might leave hours later after a wide-ranging conversation and a farm tour that turned into an expert hands-on tutorial from Richard about grasses, geology, stockmanship and woodland management - interrupted to greet various favourite cattle.

Richard was born in Moreton-in-Marsh, in the Cotswolds, the son of Mary (nee Wynn) and Harry Young, who worked on the family's College Farm at Condicote. By the age of 11 Richard was already driving tractors, milking cows and keeping native-breed pigs. He and his sister Rosamund were raised on a diet of literature by their mother, and with Stratford-upon-Avon not far away, Shakespeare and his work remained a beacon for the whole family. Richard went to Bourton school and then Chipping Campden comprehensive, where he was a champion athlete; his records at high jump, long jump and shotput stood for many years.

On leaving school, he reluctantly declined a place to study veterinary medicine at Liverpool University in order to take up the farming tenancy offered to him on a """"˜now or never"" basis by his great uncle on 130 acres of Swell Hill Farm near Stow-on-the-Wold.

To begin with Young farmed conventionally. His herd of cows were allowed to rear and wean their own calves, with far-reaching welfare benefits, but he grew his prize-winning crops with a full chemical arsenal. His mother suffered debilitating digestive disorders, and this ill-health, along with Young's deep-rooted convictions about animal sentience and welfare, led him to question his approach. Inspired by a chance meeting in the 1970s with the organic pioneer Sam Mayall, he gave up farming on his own and joined the family partnership to farm organically. In 1980, he moved with his parents and sister to Kite's Nest.

Young was a tenacious researcher and campaigner. His ability to trace patterns and connections within his vast agricultural knowledge led him to spend hours searching in literature few would even be aware of, drawing out logical consequences - however far-fetched they might at first seem - and reaching ethical and astute conclusions.

As long-time colleagues and friends, first at the Soil Association and then from 2011 at the Sustainable Food Trust, he and I worked closely to publish a series of reports that challenged conventionally accepted norms. Among his most important campaigns were those on the importance of local abattoirs to organic farming, the health benefits of animal fats in sustainable diets and the hidden environmental and health costs of UK production methods.

In 1994, as the toll on human health of increasing antibiotic resistance was starting to rise, Young, who was then policy director at the Soil Association, launched Europe's first major campaign against the misuse of antibiotics in intensive farming. He correctly predicted that banning antibiotic growth promoters would fail to reduce farm antibiotic use without stricter regulations and improvements in husbandry. More than 25 years later, the EU finally admitted as much and banned all forms of routine farm antibiotic use. Young was also a founder of the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics, which continues to campaign on the issue.

Young's combination of personal modesty, scientific integrity and eloquence eventually attracted international acclaim from both the general public and the scientific community. Always able to back up his claims with meticulous research, he was frequently interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Farming Today and The Food Programme, as well as featuring in the print media and as a much-valued speaker at farming conferences. Yet perhaps the project closest to Richard's heart was a long-nurtured plan for a book on an under-explored aspect of Shakespeare's empathy for the natural world.

During later life, he showed extraordinary dedication in caring for his mother and his research continued unabated. His attention to detail and determination to communicate precisely and correctly meant that it was not unusual to receive an email from him in the early hours, containing a draft honed through multiple revisions. His most recent report, for the Sustainable Food Trust, on the role of grazing animals in sustainable food systems, will be published posthumously.

He will be remembered by his family, friends and colleagues as an extraordinarily brilliant, capable and generous man, whose dedicated companionship and slightly risquÃ© sense of humour will be much missed. He made an immense contribution to the public understanding of the interconnections between truly sustainable farming, love and respect for animals and the improvement of public health.

He is survived by his younger sister, Rosamund, who continues to farm at Kite's Nest.

Richard Young, farmer and campaigner, born 1 August 1950; died 16 September 2023

Investigation involving Guardian shows systematic and vast forest loss linked to cattle farming in Brazil

More than 800m trees have been cut down in the Amazon rainforest in just six years to feed the world's appetite for Brazilian beef, according to a new investigation, despite dire warnings about the forest's importance in fighting the climate crisis.

A data-driven investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ), the Guardian, RepÃ³rter Brasil and Forbidden Stories shows systematic and vast forest loss linked to cattle farming.

The beef industry in Brazil has consistently pledged to avoid farms linked to deforestation. However, the data suggests that 1.7m hectares (4.2m acres) of the Amazon was destroyed near meat plants exporting beef around the world.

The investigation is part of Forbidden Stories' Bruno and Dom project. It continues the work of Bruno Pereira, an Indigenous peoples expert, and Dom Phillips, a journalist who was a longtime contributor to the Guardian""‹""‹. The two men were killed in the Amazon last year.

Deforestation across Brazil soared between 2019 and 2022 under the then president, Jair Bolsonaro, with cattle ranching being the number one cause. The new administration of Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva has promised to curb the destruction.

Researchers at the AidEnvironment consultancy used satellite imagery, livestock movement records and other data to calculate estimated forest loss over six years, between 2017 and 2022 on thousands of ranches near more than 20 slaughterhouses. All the meat plants were owned by Brazil's big three beef operators and exporters - JBS, Marfrig and Minerv""‹a.

To find the farms that were most likely to have supplied each slaughterhouse, the researchers looked at ""buying zones""; areas based on transport connections and other factors, including verification using interviews with plant representatives. All the meat plants exported widely, including to the EU, the UK and China, the world's biggest buyer of Brazilian beef.

The research focused on slaughterhouses in the states of Mato Grosso, ParÃ¡ and RondÃ´nia, important frontiers of deforestation associated with ranching. It is likely the overall figure for deforestation on farms supplying JBS, Marfrig and Minerva is higher, because they run other plants elsewhere in the Amazon.

All three companies say they operate strict compliance procedures, in an open and honest manner, to ensure they are meeting their sustainable goals.

NestlÃ© and the German meat company TÃ¶nnies, which had supplied Lidl and Aldi, were among those to have apparently bought meat from the plants featured in the study. Dozens of wholesale buyers in various EU countries, some of which supply the catering businesses that serve schools and hospitals, also appeared in the list of buyers.

NestlÃ© said two of the meatpackers were not currently part of its supply chain, and added: ""We may scrutinise business relationships with our suppliers who are unwilling or unable to address gaps in compliance with our standards.""

TÃ¶nnies said: ""These Brazilian companies process many thousands of animals per year for export,"" and claimed it was unclear whether the company was the recipient of products from plants linked to deforestation. Lidl and Aldi said they stopped selling Brazilian beef in 2021 and 2022 respectively.

What is the Bruno and Dom project?

What is the Bruno and Dom project?

Bruno Pereira, a Brazilian Indigenous expert and Dom Phillips, a British journalist and longtime Guardian contributor, were killed on the Amazon's ItaquaÃ­ River last June while returning from a reporting trip to the remote Javari Valley region.

The attack prompted international outcry, and cast a spotlight on the growing threat to the Amazon posed by extractive industries, both legal and illegal, such as logging, poaching, mining and cattle ranching.

A year after their deaths, the Guardian has joined 15 other international news organisations in a collaborative investigation into organised crime and resource extraction in the Brazilian Amazon. The initiative has been coordinated by Forbidden Stories, the Paris-based non-profit whose mission is to continue the work of reporters who are threatened, censored or killed.

The goal of the project is to honour and pursue the work of Bruno and Dom, to foreground the importance of the Amazon and its people, and to suggest possible ways to save the Amazon.

Who was Bruno Pereira?

Pereira, 41, was a former employee of the Indigenous agency Funai where he led efforts to protect the isolated and uncontacted tribes who live in the Brazilian Amazon. After being sidelined from his post soon after the far-right president Jair Bolsonaro came to power, Pereira went to work with the Javari Valley Indigenous association Univaja, helping create Indigenous patrol teams to stop illegal poachers, miners and loggers invading their protected lands.

Who was Dom Phillips?

Phillips, 57, was a longtime contributor to the Guardian who had
lived in Brazil for 15 years. A former editor of the dance magazine Mixmag, he developed a deep interest in environmental issues, covering the link between logging, mining, the beef industry and the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. His reporting brought him into contact with Pereira, and in 2018 the pair took part in a 17-day expedition deep into the Javari Valley. In 2021 he took a year off to start writing a book, titled How to Save the Amazon. His return to the Javari was to have been the last reporting trip for the project.

What is the Javari Valley?

Sitting on Brazil's border with Peru and Colombia, the Javari Valley
Indigenous Reservation is a Portugal-sized swathe of rainforest and
rivers which is home to about 6,000 Indigenous people from the Kanamari, Kulina, Korubo, Marubo, Matis, Mayoruna and Tsohom-dyapa groups, as well as 16 isolated groups.

It is also a hotspot for poachers, fishers and illegal loggers,
prompting violent conflicts between the Indigenous inhabitants and the
riverside communities which fiercely opposed the reservation's
creation in 2001. Its strategic location makes it a key route for smuggling cocaine between Peru, Colombia and Brazil.

What happened to Pereira and Philips?

On 2 June 2022, Pereira and Phillips travelled up the ItaquaÃ­ River from the town of Atalaia do Norte to report on efforts to stop illegal fishing. Two days later, members of the Indigenous patrol team with whom Pereira and Phillips were travelling were threatened by an illegal fisher. Early on 5 June, the pair set out on the return leg before dawn, hoping to safely pass a river community that was home to several known poachers. 

They never arrived, and after a search by teams of local Indigenous activists, their remains were discovered on 15 June.

Three fishers are being held in high-security prisons awaiting trial for the killings: brothers Amarildo and Oseney da Costa de Oliveira and a third man, Jefferson da Silva Lima. 

Federal police have alleged that a fourth man, nicknamed Colombia, was the mastermind of the killings.

Some of the meat shipped to the EU could breach new laws designed to combat deforestation in supply chains. Regulations adopted in April mean products brought into the EU cannot be linked to any deforestation that happened after December 2020.

Alex Wijeratna, a senior director at the Mighty Earth advocacy organisation, said: ""The Amazon is very close to a tipping point. So these types of figures are very alarming because the Amazon can't afford to be losing this number of trees ""¦ this has planetary implications.""

The MEP Delara Burkhardt said the findings reinforced the need for greater legislation globally to tackle deforestation: ""The destruction of the Amazon is not only a Brazilian affair. It is also an affair of other parts of the world, like the EU, the UK, or China that import Amazon deforestation. That is why the consumer countries should enact supply chain laws to make sure that the meat they import is produced without inducing deforestation. I hope that the new EU law against imported deforestation will be a blueprint for other major importers like China to follow.""

Aidenvironment found that 13 meat plants owned by JBS were linked to ranches where there had been forest clearance, felling or burning. For Marfrig and Minerva there were six and three plants respectively.""‹

According to a separate Guardian analysis for the Bruno and Dom project, the Amazon slaughterhouses belonging to these companies processed cattle worth more than $5bn (£4bn) while still in Brazil in 2022: more value will be added further along the complex supply chain, and by an overwhelming margin the economic value of this industry is being realised outside Brazil, on dinner plates at restaurants in Beijing and New York. They have repeatedly been criticised for deforestation in their supply chains over the last decade.

Other companies are also known to source cattle from the same buying zones.

In cases where the full beef supply chain could be mapped, the study estimated that since 2017 there had been more than 100 instances of forest loss on farms that directly supplied company plants.

More than 2,000 hectares of forest were apparently destroyed on a single ranch between 2018 and 2021 - SÃ£o Pedro do GuaporÃ© farm, in Pontes e Lacerda, Mato Grosso state - which sold nearly 500 cattle to JBS, though the copany said the farm was ""˜blocked' when its due diligences identified irregularities with them. ""‹ The JBS meat plant that processed these cattle sold beef to the UK and elsewhere in recent years.

The farm was also connected to the indirect supply of more than 18,000 animals across the three meat packers between 2018 and 2019 according to Aidenvironment. All three companies said they were not currently being supplied by the ranch.

More than 250 cases of deforestation were attributable to indirect suppliers - farms that rear or fatten cattle but send them to other ranches before slaughter. (Some farms act as both direct and indirect suppliers.)

Meat companies have long said that monitoring the movements between ranches in their complex supply chains is too difficult. Critics say this allows for ""cattle laundering"", where animals from a ""dirty"" deforesting ranch are trucked to a supposedly ""clean"" farm before slaughter, disguising their origin. A clean farm is one with no history of fines or sanctions for deforestation, even if its owner has carried out deforestation on other ranches.

TBIJ and RepÃ³rter Brasil worked with Dom Phillips and the Guardian to report on an example of cattle laundering in 2020. Then, the team appeared to show that cows from a farm under sanctions for illegal deforestation had been moved in JBS trucks to a second, ""clean"" farm. After the story was published, JBS stopped buying from the owner of both farms.

However, our investigation has found that the owner now supplies Marfrig, another of Brazil's big three meat packers. One of his farms, Estrela do AripuanÃ£, in Mato Grosso state, is still under sanctions but remains part of the international beef supply chain.

Records appear to show that between 2021 and 2022, nearly 500 animals were moved along the exact route that TBIJ investigated in 2020. The cattle ended up at the same ""clean"" second farm, Estrela do Sangue, which has no embargos or other environmental sanctions.

Separate documents appear to show dozens of animals moving from Estrela do Sangue farm to Marfrig's meat plant in TangarÃ¡ da Serra.

Last year, another TBIJ investigation linked the TangarÃ¡ da Serra plant to the invasion of the Menku Indigenous territory in Brasnorte.

According to shipping records, the plant has sold more than £1bn worth of beef products since 2014 to China, Germany, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK.

In a statement, Marfrig confirmed it had received cattle from the owner, saying: ""With every transaction it makes, Marfrig checks the status of the cattle-supplying properties. At the time of slaughter, the farm in question was compliant with Marfrig's socio-environmental criteria, meaning the property was not located in an area with deforestation, embargo, or forced labour, nor in a conservation unit or on Indigenous lands.""

It added: ""Marfrig condemns the practice referred to as ""˜cattle laundering' and any other irregularities. All suppliers approved by the company are regularly checked and must comply with the mandatory socio-environmental criteria described in the company's current policy.""

Minerva said it ""tracks the condition of the ranches, ensuring that cattle purchased by Minerva Foods do not originate from properties with illegally deforested areas; possess environmental embargos or are overlapping with Indigenous lands and/or traditional communities and conservation units.""

JBS queried the ""buying zones"" methodology used in the research, saying it states ""the estimate determines the potential maximum purchase zone and not necessarily the effective purchase zone."" It also said that it blocked the SaÌƒo Pedro do GuaporeÌ farm ""as soon as any irregularity was identified"". When asked, it did not specify the date.

Up to 14 cans of diet drink a day considered safe for 70kg person, as WHO says sweetener is ""˜possibly' carcinogenic in larger amounts

A widely used artificial sweetener deemed a ""possible"" cause of cancer is safe in limited quantities, such as consuming fewer than nine to 14 cans of soft drink a day, experts have said.

The sugar substitute aspartame, used in thousands of products including diet fizzy drinks, ice-cream and chewing gum, was classified as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"" in a report released on Thursday by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).

The IARC has two more serious categories: ""probably carcinogenic to humans"" and ""carcinogenic to humans"".

But the Food and Agricultural Organisation's Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives, which carried out a complementary study, retained its advice that it is safe for a person to consume 0-40mg for every kg of body weight each day.

The WHO said a person weighing 70kg would need to drink more than between nine and 14 cans of diet soft drink a day to exceed the daily guideline.

Dr Francesco Branca, director of the WHO's department of nutrition and food safety, said: ""The assessments of aspartame have indicated that, while safety is not a major concern at the doses which are commonly used, potential effects have been described that need to be investigated by more and better studies.

""We're not advising consumers to stop consuming [aspartame] altogether. We're just advising a bit of moderation.""

Both studies cited ""limited evidence"" and called for more research into the issue. The WHO said it and the IARC would continue to monitor evidence and encourage independent research groups.

Used as an artificial sweetener since the 1980s, aspartame gives a taste 200 times sweeter than sugar for few calories. The chemical is also found in products including some yoghurts, breakfast cereals, toothpastes and medications such as cough drops and chewable vitamins.

Harriet Burt, a senior policy and international projects officer for World Action on Salt, Sugar & Health based at Queen Mary University of London, said the report emphasised the need for a new approach by food and drink manufacturers.

""This new report from the WHO shows that companies need to reduce the overall sweetness of their products rather than relying so much on sweeteners,"" she said. ""When done correctly, reformulation can gradually remove excess sugars, salt and saturated fat from foods to improve their overall healthiness without the need for replacement ingredients such as non-sugar sweeteners.""

She continued: ""Worryingly, sugar consumption in the UK is still double the recommended levels due to a food system that promotes overconsumption of excessively sweet products high in salt and saturated fat. This is why reducing sugar consumption should remain a priority.

""Based on recent WHO reports, it is clear that the UK government urgently needs a comprehensive strategy to reduce not just sugar but overall product sweetness, including the use of non-sugar sweeteners like aspartame.""

Dr Mary Schubauer-Berigan, of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, told the BBC the ""evidence was not of sufficiently high quality or convincing enough"" and that ""this is really more a call to the research community"" to study the sweetener more.

292,"Waiting list for allotments in England almost doubles in 12 years","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/11/waiting-list-for-allotments-in-england-almost-doubles-in-12-years","Waiting list for allotments in England almost doubles in 12 years

There are at least 157,820 outstanding applications to local authorities, and waits of up to 15 years

There are few things so quintessentially English as the allotment, but the number of people waiting for a space of their own has almost doubled in the last 12 years.

The most recent figures, obtained by independent artists and supported by Greenpeace through freedom of information requests, show there are now at least 157,820 applications sitting on English local authorities' allotment waiting lists, up 81% from 12 years ago when researchers found the figure was 86,787.

Campaigners say this rise is due to a combination of high demand and delay in turning over plots that are not being properly used.

In preparation for the launch of a new piece of activist art, researchers found that across Britain, 174,183 applications were sitting on local authority allotment waiting lists. The average waiting time for an allotment was three years, while residents of Islington, north London, faced a 15-year wait.

The local authority with the longest waiting list was Bristol, with 7,630 outstanding applications, followed by Sunderland, Portsmouth, Southampton, Edinburgh and Manchester.

Greenpeace said the numbers of applicants demonstrated a desire among people to find new ways to tackle the intensifying cost of living, climate, nature and health crises.

The tradition of allotment holding in Britain harks back to Anglo-Saxon times when swathes of land were commonly held for growing food, grazing livestock and collecting firewood, before the enclosure acts, over four centuries, where aristocrats fenced off public land for their own use.

The modern system of allotments - named for small patches of land attached to tenant farmers cottages - emerged in the 19th century, and at the beginning of the 20th century the Allotment Act imposed a legal responsibility on local authorities to meet residents' demand for allotments.

A spokesperson for the National Allotment Society (NAS) said the steady increase in demand for allotments had been down to the cost of living crisis, the increased interest in ""growing your own"" during Covid, and better awareness of sustainable growing and healthy eating.

The NAS campaigns to encourage housebuilders to incorporate allotments in new developments and also works with local authorities to ensure existing sites are properly managed. ""Often usable plots stand vacant for periods of time,"" the NAS said. ""Vacancies due to issues with eviction, overgrown plots or lack of access are frustrating for those waiting years to get their hands on a plot.""

Daniela Montalto, a Greenpeace UK forests campaigner, said: ""Allotment waiting lists demonstrate a huge desire from people to be part of the solution to our broken food system but without access to land, the many benefits of community food growing to people, nature and the climate are being stifled.

""The government must support councils to act as well as take seriously its own role in creating systemic and lasting change to the food system. Crucial steps include proper support for farmers to transition to climate-, people- and nature-friendly farming as well as measures to reduce our climate footprint abroad including a ban on imports of soya and other agricultural commodities that drive deforestation in places like Brazil.""

Collaborating with artists JC Niala, Julia Utreras and Sam Skinner, Greenpeace used the data to inform a 30 metre-long work of living art embedded with clusters of seeds and ash from burned portions of the Amazon rainforest. The artwork, which was displayed at the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, on Wednesday morning spelled out the message ""We the 174,183 demand allotments"".

Niala, the lead artist behind the project, said: ""With the acceleration of climate change and the persistence of structural inequality within the UK and globally, food has become both an emblem and an embodiment of the troubles around us.

""Allotments quite literally provide a lifeline for some. They bring good local food back to people and take away the bad taste of the global industrial food system. They improve people's mental health and wellbeing by creating a sense of purpose and increasing opportunities to connect with others as well as spend time in nature.""

The rise of ""˜invasivorism' has introduced a range of unusual eating choices as diners strive for a more ethical diet

It can be grilled like asparagus, mixed into a sweet-sour ripple ice-cream or even turned into a beer. When guests arrive at Silo, a ""zero-waste"" restaurant in east London, next month they'll be treated to a series of dishes from an unlikely source. It is more famous as the scourge of homeowners, but for some, the solution to the Japanese knotweed crisis is to serve it for dinner.

Eating invasive species - called ""invasivorism"" - is increasingly fashionable as people search for ethical diets. In London, at The Ninth in Fitzrovia, three-cornered leek, a milder version of wild garlic, has been whipped into aioli, while at Native in Mayfair it is used alongside asparagus. At Seasonality in Maidenhead you can tuck into muntjac deer tartare, while Edinburgh's The Palmerston uses sika deer extensively.

Also in Edinburgh, chef Paul Wedgwood of Wedgwood the Restaurant has had squirrel on the menu since 2008, most famously in squirrel haggis. ""It's mellow, nutty and a bit gamey, and can be substituted for rabbit,"" says Wedgwood, who occasionally uses Japanese knotweed and three-cornered leek.

Silo is to hold a series of dinners this summer to highlight the issue. Douglas McMaster, the owner and chef of the Hackney Wick restaurant, cut his chops at several Michelin-starred restaurants: London's St John, Heston Blumenthal's the Fat Duck and Noma in Copenhagen.

The events will feature guest chefs including celebrity chef and campaigner Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, who will be challenged to create a menu using Himalayan balsam, and Skye Gyngell of Spring at Somerset House. The first dinner sees chef Matt Orlando, who previously used Japanese knotweed at Amass in Copenhagen, tackling the problematic plant.

Invasive species often wreak havoc on the local environment: according to a 2021 study by Queen's University Belfast they have caused almost £900bn of damage across the globe since the 1960s. American signal crayfish, introduced to Britain in the 1970s, have outcompeted native crayfish and can erode riverbanks. Their flavour is likened to lobster, and they're a prized delicacy in America's deep south. And four of Britain's deer species - sika, Chinese water, muntjac and even fallow - are non-native and a lack of natural predators has allowed their populations - along with native deer - to expand exponentially, harming local fauna.

""Not only is eating invasive species a solution, but we're taking pressure off the food system, saving resources,"" says McMaster. ""Japanese knotweed is incredible, it's like a mix of asparagus and rhubarb."" At Silo it is on the menu year-round, used in more than 20 menu items, made into pickles and ferments and even used in cocktails. In Japan it is considered a delicacy.

Yet in the UK it is hated. Introduced in 1839, it spreads voraciously and outcompetes native plants. Where encountered it must be professionally removed, it is routinely sprayed with glyphosate and can even devalue homes.

Is eating it the answer? ""If we want to be motivated to remove invasive species, the fact they're edible is a pretty good motivation for getting involved,"" says Fearnley-Whittingstall, whose menu features Himalayan balsam, an invasive weed that grows readily on his property.

He insists that the harvesting of the plant be left to experts, as their seeds spread easily. ""I'm thinking of pickling them into Himalayan balsam capers, which is something people do with wild garlic seeds.""

But eating invasive species is not without its critics. As with any wild plant, misidentification is a concern. ""People can become seriously ill from eating plants they misidentify, and often there are edible plants that look very similar to poisonous ones,"" says the Royal Horticultural Society. ""Instead of eating them we would recommend managing their spread with physical or cultural controls."" And for professional forager Adrian Boots, neither Japanese knotweed nor Himalayan balsam offer much in the flavour department, ""though some will try to convince you otherwise,"" he says.

McMaster admits to having difficulties encouraging diners to eat jellyfish, and for all the attempts to make squirrel go mainstream - he has put squirrel kofta and ""Kentucky fried squirrel"" on the menu - there is probably a reason it hasn't caught on.

McMaster does not envisage Japanese knotweed on supermarket shelves, but sees his role as leading the way in sustainable eating. ""˜There's a certain amount of resources on this planet, which we're taking, and we need to restore the balance.""

ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ and ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ relations as strong as ever! pic.twitter.com/V7slOQBSMN

It's now been confirmed that more than 130 prime ministers and presidents today signed the Cop28 UAE Declaration on Sustainable Agriculture, Resilient Food Systems, and Climate Action - the first of its kind commitment to adapt and ""transform"" food systems as part of broader climate action. But, the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems (Ipes-Food), an independent, expert panel on sustainable food systems, points out that the declaration contains no legally binding commitments. And there are no targets or clear steps to tackle key climate-related issues such as the crazy amount of food waste in some countries, the overconsumption of industrially produced meat and processed foods, and the food industry's huge fossil fuel footprint.

Lim Li Ching, co-chair of Ipes-Food and senior researcher for Third World Network said: ""It's encouraging to see that food systems are finally taking their place at the heart of climate negotiations and at the highest levels of government. We cannot meet our global climate goals without urgent action to transform the industrial food system, which is responsible for one-third of greenhouse gas emissions and 15% of fossil fuel use. But while this is an essential first step, the language remains very vague - and specific actions and measurable targets are conspicuously missing.""

Zambia's president, Hakainde Hichilema, has hit back at suggestions that a wave of carbon offsetting deals in African countries by a UAE sheikh, which include his country, are a new ""scramble for Africa"".

Speaking after an EU event on carbon markets alongside Ursula von der Leyen, the Spanish prime minister, Pedro SÃ¡nchez, and the heads of the World Trade Organization (WTO), World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), Hichilema said his country lacked expertise on developing carbon projects and needed international organisations to help.

This year, the rights over vast tracts of African forest have been sold off in a series of huge carbon offsetting deals that cover an area of land larger than the UK to a UAE-based firm called Blue Carbon, with concerns raised about the previous business dealings of the young Dubai royal behind the agreements.

When asked about the secretive Blue Carbon deals, Hichilema said they would benefit local people.

""It shouldn't be [a scramble for Africa's resources]. When someone comes to our country and brings an idea around carbon, we say that we don't understand how to work through this. That is why we have asked the World Bank, the IMF, the WTO, the African Development Bank to put the technical capacity together, learning from what the countries of the north have done,"" he said.

In a speech that lacked specifics, Ursula von der Leyen has said carbon markets and taxation were important for global decarbonisation, including voluntary carbon markets which have been beset by accusations of poor quality by scientific research and journalistic investigations.

The new World Bank president, Ajay Banga, said his organisations would soon be presenting high-quality forestry projects in three countries that, he hoped, would help assuage concerns about lack of environmental integrity in forest carbon projects.

Leaders speeches begin with pleas on Palestine and Pacific islands

Hello, Helena Horton here, an environment reporter here at the Guardian and I'll be blogging throughout the rest of the day. The leaders have started speaking. Here are a few highlights.

We are starting with some monarchs - the UK's King Charles spoke earlier.

Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein, the king of Jordan linked the climate emergency to the war happening in Gaza. He said:

""As we speak the Palestinian people are facing an immediate threat to their lives and well being. Tens of thousands have been injured or killed in a region already on the frontline of climate change. The massive destruction of water makes the environmental threats of water scarcity and food insecurity more severe.""

He added that people there are living without clean water and with a bare minimum of food supplies and points out that climate change exacerbates the destructive nature of war.

The monarch asked for more aid to be sent to the most vulnerable and pointed out that Jordan does not contribute significantly to climate breakdown but is greatly affected, with water scarcity a real threat.

Tupou VI, the King of Tonga said it was ""painful"" for small developing island states to see that Cop28 ""may not be the milestone moment we were all hoping for"" and that progress on the Paris agreement had been far too slow.

Every year, we hear anguished pleas from those representing small island states who are literally sinking under the water due to climate breakdown. Unsurprisingly they have felt ignored as large, wealthy countries continue to belch out fossil fuels. Tupou said that over 50,000 Pacific island people were displaced every year as their homes are lost as a result of climate breakdown. He told the conference: ""We are ocean people, the ocean is our lifeblood, it feeds us, is our mode of transportation and is a deep part of our culture.""

Summary

It has been a busy morning with big name politicians from around the globe arriving for day two of Cop28.

King Charles addressed delegates telling them ""I pray with all my heart that Cop28 will be [a] critical turning point towards genuine transformational action.""

The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, arrived for a flying visit but his decision to push ahead with new oil and gas drilling in the North Sea and rowing back on key climate measures has not got down well.

A new declaration on transforming food systems has been agreed, the first Cop resolution which directly tackles the relationship between what we eat and the changing climate.

Kamala Harris, the US vice-president, was due to arrive with a cadre of administration officials, including Tony Blinken, the US secretary of state, and Michael Regan, administrator of the EPA.

My colleague Helena Horton is taking over the blog now as leaders begin their addresses to conference

Some reaction to the new declaration on food that my colleague Nina Lakhani reported on earlier.

Tom Mitchell, executive director of the International Institute for Environment and Development, said:

""This agreement is a tentative first step in addressing one of the thorniest problems of the climate crisis - our broken food systems. They are responsible for so many greenhouse gas emissions, from cutting down forests and clearing land for animal feed, to the emissions of cattle themselves. It's staggering there has been no obligation to include this sector in emissions reductions plans for so long.

""Government subsidies have long supported the polluting effects of large scale agriculture, acting as a hidden brake on climate action. These payments should be redirected in a way that means people and nature can thrive.""

Patty Fong, from the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, said:

""The declaration doesn't set out how governments will tackle food emissions, and makes no reference to fossil fuels, despite food systems accounting for at least 15% of fossil fuels burned each year -equivalent to the emissions of all EU countries and Russia combined. This is a glaring omission.

""However, the commitment to integrate food and farming into domestic climate action plans is welcome and long overdue. Over 70% of countries' nationally determined contributions lack adequate action on food systems - updating them is where there is real potential to tackle emissions and unlock climate finance.

""Our more than two dozen philanthropic members and other partners around the world are working to catalyse much-needed food system transformation that can help to phase out dependency on polluting fossil fuels in the sector while improving health, community wellbeing, and biodiversity.""

Some photographs from today at Cop28

A quick analysis shows that while women and girls bear the brunt of the climate crisis, only 15 out of the 133 world leaders participating in this year's Cop28 are women.

Last year, seven out of the 110 world leaders attending Cop27 were women. So although there has been a welcome increase since last year, at 11%, women are still significantly underrepresented.

Helen Pankhurst, senior adviser on gender equality at Care International UK said: ""Yet again, the red carpet is being rolled out for male leaders at Cop and men dominate among the senior negotiators. How are we going to achieve a fair outcome in climate negotiations with such inequity at the top? Women and girls are the most affected by climate change, yet they are silenced. Invisible. This must change.""

More from Nina Lakhani on the new food declaration

While far from perfect, the groundbreaking declaration was widely welcomed by small-scale and Indigenous farmers - who produce a third of the world's food - as well as right to food campaigners, consumer associations and small business groups.

""The destruction of nature and climate change threatens food security, rural livelihoods and nutrition, but our food systems also cause a third of global emissions and are a primary driver of wildlife loss. It's about time the Cops put them on the main menu,"" said Hilal Elver, a former UN special rapporteur on the right to food. ""Food and agriculture must be at the heart of new climate plans and funding if we are to meet the Paris agreement and have enough nutritious food for everyone.""

Esther Penunia, secretary-general of the Asian Farmers' Association for Sustainable Development, a regional alliance representing 13 million family farmers, said: ""The declaration is a major milestone on the road towards a more resilient and sustainable food system. Governments need to work with family farmers networks to ensure these promises are translated into the concrete policies and funding needed to support small-scale producers and promote a shift to more diverse and nature friendly farming, which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says is needed to safeguard food security.""

Other commitments include a pledge to accelerate and scale science and evidence-based innovations - including local and Indigenous knowledge - which increase sustainable agriculture, promote ecosystem resilience and improve livelihoods, including for rural communities, smallholders, family farmers and other producers.

It's been a long time coming but finally, world leaders seem to be catching on to the fact that achieving the long-term goals of the Paris agreement will be impossible without transforming agriculture and food systems. Progress on this is a key area to watch, especially given the power and influence of the meat, dairy and industrialized farming conglomerates.

World leaders have signed a declaration on transforming food systems - the first ever Cop resolution which directly tackles the symbiotic relationship between what we eat and the changing climate. The resolution recognises that ""unprecedented adverse climate impacts are increasingly threatening the resilience of agriculture and food systems as well as the ability of many, especially the most vulnerable, to produce and access food in the face of mounting hunger, malnutrition, and economic stresses ""¦ [we recognise] the profound potential of agriculture and food systems to drive powerful and innovative responses to climate change and to unlock shared prosperity for all.""

The 100+ countries to sign the declaration on sustainable agriculture, resilient food systems and climate action have committed to including food and land use in their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and national adaptation plans by Cop30 in 2025.


Globally, food systems account for about one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions, with the vast majority coming from industrialised farming, particularly livestock and fertilisers. The climate crisis is already impacting agriculture and food security, as extreme weather events like floods, droughts, heatwaves and wildfires - and slow-onset impacts like sea level rise and desertification - fuel high prices and food shortages in countries across the world.

Kelp absorbs carbon dioxide and has high nutritional value, but it is under threat from rising temperatures, pollution and invasive species

Bubbles stream furiously behind Frank Hurd as he gently parts the curtains of giant kelp. Green and gold ribbons reach upwards through the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean towards the sun.

Hurd, a marine biologist with environmental organisation the Nature Conservancy, is diving in a kelp forest off Anacapa Island, one of the protected rocky volcanic islets that form the Channel Islands national park, an archipelago off the coast of southern California.

This thick, healthy kelp - a type of seaweed - forms a small part of underwater forests that blanket the coastline of nearly every continent. Some are relatively well-studied, including the Great African Sea Forest, a rich stretch of giant bamboo kelp spreading north from Cape Town to the Namibian coastline that was the setting for the film My Octopus Teacher; and the Great Southern Reef, a giant kelp forest hugging Australia's southern coastline. But many more of these forests are unnamed and unknown - hidden underwater.

Despite being one of the fastest growing plants on Earth, kelp has historically been difficult to map because of the difficulties of measuring ocean depths with satellites. However, research published in September found that seaweed forests are far more extensive than previously realised.

An international group of scientists from eight countries, led by Dr Albert Pessarrodona from the University of Western Australia, manually sifted through hundreds of studies - including local plant data records, online repositories and citizen science initiatives - to model the global distribution of ocean forests. They found that underwater forests cover between 6m and 7.2m sq km - an area comparable to the Amazon rainforest basin and twice the size of India.

Seaweed forests can act as a vital buffer against the climate crisis, absorbing carbon dioxide from seawater and the atmosphere. Ocean forests may store as much carbon as the Amazon rainforest, according to one analysis.

Yet there is still a sizeable gap in understanding of seaweed's long-term ability to sequester carbon, because it lacks a root system to lock the carbon into the ground, unlike other marine plants such as mangroves and seagrass. Whether carbon stays locked up also depends on what happens to the seaweed, and there is still scientific debate on how effective it is at storing the element.

Marine ecologist Dr Karen Filbee-Dexter, one of the study's 10 authors, said the research was a ""major step forward"" in understanding the potential role that seaweed can play in mitigating climate breakdown, ""because it calculates the productivity - growth and carbon uptake - of the largest marine vegetated ecosystem"". It can also help estimate the carbon-sink potential of the world's marine forests, she added.

Kelp, the largest seaweed species, able to grow tens of metres high, also plays a vital role in marine ecosystems, providing food and shelter for fish, other marine animals and birds.

In Australia, native kelp is home to the weedy seadragon - a purple-hued creature with leaf-like appendages that look like kelp fronds - which only lives along the country's coastline. Kelp forests along North America's Pacific coast provide vital habitats for southern sea otters. In addition, the mighty grey whale uses kelp forests as a haven from predatory killer whales and as vital feeding grounds for their young during their migration to Alaska waters from Baja California in Mexico.

Underwater forests could also have a role in efforts to alleviate the world's food security crisis, thanks to their rapid growth.

The scientists examined hundreds of individual studies from around the world where seaweed growth had been measured by scuba divers. ""We found ocean forests are more productive than many intensely farmed crops such as wheat, rice and corn,"" the study noted. It defined productivity in terms of how much biomass - the fronds, stipes and holdfasts of the seaweed - was produced by crops and seaweed.

On average, ocean forests in temperate regions, such as Australia's southern coast, produced between two and 11 times more biomass by area than intensely farmed crops, a productivity that could be harnessed for the food system.

Seaweed has been mass-consumed in Asia for centuries, and now western markets are catching on, albeit on a small scale, with more European and North American companies manufacturing seaweed products for human consumption. The Cornish Seaweed Company has a seaweed salad range; Marks & Spencer has a ""coconut seaweed crunch"" snack, and there are numerous lines of kelp burgers.

""Although there is evidence of seaweed being consumed as food 14,500 years ago, it has not been a part of the diet for large swaths of the world's population,"" says marine biologist Amanda Swinimer, who has been wild harvesting seaweed for decades through her company, Dakini Tidal Wilds.

However, she adds, as food security becomes more of an issue, ""people are looking for other sources of nutritious food. If harvested properly, seaweeds have the potential to be a very sustainable and nutrient-dense food source."" Seaweed is also being used as animal feed, in place of corn and soya beans, thanks to its high nutritional value.

Yet these underwater forests face multiple threats, including rising sea temperatures, pollution and invasive species. Along the northern California coast, kelp has declined by more than 95% over the past several years, decimated by sea urchins - whose population has exploded as vast numbers of starfish, their main predators, have been killed by a wasting disease linked to warming waters.

The Great Southern Reef along Australia's coastline, and forests in the north-west Atlantic, along the coasts of Maine, Canada and Greenland, are also showing concerning signs of decline.

Seaweed forests are often overlooked and less studied compared with coral reefs, making it difficult to understand how they are changing. ""Most of the world's seaweed forests are not even mapped, much less monitored,"" says Filbee-Dexter. While corals are found in warm, calm and easily accessible areas, making them fairly easy to study, kelp is in cold waters on some of the choppiest, roughest coasts in the world.

Filbee-Dexter believes that the more scientists understand about these vital but fragile marine ecosystems, the easier it will be to help them survive. ""I hope that more awareness about these forests will lead to more protection and restoration.""

In California, Hurd continues to dive among the kelp forests, monitoring their progress and hoping their decline can be stemmed. ""The loss of these incredibly productive ecosystems is devastating for both nature and people,"" he says. However, as science continues to develop smarter technologies to track kelp, such as drones, satellites and AI, he remains hopeful that research can shed light on the role of kelp in fighting climate breakdown.

""The one thing that kelp in particular should never be underestimated for is the productivity and biodiversity it supports around the world. It should be protected and restored with a great sense of urgency.""

Here are some more highlights from the leaders' speeches, by Bibi van der Zee and I.

Wavel John Charles Ramkalawan, president of the Seychelles, said he was disheartened that so many financial commitments on climate change were yet to be fulfilled despite the urgency of the crisis.

""Small island developing states are on the frontline of climate change,"" he told the summit. They urgently need money to deal with the coastal erosion they are seeing. ""We made history by operationalising the loss and damage fund on the first day of this Cop ""¦ It is vital that this fund is equitable and genuinely helpful."" The Seychelles is an environmental champion which already protects 32% of its marine land, but it is categorised as a high-income country, and Ramkalawan is extremely concerned that this will affect their ability to access LAD funding.

Turkey's Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan was another leader who made comparisons between the war in Gaza and the climate crisis. He said: ""Turkey has stood by peace during all these crises and works towards finding solutions on the basis of equity. We approach the issue of climate change from the same perspective."" He pointed out that Turkey is the second in Europe and ninth in the world for hydro energy. He said despite the devastating earthquake in February they are managing to keep on track for their goals and are ""healing the wounds"" of the disaster while building ""climate and environment friendly"" structures.

Zuzana ÄŒaputovÃ¡, president of Slovakia, asked the summit: ""How much more do we want to harm future generations?"" Her country's emissions have peaked already, and are 55% lower than they were in 1980. They plan to use 5% of GDP from public sources to decarbonise their country and by the end of this year will stop using coal to generate electricity.

Steven Guilbeault, Canada's environment minister, has said the loss and damage fund should help rebuild trust between the global north and south after years of tense negotiations.

Earlier today, Canada committed US$11.8m to the new fund, which will be housed within the World Bank. Guilbeault also said his country was happy to support language on reducing fossil fuels that was consistent with Canada's 2050 carbon neutrality target.

""It is significant. For 30 years, we made absolutely no progress on loss and damage. We went from nothing about a year ago to a fund and countries pledging money today. I think for the global south, this is a very significant issue. Between that and the $100bn dollar goal, I think these are very important elements that will help restore trust. Trust is the fuel of this process. I think it bodes well for the next two weeks,"" he said.

""It's not a recognition that we are willing to take on liability from the results of climate change. But as large emitters, we have a role to play. We have a greater role to play in supporting the global south.""

When asked whether Canada supports language to phase out all fossil fuels, a key point of contention at the Cop28 summit, Guilbeault said his country was open to different forms of language in the final text and underscored that fossil fuel production would have to drop.

""We support language that's aligned with our commitment to be carbon neutral by 2050. Whether you want to call it phasing out unabated fossil fuels or say it in a different way. Some people would like us to say we want to phase out all fossil fuels but even the IPCC and the IEA still say in a 2050 carbon neutral world that we will still be using fossil fuels,"" he said.

""I don't know how realistic it is to say we will phase them all out but what's important is that we radically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. And for those that we are using, we need to capture and sequester the emissions. We don't have a choice. But we need to see significant emission reduction from the oil and gas centre. We can't do that through abatement technology. There is going to be a reduction in production,"" he said.

Veteran climate reporter Roger Harrabin, who used to work for the BBC and is now freelance - sometimes writing for the Guardian - points out that only political journalists, not environmental specialists, have been allowed into an event with Rishi Sunak. Harrabin says he was ""kicked out"".

I've just been kicked out of this ""˜private event' - a lobby conference with @rishisunak about to start. I've been reporting on climate for 35 years so it's possible I know more than most Pollcorrs. That's why the environment corrs are left outside. â¦@fionaharveyâ© â¦ pic.twitter.com/IZ4aNBPBfh

We have a brilliant reporter in there and will bring you the news from his press conference, but it is true that this government often hides from scrutiny and one of the ways it does that is by barring specialist reporters from its briefings.

Our environment editor, Fiona Harvey, has also reported troubles in accessing press conferences at the summit.

Journalists being told we can't access the main press conference room #Cop28 without special tickets. And an escort. Security won't let us through. This is absurd. Not transparent and very not helpful.

The leader's speeches continue. Here are some updates from myself and one of my editors, Bibi van der Zee, who is also listening in.

Santiago PeÃ±a, president of Paraguay, said: ""In my country of Paraguay all energy is clean and renewable. Yes you heard that, it is all clean and renewable.""

He's right - the Itaipu Dam, located on the ParanÃ¡ River, is one of the largest hydroelectric power plants in the world and generates about 95% of Paraguay's electricity, all of which comes from renewable sources.

He also pointed out that 44% of their land surface is forest, and asked China to allow Taiwan to be included in the Cop process - the small country is currently barred at the instruction of the Chinese government.

Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, the president of Kazakhstan, has pledged to join the global methane pledge. He says there is extraordinary potential for wind and solar in his country - a key oil exporter - and also points out that Kazakhstan is poised to become a major source of rare earth minerals. Tokayev is planning to convene a regional climate summit in 2024 under UN auspices.

President of Serbia, Aleksandar VuÄiÄ‡, said that temperatures in his country have increased by 1.8C already. Serbians experienced uncomfortable ""tropical nights"" over 20C degrees celcius for the first time this October, which he said was ""unprecedented for the region"".

Abdul Latif Rashid, president of Iraq, drew on the history of the region, pointing out that his predecessors in Mesopotamia, 4,500 years ago, drew up the first agreement for sharing water resources, and warned the summit that the famous rivers of Iraq were now under threat from drought linked to climate change. ""The drought in the south of Iraq, the record level temperatures, desertification, and sand storms have led to economic challenges that resulted in a larger level of poverty and internal displacement."" He urged the gulf countries to act as a unified bloc, and condemned the aggressive attack on Gaza.

""˜Planetary emergency': droughts, the deadliest of disasters

Droughts supercharged by global heating are ""an unprecedented emergency on a planetary scale"", according to a UN report released on Friday at Cop28, leading to food shortages and famine.

While other climate impacts such as heatwaves, wildfires and floods often hit the headlines, droughts are often silent disasters, the report said, and ""the massive impacts of human-induced droughts are only starting to unfold"".

The report is from the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), which is an international agreement on good land stewardship. It says ""few if any hazards claim more lives, causes more economic loss and affects more sectors of societies than drought"".

Ibrahim Thiaw, UNCCD executive secretary, said: ""Unlike other disasters, droughts happen silently, often going unnoticed and failing to provoke an immediate public and political response. This silent devastation perpetuates a cycle of neglect, leaving affected populations to bear the burden in isolation.""

""With the frequency and severity of drought events increasing, as reservoir levels dwindle and crop yields decline, as we continue to lose biological diversity and famines spread, transformational change is needed,"" he said.

Extreme droughts that have wrecked the lives of millions of people in Syria, Iraq and Iran since 2020 would not have happened without human-caused global heating, a recent study found. The climate crisis also made the record drought across the northern hemisphere in summer 2022 at least 20 times more likely, scientists have calculated. Without human-caused global heating, the event would have been expected only once every four centuries.

""Several countries already experience climate-change-induced famine,"" said the UNCD report. ""Forced migration surges globally; violent water conflicts are on the rise; the ecological base that enables all life on Earth is eroding more quickly than at any time in known human history.""

The report cited a string of scientific findings:

120 million people are people expected to experience extreme drought even if global temperatures are restricted to 1.5C. Current policies are on track for 3C of heating, meaning extreme drought for 170 million people

In China, 15-20% of the population face more frequent moderate-to-severe droughts this century

1.2 million people in the Central American dry corridor are in need of food aid after five years of drought, heatwaves and unpredictable rainfall the drought in the La Plata basin of Brazil and Argentina in 2022 was the worst in 78 years, reducing crop production and affecting global markets

The report notes that those who have done the least to cause the climate crisis are most exposed: 85% of those affected by droughts live in low- or middle-income countries.

The report said better farming techniques, such as drought-resistant crops, efficient irrigation methods, no-till farming, can reduce the impact of drought on farmers' crops and incomes. The International Drought Resilience Alliance, which was launched at Cop27, by the leaders of Spain and Senegal at Cop27, is creating political momentum and mobilising money and technology for a drought-resilient future and now has 34 member nations.

Brazil's Lula: 'it is not possible to face climate change without combating inequality'

The President of Brazil, Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, said his country was leading by example: ""We have adjusted our climate goals, which are now more ambitious than those of many developed countries. We have drastically reduced deforestation in the Amazon and will bring it to zero by 2030,"" he said.

Lula, as he is best known, called for developed countries to invest more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to support developing nations who are suffering from climate impacts.

""The planet is fed up with unfulfilled climate agreements. Governments cannot escape their responsibilities. No country will solve its problems alone. We are all obliged to act together beyond our borders"", he argued.

He told delegates that the trillions of dollars spent on weapons should be used against hunger, inequality and climate change: ""The world has naturalised unacceptable disparities in income, gender and race and that it is not possible to face climate change without combating inequality.""

He spoke of climate suffering in the Amazon, which is experiencing one of the ""most tragic droughts in its history"" while cyclones in the south of Brazil have left a trail ""of destruction and death"".

Although his energy minister announced yesterday that Brazil will align more closely with the world's biggest oil syndicate, Opec, Lula said it was necessary to ""work for an economy less dependent on fossil fuels.""

As an aside, we have reported on this inequality in our series The Great Carbon Divide.

A royal observation that may have gone unnoticed but over in Greece is causing waves of excitement.

King Charles's address has been well received in Athens and not only for his dramatic call for climate action to save the planet for future generations. The Greek media has noted with a touch of euphoria that the British monarch was donning a Greek-motif tie and breast pocket handkerchief - signalling (or so it has been interpreted) his support for the return to Athens of the Parthenon marbles in the wake of this week's row over the antiquities.

Charles, who regularly holidays in Greece, the country of his father's birth, has frequently spoken of his great love and passion for all things Hellenic. The king cannot publicly take a stance in the centuries-long row over whether the 2,500-year-old sculptures are better exhibited in the Duveen gallery of the British Museum or the Parthenon gallery of the Acropolis Museum beneath the fifth-century BC temple but in this instance his sartorial choice, say Greeks, appears a little more than symbolic.

World leaders are using their Cop speeches to push other political points.

Gitanas NausÄ—da, president of Lithuania, said the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has committed ""ecocide"" in his war against Ukraine and should not be about to get away with it.

Emmerson Mnangagwa, the president of Zimbabwe, said ""economic sanctions placed on our country are hindering climate action"". He demanded the lifting of what he described as the ""heinous sanctions"". These sanctions were put in place by the US, UK and EU in 2022 because of human rights violations such as murdering protesters, and not respecting democracy and the rule of law.

Ursula von der Leyen calls for world to follow EU with carbon pricing

Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, had a focus on ""loss and damage"" in her speech. She said:

At this Cop we will set a decisive step forward to protect the most vulnerable citizens worldwide. They suffer loss and damage and we will stand by their side.

She added: ""Global emissions must peak by 2025, we must phase out fossil fuels and we must reduce methane emissions""

Von der Leyen said the EU would contribute to the new loss and damage fund, and that they've pledged more than £270m so far. ""We must get the fund up and running and we must do it fast,"" she added.

In terms of private finance, she said: ""We need to reform the international financial system, we need more carbon pricing.""

William Ruto, the president of Kenya, said that his region was already facing the horrific effects of climate breakdown.

""In eastern Africa, catastrophic flooding has followed the most severe drought the region has seen in over 40 years,"" he said, adding that studies indicated droughts were now more than 100 times more likely in parts of Africa than in the pre-industrial era.

The extreme weather this year has ""seized lives and destroyed communities"" as well as destroying infrastructure and supply chains.

He added that the world needs to invest in green energy and other infrastructure in Africa. ""A tendency to ignore Africa's developmental and industrial needs ""¦ is no longer a tenable position. Turning Africa into a green powerhouse is not just essential for the continent, it is also vital for global industrialisation, decarbonisation.""

Scientists identify parts of ocean suitable for seaweed cultivation and suggest it could constitute 10% of human diet to reduce impact of agriculture

An area of ocean almost the size of Australia could support commercial seaweed farming around the world, providing food for humans, feed supplements for cattle, and alternative fuels, according to new research.

Seaweed farming is a nascent industry globally but the research says if it could grow to constitute 10% of human diets by 2050 it could reduce the amount of land needed for food by 110m hectares (272m acres) - an area twice the size of France.

But the authors of the research said there are a range of potential negative impacts on marine life that will need to be balanced with the benefits of a global seaweed farming industry.

The study looked at 34 seaweed species and where they could feasibly grow and then narrowed this down to places with calm enough waters and close enough to populations where farms could be established.

About 650m hectares (1,606m acres) was identified as plausible for seaweed farming, with the largest areas in Indonesia and Australia which both have large ocean regions under their economic control.

""Cultivating seaweeds for food, feed and fuel within even a fraction of the 650m hectares of suitable ocean could have profound benefits to land use, emissions reduction, water and fertiliser use,"" the authors wrote.

Scott Spillias, a researcher at the University of Queensland in Australia who led the study published in Nature Sustainability, said: ""People around the world are looking at the ocean as this big ""˜untapped' resource and asking if we should be using more of it.""

One of the biggest benefits, the study said, would be the cultivation and use of red Asparagopsis as a cattle feed supplement that has been shown to result in drastically lower methane emissions from cows. One supplement based on the seaweed reportedly went on commercial sale to farmers in Australia last year.

The study suggested cuts to methane emissions from using Asparagopsis could save 2.6bn tonnes of CO2-equivalent a year by 2050 - about the same as the current greenhouse gas footprint of India.

Spillias said introducing more seaweed into human diets could also deliver benefits. In parts of Asia, seaweed makes up 2% of diets, but scaling this up to 10% globally could spare 110m hectares of land currently used for growing food.

""Basically this is just people eating more vegetables,"" he said. ""If we grow seaweed, the best thing to do is for people to eat it rather than feed it to livestock, but that's going to need some big cultural shifts.""

after newsletter promotion

The nine authors, from Australia and Austria, said more work is needed to understand the costs and benefits of any boom in seaweed farming, but ""the magnitude of potential benefits supports the notion that seaweed farming in the ocean can play a pivotal role in our response to global sustainability challenges.""

A review in 2019 of the risks of expanding seaweed farming in Europe highlighted concerns farms could upset the balance of marine ecosystems and could alter the way water around coastlines moves.

""Converting even a few million hectares means a huge amount of development,"" Spillias said. ""We are modifying habitats and introducing materials to places where we haven't before.

""A lot of seaweed farming now is using plastic ropes and nets and we know the impacts of plastic on the ocean. If this is done on a large scale we need to find better materials.""

He said if there was a widescale push globally for seaweed farming, there could be social implications.

""Marine industries do not have a great reputation on human rights and if we're farming seaweed largely out of sight, then we need to think of the people in these industries and make sure they're being fairly treated,"" he said.

Plans for the world's first commercial octopus farm are well advanced - just as science discovers more about this curious, intelligent and affectionate animal. Can it be done ethically?

The sterile boardroom, much of it taken up by a lengthy white table, is at the heart of the sprawling building in northern Spain. The corporate chatter that fills this room these days, however, is dominated by the scene playing out one floor below, where about 50 adult male octopuses are in a tank the size of a budget hotel room.

A handful of the octopuses - the fifth generation to be born in this Spanish multinational's concrete-and-glass office and research centre - skim through the shallow waters, some brushing up against each other while others tuck into the tank's barren corners. A low-intensity light casts a pale glow as researchers lay the groundwork for one of the world's most controversial endeavours: the first commercial octopus farm.

""From a scientific point of view, this project is a global milestone,"" says Roberto Romero PÃ©rez, a marine biologist who oversees aquaculture at Grupo Nueva Pescanova. ""The truth is that we're finding the mood to be a bit more hostile than expected.""

The company's vision for a farm that could eventually provide up to 3,000 tons of octopus meat a year - requiring the slaughter of about 1 million Octopus vulgaris - came into public view in 2021 when it applied for permits. The planned farm has since become an international flashpoint, pitting the company and other proponents of octopus farming against those who argue that the solitary, intelligent animals are ill-suited to being farmed.

From Mumbai to Mexico City, protesters have mobilised, adding their voice to the more than 100 academics who contend that farming a carnivorous animal known to be curious, affectionate and exploratory would be unethical and environmentally unsustainable. Others have sought to crackdown on the sector before it gets started; lawmakers in the US state of Washington are mulling a ban on octopus farming while an online petition calling for a global ban has received nearly 1m signatures.

At the heart of the debate is the question of whether octopuses should be subject to the long-documented mistakes seen in the factory farming of animals such as pigs, says Jennifer Jacquet, a visiting professor of environmental science and policy at the University of Miami.

""We're not having the conversation of should we eat octopus or not, we're simply at a crossroads where we can decide whether or not to put octopus into mass production. Do we need to do this? It's really a luxury good. It's not for survival,"" says Jacquet. ""This is a symbol of what humans should not be doing in the 21st century.""

Long consumed across the Mediterranean and parts of Asia, as well as Mexico, octopus meat has been growing in popularity globally, as the world's wealthiest populations embrace octopus-laden sushi, poke and tapas. Much of the demand has so far been met by wild stocks: between 1950 and 2015 the catch of wild octopuses increased more than tenfold to an estimated 400,000 tons.

While proponents of octopus farming argue that it could help alleviate pressure on wild stocks, there's little precedent to suggest this will happen, says Jacquet. A 2019 study that delved into more than four decades of data from around the world suggested that, overall, increases in aquaculture did not result in fewer wild fish being caught. Instead, researchers found that aquaculture may be contributing to increased demand for seafood.

The decades-long push to farm octopus has played out in parallel with a growing interest in octopus research, offering a deeper understanding of an animal once described as ""probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien"".

The octopus has long been celebrated for its inquisitive nature, penchant for daring escapes and ability to transform the colour and texture of its skin to mimic its surroundings. A recent report by the London School of Economics found ""very strong evidence of sentience"" in octopods.

The finding - which suggests octopuses are capable of experiencing pain and distress - was based on a review of more than 300 scientific studies, including one that found injured octopuses protect a wound by wrapping an arm around it and another that suggested that injured octopuses, if given the opportunity, will self-medicate by seeking out pain relievers.

""Just because an animal has been deemed sentient, doesn't mean we can't farm them,"" says Alex Schnell, a comparative psychologist who was part of the review. ""But there are certain practices that need to be put in place to be able to farm a sentient animal.""

Currently, there are no EU rules that protect farmed octopuses, as the existing animal welfare legislation doesn't apply to invertebrates. The kinds of protections that would be needed to farm octopus - a soft-bodied animal that can be easily hurt by tank collisions or if handled roughly and that requires a mentally stimulating environment - led Schnell and the other members of the research team to conclude that ""high-welfare octopus farming is impossible"".

When placed in close quarters, octopus can become aggressive or territorial, says Schnell. ""In my 15 years of experience, I've never encountered a facility that groups octopuses together without incidents of aggression or escape,"" she says. ""Cannibalism commonly occurs when octopuses are housed together. Stress from overcrowding or non-ideal living conditions can lead to self-cannibalism, where they eat their own arms.""

Inside a secured area at Grupo Nueva Pescanova's research facility in Galicia, nine tanks filled with dozens of Octopus vulgaris, the common octopus, sit side by side. About 15 biologists spend their days here, testing how slight variations in light levels, nutrition and other conditions affect them.

Researchers lift the thick, black plastic curtains that shroud three of the tanks, offering a glimpse into a darkened space containing around 40 spawning females and another tank that is home to a handful of elderly octopuses who researchers suspect are on their last days.

What the company is keen to show me, however, is the 16 sq metre tank where 50 or so adult octopuses, many of them weighing as much as 3kg, are grouped together.

""We're not observing any territoriality, or cannibalism, or attacks, or anything like this. Why? Because the conditions are just right,"" says Romero PÃ©rez, citing parameters from water temperature to the lack of predators and ready availability of food. ""So our animals, which is a bit of what most people don't understand, are in very good condition. They are in a situation that nobody has seen them in before. Nobody.""

For this age group, the aim is to gradually increase the size of the tank - the current water depth is slightly less than one metre - and number of animals, says Romero PÃ©rez. ""The aim is to increase the density in order to make it economically profitable.""

While reports suggest that the density could eventually climb to between 10 and 15 animals per cubic metre, he says the exact figure is still being worked out. ""We say that the density will be optimal for the animal to be well,"" he says. ""We don't know what density we can get to. We're starting low, then we'll see how we manage it.""

Romero PÃ©rez describes the project as being in an ""experimentation"" phase, as researchers gather data that will guide the plans for the farm. The company eventually envisions a facility where the animals would be divided into about 1,000 tanks based on life phases, with the conditions tailored to promote growth in each phase. ""It's not the density that is important, but rather the conditions,"" says Romero PÃ©rez, who denies the allegations that the animals would at times be subject to constant light. ""It won't be 24 hours,"" he says. ""Different ages have different light requirements, in terms of daylight hours, light intensity and wavelengths.""

Pablo GarcÃ­a, one of the centre's octopus researchers, points to the facility's tanks, which bear more resemblance to a children's pool shrouded in black plastic than the fortified glass structures of aquariums. ""Other researchers have told us that if this were their animals, they would have octopuses trying to climb out in the corner, turning up in the hallways or dead out of the water. But here there's no problems,"" he says. ""For them this would already be cannibalistic fodder, they're almost afraid to group two or three octopuses together.""

The difference, he suggests, is that these are not wild octopus but rather the fifth generation bred in captivity at the centre. ""There's been an indirect selection process here,"" he says. ""That wasn't the goal, but in the end you end up with the ones that are best suited to the conditions ""¦ The first generation had a different type of behaviour but this has evolved very positively.""

Save for a few large tubes for egg deposits in the females' tank, the spaces are void of any kind of cognitive stimulus. ""At the beginning we had nooks and crannies, parts of tubes or rocks for them because we were going with what was known,"" says Romero PÃ©rez. ""Little by little we pulled them out as we realised they weren't needed. What's important is the temperatures, the oxygen levels, the PH, the light.""

The company's observation flies in the face of what is known about Octopus vulgaris, argues Jennifer Mather, a professor at University of Lethbridge, in Alberta, Canada, who served as the scientific adviser on the Oscar-winning film My Octopus Teacher. ""If they have somehow or another managed to selectively breed calm octopuses, where's their data?"" she asks.

Octopuses' proclivity for brazen escapes have been well documented: from Inky the octopus's four-metre dash across an aquarium floor and shimmy down a 50-metre drainpipe in 2016 to the century-old story of the octopus at the Brighton aquarium renowned for sneaking out of his tank in the dead of night to feast on lumpfish.

Octopuses are known for having strong personalities with huge differences between individuals, says Mather - and Octopus vulgaris is no exception. ""I found vulgaris to be an up-and-at-'em species. Really active, really exploratory, really likely to escape,"" she says. ""In some ways the most interesting of octopuses. On the other hand, invariably the least likely to tolerate the kind of crap we're going to do to them.""

A global cohort of companies has for decades been working to unlock the mystery of how to raise octopus in captivity, hoping to cash in on the ballooning trade of an animal that grows quickly and has a high reproductive rate.

Nueva Pescanova - a pioneer in aquaculture, with shrimp and turbot farms that span a surface area of more than 10,000 football fields - pulled into the lead in 2019 after it announced that it had managed to replicate the life cycle of Octopus vulgaris in captivity.

Two years later it began soliciting licences to build a two-storey farm at the port of Las Palmas in Gran Canaria. The location of the facility, which will be fed by seawater from a nearby bay, was chosen because of the temperature of the surrounding waters.

The company hopes to have its application approved by the end of this year, paving the way for it to begin the two-year task of constructing the reportedly â‚¬65m (£55m) farm. From there, stocked with octopuses transported from the research facility in northern Spain, it would take about a year and a half for the octopus to reach the adult phase. The timeline suggests the first batch of product - estimated to initially be between 300 and 500 tons of octopus meat - would probably not hit the market before 2027, says Romero PÃ©rez.

From there, the aim is to gradually ramp up production over the next four years to 3,000 tons of meat annually. This would mean the slaughter of about 1 million octopuses a year - a projection complicated by the lack of existing international standards on the humane slaughter of them.

Nueva Pescanova plans to kill the animals using baths of ice flakes and water that would gradually drop to -3C, says Romero PÃ©rez, describing the method as superior to clubbing the animals over the head, and the many unknowns regarding how to stun octopuses with electricity. For octopuses caught in the wild, a variety of methods are used to kill them, from clubbing to asphyxiation in a net and slicing their brains.

Ice baths are the ""standard method used in global aquaculture,"" says Romero PÃ©rez. ""Basically, it sets off a neural response that lowers the ability to feel. It's the most respectful, most humane form of sacrifice that we know of today.""

His view contrasts with that of the World Organisation for Animal Health, which in 2019 said that the method has been shown to ""result in poor fish welfare"". A 2014 review carried out in part by the Humane Slaughter Association suggested that while fish often stop moving relatively quickly after being placed in ice or ice slurry, ""brain activity indicates the potential for the continuation of consciousness for a substantial period"".

Nueva Pescanova says it is working with researchers at a university in the Canary Islands to explore how to improve the slaughter. ""People are imagining things that don't exist; you don't take an animal and throw it out there on the ice,"" says Romero PÃ©rez, who has worked in aquaculture for more than two decades. ""European legislation allows for immersion in ice water but there is a protocol that needs to be developed before the animal reaches the phase of immersion in ice so that it suffers as little as possible. And that is what we are working on.""

As it stands, the mortality rate before slaughter is projected to be between 10% and 15%. ""Our goal is to keep improving it,"" says Romero PÃ©rez. ""But it's very low for the world of farming. For the species most commonly cultivated in the Mediterranean, for example, the normal mortality rate is between 15% and 20%.""

He argued that it was in Nueva Pescanova's best interests to keep the mortality rate as low as possible. ""How we make more money is by ensuring animal welfare. It's something that seems contradictory, but really that's the way it is.""

Eurogroup for Animals slammed the company's justification of the mortality rates as unacceptable. ""This level is a problem to solve, not to repeat,"" says Keri Tietge of the group.

As the company waits to hear on the permits for the farm, campaigners have seized on the drawn-out timeline, calling on the EU to ban octopus farming as well as imports of farmed octopus.

""We have a chance to stop this before it starts,"" says Tietge. ""It's a very strong signal to all the industry players that are trying to do the same thing. If they see all this pushback and regulatory troubles, it makes them think twice.""

In the meantime, campaigners have worked to flag the potential environmental impact of the farm, from the waste runoff that could be created by the mass of octopuses to the wild fish that could be needed to sustain a carnivorous animal that requires as much as three times their weight in feed.

""For carnivorous species, these commercial pellet feeds are made with fishmeal and fish oil ingredients, which of course leads to more fishing in order to catch the wild forage fish that these ingredients are produced from,"" says Tietge. This reliance could also potentially exacerbate food security issues in the regions of the global south that are home to the main industrial fishmeal plants, she adds.

Nueva Pescanova says its feed includes byproducts of already-caught fish and that it is working to replace some of the animal protein with plant-based sources. When it comes to the risk posed by the farm's runoff, it says it has provided the regional government of the Canary Islands with detailed plans as to how it would disinfect and filter all of the water leaving the facility.

In an email to the Guardian, the directorate general for fisheries in the Canary Islands said that it is ""obliged to process all projects that comply with the law"".

While the project is still proceeding through the standard administrative process and is waiting on the regional government's environmental impact assessment, it noted that ""to-date the initial project complies with all of the requirements"".

It added: ""The project for an octopus farm in Gran Canaria falls within an EU mandate that urges us to develop aquaculture as a fundamental element of the blue economy.""

The company says it has a good handle on the octopuses in its research facility, though Tietge contends it remains to be seen how the situation will play out if it attempts to house together more than a million conflict-prone animals known for their ability to take things apart and squeeze through openings the size of a coin.

""I think it is easier not to see these types of problems in the lab setting where there are people constantly tending to the situation and the environment and making sure the conditions are perfect,"" says Tietge.

""When you then have nearly 1,000 tanks in production, there's just no way to control it as much. So I think they will have a lot of these health and welfare issues popping up in much bigger numbers if they are able to start farming.""

Ultimately, the debate over octopus farming comes down to whether we are prepared to subject octopuses to the same kinds of mistakes we've made when it comes to the intensive farming of animals such as pigs, says Elena Lara of Compassion in World Farming.

""We have put very intelligent animals in intensive farms that are now suffering. Let's not do it again,"" she says. ""Now that we have better science, better knowledge, let's take that information and use it in the right way. We should learn from the past.""

304,"Dairy farmers quit in fury amid UK price squeeze and rising costs","https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/29/uk-dairy-farmers-costs-milk-price-energy-feed-bills","Dairy farmers quit in fury amid UK price squeeze and rising costs

While supermarkets slash the price of milk, soaring energy bills and labour shortages are endangering the industry's future

""˜The hardest thing I've had to do."" That was the heartbreaking confession of a British dairy farmer after selling his herd of cows, bringing to an end a family business that had been in existence for nearly 200 years.

The reason for this fateful decision? A 14p-a-litre drop in the price he was getting for his milk, within a few months, despite facing continued high bills for electricity, animal feed and fertiliser. ""I can't understand why anyone would want to carry it on,"" he said.

The milk producer, who has chosen to remain nameless, told his story to David Exwood, a Sussex farmer, who shared the comments on Twitter. His situation is far from unique. Dairy farmers and other food producers have been struggling with spiralling costs since the outbreak of war in Ukraine last February pushed energy bills skywards - also affecting the cost of fertiliser, which needs gas for its production.

Financial pressures were further exacerbated by last summer's drought, as farmers had to buy more animal feed because of a lack of grass.

Milk shortages after the disruption of the pandemic eventually saw the wholesale price rise to record levels by late 2022, peaking at 51.6p per litre last December. This, finally, covered farmers' costs and allowed them to breathe a sigh of relief. But the respite was short-lived.

The average farm-gate price for milk has been on a downward trajectory in recent months, sliding to 37.6p per litre in May, according to government figures. This represented an almost 5% drop in the space of a month, and a near-8% decrease on the same month a year earlier.

Paul Rowbottom, a farmer who also sells animal feed, says he can see the impact of financial pressures every day at the farms he visits across Staffordshire, Derbyshire and Cheshire. ""Trying to get money in is a nightmare,"" he says. ""They can't pay their bills."" He says the dairy farmers and other food producers he supplies are facing the worst challenges he has seen during 30 years in the job: ""I don't think I have seen so many people so fed up as now.""

Recent falls in the milk price have partly been attributed to the ""spring flush"" - when cows naturally produce more milk as they are let out into fields - leading to oversupply. Yet dairy farmers clearly feel that they take the financial hit when milk processors and retailers reduce the price paid for their product.

Cheaper milk, along with lower prices for butter and bread, has been among the price cuts advertised recently by supermarkets as they battle to win over price-conscious shoppers during the cost of living crisis and a period of stubbornly high food inflation. A four-pint bottle now costs £1.45 at grocers including Tesco and Sainsbury's, about 20p cheaper than in early April, and the lowest price since before the pandemic.

Now food producers are warning that a continued exodus of dairy farmers could jeopardise the UK's current self-sufficiency in liquid milk. Almost 5% of them left the industry last year, according to the National Farmers' Union (NFU).

The Dorset Dairy Company has become one of the latest farms to decide to sell off its milking cows after the crash in prices. Dan Miller, the company's head of operations, is the third generation of his family to oversee a herd at Stalbridge. He now intends to sell their 180 cows in September, after which the company plans to buy in milk from elsewhere to continue making its yoghurt, butter and cream.

Miller says he made the decision as a result of the volatility in the milk price, where the ""happy days"" of the wholesale highs in late 2022 prompted many dairy farmers to expand, just as consumers reined in their spending. People are also gradually changing their milk habits - whether that's cutting back on traditional cups of tea or morning cereal or the rise of dairy-free alternatives.

Miller believes the industry has struggled to adapt quickly enough, with small suppliers the most vulnerable. ""With milk you can't turn off the taps easily,"" Miller says. ""A lot of people said ""˜let's improve and grow and produce more milk.' We should have been more cautious.

""This is an epic cycle and I don't see it getting better quick enough,"" he says, explaining why he is selling his herd. ""We don't know how long this is going to last.""

Farmers across the country are asking themselves how long they can hold on amid financial pressures, as they continue to grapple with chronic labour shortages. Almost three-fifths of dairy farmers belonging to Arla, the UK's largest dairy cooperative, complained of worker shortages in a recent survey, saying they were finding it harder to find staff than in 2019.

Andrew Hall, a beef and dairy farmer from Alveston in Warwickshire, has also experienced this. Of his four children, the oldest two have already studied at university, and decided that they don't want to take over the farm, while workers ""who are my age and older are saying ""˜I'm sick of this,'"" he says.

""I am finding it tough financially and mentally, and obviously labour is a massive issue,"" he says, adding that he is receiving 15p less a litre than in February. ""Most dairy farmers are working seven days a week, but it's 2023, not 1983 or 1973. And we have been left behind with wages.""

The 56-year-old is also going to miss out on his one week-long holiday of the year, as his ""relief milking"" assistant is recovering from a road accident. ""I can't find anybody else to milk,"" he says.

To keep on top of his outgoings, Hall has reduced the amount of feed given to his cows and is scaling down production, relieved that there is more grass available than last summer. ""You never hear of farmers striking,"" he says. ""But we have been taken advantage of for too long.""

Succession problems are among the reasons for a large number of dairy herds coming to market at Kivells, an agriculture and livestock auction house. Mark Davis, an auctioneer based in Exeter, is expecting to sell 1,500 dairy cows over the next month. ""We are seeing a lot of sales come forward,"" he says. ""The milk price and finances are bound to have an effect.""

Davis, who also works part-time on the family dairy farm run by his brother, believes the reluctance of the next generation to take over family businesses is also playing a role. ""The sales coming up are generally because of retirement, a couple have been in ill-health, in one the farmer died and the family didn't want to take it on.""

Some farmers are pinning their hopes on the government's plans to introduce new regulations in the coming months, and bring more stability to the dairy supply chain. The so-called dairy code is intended to ""ensure supply contracts in the dairy sector are fair and transparent, with farmers being paid a fair price for their produce"", according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).

The regulations are designed to allow farmers to challenge prices offered by processors, and prevent contract changes from being imposed on producers without agreement, while allowing them to raise their concerns more easily.

Michael Oakes, a dairy farmer in Worcestershire, is hopeful that the plans, expected to become law in the autumn, might ""take out some unfair practice from the supply chain"". He believes that the current situation, where farmers sometimes only find out a few days in advance what they will be paid for next month's milk, is untenable.

Oakes, who is also chair of the NFU's dairy board, hopes the regulations could ""create a new relationship with processors, get rid of the ""˜us and them'. We need each other, but it has never felt like a true partnership.""

For now, dairy farmers such as Hall are committed to remaining in farming, even though he admits that he occasionally dreams of a life without caring for a dairy herd. ""I could rent out buildings [on the farm] for storage, and have an easier and better lifestyle.""

307,"Is Florida running out of orange juice? Record prices put the squeeze on consumers","https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/feb/13/florida-orange-juice-record-prices-weather-disease","Is Florida running out of orange juice? Record prices put the squeeze on consumers

Extreme weather and a prolific citrus disease have plagued Florida's orange crop, sending prices through the roof

Has breakfast in the US ever been this expensive? The recent eggflation seen across the country has caused an uproar, and now orange juice is adding to the financial pain.

Orange juice futures - contracts to buy and sell OJ - have almost doubled to $2.60 per pound over the last year, up from $1.40 a year ago, leading to price surges in stores. In January, orange juice not from concentrate hit $10 a gallon, while juice from concentrate hit $6.27 per gallon.

The increase has not gone unnoticed. ""This is my favorite,"" a TikTok user in a grocery store says as he holds up a glistening 89-fluid-ounce orange juice bottle in a video posted last month. ""Simply Orange juice: $7. That's simply too high.""

The price increase highlights a serious problem for Florida - the state that is synonymous with the orange and produces the most orange juice in the country.

This season the US agriculture department predicts the state will produce 16m 90lb boxes of oranges, a 61% drop compared with last season when the state produced 41m boxes. It's a worrying decrease but nothing compared with the fall from its peak in the 1990s when the state was producing 200m boxes a year.

""While the current crop size is a real disappointment, we're not giving up,"" Matt Joyner, CEO of Florida Citrus Mutual, a trade association, said in a statement on Wednesday.

Florida's woes have opened up an opportunity for Brazil, the world's largest exporter of orange juice. Orange juice shipments from that country were up 58% in the first four months of this season as Florida oranges saw a small yield.

Over the last decade the state has ramped up efforts to protect its industry, which is vulnerable to extreme weather events like hurricanes and has been experiencing a pandemic of its own through a prolific citrus disease.

The citrus industry was once the dominant industry in the state, a role that now belongs to tourism, but the citrus industry still covers 375,000 acres (151,757 hectares) in the state and supports over 32,000 jobs, bringing in economic contributions of about $6.6bn (£5.48bn), according to the University of Florida.

""It's farm income, but it's also the income that comes from the communities that are served by the industry,"" said Marisa Zansler, director of economic and market research for the Florida department of citrus. ""There's a lot of economic contribution in agricultural areas of Florida that aren't necessarily served by tourism.""

Hurricane Ian tore through central Florida - home to many of the state's citrus groves - in September as a category 4 storm, wreaking havoc on the state's citrus farms. The University of Florida estimates the damage to the state's agricultural sector was $1.07bn (£890m), with citrus growers bearing $247m (£205m) in damages. In early February, a bipartisan from Florida's congressional delegation introduced a bill that would give US Department of Agriculture (USDA) grants to farmers to help them recover from the damages.

Along with the stress from Hurricane Ian, the orange industry has been dealing with a pandemic of citrus greening among its groves for over a decade.

The disease is spread by an insect, the Asian citrus psyllid, that feeds on the stems and leaves of trees and then infects them with bacteria. The disease was first found in the state in 2005, and by 2015, it was found in all citrus-producing counties, according to the state's department of citrus. Growers said in 2015 that as much as 90% of their trees were infected.

Greening hurts the tree's circulation and nutrition status, leading it to produce green, smaller, misshapen fruit that tastes bitter. An infected tree can die five years after infection. The bugs can be carried across the state by heavy winds, making hurricanes even more devastating to the crop.

The state has invested millions into researching and developing treatments for citrus greening over the years, and efforts to replant old and infected trees have been under way. This year, the state is looking to allocate $29m (£24m) for protection and research in the citrus industry, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

""We've just had pressure from both sides of the spectrum, from weather-related events as well as dealing with [greening],"" Zansler said. ""The industry is working toward resolving a lot of these challenges and replanting, and it's going to take some time.""

While solutions to citrus greening are still being explored, growers in the state are experimenting with nutritional supplements to help make trees stronger in the face of greening and trunk injections that help the trees fight the disease's bacteria. Researchers have also been working on developing modified citrus trees that are resistant to the disease.

Even with the one-two punch of weather and disease Florida's orange trees have been taking, growers are still optimistic about the future of the industry as they see these efforts to fight the disease start to bear fruit - literally.

""I've grown up in this industry ""¦ I remember groves years ago and what they look like, and what groves look like now and what the fruit looks like. This year, before the hurricane, we were on a good track,"" said Emma Keller, executive director of the Peace River Valley Citrus Growers Association. ""Despite everything that happens and what they get hit with, [growers] keep pushing, because they truly love this industry and what they do. They are a super-resilient group.""

One of the big opportunities missed in the climate wars was the chance for agriculture to lay out its case separate from fossil fuels

For farmers, growing food and fibre is no longer enough in an age of global heating.

This week our local Landcare group is running a workshop on environmental accounting where farmers learn to measure their ""natural capital"", such as native vegetation, fauna and soil.

Right now, they are getting swamped by offers to sell carbon and biodiversity credits, often to provide other industries with offsets. I can plant a paddock of trees here so that you can release emissions over there.

Tales of potential riches compete with dire warnings of regret for people who sign up to long-term contracts without knowing exactly what they are in for. Every week in my inbox press releases herald the next big offer for farmers when it comes to selling carbon and reducing emissions.

It is a far cry from 10 years ago, when emissions-intensive industries including energy, transport and agriculture walked in lock step against any change to business as usual.

One of the big opportunities missed in the decade-long climate wars was the chance for agriculture to lay out its case separate from the fossil fuel industry.

While agriculture will need to keep reducing emissions to stay in the game, the advantage that farmers have over the coal and gas industry is, simply, that they are producing food. There are fewer alternatives to land-produced food at scale, notwithstanding new ventures in lab-based meats and high-rise farming.

By dragging its feet when it came to accepting climate science, agriculture left itself open to getting lumped in with fossil fuels as an industry holding back necessary change. It is now seen as having a big role to play in providing offsets even though many of the smart operators are wary of selling their carbon. The bottom line is, if large numbers of offsets are required by fossil fuel companies and other industries, that will have a material impact on agricultural land. So do you grow food, or carbon, or both?

If it is more lucrative to be paid to plant trees to offset digging up coal and gas than it is to grow food, economics might push farmers into taking up the offer.

The latest budget had a couple of small, unremarked initiatives that may go some way to counting the cost of unfettered offsets in the land and farming sector.

The agriculture minister, Murray Watt, acknowledged there was a wariness among farmers when it came to getting independent advice on how to reduce emissions and engage with carbon and biodiversity markets.

""When I talk with farmers, they're really keen to be involved, but many of them aren't quite sure how to do it and they're really wary about who it is they're getting their advice from,"" Watt said.

So $40m was set aside to establish a network of ""sustainable agriculture facilitators"" to provide that advice. This contract will go to tender shortly but it is understood Landcare groups and natural resource management groups with existing relationships with farmers are well placed.

The Australian Bureau of Resource Economics and Sciences is also getting $38m to start crunching the numbers on different land uses, including the offset market.

Abares will develop a landscape model which measures the effects of domestic and international policies such as the safeguard mechanism as well as low-carbon food production policies demanded by other countries.

It will also survey low-emissions agricultural practices at an individual farm level and a sector-wide level to understand what might work in different regions.

The idea is to provide regional context for farmers to consider the opportunity cost of taking up different practices. Examples might include the use of red Asparagopsis algae versus other feed supplements to reduce methane.

The Abares executive director, Dr Jared Greenville, said producers were ""flying a little bit blind into a low-carbon world"" because of all the different options and requirements at play, including whether to offset or inset emissions. Insetting is where you mitigate climate risk within your business. A cattle farm might plant out a riparian zone to grow carbon, for example, to balance out the emissions from its beef operation.

Greenville hopes the research will provide farmers and policymakers with a better understanding of the impact of changing land use.

""The real focus of that is ""¦ to provide good policy advice to government,"" he said. ""If they're going to increase the use of offsets for fossil fuel industries, transporting and the like, then that has the potential to impact land use.""

What is clear is that farmers will need to balance their emissions inside their own businesses as the world moves towards net zero.

""If there's no land inset options to agriculture in 20 years' time and we move into net zero, offsetting agriculture's emissions ""¦ is going to be more costly,"" Greenville said.

""It's quite likely that if you want to get to a least-cost path then not selling all your offsets [carbon credits] today is the best strategy. We haven't done the work to back that up but that's quite likely where I'd say it's to go.""

On paper, Andrew Herrick was never going to be a good match with Doris. But after years of subtle flirtation, an office romance started to bloom

We'd been glancing at each other across a crowded room for five years. Doris was a receptionist at a suburban Melbourne joinery where I was a glazier. I found her attractive and our one brief chat at the Christmas party revealed we had something in common: we'd both just bought David Bowie's new album, Heroes. But my flicker of interest was doused by her long-term relationship with the firm's truckie, a gormless petrol head whose car held some record at the local drag strip.

Doris was never going to be my type. We were opposites in too many ways: I was an analytical, resolutely cynical university dropout; thin, pale, long-haired and lanky. And I had a slow, daggy car. Doris was spontaneous and cheerful, shapely, olive-skinned and petite. She had left school at 17 for a job at the factory in the same street as her family home.

I longed for an earthy girl, ideally from the country, so we could retreat there, grow vegetables and be hippies together.

But a year later, at the next Christmas bash, with the truckie gone, the flicker between us kindled when she played footsies with me under a pub table. Then she not only accepted my offer of a lift home, in preference to our flashy head salesman, but gave me a peck on the cheek and a coy smile before leaving my car.

I still wasn't sure a month later, when our chain-smoking office matriarch Val pointedly remarked that there was a girl in the office and that no one was taking her out.

So I did, to meet my weekend friends in Fitzroy and Carlton, who all had degrees and worked in finance, insurance or IT. They haughtily dismissed Doris as unsuitable. She was shy and found them intimidating. The women baited her by flirting with me, which they'd never done before. Someone humiliated her by hiding her shoes. I began to feel unsuitable too.

My family's welcome was subdued - in contrast to Doris's clan's effusive acceptance of me. My mother confessed she was initially dismayed when I brought her home (before later declaring her ""a gem""). I knew why. It wasn't her family's migrant status, directly. But Doris was so reserved and sometimes, having only spoken Maltese as a child, tongue-tied. She came from the factory, a place my parents saw as a dead end for me. Blame my father, who after I flunked uni had nudged me to get a job, any job, in the same week as a vacancy at the joinery appeared in the local paper.

My hippy mate Alan was more open-minded. He invited us to dinner in Prahran, where he was house-sitting a back yard dope crop for friends trekking in Tibet. Doris was more interested in their apricot tree.

She was at ease with herself that night. She wore a blue calf-length singlet dress that revealed her tanned, toned shoulders. The outfit was demure but drew me in, just like the woman who chose it. Alan asked Doris how she knew when apricots were ripe and we were both startled when she laughed and replied: ""When the birds do.""

I glanced at Alan. Duh. I climbed the tree and picked the fruit the birds had marked, then watched her avidly consume them, her eyes sparkling above a sticky grin. Later that night, when we kissed, she tasted of apricots.

I saw my so-called uni friends one more time and decided I preferred Doris because of the ways she was unlike them: not worldly and cynical or promiscuous and miserable, but innately happy, self-sufficient and skilled. She enjoyed cooking, sewing and gardening, and was somehow both earthy and elegant, modest and vivacious, sensible yet passionate. What more could I want?

All doubts vanished when I went skiing for a week and found myself at bars and parties mired in misery. I couldn't bear to be without her. After three days away I drove the five hours back to Melbourne, determined to spend the rest of my life with her, without really understanding why.

But then, we can't ever really know why we yearn to spend our life with someone, for that question takes a lifetime to answer. And after 43 years together, I'm beginning to have a pretty good idea.

319,"Climate breakdown could cause British apples to die out, warn experts","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/11/climate-breakdown-british-apples-die-out","Climate breakdown could cause British apples to die out, warn experts

Japan's Fuji and New Zealand gala could replace pippin and russet as rising temperatures threaten homegrown species

Classic British apples may die out and be swapped for varieties from New Zealand and Japan, as climate breakdown means traditional fruits are no longer viable.

Apples such as pippin or the the ancient nonpareil, grown in Britain since the 1500s, are struggling in the changed climate because there are not enough ""chilling hours"" for the trees to lie dormant in winter and conserve energy for growing fruit.

Scientists at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, are planting 40 apple trees, a third of which are heritage varieties that once grew in its Georgian kitchen gardens. Another third are new varieties bred to need less cold over winter, and the final third are from warmer countries including South Africa. The varieties will be compared to see which has the best crop in London's warming temperatures.

In January, the Met Office announced that 2022 had been the sixth warmest year on record, and it looks as if 2023 will be another record-breaker. But though many crops are affected by the summer's intense heat and drought, apple trees are struggling because they need a period of cold over the winter.

In autumn, they store enough energy to see them through the dormant period, and then burst into action again in spring. Perfect chilling hours for apples are those below 6C but above freezing, and most traditional apple trees need about 1,000 chilling hours. If temperatures remain above 6C then they have to respire, using up energy stores throughout the winter period, which in turn limits the stores available in spring, meaning fewer apples grow.

Gala apples are a popular variety grown in New Zealand, but the horticulturalist Helena Dove, who runs Kew's kitchen garden, said the breed may overtake traditional varieties in Britain.

""The Gala was bred in New Zealand, which means it only needs about 600 chilling hours, which is more like what we're getting at the minute in the UK,"" she explained.

""We will see if gala has a better crop than nonpareil, which was bred in 1696. We are also trying the Fuji apple, which originated in Japan and only needs 400 chill hours, which might do better in these milder winters.""

When some of the most beloved heritage varieties of British apple were bred, she said: ""We had these lovely cold winters, which we aren't getting any more.""

Dove hopes to have a crop in three years, and to be able to share some preliminary findings with the industry then. Farmers are ripping out orchards because of climate breakdown and a lack of workers, and she hopes this research could bolster the industry.

""This chilling hours conversation is happening,"" she said, ""because it's not just apples, pears and blackcurrants that have this feature where they need to stay dormant.""

However, it is not certain that these new varieties will be the solution: ""We could find out that we don't get a dry enough winter for these varieties. So this is why it's an experiment, because South Africa doesn't have the wet weather that we have. So it's going to be whether they've got low chill hours and can cope with the amount of rain.""

Apples on the way out

Egremont russet is a classic English russet apple from the Victorian era. Apple aficionados love its flavour and appearance.

Nonpareil apples originated in France but have grown in the UK for hundreds of years. It is popular due to its pear-drop flavour.

Cox's orange pippin apples are what springs to mind when you think of the classic English fruit; with blushing orange and red skin that gives way to patches of green.

Potential replacements

Gala apples are ubiquitous in the supermarket. They are crisp, juicy and a pinkish red but critics may say they do not have the complex, floral flavours of the classic English apples listed above.

Fuji apples are a modern variety that originated in the Tohoku research station in Fujisaki, Aomori, Japan, in the late 1930s, and was brought to market in 1962. It is a cross between two American apple varieties: the red delicious and old Virginia Ralls Janet apples. They taste sugary sweet, like bottled apple juice.

Exclusive: Australian company resurrects flesh of lost species to demonstrate potential of meat grown from cells

A mammoth meatball has been created by a cultivated meat company, resurrecting the flesh of the long-extinct animals.

The project aims to demonstrate the potential of meat grown from cells, without the slaughter of animals, and to highlight the link between large-scale livestock production and the destruction of wildlife and the climate crisis.

The mammoth meatball was produced by Vow, an Australian company, which is taking a different approach to cultured meat.

There are scores of companies working on replacements for conventional meat, such as chicken, pork and beef. But Vow is aiming to mix and match cells from unconventional species to create new kinds of meat.

The company has already investigated the potential of more than 50 species, including alpaca, buffalo, crocodile, kangaroo, peacocks and different types of fish.

The first cultivated meat to be sold to diners will be Japanese quail, which the company expects will be in restaurants in Singapore this year.

""We have a behaviour change problem when it comes to meat consumption,"" said George Peppou, CEO of Vow .

""The goal is to transition a few billion meat eaters away from eating [conventional] animal protein to eating things that can be produced in electrified systems.

""And we believe the best way to do that is to invent meat. We look for cells that are easy to grow, really tasty and nutritious, and then mix and match those cells to create really tasty meat.""

Tim Noakesmith, who cofounded Vow with Peppou, said: ""We chose the woolly mammoth because it's a symbol of diversity loss and a symbol of climate change."" The creature is thought to have been driven to extinction by hunting by humans and the warming of the world after the last ice age.

The initial idea was from Bas Korsten at creative agency Wunderman Thompson: ""Our aim is to start a conversation about how we eat, and what the future alternatives can look and taste like. Cultured meat is meat, but not as we know it.""

Plant-based alternatives to meat are now common but cultured meat replicates the taste of conventional meat. Cultivated meat - chicken from Good Meat - is currently only sold to consumers in Singapore, but two companies have now passed an approval process in the US.

In 2018, another company used DNA from an extinct animal to create gummy bears made from gelatine from a mastodon, another elephant-like animal.

Vow worked with Prof Ernst Wolvetang, at the Australian Institute for Bioengineering at the University of Queensland, to create the mammoth muscle protein. His team took the DNA sequence for mammoth myoglobin, a key muscle protein in giving meat its flavour, and filled in the few gaps using elephant DNA.

This sequence was placed in myoblast stem cells from a sheep, which replicated to grow to the 20bn cells subsequently used by the company to grow the mammoth meat.

""It was ridiculously easy and fast,"" said Wolvetang. ""We did this in a couple of weeks."" Initially, the idea was to produce dodo meat, he said, but the DNA sequences needed do not exist.

No one has yet tasted the mammoth meatball. ""We haven't seen this protein for thousands of years,"" said Wolvetang. ""So we have no idea how our immune system would react when we eat it. But if we did it again, we could certainly do it in a way that would make it more palatable to regulatory bodies.""

Wolvetang said he could understand people initially being wary of such meat: ""It's a little bit strange and new - it's always like that at first. But from an environmental and ethical point of view, I personally think [cultivated meat] makes a lot of sense.""

The large-scale production of meat, particularly beef, causes huge damage to the environment, with many studies finding there must be a big reduction in meat-eating in rich nations in order to end the climate crisis.

Cultivated meat uses much less land and water than livestock, and produces no methane emissions. Vow said the energy it uses is all from renewable sources and that foetal bovine serum, a growth medium produced from cattle foetuses, is not used in any of its commercial products. The company has raised US$56m (£46m) in investment to date.

Wolvetang thinks there will be increasing crossover between the technologies used in medical and human stem cell research and the production of cultured meats.

For example, cells can be programmed to develop in response to their immediate environment, meaning cuts of meat containing muscle, fat and connective tissue could be grown.

Seren Kell, at the Good Food Institute Europe, said: ""I hope this fascinating project will open up new conversations about cultivated meat's extraordinary potential to produce more sustainable food.

""However, as the most common sources of meat are farm animals such as cattle, pigs, and poultry, most of the sustainable protein sector is focused on realistically replicating meat from these species.

""By cultivating beef, pork, chicken and seafood we can have the most impact in terms of reducing emissions from conventional animal agriculture.""

The mammoth meatball will be unveiled on Tuesday evening at Nemo, a science museum in the Netherlands.

Cargill and ADM led push to weaken new protections for threatened ecosystems in South America, report says

Cargill and ADM, two of the world's leading livestock feed companies, helped to scupper an attempt to end the trade in soya beans grown on deforested and threatened ecosystem lands in South America, a new report alleges.

Soya is one of the cheapest available types of edible protein, and is in huge demand for feed for animals around the world; as our consumption of meat and dairy has risen globally, the need for soya has soared too.

But its production has been directly associated with deforestation in some of the most threatened landscapes around the world. Last year, in response to internal concerns and growing public awareness of the issue, 14 leading grain traders worked intensively to agree a ban on buying soya beans grown on some of those landscapes, including Brazil's Amazon forest, the Pantanal wetlands and the Cerrado savanna, according to the report.

The ban would have imposed a backdated deadline of 2020 on soya buyers, and was expected to be announced at last year's UN Cop27 climate conference in Egypt, the report said. The backdated deadline was aimed at preventing harvested soya already grown on threatened land areas from entering global markets, and avoiding the deforesting scramble a future deadline might have provoked.

But instead of agreeing the ban, Cargill and ADM ""led the push"" for weaker language in the final statement, according to one person involved in the discussions between the 14 grain traders before Cop27. ""If Cargill - or ADM - had not taken those positions, the outcome would have been different,"" the source said.

The Guardian spoke to several of the report's sources who confirmed their quotes but did not wish to be named.

The soya agreement that was signed by the companies, included in the November 2022 agriculture sector roadmap to 1.5C, was seen as a failure by many NGOs. A group representing retailers including Asda, Aldi, Lidl, M&S and Tesco told Cargill and ADM the agreement was inadequate, inconsistent and insufficient.

The new report by Mighty Earth, an NGO which has previously called Cargill ""the worst company in the world"", follows news that soya land conversion has surged in Brazil's Cerrado. That rise is largely driven by the expansion of soya grown for animal feed, according to Mighty Earth's CEO, Glenn Hurowitz. ""If Cargill had signed up to the ban ""¦ the other companies would have followed the leader."" As a result we would not be seeing ""the forests and biomes of South America bulldozed at such an alarming scale and pace"", he said.

Two other leading commodity companies, Amaggi and Louis Dreyfus Company (LDC), were committed to the soya ban initiative, Mighty Earth's report said. Both have ""stronger commitments [than Cargill and ADM] to end all soya linked to deforestation and conversion"", said David Cleary, director of global agriculture at The Nature Conservancy, an NGO. The term conversion is used to describe threatened ecosystem lands that are converted to soya plantations, whether forested or not.

Apparent inconsistencies between Cargill's public and private stances on traceability were uncovered by the Mighty Earth investigation. On its website, Cargill rates its Brazilian soya supply chain as 100% traceable. But a February 2022 email quoted Cargill saying it was ""basically impossible to ensure traceability"" in its Brazilian soya supplies because beans from different sources are mixed at port silos.

The email, seen by the Guardian, was from a European Commission official and described a meeting with Cargill. It was released to Mighty Earth under freedom of information laws.

Asked about the claim, Cleary said Cargill was most likely referring to a lack of traceability in their indirect soya supply. This represents about a third of total supplies, he said, and is often used as an excuse for delaying traceability improvements. ""Traceability [of indirect soya supplies] is harder but not impossible, hence often used as an excuse by laggards,"" Cleary said.

Speaking from Brazil, Cleary added that although ""all the companies are moaning"" about the EU's new deforestation regulations, introduced in June this year with an 18-month compliance window, they were all, including Cargill, preparing to meet requirements.

In an email received by the Guardian after publication, Cargill said the accusations in the Mighty Earth report were inaccurate and that it had ""traced 100% of our directly sourced volumes in Brazil back to the farm polygon map - the most sophisticated and complete method available for tracing the source locations of the commodities we trade."" The email also said Cargill was ""one of the original signatories of the Corporate Statement of Purpose that launched at COP26 and actively worked with the industry to develop the Agriculture Sector Roadmap introduced at COP27.""

The report adds that Cargill has said it was ""proud to be one of the 14 companies that came together to address deforestation in key biomes and supply chains"" as part of the November 2022 Agriculture Sector Roadmap to 1.5C. ""As an industry, we collectively aligned on all aspects of the roadmap as the best path forward for protecting these critical South American forest ecosystems,"" it said.

ADM did not respond to a request from the Guardian for comment, but a comment in the report states that the participants in the roadmap ""worked together collegially and continue to do so. ADM believes that action must be taken to prevent both deforestation and conversion, and we have a strong record of responsible sourcing and monitoring our supply chains. We have achieved 100% traceability and 99% deforestation and conversion-free supply chains in Brazil, which includes the Cerrado"".

A person involved in the Cop27 soya ban discussions said, on condition of anonymity, that the Mighty Earth report was ""somewhat misleading"" because it implies ""there was an agreed goal and the traders didn't deliver on it"". Rather, the source said, there were ""expectations"" a ban would be announced at Cop27, but they were ""unrealistic given the practices of the companies involved"".

As we enter 2023, WWF reflects on key moments from the last 12 months. From celebrating the Year of the Tiger and recruiting ""˜Walrus Detectives', to continued deforestation in the Amazon and the effects of extreme weather events around the world, 2022 was a year of environmental highs and lows, many of which will continue to resonate in the year ahead.

Extreme weather: droughts in Kenya kill elephant populations

In November, Kenya's tourism, wildlife and heritage cabinet secretary, Peninah Malonza, announced that between February and October 2022, drought killed 205 elephants and large numbers of other wildlife, as much of east Africa experienced its worst drought in 40 years. People and wildlife have been severely affected by the droughts, with long periods of little to no rainfall leaving both communities and animals on the brink. A lack of water has resulted in widespread livestock deaths, crop failure and acute hunger for millions of people, alongside an increase in human-wildlife conflict. Governments refusing to phase out fossil fuels at last year's Cop27 summit was another knock-back to hopes of stabilising our climate.

Year of the tiger: living with tigers in India's mangroves

In the Sundarbans area of West Bengal, mangrove forests provide protection from storms and rising sea levels, and are a crucial source of food and income for many of the 4.5 million people who live there. They are also home to tigers, and tragic tales of human-tiger encounters are not difficult to come by. Moulis - traditional wild honey collectors - used to risk their lives by travelling into the forest to make a living, but with support from WWF, 80 families are now involved in a honey cooperative that uses apiaries placed in secure, netted areas on the edge of the forest. In June, as part of the lunar Year of the Tiger, WWF reported on the importance of such human-tiger coexistence to secure a future for this much-loved big cat.

Amazon: illegal gold mining in the TapajÃ³s

In the Amazon, gold mining is a rapidly increasing problem with devastating environmental and social implications. It is fuelling deforestation, mercury contamination, violence and land grabs in both protected and Indigenous land across the region: this image taken last summer shows an aerial view of a goldmine in the TapajÃ³s region in the Amazon in Brazil. The UK is the third largest importer of Brazilian gold, and recent studies suggest that at least a third of gold from Brazil comes from illegally mined areas. WWF is calling for a ban on Brazilian gold until systems are in place that can prove for certain the gold coming into the UK has been legally and responsibly sourced.

Extreme weather: flooding in Pakistan

In the aftermath of floods in the village of Bubur, a man sits in the rubble of his home with clothes and his granddaughter's school bag wrapped in a rug. About 33 million people in Pakistan - or one in seven people in the country - were affected by the devastating floods that hit the country over the summer. For context, that's the equivalent of almost half the population of the UK. Families lost their homes, livelihoods, and in some cases, loved ones. Survivors of the flooding will continue to suffer as they cope with the loss of the crops and livestock that are crucial to their survival. Climate change and weather-related disasters have increased by 40% over the last 20 years, and have killed roughly 410,000 people in the last decade; nine in 10 of the victims were in the developing world, and this will continue to worsen as the climate crisis deepens.

Citizen science: walrus from space

Walrus from Space, led by WWF and British Antarctic Survey (BAS) in collaboration with research groups around the Arctic, is an ambitious five-year project that asks citizen scientists to become ""˜Walrus Detectives' by searching for and counting walrus numbers using satellite imagery. Since launch, about 1.5msatellite images have been searched by over 11,000 volunteers. The data collected will be used to gain a better understanding of walrus populations and trends, how they are responding to the climate crisis today, and how they might respond in the future, to help inform conservation of these marine mammals and their habitat. In July 2022, WWF'schief adviser for the polar regions, Rod Downie, travelled to Svalbard in the Norwegian Arctic with project colleagues to verify data, comparing satellite, drone, and ground counts, including this walrus haul-out on a spit in Svalbard.

Extreme weather: 2022 was the first ever red warning for extreme heat in the UK

2022 saw a milestone in the UK's climate history: temperatures over 40C were recorded for the first time on the British Isles, with the Met Office issuing the first ever red warning for extreme heat, and it was the driest year since 1995, illustrated by this image of extremely low water levels in Ladybower Reservoir, Derbyshire. Climate change is making extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, wildfires and droughts both more frequent and more intense, harming people's health and homes. From puffins to bluebells, bumblebees and mountain hares, wildlife in the UK is already feeling the heat from climate change and struggling to adapt. The only way to limit global warming to the crucial goal of 1.5C is to restore nature, slash emissions and invest in clean, renewable energy.

Amazon: river dolphins under threat

Taken last year, this image captures an Amazon river dolphin, known locally as ""˜boto', hunting for scraps from a fish market in the Brazilian Amazon. One of the biggest threats to the species are big infrastructure projects, such as hydropower dams and the soya bean processing port in the background of the shot. These developments can alter river flows, fragment habitat, and prevent connectivity - all of which impact the dolphin's abilities to breed and survive. There are many other threats to the boto, including mercury poisoning, overfishing, and being killed for use as fish bait. WWF is working in the region to monitor and protect the species together with local fishers and communities, private companies, academics and governments.

Year of the tiger: tigers bounce back in nepal

On Global Tiger Day in July, Nepal announced that it had increased its wild tiger population by 190% since 2009, to 355 individuals. An extensive effort covering 18,928 sq km - over 12% of the country - and 16,811 days of field staff time was invested to complete the country's National Tiger and Prey Survey 2022, which identified individual adult tigers based on stripe patterns. This achievement was a result of the rigorous protection of key tiger habitats and corridors, partnership with local communities, and cracking down on illegal wildlife trade. Wild tiger numbers are on the rise, but they are still the most endangered big cat, reduced to about 5% of their historic range. Conservation efforts must continue if this iconic species is to survive.

International wildlife trade: disappearing sharks and rays

Sharks and rays are important to the health of our oceans, yet they have become increasingly valued for their meat, fins and parts used for their purported medicinal properties. According to WWF's Living Planet Report 2022, the global abundance of 18 of 31 oceanic sharks and rays has declined by 71% over the last 50 years. This collapse reflects an increase in extinction risk for most species, including whale sharks, photographed here last year in the Philippines. Halting declines and rebuilding populations to healthy levels through catch limits and restrictions on trade will help secure the future of these marine species, as well as the ecosystems and people that depend on them. In November, a major agreement on international wildlife trade (CITES COP 19) saw nearly 100 species of sharks and rays given greater protection by new trade restrictions, which is a significant step in the right direction.

Regenerative agriculture: the opportunity to build a sustainable food system

The biggest impact on UK wildlife over the last 50 years has been the intensification of agriculture, but at Strickley Farm in Kendal, wildlife is returning to the landscape. Instead of a single type of grass treated with chemicals, this wide variety of grass leys and other plants can be found in pasture fields, providing a habitat and food source for native species, and providing health benefits to the cattle that graze the fields. Such regenerative, nature-friendly farming methods could be incentivised in England through the government's new environmental land management schemes (ELMs), but their rollout remains uncertain. In December, WWF joined over 50 food and farming organisations to urge the government to raise the ambition of the schemes, and provide urgent clarity for farmers, so that we don't miss this landmark opportunity to build a sustainable food system.

Human-wildlife coexistence: snow leopards protected by buddhist community

About 80% of global snow leopard habitat is shared with people who follow Buddhist teachings, in which snow leopards are considered a sacred species, and last year, WWF Nepal united with the Buddhist community to achieve their shared goal of protecting these vulnerable big cats. The Nepal Buddhist Federation has committed to, and is working towards, creating a long-term faith plan for the environment, which will enhance conservation efforts to protect wildlife and the wellbeing of communities, which have lived in harmony with nature for thousands of years. Monasteries help to protect the local environment, including snow leopards and the people who live alongside them - their stewardship and leadership are crucial.

STATE OF UK NATURE: COP 15 BIODIVERSITY SUMMIT

While things are looking up for this common kingfisher, nearly 30% of UK bird species remain threatened with extinction, with 38 million birds having vanished from our skies in the last 50 years. The UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world, and while the UK government made commitments to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030 at December's Cop 15 summit, details about the actions they will take to achieve this remain to be seen. Jen Read, who captured this image, was told her disability would prevent her from doing many things in life. But she is now a wildlife photographer, and echoes the 81% of Britons who believe UK nature is under threat and that more needs to be done urgently to protect and restore it.

From nuclear power to electric vehicles, battles between activists risk getting in the way of reducing emissions

One of the most effective ways to be a climate sceptic is to say nothing at all. Why expend the effort slapping down climate solutions when you can rely on feuding climate activists to tear each other's ideas apart? We tend to fight with those we are closest to. This is true of family. But it's also true of our peers, which for me, are those obsessed with trying to fix climate change. Step into the murky waters of Twitter and you'll often find activists spending more time going after one another than battling climate falsehoods.

These might seem like small squabbles, but they have a real impact. They slow our progress and play into the hands of the deniers, the oil companies, the anti-climate lobbyists. These groups push on while our heads are turned.

What we want to achieve is the same: to reduce carbon emissions. The problem is that we are stubborn about how we get there. We often have strong opinions about what the evils are, and how to fix them. The nuclear zealots want to go all-in on building new power stations. The renewable zealots want no nuclear at all. Some promote electric cars; their opponents want car-less roads. Vegans advocate for cutting out animal products; flexitarians feel judged when they eat their weekly roast chicken.

These cracks can start at an even higher level. For some it is not about the specific technology we deploy, it's about the fact that we see technology as a solution at all. There are those who believe that technology will fix everything. Their detractors think this techno-optimism is naive; only radical economic and social change can save us.

Such inner-circle battles aren't specific to climate. They are everywhere. The American economist Michael Munger wrote about this very same tension in economic policy, describing how the world is split into ""directionalists"" and ""destinationists"". Directionalists back any solution that takes us towards the final goal. In climate, this means they support anything that puts a notable dent in emissions. Destinationists are less flexible: they have an ideal outcome in mind. They block and reject anything that doesn't fit their perfect vision. If they want to see a car-less world, they push against electric vehicles (EVs), even if they would cut emissions by a lot.

Destinationalism is a problem. Sure, we all have our favourite solutions. But the reality is that we can't afford to be choosy. The answer to almost every climate dilemma is ""We need both"". We need renewables and nuclear energy (even if that means just keeping our existing nuclear plants online). We need to tackle fossil fuels and our food system; fossil fuels are the biggest emitter, but emissions from food alone would take us well past a temperature rise of 1.5C and close to 2C. Not everyone can commute without a car, so we need electric vehicles and cycle-friendly cities and public transport networks. We can't decarbonise without technological change, but we need to rethink our economic, political and social systems to make sure they flourish.

These battles are not just neutral noises off; they actively help the other side. Fossil fuel companies don't need to dunk on nuclear power because many environmentalists have done it for them. Take Germany, where nuclear plants were closed early, delaying the phasing-out of coal power. This was not only bad for the climate but for air pollution too. Many people on the pro-nuclear side didn't help: their bashing of renewable energy technologies made anti-nuclear environmentalists even more defensive. Or there's the claim that EVs can be just as bad for the environment, often trotted out even in green-leaning media. In response, people are persuaded to stick with their petrol or diesel car. Similarly, meat-eaters who are considering cutting back see claims about how ""unhealthy"" and ""processed"" some plant-based burgers are, and opt for beef instead.

The solution isn't to stop debating. I'm not claiming we should uncritically support every proposal on the table. That would waste money, time and resources. Our efforts would become scattered and diluted. We'd focus on the wrong things. We need to be intensely critical to make sure we invest in climate solutions that are effective and can scale. And no solution is a panacea - EVs, lab-grown meat, renewable energy, nuclear power - all have some impact. We need to be transparent about those impacts to reduce them as much as we can.

So how can we make these debates work better? First, we need to become less fixated on the ideal pathway. None of us will get precisely what we want; we need to compromise and take a route that reduces emissions effectively and quickly, using a combination of solutions.

Second, we need to be more generous when dealing with our rivals. Intellectual disagreements can quickly descend into name-calling. Real conversation stops and we talk past one another instead. We become more focused on winning the argument than understanding the other side. This makes the climate solution space hostile, which is counterproductive considering we want the world's best minds to be there.

Third, we need to be honest about what is and isn't true about the solutions we don't like. ""EVs emit just as much CO2 as petrol cars"" is simply wrong. They emit significantly less, even if they emit more than the subway or a bike (and yes, this is still true when we account for the emissions needed to produce the battery). ""Nuclear energy is unsafe"" is wrong - it's thousands of times safer than the coal we're trying to replace, and just as safe as renewables. It's fine to advocate for your preferred solutions, but it's not OK to lie about the alternatives to make your point.

In short, we need to become better directionalists. To focus on moving towards our goals, rather than pinning all our hopes on an ideal means of getting there. Whether you're a fan of nuclear or solar, electric cars or trains, lab-grown meat or lentils: we are all on the same team. Let's start acting like it.

Diabetes UK study also expresses concern about growing number of younger people with type 2

The UK is experiencing a ""rapidly escalating"" diabetes crisis, with cases topping five million for the first time and under-40s increasingly affected, a report has revealed.

About 90% of diabetes patients have type 2, a condition much more likely to develop if people are overweight. About two-thirds of adults in the UK are overweight or obese.

A report published by Diabetes UK on Thursday reveals an all-time high for type 2 and type 1 combined of 4.3m officially diagnosed cases and another 850,000 people living with one or other of the conditions but still to be diagnosed. Another 2.4 million people are at high risk of developing the type 2 form in the UK.

""These latest figures show we're in the grip of a rapidly escalating diabetes crisis, with spiralling numbers of people now living with type 2 diabetes and millions at high risk of developing the condition,"" said Chris Askew, the chief executive of Diabetes UK.

The stark figures mean millions of Britons are at increased risk of complications including heart attacks, kidney failure, stroke, amputation and blindness.

As a result, the UK faces a public health emergency unless action is taken, Askew said. ""Diabetes is serious, and every diagnosis is life-changing. It's a relentless condition, and the fear of serious complications is a lifelong reality for millions of people across the UK.

""But it doesn't have to be this way. With the right care and support, cases of type 2 diabetes can be prevented or put into remission. What we need to see is the will, grit and determination from government and local health leaders to halt this crisis in its tracks and improve the future health of our nation for generations to come.""

The report specifically raises concern over the high number of people who are overweight or obese across the UK, and says this is directly ""translating"" into an increase in cases of type 2 diabetes. The risk of type 2 diabetes is seven times higher in obese people than in those of healthy weight, and three times higher for those who are overweight.

The report also expresses concern about thegrowing number of younger people developing type 2. ""Alarmingly, the condition is becoming increasingly common among those under the age of 40,"" it says. ""While numbers of under-40s with type 2 diabetes remain a small proportion of total cases, it is known to have more severe and acute effects on younger people.""

The number of people under 40 in the UK being diagnosed with type 2 is now rising at a faster pace than among the over-40s. The latter still make up the vast majority of cases, but the number of under 40s with the condition has shot up the 150,000, representing a faster growth rate.

Demand for care for children with type 2 at paediatric diabetes units across England and Wales has also increased by more than 50% in the last five years.

Diabetes UK also said the condition was becoming more prevalent in areas where there were higher levels of deprivation.

It said the risk factors for type 2 were ""multiple and complex"" and included age, family history and ethnicity, as well as being overweight or obese.

The charity called on the government to make diabetes central to its forthcoming major conditions strategy to prevent cases and to support people at high risk.

Zoe Davies, a spokesperson for the campaign groups Action on Sugar and Action on Salt, said: ""These latest findings unfortunately come as no great surprise given the government has turned its back on many of the key polices designed to improve public health, in particular children's health.

""They have delayed plans for a ban on pre-watershed TV advertising for junk food, for example, in favour of multinational food companies which are making huge profits from selling unhealthy products and do not have a vested interest in the nation's health.

""Now, more than ever, the UK's population need equitable access to healthy, affordable food and this can only be achieved with policies designed to rebalance our food system.""

337,"It's the ""˜Swiss army knife of the sea'. But can kelp survive rising marine heat?","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/12/kelp-farming-ocean-temperatures-climate-crisis","It's the ""˜Swiss army knife of the sea'. But can kelp survive rising marine heat?

As warming oceans threaten the farming of the sustainable crop, scientists work to make the industry climate resilient

Ocean temperatures have hit record highs this year, growing so hot in some places that taking a dip in the sea feels like stepping into a hot tub. For kelp farmers, who grow an underwater crop with a life cycle highly dependent on temperature, that spells trouble for their harvests - and their nascent industry's future.

""Over the last 30 or 40 years, we've seen a pretty big decline in the kelp populations around Long Island. In large part, that's due to climate change and water temperatures increasing,"" said Michael Doall, a former oyster farmer and marine scientist at Stony Brook University's School of Marine & Atmospheric Sciences.

Doall is just one of many scientists working on solutions that will help make the burgeoning industry more climate resilient. Their research subject, kelp, has been billed as the future of food: the sea vegetable doesn't require land, fresh water or fertilizer to grow, allowing it to sidestep some of the harms that accompany traditional resource-intensive terrestrial agriculture.

It grows up to 2ft per day, making it efficient at pulling climate-warming carbon and ecosystem-disrupting nitrogen from land-based fertilizer runoff out of the water. And it's a delicious ingredient that can be used to add a rich umami flavor to everything from sushi and burgers to pickles and salads.

""It's often called the Swiss army knife of the sea, or the tofu of the sea. It can be turned into so many different things,"" said Scott Lindell, a research specialist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts.

Kelp has been farmed as food in Asia for millennia and harvested by tribes such as the Shinnecock and used for everything from food and medicine to housing insulation in what's now known as Long Island, New York, since long before settlers arrived. But kelp farming as a commercial endeavor - in which kelp is grown on tensioned ropes secured by anchors and buoys a few feet below the water's surface that are pulled up for harvest - began in North America just a few decades ago.

It is increasingly being sold as a valuable food product in North America, as well as a useful ingredient in bioplastics, cosmetics and even renewable fuels.

Now, as interest ramps up in earnest on this side of the globe, kelp is running into a problem as the climate crisis turns up the temperature of the ocean. That's throwing kelp's complicated life cycle out of whack, which spells trouble for those farming it.

Historically, kelp growers have started each season by diving for wild kelp sorus, or reproductive tissue - the ocean equivalent of foraging for wild seed. That ""seed"", as it's called colloquially (though it's technically a different kind of reproductive tissue, since kelp are algae rather than plants), is then grown in tanks in a nursery until it's ready to be outplanted in the open ocean.

But the emergence of reproductive tissue is triggered by changes in water temperature, which means that as oceans warm, sorus is emerging later and later, truncating the growing season.

""Like with any other agricultural practice, when you have a shorter growing season, you get lower yields,"" said Toby Sheppard Bloch, director of infrastructure at GreenWave, a non-profit focused on regenerative ocean farming.

When GreenWave's founder Bren Smith first started farming kelp off the coast of Connecticut 20 years ago, he outplanted at the end of October, according to Bloch. But in the last couple years, Smith hasn't been able to outplant until the end of December - a loss of up to eight weeks of growing time. That can make a big difference for farmers, who are often operating within slim financial margins.

Plus, gathering reproductive material from the ocean means there's less left over to reseed wild kelp beds in the future. As kelp farming scales up, this could pile additional pressures on wild kelp beds that are already threatened by warming waters and habitat loss.

""In the past, there's been an assumption that there will always be an abundance of this wild material,"" Bloch said. But as waters warm, that assumption may not hold.

These are just a few of the reasons that aquaculture researchers are looking for ways to cultivate ""seed banks"" for kelp that will reduce dependence on wild sorus. ""A corn farmer doesn't have to go find wild maize plants every year,"" Bloch said. But since kelp has a more complex life cycle than the average land crop, it's not quite as simple as storing dried corn seed in a cool dark place until next year.

Marine scientists like Charles Yarish, a professor emeritus at the University of Connecticut, have proven that in a lab setting, light and temperature cues can essentially press ""pause"" or ""play"" on kelp's life cycle. This means kelp growers don't have to be at the mercy of ocean temperatures and wild kelp beds - and they can cultivate kelp seed at any time.

Plus, this technique allows growers to ""bulk"" the sorus so that a larger number of ""seedlings"" can be grown with less reproductive material. ""It's a very efficient use of material in that sense,"" Bloch said.

GreenWave has been working on replicating and testing that process in a much lower-budget setting, using tools like a ""$69 coffee urn from a church basement"" to pasteurize seawater in lieu of the quarter-million-dollar autoclave that would be used in a lab setting.

""We're trying to figure out how to take the really smart things that [scientists are] developing, and make it something that the farmer might be able to operate on their own, so that farmers don't have to rely on third parties for their seed, like a soy or corn farmer is dependent on Monsanto,"" Bloch said.

Other researchers, like Lindell from Woods Hole, are working with their knowledge of kelp lifecycles to selectively breed the crop, hoping to select for traits like heat tolerance that might allow kelp to thrive in its current native range even as waters get warmer.

There are still plenty of barriers to overcome as the kelp aquaculture sector develops. But with GreenWave's early pilots planting kelp from cultured reproductive material producing ""stunning"" results that nearly doubled yields over kelp planted from wild sorus, there's reason for hope.

Plus, added Doall, the stakes are simply too high for the aquaculture community not to stick with this process until they get it right.

""There's a lot riding on it,"" said Doall. ""If we're able to domesticate it, it's going to help the industry by leaps and bounds.""

340,"Concern as UK minister confirms beef could be imported from Mexico","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/21/robots-and-cow-mattresses-168m-to-be-invested-in-farming","Concern as UK minister confirms beef could be imported from Mexico

Farming groups say allowing high-carbon meat to enter UK could undermine domestic beef sector and harm environment

Mexican beef could hit UK supermarket shelves as the farming minister confirmed that the high-carbon meat could be imported under a new trade deal.

Mark Spencer told journalists at the National Farmers' Union (NFU) conference in Birmingham that the deal could pave the way for meat from the Latin American country, declaring: ""We have to be fair to everyone; we can't say we will sell milk to you but we won't buy your beef.""

However, farmers were concerned that this could undermine UK beef, which is lower-carbon than that sold in Mexico. Additionally, investigations have found that the livestock sector in the country is plagued by tropical deforestation.

The NFU president, Minette Batters, said: ""I am very concerned about links to deforestation. From Mexico our lines are pretty tough on this having given away so much on beef to Australia and New Zealand. We want the government to take a very, very firm line on further imports of beef.

""Environmental impacts are why beef was a sensitive sector, both in New Zealand and in Australia. And now in Mexico. And we want them now to really show that they are keeping their promises of not undermining farmers and trade deals. We don't want to see further imports of beef.""

Rob Rose, a regenerative beef farmer from Rosewood farm in Yorkshire, said there was no justification for importing beef produced to lower standards.

He told the Guardian: ""I can see no justification for importing any beef into the UK - it certainly won't help UK farmers or food security if the standards or price of that beef is lower than that which we can produce in the UK.""

Dustin Benton, the Green Alliance policy director, added: ""Mexican beef is somewhat more carbon-intensive than UK beef. It doesn't make sense to undermine British producers with higher carbon imports.""

Earlier, Spencer had hailed the announcement of £168m in grants to farmers as a way for them to increase productivity and improve animal health. ""The role farmers play in putting food on our tables as well as looking after our countryside is crucial. We know that sustainable food production depends on a healthy environment. The two go hand in hand.""

""Helping farms invest in new technology as well as bringing in nature-friendly schemes will support the future of farming.""

But the government's latest attempts to woo farmers - who are facing severe hardship owing to high inflation - looked destined to fall flat, as it emerged that the money offered for the boost was merely recycled from a previous underspend.

Martin Lines, the chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, said: ""It doesn't look like it's new money. It's welcome investment that can help farmers invest in better productivity but if they are using the pot as part of the BPS [basic payment scheme, the current support for farmers] pot, there will be less money to deliver for environmental outputs. What isn't getting done because they are using this money?""

Tim Farron, the environment spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said the re-announcement of money already pledged showed that the government had not grasped the issues facing farmers. ""It's an admission that the government hasn't kept its election pledge to farmers, and that they have spent far less than promised,"" he said. ""Innovation grants to farmers could be helpful, but not instead of the regular support that farmers were promised.""

Mark Tufnell, the president of the Country Land and Business Association, added that changes to regulations were also needed: ""Agriculture is a vibrant sector for research and development, with huge potential for increased productivity and automation. This announcement takes us one step closer to exploiting that potential. Funding alone, however, will not fix our productivity issues. We know of many farm businesses who have scrapped plans for investment in, for example, reservoirs, because the planning system is so woeful that it takes too long to receive the permissions. So any financial support from the government needs to go hand in hand with regulatory reform.""

Farmers are being hit hard by rising prices for fuel, fertiliser and animal feed. They are also concerned about lax post-Brexit border controls that threaten to import animal diseases, and angry at the threat of an influx of cheap food from overseas competitors with lower standards, owing to trade deals that look set to disadvantage UK farmers.

Farmers will receive £2.4bn a year in public payments following Brexit. That is spending that ministers have guaranteed until the end of this parliament. The amount is based on what farmers used to gain from the EU's common agricultural policy, but the criteria on which it is allocated to farmers is changing from payments based on the amount of land farmed to payments based on farmers taking action to improve the environment.

But many farmers are concerned that they are losing out in the transition, and farming leaders have warned that food production must be a focus of the new payments, as well as environmental improvements.

Rishi Sunak has chosen not to attend the annual NFU conference in Birmingham this year, sending a pre-recorded video message instead.

Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour party, will address the conference on Tuesday afternoon, his latest attempt to court the vital rural vote without which Labour cannot hope to regain power. He will promise measures to benefit rural communities, including more police in rural areas and clean-up squads for fly-tippers, and pledge that 50% of publicly procured food must come from the UK.

Minette Batters, the president of the NFU, warned that input prices had risen by about 50% since 2019, despite recent falls in the price of energy. Bird flu is also on the rise, the threat of African swine fever spreading from Europe is alarming the pig sector, and the stranglehold of the big supermarkets over farm producers means farmers make only tiny profits from their produce, as low as 0.09p in profit from a loaf of bread.

Batters warned the government: ""The clock is ticking ""¦ The time is nearly up for government to demonstrate its commitment to food and farming in our great country, not just by saying they support us, but by showing us they do.""

A government spokesperson said: ""The UK is a global leader in environmental protection and animal welfare and we will never sign a trade deal that compromises on these standards.

""Our approach to trade is clear. We are committed to realising the benefits of greater trade, opening up new markets for our world-class British produce, and ensuring that our approach works for farmers, consumers and businesses.""

My friend and mentor Russell Butler, who has died aged 88, spent his professional life running agriculture and development projects all over Africa, and his personal life pursuing fairness and equality, including as a Labour party candidate in Bexley in 1966, where he succeeded in reducing Ted Heath's majority but not in winning the seat.

Russell was born on the Isle of Wight to Louise Stone. She registered him at birth as Leon Stone, father unknown, and arranged for him to be adopted immediately. He was brought up in Melksham, Wiltshire, as the only child of Arthur Butler, a commercial artist, and his wife Winnifred (nee Bull).

His days at University College London were formative; like many in the 1950s he was the first of his family to go to university, and he studied economics as a means to understand and improve working people's conditions. He was president of the students' union and made lifelong friends there.

He took his chosen path - leaving the UK to work in Africa, where he conducted surveys in Algeria, administered EU agriculture projects in the Central African Republic and secured funding for projects on fruit flies in Mauritius and and Madagascar, irrigation in Botswana and trade finance throughout southern Africa. I met him in Zambia in 1985, where we worked on a system to increase crop yields and farm incomes.

For most of the 1990s he was in Mauritius, living in an old sugar mill. In 2000 he moved to South Africa, though he kept a base in London. In 2017, Russell moved back to London, where he lived in Primrose Hill and again became active in local Labour party politics.

He had been diagnosed with HIV in the 1980s, at a time when outcomes for that condition were not optimistic. Chelsea and Westminster hospital initially helped to stabilised his condition so that he could begin working and travelling again, and then sustained his long life, for which he was grateful.

Russell loved to play the piano (Bach was a favourite), he wrote and read poetry (translating Catullus from the Latin was a daily hobby) and he was an avid theatre and film lover. He had a fondness for France and the French language, and was still enjoying going to Paris by train in his 80s.

Thinktank suggests projects could deliver one-fifth of savings needed from farming, but agriculture experts cast doubt on idea

Rewetting about half of England's lowland peat would be enough to deliver a fifth of the greenhouse gas emissions savings needed from the country's farming by 2030, research suggests.

Rewetting peat would also help restore habitats for birds, wildlife and plant species. But farming experts strongly dispute the potential for such projects.

Food grown on lowland peat in England has a much higher carbon footprint than imports of soya from Brazil, according to the research, from the Green Alliance thinktank. That is because wet peat sequesters carbon, but when peat is drained and farmed it emits about 19 times as much carbon as non-peat cropland.

The Green Alliance said the findings showed that rewetting peat, through removing drainage or building dams to retain water on the land, should be a government priority. Lowland peat occupies only about 1% of the UK's farmland, so even if half were rewetted it would have little impact on land availability, according to the analysis, but make a substantial contribution to the UK's efforts to reach net zero.

However, farmers said drained peatlands - including the fens of East Anglia - were some of the UK's most productive farmland, so a simple comparison of land area would not reflect their true value.

Farming is one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions but so far government efforts to reduce agricultural emissions have not produced the changes needed. Farmers could be given stronger incentives to rewet lowland peat on their farms through the government's environmental land management schemes, as current incentives appear ineffective, according to the Green Alliance analysis.

Lydia Collas, the author of the research at Green Alliance, said: ""In its natural form, lowland peat can support a huge range of wetland species and absorb significant rainfall, preventing flooding downstream.

""Everyone knows that clearing Brazilian rainforest for soya production is a disaster for the climate and for nature, but we're sabotaging our own environment by growing grain on lowland peat.""

Farmers were unconvinced, however. Aidan Gill, an environment policy adviser at the National Farmers' Union, said the impacts on food of rewetting peat could be substantial, depending on the areas affected.

""The highly productive East Anglian fens produce more than 7% of England's total agricultural production, worth £1.2bn, so rewetting peat soils [there] would be quite a significant land use change and have a big impact on UK food security,"" he said.

He added that there were many practical obstacles, as fields could not be rewetted in isolation, and there was a risk of flooding to surrounding areas.

Gareth Morgan, the head of farming policy at the Soil Association, also urged caution. ""The fens are crucial for rural communities and domestic food production, supplying a third of British-grown vegetables.

""A poorly thought-out change in land management on the fens could increase reliance on imports, weakening the resilience of our local food systems, and contributing to emissions and habitat loss abroad,"" he told the Guardian.

He said the Soil Association agreed that rewetting peat in some areas was needed but called on the government to ""work with local farmers and use their expert knowledge of the land to adopt a mosaic approach that maintains nature-friendly farming in the most suitable areas while rewetting and restoring peatlands in others"".

""A one-size-fits-all approach will be inappropriate,"" he said.

A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""We made clear in our plan for water that reducing emissions from peatlands will require rewetting - and are committed to working with farmers and other land managers to halt the degradation of our lowland peat soils.

""Later this year, we will launch a £6.6m lowland peat research and development programme to help us identify the best way to reduce emissions from peatlands.""

Climate crisis to deliver ""˜ongoing systemic shocks' to production as hot conditions become more frequent, researchers say

Climate conditions that reduce coffee yield have become more frequent over the past four decades, with rising temperatures from global heating likely to lead to ""ongoing systemic shocks"" to coffee production globally, new research suggests.

Researchers analysed the impacts of climate factors such as temperature, rainfall and humidity in the top 12 coffee-producing countries globally between 1980 and 2020.

The study, published in the journal PLOS Climate, found that the frequency of ""climate hazards"" - suboptimal growing conditions due to extremes such as high temperatures - had increased in every region during that period. Five of the six most hazardous years occurred between 2010 and 2020.

The optimal growing temperatures for the two major coffee varieties, arabica and robusta, are 18 to 22C and 22 to 28C.

The researchers found that between 1980 and 2020, growing regions were more prone to experiencing too-cold temperatures. ""The current climate, however, is characterised by too-hot conditions in every region,"" they found, adding that ""the vast majority of coffee regions never experience too-cold growing season temperatures"".

The study's lead author, Dr Doug Richardson, who completed the research while at the CSIRO, said the shift from cool and wet to hot and dry conditions ""we're pretty confident is a result of climate change"".

The researchers wrote: ""With climate change projections showing a continued rise in temperatures in the tropics is likely, we suggest that coffee production can expect ongoing systemic shocks.""

""As with other crops, a systemic risk to the global coffee trade is posed by synchronised crop failures,"" they added.

Previous research has shown the amount of land suitable for coffee cultivation globally could halve by 2050 due to climate change.

Richardson said: ""If you have a shock to the supply of coffee in any given year, if there isn't enough coffee stored from previous years, then you could expect the price to increase.""

The researchers also analysed the impacts of six different climate drivers on coffee production, including the El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation (Enso), the planet's most significant year-to-year climate fluctuation.

""During El NiÃ±o events, we see a greater chance of conditions being too hot or too dry, and it's roughly the reverse for La NiÃ±a,"" Richardson said.

Though El NiÃ±o has global effects, it seems to have less of an impact in southern Brazil, the world's largest grower for arabica beans. ""It's fortunate that it's less affected by Enso,"" Richardson said. ""What we hope is that during El NiÃ±o events, suppliers from southern Brazil might be able to offset reductions [in crop] elsewhere.""

The researchers found: ""Major arabica regions in the far southeast of Brazil and southwest Ethiopia are amongst the least susceptible regions to climate hazards.""

The 12 top coffee growers account for about 90% of global production. These include Brazil, Peru and Mexico in the Americas; Uganda and Ethiopia in Africa; and Vietnam and Indonesia in south-east Asia.

354,"What are fire ants, and what will happen if these tiny killers take hold across Australia?","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/29/fire-ants-found-nsw-invasive-species-bites-sting-death","What are fire ants, and what will happen if these tiny killers take hold across Australia?

The invasive species has been found in NSW after crossing the border from Queensland, and can be deadly and damaging

Fire ants have been found in New South Wales. The invasive species can kill people and livestock, and damage infrastructure and ecosystems. Eradication requires a $2bn commitment - but experts warn those costs pale in comparison to the impacts of a nationwide infestation.

What are fire ants and why are they marching?

Solenopsis invicta, the red imported fire ant (Rifa), is an extremely invasive species of fire ant, so called because of its powerful sting. They are particularly good at spreading and are well adapted to parts of Australia which are similar to their native environment in the Pantanal in South America. They can survive underground for years, then form rafts in floods, travelling to colonise new ground. They have moved around the world in infested soil attached to containers and shipments.

What do Rifa look like?

Ranging from 2mm to 6mm in size, individuals are copper brown in colour with darker abdomens. Their nests look like small mounds of loose, crumbly dirt and are most often in direct sunlight on lawns, near concrete paths, taps and bodies of water, or along fence lines. To check the identity of a suspected nest, the Queensland government says to gently poke the mound with a long stick and then check the ants ""erupting"" from the disturbed soil.

How are they killed?

Usually by bait, which is put down and then taken into nests by the highly efficient foraging ants. An alternative is direct nest injection using the chemical found in dogs' flea collars.

What will a fire ant do to me?

When a nest is disturbed, the ants swarm and a pheromone triggers simultaneous stinging en masse. One sting is similar to a bull ant bite, but in high numbers, stings can overwhelm victims. Anaphylaxis and secondary infections can cause death. A 2008 World Health Organization study estimated that 30-60% of people living in infested areas are stung each year, while a 2021 Taiwanese study found that 2.8% of sting victims exhibited anaphylactic shock. Rifa have caused about 85 deaths in the US, including a 43-year-old Georgia woman who died after stepping on a nest in June and an 87-year-old woman who died after being stung 1,625 times in 2000. Pets, livestock and native animals are also vulnerable.

How else can they affect us?

They can damage electrical and agricultural equipment, kill native plants and damage ecosystems beyond repair. Soil displacement damages infrastructure, in turn exposing workers. A 2021 report for Biosecurity Queensland found Rifa could cut agricultural output by up to 40%.

Without proper management, Rifa ""will surpass the combined effects of many of the pests we currently regard as Australia's worst invasive animals (rabbits, cane toads, foxes, camels, wild dogs and feral cats),"" stated a 2016 independent review of the eradication program.

If they get out of control, fire ants will cost the Australian economy $1.2bn to $2bn a year according to the Biosecurity Queensland report - although some economists have told Jack Gough of the Invasive Species Council that they believe the figure to be an underestimation.

""Red imported fire ants are a terrible invasive pest, which cause serious social, economic, and environmental harm,"" the NSW agriculture minister, Tara Moriarty, said.

When did they arrive in Australia?

Fire ants were first detected at the Port of Brisbane in 2001, but they may have been present since about 1992, according to a 2021 strategic review of the national Rifa response. They have infested about 700,000 hectares of south-east Queensland. Seven other incursions - all linked to ports and airports - including in Gladstone, the Port of Botany and the Port of Fremantle, have been eradicated.

On Friday, five Rifa nests were detected by a member of the public 13km south of the Queensland border on council land in South Murwillumbah in NSW, prompting a biosecurity response and urgent calls for biosecurity funding.

What does that response look like?

""We've had plans in place for this scenario for many months,"" Moriarty told Guardian Australia. The detection triggered the National Fire Ant Eradication Program response. A Queensland government team - as the fire ant hotspot, that state leads the response - ""chemically eradicated"" the infestation to a radius of 200 metres from the nests.

NSW's Department of Primary Industries implemented an emergency biosecurity order across all residents and businesses within a 5km radius of the site. Within that area, the movement of mulch, woodchips, compost, sand, gravel, soil, hay and other baled products is restricted. Breaching the biosecurity order can lead to a $1.1m fine for individuals or $2.2m for businesses. The ants are being genetically tested and all 13 properties within the zone are being searched for signs of infestation with the help of detection dogs.

Moriarty said the ants most likely travelled to NSW in a delivery of turf. Other turf shipments from the same provider are being investigated. The nests had been active for at least three months.

Is it possible there are more infestations than we know about?

Definitely. ""Undiscovered nests are a huge worry,"" said Reece Pianta, conservation officer at the Invasive Species Council. Surveillance depends upon members of the public notifying authorities.

How much is it costing to fight the fire ant?

Between 2001 and 2022, commonwealth and state governments spent $644m in their attempts to eradicate the pests. The National Fire Ant Eradication Program, which spans state, territory and federal governments, was devised in 2015 and funded with $411m in 2017. It was put into place in 2018 and was then the subject of 2021's strategic review, the full recommendations of which are not likely to take effect until 2024, Gough said. A second portion of funding to cover 2023 to 2027 totals $593m, $140m of which is pending - Queensland, NSW and the federal government have funded their portions of the program thus far, ""which is pretty slow when you consider how fast a fire ant colony can move"", Pianta said.

In July, a Queensland Audit Office report determined that delayed funding had likely contributed to the spread. The federal agriculture minister, Murray Watt, said Canberra had fixed a large shortfall left by the former Coalition government by bringing forward existing funding to bolster the national response. He added that there had been no delay in rolling out the program.

Is the response working?

We haven't seen the full impact of fire ants here, thanks to 22 years of containment efforts - efforts that, until now, kept the ants from spreading over state borders. The program has so far failed in its objective of eradication.

The 2021 strategic review concluded that the program could not eradicate or contain fire ants within the scope and budget of the 10-year plan. Despite this year's additional $593m, the Invasive Species Council does not believe the funding goes far enough: not only has the size of the affected area increased, but inflation makes the cost of imported baits more expensive. Their concerns are echoed by the NSW Farmers Association and the NSW Nationals.

""Eradication is possible, but as time goes by, the cost goes up. We're better off spending more earlier to prevent a bigger cost down the track,"" Pianta said. The review stated that eradication would cost $2bn - equalling a single year of financial impacts should a nationwide infestation take hold. ""Is there a cost benefit to not adapting and trying to solve it? Yes, and while there is, we need to take that opportunity,"" he said.

Might the fire ant become the next cane toad?

Living with fire ants is possible but burdensome and expensive. In parts of Texas, people have changed their way of life to cope with the dangers of Rifa. Shoes are mandatory and Pianta knows of a horse stud operator who has abandoned his business. He cites American invasive species experts' advice: ""Australia doesn't want a fire ant future.""

What do I do if I see a fire ant?

""I know it's really difficult but we have to work together, we can't let these things spread,"" Moriarty said of the current biosecurity controls in northern NSW. Report a suspected fire ant nest on the Program website. The NSW DPI is also encouraging the public to report any suspicious sightings online or by calling 1800 680 244.

Police say a dead longhorn cow was found on the lawn of an Oklahoma State University fraternity on Friday, the day before the school's football team plays the University of Texas Longhorns in the Big 12 championship game.

Police were notified just after 6.30am of the dead animal on the lawn of Farmhouse fraternity, according to Stillwater police officer TJ Low.

The carcass had an expletive carved into its side and the stomach was cut open, according to the campus newspaper, The O'Colly.

""It's a very cruel crime to be committed, especially right before the Big 12 Championship,"" Low told the Oklahoman. ""Nothing is worth doing that kind of crap.""

A representative for the fraternity, which was founded in 1905 by agriculture students, did not immediately return a phone call for comment.

Oklahoma State University said in a statement that it ""is appalled at the disturbing display of animal cruelty ... at an off-campus location near a fraternity house"".

Warnings that ""˜slow-moving disaster' in North America raises chances of fatal mad cow-type disease jumping species barrier

When the mule deer buck died in October, it perished in a place most humans would consider the middle of nowhere, miles from the nearest road. But its last breaths were not taken in an isolated corner of American geography. It succumbed to a long-dreaded disease in the backcountry of Yellowstone national park, north-west Wyoming - the first confirmed case of chronic wasting disease in the country's most famous nature reserve.

For years, chronic wasting disease (CWD), caused by prions - abnormal, transmissible pathogenic agents - has been spreading stealthily across North America, with concerns voiced primarily by hunters after spotting deer behaving strangely.

The prions cause changes in the hosts' brains and nervous systems, leaving animals drooling, lethargic, emaciated, stumbling and with a telltale ""blank stare"" that led some to call it ""zombie deer disease"". It spreads through the cervid family: deer, elk, moose, caribou and reindeer. It is fatal, with no known treatments or vaccines.

Its discovery in Yellowstone, whose ecosystem supports the greatest and most diverse array of large wild mammals in the continental US, represents an important public wake-up call, says Dr Thomas Roffe, a vet and former chief of animal health for the Fish & Wildlife Service, a US federal agency.

""This case puts CWD on the radar of widespread attention in ways it wasn't before - and that's, ironically, a good thing,"" he says. ""It's a disease that has huge ecological implications.""

Roffe had been predicting CWD would reach Yellowstone for decades, warning that both the federal government and the state of Wyoming needed to take aggressive measures to help slow its spread. Those warnings went largely unheeded, he says, and now the consequences will play out before the millions who visit the park each year.

The area constitutes a vast laboratory for observing what happens when CWD infiltrates an ecosystem with its original full complement of biological diversity. Hundreds of thousands of elk and deer move through Yellowstone, supporting populations of grizzly bears, wolves, cougars, coyotes and other scavengers.

The disease is a ""slow-moving disaster"", according to Dr Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist who studied the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or ""mad cow disease"" - a related prion condition - in the UK, and is director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.

Dr Cory Anderson recently earned his doctorate studying with Osterholm, focusing on pathways of CWD transmission. ""We're dealing with a disease that is invariably fatal, incurable and highly contagious. Baked into the worry is that we don't have an effective easy way to eradicate it, neither from the animals it infects nor the environment it contaminates.""

Once an environment is infected, the pathogen is extremely hard to eradicate. It can persist for years in dirt or on surfaces, and scientists report it is resistant to disinfectants, formaldehyde, radiation and incineration at 600C (1,100F).

Jumping the species barrier

In the US and Canada, CWD has gained attention not only because it affects big-game animals but also because of the possibility that it could jump the species barrier. Deer, elk and moose could infect livestock, other mammals, birds or even humans. Epidemiologists say the absence of a ""spillover"" case yet does not mean it will not happen. CWD is one of a cluster of fatal neurological disorders that includes BSE.

""The BSE [mad cow] outbreak in Britain provided an example of how, overnight, things can get crazy when a spillover event happens from, say, livestock to people,"" Anderson says. ""We're talking about the potential of something similar occurring. No one is saying that it's definitely going to happen, but it's important for people to be prepared.""

Dr Raina Plowright, a disease ecologist at Cornell University, says CWD should be viewed against a backdrop of dangerous emerging zoonotic pathogens that are moving back and forth across species barriers between humans, livestock and wildlife globally. Outbreaks occur as human settlements and agricultural operations press deeper into environments where contact with disease-carrying animals is increasing.

With the hunting season under way in the US, the US Centers for Disease Control and individual states strongly recommend that harvested game animals be tested for disease, and that meat from cervids that appear ill should not be consumed.

The Alliance for Public Wildlife estimated in 2017 that 7,000 to 15,000 CWD-infected animals a year were unwittingly being eaten by humans, and that the number was expected to increase 20% annually. In Wisconsin, where testing of game meat is voluntary, Anderson and Osterholm say many thousands of people have probably eaten meat from infected deer.

Wyoming serves as a reference point for other states. Since 1997, there have been 92,000 tissue samples collected and tested there, said Breanna Ball, of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. Last year, the meat from 6,701 deer, elk and moose was tested. Disease was present in about 800 samples, suggesting infection rates are rising.

According to the US Geological Survey, CWD is now present in 32 states and three Canadian provinces.

Slowing the spread

In the wake of the confirmation of CWD in the park, the Yellowstone authorities are revising their strategy for surveillance and dealing with more sick animals in the future. Roffe says CWD virulence is ""density dependent"", meaning infection rates are higher where large numbers of animals congregate.

Especially problematic, he notes, is the controversial artificial feeding of wildlife by humans. In Wyoming, the state and federal government operate nearly two dozen ""feedgrounds"" for elk, where more than 20,000 animals are given alfalfa to help them survive the winter. The practice is condemned by leading wildlife management organisations.

""The science of what's needed to help slow the spread of CWD is clear, and has been known for a long time,"" Roffe says. ""You don't feed wildlife in the face of a growing disease pandemic.""

Studies suggest that animals which some hunters regard as competitors may actually be allies. Wildlife predators such as wolves, cougars and bears are able to detect sick animals long before humans do, and they will prey on them, removing them from the landscape. So far, they have maintained immunity from disease.

A major policy contradiction, wildlife conservationists say, is that Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, the three states that make up the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which some estimate to stretch for 90,000 sq km (35,000 sq miles), encourage the liberal killing of wolves and cougars for sport and livestock protection, even when doing so is unnecessary and may be counterproductive to controlling CWD.

""We're still at the front end of a scary disease event, and we don't know where it's headed,"" Roffe said. ""There's a lot at stake for the Yellowstone ecosystem, and a lot at stake for all Americans who enjoy having healthy wildlife on the landscape.""

In today's newsletter: Semaglutide has won endorsements from celebrities and expert drugs advisers and has gone viral on TikTok. But don't expect a quick fix

Good morning.

In the last year, a little known drug originally prescribed to people with type 2 diabetes has shot into the headlines. Semaglutide, sold by Novo Nordisk as Ozempic, has taken social media and Hollywood by storm. Elon Musk credited his new body to Wegovy, another brand of the drug, and celebrities like the Kardashians are widely rumoured to be using it to shed the curvy figures that propelled them to fame in the early 2010s.

Ozempic is still only approved in the US for diabetes, though it is prescribed for weight loss. Wegovy on the other hand has been approved as a weight management treatment. Both drugs are owned by Novo Nordisk.

Semaglutide suppresses the appetite by mimicking a hormone that is released when we have eaten, which then tricks the brain into thinking that the person using the medication is full. It is injected once a week, and while effective, can have a number of uncomfortable side effects, such as nausea, constipation and even a sense of disgust about food. However, for those struggling with their weight (in 2021 25.9% of adults in England were classified as obese), it has offered a route to weight loss without undergoing drastic surgery.

The response to semaglutide, which has now been approved for the treatment of obesity in the UK, has been mixed: many have welcomed the new medication as it gives doctors more options to help people. Some critics however feel unmoved by this argument instead claiming that it simply gives people a cheat code to weight loss without the hard work. As always with conversations about weight, it is often as much about moral judgments as health.

I spoke to health journalist Julia Belluz, who has reported on Ozempic and is writing a book on obesity, about how semaglutide is changing the way we understand weight loss. That's right after the headlines.

Five big stories

G7 | Rishi Sunak has announced a UK ban on imports of Russian diamonds and Russian-origin copper, nickel and aluminium, with other G7 members expected to follow suit. Sunak also wants to push India and Brazil to show greater support for Ukraine.

Health | Research by a fertility charity suggests that male GPs are less likely to refer eligible patients for IVF, raising concerns about access to the NHS-funded treatment. GPs usually make the initial referral to fertility clinics, meaning that they play a key role in access.

Economy | Grocery bills that have increased by 20% over the past year are going to continue to rise, overtaking the price of energy as the driving force behind inflation over the summer. The poorest households will be hit the hardest.

Italy | Floods in northern Italy have killed 13 people, with many people still reported missing. An estimated 20,000 people have been left homeless in the worst flooding to affect the country in a century.

New Zealand | A 48-year-old man has been charged with two counts of arson after a fire swept through a Wellington boarding house on Monday night, killing at least five people. One of the charges carries a maximum prison term of 14 years and police have not ruled out more serious charges.

In depth: ""˜The people who were first in line might not be the people who urgently need it'

Researchers noticed in diabetes trials that patients on semaglutide were losing significant amounts of weight, so Novo Nordisk, the company that owns Ozempic, began testing the drug for indications of weight loss specifically. ""The big picture is that there hasn't been a drug that's safe and this effective for weight loss until now,"" said Julia Belluz.

The asterisk

Like every drug, semaglutide comes with side effects and risks, including nausea, diarrhoea, constipation, dehydration, vomiting and headaches. Then there are aesthetic side effects like ""Ozempic face"" - a term used to describe the gaunt look after the skin loses collagen - and hair loss, though this is because of rapid weight loss rather than the drug itself. In some rare cases, patients can develop a painful condition called acute pancreatitis.

The recent use of semaglutide as a weight loss drug also means that a lot of the long-term risks are unknown. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US has said that pregnant people should not be using semaglutide, and anyone trying to get pregnant should stop using the drug at least two months prior to pregnancy.

The warnings were based on worrying signs when the drug was given to pregnant animals, Belluz said, but the FDA believes the side effects currently seen are more likely attributable to weight loss than the drug itself. ""Ultimately, you don't want to be carrying a foetus and losing weight, it's not optimal, you're supposed to be gaining weight,"" Belluz said. ""But really we have no idea how this plays out in [pregnant] humans, and we won't have that data for years."" Despite the lack of clarity on what this drug could do to women, the concerns have not been relayed in advertising in the US or in media coverage.

The global food system

It is important to look at the growing diabetes and obesity crisis in the context of a global food system that has been ""catastrophic for the health of many populations,"" said Belluz. And the problem is felt most acutely by the poorest and most marginalised populations - in England adults in the most deprived regions have almost double the prevalence of obesity compared with the least deprived (36% compared with 20%). Among children the gap is even wider.

In the US, semaglutide highlights some of the very inequalities that lead to the disparities in obesity and diabetes. ""A lot of the places with the highest rates of obesity have the lowest rates of insurance, and they tend to be communities of colour, particularly in southern states,"" Belluz said. ""It seems many of the people who were first in line for the drug, in Hollywood circles for example, might not be the people who urgently need it and are living with extreme forms of obesity."" Musk was not obese before his weight loss, nor were any of the other stars rumoured to have used it. The increased demand has on occasion led to a shortage of the drug in the US.

While these systemic issues need to be addressed to deal with the underlying factors, Belluz said that the people who are living with weight-related health issues need help now. Essentially it is not an ""either or"" situation. Medical interventions should be deployed in tandem with policy decisions that address the environmental drivers of obesity and type 2 diabetes.

The results

There is not a uniform experience of semaglutide. Some people find it extremely effective, others don't have a great response. ""Some people end up losing so much weight they have to go off the drug,"" Belluz added. On average, people who were obese who were taking semaglutide alongside a healthy lifestyle lost about 15% of their body weight in the first year. The research suggests that weight regain is likely if patients stop using semaglutide.

In the search for ever more effective medicine, new, different compounds are being trialed that are seemingly leading to even more weight loss, said Belluz. ""On tirzepatide people are losing closer to 20% of their body weight - and this is just the beginning.""

An evolving discussion around weight loss

The introduction of this drug came at a complicated moment, when there has been significant backlash against the diet industry and more and more groups have been pushing to decouple body weight and health. Belluz spoke to patients who were grappling with the ""Health at Every Size"" movement and trying to embrace their larger bodies but who simultaneously knew that their weight was causing them some degree of health issues that the medication could help: ""They felt conflicted about it because they did not want to participate in another form of diet culture.""

Semaglutide is not a magic ""skinny jab"" or a simple shortcut to losing weight as it is sometimes portrayed. As well as possible adverse side effects, the drug is more of an aid than a solution in and of itself - it facilitates a shift to more healthy eating. ""A lot of the patients I've spoken to are really resentful of this idea that these are just thin injections where you do nothing and you lose a lot of weight because that's not the case,"" said Belluz. ""They are typically undergoing a lot of accompanying lifestyle changes - the drugs are just making those easier.""

The Upside

A bit of good news to remind you that the world's not all bad

An acrimonious or distressing end to a relationship can be a bruising experience, as underscored in Emine Saner's Guardian article about dipping a toe into dating after heartbreak. Taking your time is crucial, says psychologist Jo Hemmings, while psychotherapist Hilda Burke stresses the importance of ""training [people] to believe that they are lovable, that all of us are worthy of love. That starts with being more loving towards ourselves. When you're in that frame of mind, you think: ""˜Why wouldn't someone like me and love me?'"" Saner also spoke to Lauren, who went through a difficult divorce but is now in a healthy relationship with a partner who ""has completely restored my faith in men. Whatever happens to our relationship, it feels so joyful to have healed my heart enough to be able to open it up completely to someone, to know that I might get hurt again, but feel strong and optimistic enough to take a chance.""

Experts say record waves of avian influenza have been setting off alarms, with fears virus could adapt to spread among people

Multiple waves of avian influenza have left a trail of devastation across the globe, leading to the deaths and culling of more than 300 million chickens, ducks and geese and an unknown number of wild birds between 2005 and 2021.

Today, with parts of Europe and North America in the midst of the worst outbreak on record, a global cohort of researchers is keeping cautious watch amid concerns about the impact the disease could have on humans.

""There is concern about it having pandemic potential,"" says Wendy Blay Puryear, a molecular virologist at Tufts University. ""Before Covid was on anybody's radar, this was the one that we were all watching very closely.""

The virus is currently considered a low risk to humans, she says. ""But anything that has the ability to replicate and evolve rapidly, and anything that has that ability to infect a lot of different hosts is kind of on borrowed time.""

Much of the focus of experts is on H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza that has fuelled, in part, the surge in cases around the world. First identified at a goose farm in Guangdong, China in 1996, the virus has turned up in at least 63 species of wild birds and has shown itself capable of infecting mammals such as bobcats, harbour seals and bears.

The more the virus spreads, the greater the chances are that it may spill over into humans, says Thijs Kuiken, a professor in the department of viroscience at Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam. Once the virus infects humans, the concern is that it could further adapt to allow human-to-human transmission.

""The chance of this happening is very small, but the impact - if it does happen - is very big, because it means that we then have a new influenza pandemic,"" he says, pointing to the 1918 flu, believed to have killed as many as 50 million people, as an example of a pandemic that has been linked to an avian influenza and originating in birds.

As H5N1 crisscrosses the globe, its impact on humans has set off alarms; between 2003 and October 2022, the virus turned up in 865 humans in 21 countries, resulting in 456 deaths. While the cases - most of them in Africa and Asia - were linked to the handling of infected live poultry rather than human-to-human transmission, the figures suggest the virus ""has a high case fatality rate in people who become infected"", says Kuiken.

Public health officials are taking few chances. In the UK, where a duck breeder tested positive for the virus in late 2021 after handling infected poultry, the Health Security Agency has been working to develop an ""off the shelf exercise"" to prepare for an outbreak of avian flu among humans, the UKHSA told the Guardian in an email.

In the Canadian province of British Columbia, public health officials recently warned doctors to watch out for avian flu infections among patients, after a spike in cases among poultry at local farms.

The virus would probably require more than one or two changes to enable human-to-human transmission, says Ian Barr, the deputy director of the WHO's Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne.

""We never really know with these viruses ""¦ but they've been with us for 18 years in various forms and they haven't yet gained that function of being easily transmissible to man,"" says Barr. ""So, hopefully the virus finds that a difficult thing to do, but it's something which we're not entirely knowledgable about.""

He described it as a game of numbers. ""The more viruses that are out there, the more species that they infect, the longer they hang around for, then the more chance there is for something to mutate or go awry or reassort with an unwanted consequence.""

Efforts to halt the spread of this strain of virus have been complicated by its prevalence in wild birds, says Rebecca Poulson of the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Georgia.

""We know birds move incredibly long distances,"" she says. ""And if these birds are infected and are shedding these viruses as they move across the landscape, they can disseminate it quite far and wide in a really short amount of time.""

The presence of the virus in wild birds and farmed poultry has allowed it to ping-pong between populations and amplify its spread, says Nichola J Hill, an assistant professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts in Boston.

""I think we used to cling to this idea that we can control the virus in poultry, we're set, no problem,"" she says. ""And now we're facing a new era because if it has become established in wild birds, that's a far more complex situation in terms of figuring out how to control it and predict where it will go next.""

What is clear, however, is the role our food system has played in getting us to this point, she says, citing the high densities of poultry seen in commercial farming and the genetic similarity of most of the animals. ""All of these amount to a situation which is ripe for the virus to get a foothold and then evolve towards virulence.""

368,"Baby formula: does it deliver on manufacturers' health claims?","https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/23/baby-formula-milk-bottle-breastfeeding-manufacturers-health-claims","Baby formula: does it deliver on manufacturers' health claims?

Many of the claims made for infant milk, the price of which has soared by 45% recently, lack evidence - but the government continues to turn a blind eye

Tubs of formula line supermarket shelves; their packaging awash with promises to satisfy hungry, colicky or reflux-hit babies. The vast array of products - offered at an even vaster array of prices - could leave any new parent scratching their head over which to choose. And more confusing still? The NHS website says there is ""no evidence"" to support many of the claims a lot of them make in the first place.

So goes the world of baby-formula marketing in Britain, where companies have learned to artfully skirt around regulations, many familiar with the industry believe, in the knowledge that enforcement will probably never come. The industry has raised prices by up to 45% during the cost of living crisis, leading to such a rise in thefts that many supermarkets now put security tags on tubs, or place them behind tills. Less discussed, though, is how big business lobbying allows spurious claims to abound in an industry estimated to be worth up to $109bn globally by 2027.

In February, a study published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) found that of 757 formulas analysed, all bore at least one health or nutrition claim - yet these were ""often not backed by scientific references. When they are, the evidence is often weak and biased"", the authors wrote; where clinical trials had been carried out, 88% were at least part-funded by or affiliated with the industry.

In a paper published online a month before, researchers at University College London concluded that formula ""manufacturers are marketing their products in ways that contravene guidance from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), with 18% of packs displaying health claims, and 41% bearing nutritional promises that are ""˜not permitted'"".

The DHSC did not respond, saying only that unpermitted claims were for the local authority to enforce. The rules state that infant formulas cannot be advertised or subject to special promotions, nor feature any text or images that appear to discourage breastfeeding, or make health claims without evidence.

But loopholes are rife in our longstanding bottle-feeding culture, says Robert Boyle, reader in paediatric allergy at Imperial College London, who was involved in the BMJ study. Britain has among the lowest rates of breastfeeding globally; 1% of mothers feed their child this way exclusively by the six-month point the NHS recommends. While the NHS says that ""breastfeeding into your baby's second year or beyond, alongside other foods, is ideal"", this figure drops to 0.5% after one year (compared with 23% in Germany or 27% in the US), with eight out of 10 women in the UK stopping breastfeeding before they wanted to, according to Unicef. The charity is fervent that breast is best, pointing to studies that suggest breastfed children are less likely to be prone to diabetes or obesity later in life, perform better on intelligence tests, and that their mothers have a lower risk of breast and ovarian cancers.

Still, poor breastfeeding support before birth has helped to dilute its benefits - and spurious products play a role too, Boyle adds, by ""falsely convincing [women] that formula is better than it really is, or that breastfeeding is less good than it really is. The claims that the companies make about their products are part of a wider picture of undermining women's confidence and competence in doing the best for treating their baby.""

Though the ingredients in each formula product are by and large the same, ever-expanding ranges and price differences ""make it look like there are endless variations and they've all got very exciting differences between them,"" says Boyle. A 2019 study by charity First Steps Nutrition Trust found that 40% of parents who use formula felt the more expensive varieties were better.

Formula for problems such as reflux or colic is sold by brands such as Cow & Gate and SMA at about £14 per 800g tub. Colic (or ""comfort"") formula contains cow's milk protein that has already been partially broken down, which is meant to make it easier to digest - yet the NHS website states that ""there's no evidence for this"". So why is it marketed as such?

You could ask the same question of ""growing-up milk"" aimed at babies aged over one year, of which the NHS declares there is ""no evidence"" of a need; ditto ""hungry-baby formula"". Again, despite the claims for ""hungry-baby"" formulas, the NHS website asserts that there is ""no evidence that babies settle better or sleep longer when fed this type"".

Danone, the parent company of Cow & Gate (the biggest UK formula provider; it also owns Aptamil and Nutricia), said its formulas were ""based on over 50 years of breastmilk research ""¦ Our ""˜hungry' milks are nutritionally complete and are made with a special balance of milk protein to keep hungry babies feeling fuller for longer."" Pressed for studies to demonstrate this, it repeated that its offering was ""nutritionally complete"".

Concerns are now rising that the industry's claims not only fail to deliver, but are potentially exacerbating other health concerns. Feed, an infant nutrition charity, has found that the cost of living crisis has led to a rise in parents requesting hungry-baby formula from health visitors, ""because they are believing the companies' unsubstantiated claims"", says Erin Williams, its co-founder. ""This false sense of security that the formula company has created could lead to babies being inadequately fed.""

For many parents, picking the ""right"" formula remains desperately unclear. Rachel Evans still feeds her 16-month-old son some formula ""because he's quite picky and I don't think he gets everything he needs from what he eats"", but only recently learned - when listening to a podcast - that their [manufacturers'] promises ""often aren't evidence-based"". Evans, a psychologist, says she remains ""really confused about if he needs the formula or if I'd be better off giving him a multivitamin"". Meanwhile Frankie Jones, a bowel health practitioner, agrees that she felt ""completely clueless"" when choosing formula for her son and tried three in the space of 10 weeks - including an anti-reflux variety that helped him to settle, but brought on ""terrible constipation. So [that] milk helped with one problem but triggered another.""

Alison Thewliss MP has raised the issue of baby formula advertising in parliament via debates and a private member's bill, and says she has seen ""very little interest in enforcing"" existing legislation, probably because ""the formula industry is far too close to the government"". The current state of play ""absolutely shouldn't be allowed to go on"", Thewliss adds, referring to concerns over products that promise to clear up allergies (as parents should be made aware that this requires a diagnosis, rather than thinking they can ""[buy] something off the shelf without medical advice""). She adds that adverts for products targeted at over-ones (the age at which marketing is permissible) feature ""idealising images of these lovely healthy babies"" younger than the age group they have been designed for, ""because it's the conviction of the industry to sell more products"".

Mounting evidence against formula companies' claims and a spotlight on spiralling costs have produced no legislative crackdown, a sign to many that the government's priority remains business over babies. ""The only solution is to ban claims [on packaging] completely,"" Boyle suggests. Until that happens, ""I don't think you can have a fair playing field.""

Aquaculture is bringing jobs and money to rural regions, but a huge escape of farmed fish in August could devastate local salmon populations

Clad in black waders, GuÃ°mundur Hauker Jakobsson jumps into the River Blanda, whose freezing waters run down from the HofsjÃ¶kull glacier. Armed with a net, he casts around the ascending pools of the river's fish ""ladder"", built to aid wild salmon migrating up this powerful waterway from the sea.

Within minutes, he pulls out a 15lb silver fish, which thrashes and writhes against the net, then another, then another - five in all. The wild salmon of the Blanda here in north-west Iceland are some of the largest and most athletic in a country where the rivers are considered among the world's best. King Charles has fished for salmon here, as have David Beckham and Guy Ritchie; Eric Clapton is a regular.

But these, says Jakobsson - known as Gummi, who is the vice-chair of the Blanda and SvartÃ¡ fishing club - are not wild fish.

GuÃ°mundur Hauker Jakobsson draws a salmon from the river

""Look,"" he shouts above the howling wind whipping our faces, pointing at one salmon. ""It's an intruder.""

Sure enough, it has a rounded tail and torn fins: signs of a farmed salmon. He suspects it's a fugitive from an open-net pen where just last month, on 20 August, thousands of fish grown in pens from a Norwegian strain escaped. They have since been found upstream in rivers, endangering the wild salmon population and hitting the headlines in Iceland.

Suspected escapees have now been found in at least 32 rivers across north-west Iceland, according to unconfirmed social media posts, one of which showed fish covered in sea lice, a parasite that can be lethal to wild fish. Iceland's Marine and Freshwater Research Institute (MRI) confirmed the farmed fish have been found in multiple rivers.

Farmed salmon fished from the Blanda River

The escape - at a pen in PatreksfjÃ¶rÃ°ur owned by Arctic Fish, one of the country's largest salmon-farming companies, which is owned by Norwegian salmon giant Mowi - has reignited calls from environmentalists, sport fishers and some politicians to restrict or ban open-pen fish farming. It is not the first big escape: just last year, another salmon farming company, Arnarlax, was fined £705,000 for not reporting an escape of 81,000 fish in 2021.

Gummi with his father, Jakob

Gummi and his father, Jakob, 73, have captured 44 farmed salmon over the past fortnight, after closing the ladder to stop them swimming upstream. At a garage next to his house in nearby BlÃ¶nduÃ³s, a coastal village a short drive from the river, they point out what sets the farmed fish apart for their wild cousins: worn gill covers, shortened and disfigured snouts, and missing or torn fins. Gummi has sent 11 of the fish to MRI for analysis.

""This is an environmental catastrophe,"" he says. ""If they breed, the salmon will lose their ability to survive.""

Indeed, studies have shown interbreeding between farmed and wild fish produces offspring that mature faster and younger, undermining the ability of the species to reproduce in nature.

Farmed salmon with their trademark disfigured snouts and torn fins

There are three reasons, scientists say, this escape is so disastrous: the fish are entering many rivers over a large area; there are in greater numbers than ever seen before; and a high percentage are mature, ready to breed.

Last week, Iceland police opened an investigation into whether Arctic Fish has breached laws governing fish farming. Specialist divers, paid for by Arctic Fish, are hunting down escapees; the firm's CEO, Stein Ove Tveiten, who along with board members could face up to two years in jail if found guilty of negligence, has apologised for the incident.

Iceland's open-net salmon farming industry is in its infancy compared with Norway's, which produced 1.5m tonnes in 2021 - or Scotland's (205,000 tonnes) - but it has grown more than tenfold since 2014, from under 4,000 tonnes to 45,000 in 2021.

However, the speedy growth has brought problems. Iceland's national audit office found regulation patchy and weak and the industry largely unsupervised. It found that the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority did not consider additional monitoring necessary, despite serious and repeated breaches of regulations.

""This is more than a wake-up call,"" says JÃ³n Kaldal of Icelandic Wildlife Fund about the escapes. ""All red lights should be blinking. You're talking about the future of wild salmon.""

Globally, the numbers of wild Atlantic salmon, a keystone species for many mammals and birds, have dropped from 8-10 million in the 1970s to 3-4 million today. Only 500,000 are left in Norway, half the number of 20 years ago. Escaped farmed fish and sea lice - a persistent problem in open-pen farms - are their greatest threats. Scotland has seen a 40% decline in salmon returning to rivers over four decades; the Scottish government says many factors have caused the crisis, including the climate emergency, but that sea lice from aquaculture were partly to blame.

Arctic Fish has four sites in the area

Environmentalists also say open-pen farms cause pollution from organic waste and the pesticides to treat sea lice. A medium-sized fish farm of about 3,000 tonnes can produce as much effluent as a city of 50,000 people, according to the Norwegian Pollution Control Authority, and eutrophication problems - too many unnecessary nutrients added to water bodies, causing harmful blooms of algae - may follow.

In Iceland, the extent of hybridisation between farmed and wild salmon may be more extensive than previously believed, researchers said in July. Crucially, they also found evidence that the hybrids survived - and produced offspring. Nevertheless, the MRI has raised its catch limit on farmed salmon in Icelandic waters to 105,500 tonnes, or 68 million fish - a threefold increase.

""We know what will happen if we reach that figure,"" says Kaldal. ""Wild salmon won't stand a chance.""

He sees the escape incident as a ""turning point"" that could positively influence the public consultation that's under way before a new aquaculture bill is expected next year. One of the biggest problems, he says, is the lack of independent surveillance.

""The NAO report confirmed what conservationists have been saying for years,"" says Kaldal. ""The industry has been given a free ride. They do what they want.""

In Iceland, where nature is prized, most people are against open-pen salmon farming. But in the remote Eastfjords and Westfjords, where the industry is based, it has helped breathe life into sparsely populated rural villages, though it only provides about 5.5% of jobs in the region.

A view of Ãžingeyri, Westfjords

In the tiny port of Ãžingeyri, Westfjords, where the mountainous landscape dwarfs wooden-clad low houses clustered around DÃ½rafjÃ¶rÃ°ur, most people know someone who works for Arctic Fish. Residents tend to dismiss conservationists as ReykjavÃ­k people who don't understand rural life. House prices have risen - a welcome development - and the fish farms attract incomers.

Shopowner ElÃ­sa BjÃ¶rk JÃ³nsdÃ³ttir says that without the salmon farms her store would be closed

At a petrol station that becomes the port's only restaurant when summer fades, ElÃ­sa BjÃ¶rk JÃ³nsdÃ³ttir says: ""It keeps my business afloat through the winter. If it wasn't for the salmon company, the store wouldn't be here."" She had heard of the escape.

""I haven't made up my mind about the risk of extinction of wild salmon. I don't know if it's true,"" she says.

At the pool, the heart of the port's 300-strong community, Valdimar Haukur Gislason, 89, a former teacher and now an eider duck farmer, emerges after his morning swim. The population has been falling for years, he says. ""The salmon farms are just fine. There's more employment. Everyone is pro the farms here. It gives people something to do.""

Arctic Fish site manager BernharÃ°ur GuÃ°mundsson

On a red and white service boat from the port to one of Arctic Fish's four sites here, BernharÃ°ur GuÃ°mundsson, site manager at DÃ½rafjÃ¶rÃ°ur, insists the company follows all regulations and says his employees had been insulted by conservationists. ""Its like we are terrorists or a tobacco company. They want to stop the industry and we lose jobs, but for what purpose?""

A single pen, measuring 35 metres in diameter, holds between 100,000 and 120,000 fish, more than double Iceland's wild salmon population. Each site has about 10 pens. Arctic Fish has licences for 21,800 tonnes of salmon in the Westfjords, with two more sites planned.

Asked about official reports that for three months before the escape, three fjords south of DÃ½rafjÃ¶rÃ°ur, underwater inspection of some nets had not been done, DanÃ­el Jakobsson, head of development at Arctic Fish, doesn't comment on specifics because of the police investigation, but says they are working with the authorities to minimise damage.

""We have been farming for 10 years and this is the first time an incident of this scale has happened,"" he says from his office at ÃsafjÃ¶rÃ°ur, a town in Westfjords.

Jakobsson does not believe the incident has implications for wild salmon. ""We have systems in place that ensure wild salmon are not put at risk,"" he says. ""On top of that, our licences have an expiry date. If we do not behave, we don't get licences renewed.""

Arctic Fish has licences for 21,800 tonnes of salmon in the Westfjords

However, SvandÃ­s SvavarsdÃ³ttir, Iceland's minister of food, agriculture and fisheries, says the escape has had ""serious consequences"" for native salmon. It is the ""unequivocal responsibility"" of the permit holder and company to prevent escapes, she says, adding that she had established a taskforce to examine the regulations as part of a review of the Aquaculture Act.

In ReykjavÃ­k, the writer Simen SÃ¦tre is at an event organised by clothing company Patagonia, to launch his book The New Fish: The Truth About Farmed Salmon and the Consequences We Can No Longer Ignore. He is disappointed with Iceland's authorities.

""In Norway, there's a big problem with fish welfare. In Canada, authorities are facing political pressure to stay away from First Nation areas and to tighten regulation. In the Faroe Islands, the fjords are full. But in Iceland, they are a little naive,"" SÃ¦tre says.

""I'm surprised they are surprised by the escape of 3,500 fish. They've allowed the industry to call the shots and the authorities react. But they always come too late.""

Yemi Amu, founder of New York City's first outdoor aquaponics farm, combines growing fish and growing plants without soil, and teaches residents its benefits

Nestled between a Trader Joe's and New York City's East River is Oko Farms, a little hub of greenery in Brooklyn that looks out on to Manhattan's skyline. Fenced off in the corner of an expansive construction site, it's not easy to locate.

Past the gates is a 10,000 sq ft plot brimming with beds of lemongrass, cabbage, okra, peas, peppers, tomatoes, leeks, onions and carrots. They are sprawling patches of greenery, accessed by a narrow wooden walkway that interlaces throughout the property. But unlike most urban gardens, the plant beds have plastic tubes stuck to them. The tubes are connected to large baths of tilapia, carp, catfish and perch, and circulate water between the two.

Oko Farms is New York City's first outdoor aquaponics farm, combining aquaculture (growing fish) and hydroponics (growing plants without soil) into one recirculating ecosystem. It's an ancient technique once practiced by the Incas, as well as in Mexico, Peru, Japan and Egypt, that's now seeing a resurgence in the US, particularly in urban areas since it doesn't require soil and can increase crop production thanks to faster plant growth and year-round production, if done indoors.

Aquaponics is also thought to be more climate-friendly since it uses less energy and is more weather-resilient than traditional types of farming. Because most of the farm is outdoors, the farm relies largely on rainwater to replenish the system when needed, only using tap water during times of drought, or excessive heat in the summer.

Through her farm, as well as a host of educational and community programs, Yemi Amu, the founder of Oko Farms, wants to teach local residents how simple and beneficial aquaponic farming can be.

""You can put aquaponics in your apartment, basement or rooftop,"" said Amu. All it requires are a few simple components - a fish tank, a tube and a tray with plants - that can then be scaled to any size, and there are even tabletop kits available for those with minimal space. ""To be able to raise animal protein in a way that is traceable and sustainable, for those of us who live in an urban environment, it closes that gap beautifully.""

Amu calls her career in farming an ""accident"". Born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria, Amu came to New York 27 years ago to study nutrition at Columbia University. She later worked at a housing facility for people who previously experienced homelessness and mental illness. It was there that she discovered her passion for farming, after finding a small rooftop garden at the clinic.

""It helped me realize that even though I was teaching them about making healthy choices, I wasn't addressing access,"" said Amu, 42. So she pivoted to farming.

Amu spent years continuing her education while running a farmers' market and gardens at lower-income schools around Brooklyn. It wasn't until she heard about aquaponics from a colleague that she was inspired to start an urban farm of her own.

The first iteration of Oko Farms started in 2013, on a modest 2,500 sq ft plot in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. She moved to the new location, called River Street Farm Collective in Williamsburg last year. In addition to aquaponics, the site is shared with other small businesses, such as Compost Power and Island Bee Project.

The method for aquaponics itself is relatively simple. When the fish need new water in their tanks, that water flows in tubes to the plants, which extract the nutrients in the water's bacteria and fish waste. The repurified water is then returned to the fish.

Most crops can be grown with aquaponics, but it's most effective when used with plants and fish that have similar temperature and pH requirements. Lettuce, greens and herbs for instance, are optimal choices whereas blueberries, which have a lower pH balance, can be harmful to the fish.

Another benefit of aquaponics is that the fish are traceable, which is important amid the questionable ethics of fish farming today. The produce can also be free from pesticides, and the fish can be free from hormones and antibiotics.

But aquaponics doesn't come without challenges. Because of the intricate system it entails, set-up can be significantly more expensive than traditional types of farming.

For Amu, what ""hit home"" the most was the water conservation in aquaponics. Because the water is recycled instead of discarded, aquaponics can use about a ninth of the water used in traditional agriculture. ""Coming from a third world country where not everyone has access to clean water, that was a big deal for me,"" she said.

In addition to growing crops and fish, the farm offers robust programming, including reiki classes, medicinal workshops, school field trips, herbal distillation classes, a farmers' market and weaving courses from the cotton grown on site.

""We don't want this to be only for the wealthy Williamsburg demographic, that's something I struggled with for a bit,"" said Amu. The solution? ""[Being] intentional with our offerings so that people are willing to come from the outside."" This includes community engagement, workshops and culinary classes.

In addition to selling the farm's vegetables and fish at a weekend farmers' market, Oko Farms also sells to a few African and south-east Asian chefs looking for specific herbs and vegetables. When one customer from Liberia who grew up eating sweet potato leaves couldn't find them anywhere in the city, Amu started growing them.

What produce isn't sold is donated every week to an organization called One Love Community, which sets up and maintains community fridges around Brooklyn.

""Last year, we donated 450lb of vegetables and fish to the community,"" said Amu , though this year they are expected to increase those numbers.

Recently, Amu has been working with Becca Franks, an assistant professor in New York University's environmental studies department, who has been researching fish behavior at Oko Farms since 2018. The two are working on a course called ""Fish Talks"", where they can discuss aquaponics and the future of aqua-farming.

Risha Lee, an amateur gardener who started taking a class this April, said Oko Farms' work shows a ""deep respect for the animals, a natural extension of the self-care of humans and marginalized communities"".

Franks said that given the increasing popularity of aquaponics, it's critical to educate people right now on the intricacies of farming practices, especially as aquaponics continues to enter the mass industrial scale. ""With aquaculture, we're in this really important moment in history,"" she said.

Amu added that as aquaponics takes off, it's important not to exploit production. ""We would rather have fish available every other year than replicate inhumane practices,"" said Amu. ""They are sentient beings, and I want people to understand that.""

This article was amended on 7 September 2023 to correct a misspelling of Becca Franks's name.

New rules after some workers on zero-hours contracts last season - but rights bodies say more must be done

Organisations supporting seasonal workers have welcomed the new government guarantee of at least 32 hours paid work a week to people coming to harvest British crops.

In a speech at the National Farmers' Union conference on Tuesday, the farming minister, Mark Spencer, confirmed changes to the conditions for 2023 visas.

However, workers rights organisations cautioned that the government still needed to do more to protect farm workers from debt bondage.

Last season, the Guardian revealed that Indonesian workers owed as much as £5,000 to unlicensed foreign brokers when they arrived in Britain, despite having work for only a single season. They found themselves initially on zero-hours contracts, with take-home pay of less than £300 a week.

Labour rights experts said the new measures should help prevent low earnings in the UK but that more steps were needed to protect foreign workers from exploitation.

Kate Roberts, the head of policy at Focus on Labour Exploitation, said: ""The introduction of 32 guaranteed paid hours of work per week would be a positive step forward to reduce risk of destitution and debt on the scheme. Given the reports of workers being left without any work at all after only a short period, this commitment must include targeted enforcement, with clear pathways for reporting issues and accessing compensation if contracts are not respected.""

Previously there was a ban on zero-hours contracts for workers who came under the scheme, but it was not always enforced. One farm in Kent did not guarantee hours to workers last season until the Guardian contacted it. Even then, workers' contracts were increased only to a minimum of 20 hours, making it difficult to repay debts.

Adis Sehic, a policy and research officer at the Work Rights Centre, said the new 32-hour minimum was a ""welcome first step"" in reducing the potential for exploitation. He said: ""We hope that the government can build on this announcement with other constructive developments, including in relation to streamlining the process for workers to request and obtain transfers, and better standards of accommodation for workers.""

Spencer said on Tuesday that an initial 45,000 visas would be granted from 1 April for this season - 15,000 more than last year - and there was a possibility of 10,000 more if needed. He said that guaranteeing 32 hours and the living wage was ""the decent thing to do - and I think it is vital that we all stick to it"".

Andy Hall, an independent migrant rights specialist, said he feared the ""potentially positive"" impact of the announcement would be undermined ""by the overall risks of forced labour inherent in a seasonal workers scheme that prioritises addressing labour shortages quickly and cheaply over worker welfare and adherence to the rule of law"".

He added: ""Workers will remain at extreme risk of debt bondage as a result of having to bear the burden of costly recruitment practices bringing them to the UK.""

Tom Bradshaw, deputy president of the farmers' union, welcomed the announcement and said it gave farmers as well as workers coming to Britain ""clarity and confidence"" in the scheme. But he said any proposal by workers' representatives for farms or buyers to cover the cost of workers' travel was ""a step too far"".

A government spokesperson said: ""The welfare of the people using our visa schemes is always of paramount importance for is, including in the seasonal workers' scheme. We work closely with scheme operators, who have responsibility for ensuring the welfare of migrant workers, preventing zero-hours contracts and managing the recruitment process overseas. We will thoroughly investigate any reports of abuse.""

384,"Sir Gordon Conway obituary","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/19/sir-gordon-conway-obituary","Sir Gordon Conway obituary

In his book The Doubly Green Revolution (1997), Gordon Conway, who has died aged 85, describes visiting a tiny farm in Kakamega, in western Kenya. On only a quarter of a hectare - 50 metres square - he counted 30 different species of useful plant, plus a calf and a cow: maize, beans, cassava, bananas, vegetables, grasses, different trees and even an area of weeds. Population pressure had forced the subdivision of land, but Gordon argued that this had fostered intensification and innovation, resulting in a rich, ecologically diverse and sustainable farming system.

Innovation, intensification and sustainability were themes that inspired Gordon's work on agricultural development for more than half a century. As an agricultural ecologist, he was primarily interested in the physical aspects of sustainability: in the ability of diverse cropping systems to maximise output, but also sustain soil fertility and resist shocks such as drought.

Equipped with a diploma in tropical agriculture from the University College of the West Indies, Trinidad (1961), he spent the next five years undertaking entomological research in North Borneo, which in 1963 became the Malaysian state of Sabah. His work there helped cocoa farmers reduce dependence on harmful and expensive pesticides: when the spraying stopped, the natural predators re-asserted themselves, and the young trees prospered.

Humanist in outlook, Gordon was an early advocate of thinking about sustainable livelihoods, building on ideas developed by Robert Chambers at the Institute of Development Studies, based at the University of Sussex.

In their much-cited paper for the IDS, Sustainable Rural Livelihoods: Practical Concepts for the 21st Century (1992), Robert and Gordon built a model that emphasised the capabilities of rural people and the need for equity, alongside both physical and social sustainability.

They came up with themes that are easily recognisable today: the importance of resilience, the need to think about future generations and the challenge to the rich to reduce their consumption of the world's natural resources.

""For the richer,"" they wrote, ""the priority is to make lower demands on the environment. If the rich make lower demands, more is left for the poor and for future generations.""

Born in Birmingham, Gordon was the elder of two sons of Thelma (nee Goodwin), a geography teacher, and Cyril Conway, an engineer. The family moved to Richmond, south-west London, and Gordon went to Kingston grammar school. His first passion was entomology, and his bedroom was full of specimen boxes containing moths, butterflies and beetles.

From Kingston Polytechnic (now Kingston University) he went to the University College of North Wales, Bangor (now Bangor University), where he gained a BSc in ecology (1959), followed by a diploma in agricultural science (1960) at Cambridge. After Trinidad and Sabah he took a PhD (1969) at the University of California, Davis.

In 1970 he joined Imperial College London, then part of the University of London. In 1977 he became director of the Centre for Environmental Technology, based at Imperial, and from 1980 its chairman and professor of environmental technology. He directed the sustainable agriculture programme at the International Institute for Environment and Development (1986-88) in London, and then went to New Delhi for the Ford Foundation (1989-92) to promote its human welfare objectives by managing programmes in India, Nepal and Sri Lanka.

As vice-chancellor of the University of Sussex (1992-98) he helped establish the Brighton and Sussex medical school; he also chaired the IDS. The first non-American to serve as president of the Rockefeller Foundation (1998-2004), then with an endowment of more than $3bn, he led its programme and helped launch work on HIV/Aids.

He had advisory roles with international organisations including the Agriculture for Impact programme funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, an international umbrella organisation whose research centres in different countries pioneer new varieties and agricultural techniques in wheat, maize, rice and other crops.

He continued this work into his 80s, and helped shape policy on agricultural development in a world with growing population and increasing environmental stress.

He also served as president of the Royal Geographical Society (2006-09), was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 2004 and was knighted in 2005. That year, too, he returned to Imperial as professor of international development, and joined DfID as chief scientific adviser, supporting its work towards the UN's millennium development goals.

He also chaired the Runnymede Trust Commission on British Muslims and Islamophobia, whose report Islamophobia: A Challenge for Us All was published in 1997.

Gordon was a kind friend and colleague, an inspiring speaker and a good teacher. He loved travel, films and music, and the roses in his Sussex garden.

In 1965 he married Susan Mumford, a scholar of culture, arts and crafts in Thailand and Myanmar. She survives him, along with their children, Simon, Zoe and Kate.

Continent set for further drought in 2023, scientists say, as unstoppable impacts of climate crisis mount

The climate crisis had ""frightening"" impacts in Europe last year, with heatwaves killing more than 20,000 people and drought withering crops, an EU report has found.

Its writers said drought was already baked in for many farmers in 2023. The only way to limit the rising damages of global heating was rapidly to cut carbon emissions, they said.

The report, from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), said widespread heatwaves had led to Europe suffering its hottest summer on record in 2022, by a large margin. These would have been virtually impossible without global heating and had led to many premature deaths.

People in southern Europe endured 70-100 days of heat stress, where the temperature felt like at least 32C, accounting for wind and other factors. In the UK, temperatures passed 40C for the first time.

The heat, plus low rainfall, caused drought that affected more than a third of the continent at its peak, the report said, making it the driest year on record. Flows in almost two-thirds of Europe's rivers were lower than average. High temperatures also meant that the carbon emissions from summer wildfires were the highest in 15 years and the European Alps lost record amounts of ice from glaciers.

Overall, Europe experienced its second-warmest year ever recorded, with temperatures rising at twice the global average rate - faster than on any other continent. Over the past five years, the average temperature has been 2.2C higher than in the pre-industrial era.

One bright spot in the report was that Europe received its highest amount of solar radiation in 40 years, owing to lower cloud cover, enabling above-average levels of solar-power generation.

""The findings are frightening, I have to say, but I think we have to know the truth,"" said Mauro Facchini, head of earth observation at the European Commission. ""We have more and more extreme events happening in Europe. Every one of us can witness that.""

Carlo Buontempo, director of C3S, said: ""We are really moving into an uncharted territory."" The report should be seen as ""yet another wake-up call to accelerate our efforts"" to cut carbon emissions, which also hit record levels in 2022, he said. Scientists recently predicted that the imminent return of the El NiÃ±o climate phenomenon would cause global temperatures to rise ""off the chart"".

Dr Rebecca Emerton, the lead author of the C3S report, said: ""We cannot stop these climate impacts - we can only limit [them] by reducing greenhouse gas emissions rapidly.""

She said a dry winter and spring in 2023 meant more drought was on the way. ""Unfortunately, the impacts are probably already in place for the growing season, so we're likely to see reduced crop production this year,"" she said. Without global heating, droughts such as the record northern hemisphere drought in 2022 would have been expected only once every four centuries.

Prof Daniela Schmidt, at the University of Bristol, UK, said: ""We are clearly not prepared for droughts like we have seen in the last year, given the losses in agriculture, scorched plants and fish in dwindling rivers. We need to invest to adapt.""

The C3S report also examined the Arctic and said Greenland had experienced record-breaking ice-sheet melt during exceptional heatwaves in September, when average temperatures were up to 8C higher than average.

A separate report, also published on Thursday, showed that the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets had lost ice every year since polar satellite records began in 1992, with the seven worst melting years all occurring in the past decade. The melting drives up sea levels and coastal flooding across the planet.

The study, published in the journal Earth System Science Data, found that the polar ice sheets lost 7.6tn tonnes of ice between 1992 and 2020, equivalent to a giant ice cube 12 miles (20km) in height. Scientists predict that if the ice sheets continue to melt at this pace, they will contribute between 15cm and 27cm to global sea level rise by 2100.

Prof Andrew Shepherd, at Northumbria University, UK, said: ""We are finally at the stage where we can continuously update our assessments of ice sheet [loss] as there are enough satellites in space monitoring them, which means that people can make use of our findings immediately.""

Buried in Arctic permafrost, the collection safeguards the world's crop species - and is a magnet for conspiracy theories. Now the public can take a look around



Jutting out of the permafrost on a mountainside on Spitsbergen, in the Svalbard archipelago, the entrance to the world's ""doomsday"" seed vault is worthy of any James Bond movie. Surrounded by snow, ice and the occasional polar bear, the facility houses 1.2m seed samples from every corner of the planet as an insurance policy against catastrophe. It is a monument to 12,000 years of human agriculture that aims to prevent the permanent loss of crop species after war, natural disaster or pandemic.

The Global Seed Vault in the Norwegian Arctic, which opened in 2008, is closed to the public and shrouded in mystery, the subject of numerous internet doomsday conspiracy theories. Now, to celebrate the vault's 15th anniversary, everyone is invited on a virtual tour to see inside the vast collection of tubers, rice, grains and other seeds buried deep in the mountain behind five sets of metal doors.

The deep-freeze, designed to last for ever, is co-managed by the Norwegian government, the Crop Trust and NordGen, the genebank of the Nordic countries. The seeds could hold answers to agricultural challenges posed by climate crisis, invasive species, pests, changes in rainfall patterns and rampant biodiversity loss are studied, and it opens three times a year to accept new deposits from other seed banks around the world. Scientists say they hope people will learn more about their work through the virtual tour - without running the risk of falling prey to a polar bear.

""It is a bit like being in a cathedral. It has high ceilings and when you're standing inside the mountain, there's hardly any sound. All you can hear is yourself,"" says Lise Lykke Steffensen, executive director of NordGen, which is responsible for the day to day operation of the vault. ""When you open the door [to the collections], it's -18C - the international standard for conserving seeds - which is very, very cold. Then you see all of the boxes with seeds from all of these countries. I've been so many times and I'm still curious.""

After the Aleppo seed bank was destroyed in the Syrian civil war, the vault was used to replenish seeds for the first time by the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas, a regional hub based in Aleppo to study crops from the cradle of civilisation where agriculture first began. Research into the resilience of these crops and plant species could be vital as the planet heats in the coming decades.

Away from the panoramic view of the Arctic night from the vault's entrance, the virtual tour takes you down a long tunnel deep into the mountain. Eventually, you arrive at the ""cathedral"", home to the three seed chambers, each of which can store nearly 3,000 seed boxes. Each species is sealed in an aluminium airtight bag and kept in its country's box. As you make your way between what look like the shelves of a DIY warehouse, you can click on a country's box to find out more.

In theory, the seeds are safe, although the entrance to the facility flooded with meltwater in 2017 after a heatwave in Svalbard. The island is the most rapidly warming part of the planet but experts say the deposits are buried so deep in the permafrost that they will be safe for centuries. Seeds are replaced every few decades and if the cooling system ever failed, it would probably take hundreds of years for the temperature inside the vaults to rise above zero.

""The virtual tour gives everybody the opportunity to look inside. We think that is a general question of transparency and accountability to the broader public,"" says Stefan Schmitz, executive director of the Crop Trust. ""What is secured inside the vault is one of the most important global public goods we have on Earth. But we need to protect them, secure them and to make sure that they are conserved in perpetuity.""

This week, the vault welcomed first-time deposits from Albania, Croatia, North Macedonia and Benin, alongside wild strawberry varieties from a German research institute. Plants such as these could be key to helping humanity feed growing populations in a warmer world, says Schmitz.

""These wild strawberries are amazing. They have proved simply by their ability to survive in nature for millions of years that they are robust,"" says Schmitz. ""They can withstand changes in climate, they can withstand harsh situations with hardly any soil and that is exactly what plant scientists and breeders are interested in. Today, we can start breeding from varieties that are resilient to harsher climates.""

393,"""˜A national scandal': how US climate funding could make water pollution worse","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/08/biden-climate-law-pollution-midwest","""˜A national scandal': how US climate funding could make water pollution worse

The Inflation Reduction Act was hailed for its climate funding - but some are concerned several provisions will worsen a growing environmental disaster

The $369bn Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was applauded by a chorus of US organizations and activists enthusiastic about the generous funding earmarked for projects designed to mitigate climate change and improve environmental health.

But some researchers and activists are raising concerns that several provisions of the new law will actually worsen a growing environmental disaster in the nation's heartland by increasing the tide of farm-related pollution washing into waterways and groundwater.

The sweeping new statute, which includes more than $140bn in incentives designed to promote renewable fuels and cleaner electricity generation, could slash greenhouse gas emissions 40% below 2005 levels by the end of the decade. But in its efforts to promote climate-friendly agriculture, it also promotes corn-fed ethanol refineries and manure-based energy production that could unintentionally supercharge fertilizer and fecal contamination.

""It's going to end up in the water,"" Rebecca Ohrtman, a water quality specialist from Iowa, said of the contaminants from crop production and what are commonly called ""confined animal feeding operations"" (CAFOs). Ohrtman spent much of her career as a water protection coordinator with the state of Iowa. ""I can't believe they're going to provide all this funding with no strings attached.""

The Great Lakes and midwest regions face nothing short of a water quality emergency, say those on the frontlines. Farming-related contaminants have already fouled thousands of drinking water wells from Minnesota to Missouri, and virtually every waterway in Iowa is degraded with little regulation to rein in the pollutants.

""It's already a national emergency and a national scandal,"" said Emma Schmit, a senior organizer in the Midwest for Food and Water Watch, an environmental advocacy group. ""When we test our waterways, the main pollutants are E coli and nitrates and phosphorus from agriculture. These are pathogens and contaminants that can cause serious issues for people. We're about to give large corporate farms carte blanche to make it worse.""

A threat to clean water

How can legislation billed as an environmental protection statute risk being a primary threat to clean water? The answer is that there could be seemingly unintended consequences of investments to reduce greenhouse gases and replace fossil fuels with cleaner options.

There are two particular farm-related provisions in the IRA that won't put more food on the table, but will nevertheless impact water quality in the midwest. One will incentivize producing more ethanol, a renewable fuel, from corn. Another will move to limit emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, by processing manure generated by massive livestock and poultry farms. Wastes from these could end up polluting waterways.

The incentive for more corn production is particularly worrisome as farmers typically make heavy use of nitrogen fertilizers when growing corn, said Chris Jones, a research engineer and water quality specialist at the University of Iowa.

""Anytime we incentivize production of a nutrient-hungry crop, you're going to get nutrient pollution,"" Jones said. ""Corn loses a lot of nutrients to the environment. We know that for a certainty. We're incentivizing further production. We're going to get more pollution. You don't need to be a genius to know that.""

Corn is the most heavily fertilized row crop in America, accounting for 11bn lb of commercial nitrogen fertilizer applied to farmland annually, with nine of the 11bn lb applied in the midwest, according to the USDA. State and federal research shows that up to 70% of applied nitrogen runs off the land and into streams, rivers and groundwater.

Agricultural nutrient pollution is the primary reason that the Clean Water Act has not come close to meeting its ""fishable and swimmable"" goal for US surface waters. Because of waivers written into the Clean Water Act, which last year marked its 50th anniversary, nutrient runoff from arable farms and smaller livestock operations are completely unregulated. (Large livestock operators, meanwhile, are given broad discretion by states for managing and spreading manure.)

Boosting corn acreage, to create more ethanol, is one of the Biden administration's goals. It wants to increase ethanol production from 15bn gallons in 2022 to 21bn gallons this year, and 23bn gallons by 2025, principally to meet the administration's national energy strategy for ethanol to be a primary feedstock for producing ""sustainable"" fuel for airlines.

Though the $1.01 a gallon tax credit provided in the new law is a win for corn and ethanol producers, the administration's plan for ethanol is a big problem for water. Corn farmers already apply more than 4bn lb of nitrogen fertilizer to produce the current national supply of ethanol. Based on this usage rate, refining five billion more gallons of ethanol could lead to 1.5bn more pounds of fertilizer being applied to fields in corn-growing states. That would exacerbate the water quality issues plaguing the region.

""We're putting more and more pressure on the productivity of agriculture to produce more corn, more livestock for our fuel,"" said John Ikerd, professor emeritus of agricultural economics at the University of Missouri. ""It's also producing more pollution. Any other industry that creates this amount of pollution and represented this level of risk to public health would be heavily regulated.""

Congress didn't add any additional safeguards for water in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Livestock

The law's effect on large cattle and other livestock feeding operations also is worrisome.

The country's large livestock operations, primarily centered in the midwest, produce hundreds of billions of gallons of untreated liquid manure and tens of millions of tons of solid manure that are spread over farmland with scant oversight. Manure contains nitrogen, phosphorus, and dangerous pathogens that can also run off and contaminate waters across the region.

In 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) identified phosphorus and nitrogen discharges from US farmland as ""the single greatest challenge to our nation's water quality"".

For millions of Americans in the heartland already contending with dirty water, the new law risks making the country's most severe surface and groundwater pollution worse, according to water quality experts.

This is because another feature of the IRA is a flurry of tax incentives to generate renewable energy from biodigesters - large tanks where bacteria and heat help convert organic waste to methane.

The American Biogas Council, an industry trade group, counts 2,300 biodigesters in operation in the US. With tax credits in the new climate law, the council estimates 15,000 more could be installed, including nearly 8,600 on large dairy, hog, and poultry farms. The methane produced could be used by electricity producers in rural regions.

But biodigesters don't reduce the volume of waste. The same amount of liquid and solid manure that goes into biodigesters is returned as ""digestate"" The liquid waste contains more concentrated forms of phosphorus and nitrogen and is used as fertilizer on farmland close to where it was produced and where it will drain into waters in the Midwest.

The incentives are sure to lead to more biodigesters. The American Biogas Council, an industry trade group, counts 2,300 biodigesters in operation in the US. With tax credits in the new climate law, the council envisions that 15,000 more will be installed, including nearly 8,600 on large dairy, hog and poultry farms.

Even though digesters provide livestock farmers with a new source of revenue, the Biogas Council asserts that the extra cash will not lead to an expansion of intensive animal farming operations and more manure.

""That would mean that farms are buying cows to produce manure to put into the biogas system,"" said Patrick Serfass, the council's executive director. ""I guarantee you that no one is doing that.""

But limited real world evidence suggests that biodigesters are a powerful incentive to increase the number of animals - and the amount of manure - at industrialized livestock operations.

Last year, after Iowa enacted a new law that encouraged livestock operations to install biodigesters, five of the nine dairies awarded construction permits said they would also increase the size of their herds. The USDA did not respond to questions raised about the effects of the new statute on water pollution. Corn and livestock industry executives did not respond to interview requests.

""˜Conservation' programs

In approving the Inflation Reduction Act, neither the Biden administration nor Congress wholly ignored the risk to water. The law enables the USDA to fund its $19.5bn climate smart program, a portion of which is devoted to ""managing nutrients"".

The law also provides $18bn for decades-old ""conservation"" programs. ""The Inflation Reduction Act provides major incentives for a broad range of different practices and strategies for managing nutrients, guarding water quality and keeping carbon in the soil,"" US senator Debbie Stabenow, the Michigan Democrat and chairwoman of the Senate agriculture committee, said. ""There are a lot of strategies that work but there are not enough farmers participating because there hasn't been enough money to fund all the requests.""

Indeed, the climate smart program includes $300 million for organic and sustainable farm practices, the largest investment ever made by the federal government for environmentally sensitive crop and livestock production. But while that $300 million has been allotted to dozens of growers, as well as other research and planning projects, these farms ultimately account for just a few thousand acres of the more than 100 million acres of cropland in the Corn Belt and Great Lakes states.

Most of the USDA ""climate smart"" and conservation programs support existing voluntary ""best management practices"" that include not plowing before planting, raising cover crops, and planting buffer strips to soak up excess nutrients. But best management practices, initially designed to control soil erosion, have been largely ineffective at reducing phosphorus in streams in the Great Lakes states.

In fact, installing best management practices to impede discharges from fields can make conditions worse. Two years ago, during the annual meeting of researchers studying Lake Erie's harmful algal blooms, Deanna Osmond, a crop and soil scientist at North Carolina State University, reported that the most popular best management practices thought to curb runoff actually increased nutrient concentrations that cause harmful blooms.

For instance, buffer strips planted on field edges increased the amount of phosphorus draining into ditches and streams. The same thing occurred with planting cover crops. ""Conservation practices have potential tradeoffs,"" Osmond said. ""We have to acknowledge these tradeoffs.""

These best management practices, moreover, have never been especially popular with corn growers and livestock producers in the nine-state corn belt from the Dakotas to Missouri. Just 2.2m of Iowa's 30m acres of farmland, for example, were planted with cover crops, according to the most recent analysis by the state agriculture department.

""We've got an industrial agriculture system that's regulated as if it were still scattered, independent, diversified small family farms,"" said Ikerd, the agricultural economist. ""It's not. Industrial agriculture focuses on production and profitability. Not public health. Not conservation. Not the environment.""

Analysis suggests government policies would achieve reduction less than half target of 30% by 2030

The UK is still well off track on meeting its international commitments to cut methane emissions, analysis has shown, despite moves to stop cows from belching out so much of it.

Ministers unveiled a host of initiatives to reduce UK greenhouse gas emissions in the government's ""green day"" of energy announcements more than a week ago, including plans to introduce methane-suppressing feed for livestock from 2025, and to stop biodegradable waste going to landfill from 2028.

But these did not go far enough to reduce Britain's methane emissions by 30% by 2030, the target agreed under the global methane pledge that the UK signed before the Cop26 summit in Glasgow in 2021, according to analysis by the Green Alliance thinktank.

It found that the government's policies would cut UK methane output by about 14%, compared with 2020 levels, by 2030.

Ministers have rejected one significant measure to cut methane emissions, an immediate ban on routine flaring and venting from gas and oil drilling platforms in the North Sea. The review of the UK's net zero strategy by the former energy minister Chris Skidmore, as well as parliamentary committees, recommended bringing in such a ban from 2025, but the practice will be allowed to continue until at least 2030.

Offshore operators waste enough gas to power more than 750,000 homes a year through flaring and venting, and enough to power at least 100,000 more from undetected leaks.

Measures to cut the UK's methane in line with the pledge and beyond are still possible, according to the Green Alliance. Bringing forward the ban on flaring and venting, forcing landfill operators to capture methane at a higher rate than what escapes from rubbish dumps at present, mending the UK's existing leaky gas mains at a faster rate, and encouraging a swifter uptake of methane-suppressing feed for livestock could help the country achieve a reduction of more than 40% by 2030.

Liam Hardy, of the Green Alliance, said: ""Existing measures to tackle UK methane emissions are wholly inadequate, but it's not too late to turn things around. The government should be able to put forward a plan to cut methane emissions by more than 43%. This would help get us closer to net zero and put the UK in a clear position of leadership ahead of international climate negotiations later this year.""

The UK is also falling behind on its overall climate pledge to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, according to the government's own analysis.

More than 100 countries are now signed up to the global methane pledge. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, with about 80 times the warming effect of carbon dioxide, though it has a shorter life in the atmosphere.

Scientific consensus says cutting methane drastically is one of the quickest and surest ways to stave off the worst impacts of the climate crisis, and could help to reduce global temperature rises by as much as 0.5C within a few decades. But global methane emissions are still rising, and many countries have been misreporting their output of the gas.

Satellite imaging is allowing a far clearer picture of global emissions than before. The Guardian recently revealed the existence of more than 1,000 ""super-emitting"" methane sites around the world.

The UK government disputed the Green Alliance findings. ""This analysis is completely wrong. The UK has adopted early and ambitious measures to tackle methane emissions. Already this means that between 1990 and 2020 UK methane emissions fell by 62% - more than any other OECD country,"" a spokesperson said.

""We recognise the urgency to do more, which is why we are going further and faster to reduce emissions in line with the net zero strategy and carbon budgets, and the global methane pledge, a global reduction target.""

MÄori tribes record changes to lands and oceans, with some food-gathering practices that have sustained communities for hundreds of years lost

Danny Paruru crouches at the water's edge, letting it wash over his hand. Behind him, at the far hill-line, the sharp peaks mark out where the lands of his tribe, Te WhakatÅhea, once stretched to before they were forcibly taken by the crown. In front of him the surface of the estuary ripples.

""Years ago our kaumatua [elders] were realising that we were deemed to be landless people - that we didn't have a lot of land left, after the lands were confiscated. So they turned their eyes to the ocean,"" he says. ""Places around this area provided our sustenance and our survival, over many generations of our people.""

Now, that ocean, too, is changing. On this shoreline, the tribe still digs for pipi, a native clam, wading waist deep and reaching fingers into the soft muddy sand to find them. But other food sources, like cockles and mussels, have been shrinking or disappearing. The estuaries and mudflats are shifting, reshaped by new currents, rising sea levels and the runoff of farms.

Even the scent of the pipi beds is changing. ""That smell isn't there any more, that I remember as a child,"" Paruru says - it's hard to describe, but something of the dark, rich, briny smell of mud has disappeared, replaced by a lighter, sandier wash of salt.

As the climate heats waters around New Zealand, MÄori tribes are recording changes - subtle and dramatic - to their lands and oceans, with some experiencing the losses of food-gathering practices that have sustained their communities for hundreds of years. As the speed and severity of changes ramps up, tribes are racing to find solutions to preserve the ocean environments that they depend on, and carry treasured species into the future.

""˜The whales aren't coming'

New Zealand has borne a series of record-breaking marine heatwaves over the past five years, with extreme changes in water temperature pushing up the mean temperature in some regions by more than four degrees over the past 12 months. The higher temperatures have redistributed ocean species: sending warm-water fish increasingly far south, changing the travel patterns of whales and, in some cases, contributed to mass die-offs including of sea sponges, shellfish, penguins, salmon and other fish species.

Accompanying the rise in temperature is increasing ocean acidification from carbon dioxide levels in the water, which eats away at shellfish, leading to smaller, less healthy creatures. Te WhakatÅhea's ancestral lands lie in the Bay of Plenty region, where the ocean recently remained in heatwave conditions for over a year.

""Every MÄori community around the country that still maintains a relationship with the moana [ocean] would notice the changes,"" says Mere Takoko, the Aotearoa country leader for Conservation International.

""In the south, Kaikoura, they're going through months now where the whales aren't coming. That has never happened before ""¦ That's a signal of what's happening in our oceans.""

Fish stocks drop

At the slow-running bends of the Arahura River, generations of NgÄi Tahu fishers have carried their nets out, wading into the still-chilly spring waters. They come for the whitebait, or Ä«nanga: tiny native fish that travel up the river to spawn. Once caught with the weave of cloth and sugar sacks, they are now captured by fine-woven nets, fried whole in fritters, and considered a delicacy in New Zealand.

""My dad talked about when he was a child, it was so plentiful that they were putting it back into the river, they were just catching bucketloads"" says Lisa Tumahai, Kaiwhakahaere [chairperson] of Te RÅ«nanga o NgÄi Tahu. ""My husband talks about when he grew up in the village as a child, so they were putting it on the garden as manure, it was just so plentiful. If I go back about 15 years ago, I had cousins who, within the fishing season, would catch enough fish to sustain them.""

""That no longer exists,"" she says. NgÄi Tahu still fish for whitebait, but the numbers have been sinking dramatically, hurt by overfishing, sediment buildup, runoff from farming, increased drought and now, changing temperatures. According to Climate change vulnerability assessments conducted by Niwa - New Zealand's national climate researcher - whitebait are among the most vulnerable species to the effects of the climate crisis.

""We're still a very active hunter and gatherer tribe,"" Tumahai says. ""If you can't harvest mÄhinga kai, you can't sustain yourself. You can't bring food to the table.""

For MÄori, mahinga kai, or the gathering of traditional foods, is regarded as a crucial cultural practice as well as a practical and economic one - integral to the process of welcoming visitors to marae, and to maintaining connections to the environment, ancestors and traditional knowledge systems.

""Kai [food] is a central part of life, our wellbeing, everything,"" Paruru says. ""So it's our responsibility then to make sure that we protect what we have left for the future generations.""

""˜We didn't create this problem'

In the small fishing village of Moeraki, on the east coast of the south island, NgÄi Tahu hapÅ« [subtribes] are watching the weather patterns change, and the coastlines begin to crumble.

""We used to go fishing when an easterly was forecast, knowing the velocity of the wind would slowly build up along the coast over the course of the day,"" says David Higgins, an Upoko [leader] of Te RÅ«nanga o Moeraki. ""Now it seems to happen in an hour, with the wind so much more volatile than it was in the past. It's too dangerous to go out fishing when strong winds are forecast.""

In his own lifetime, Higgins says he has seen the food system changing rapidly. The tuna [native eels] can taste salt encroaching on the intertidal zones, and are now migrating out to sea earlier than they once did. The kina [sea urchins] are smaller and less plentiful.

""Many who live away from our village would be shocked by the changes to the coastline or how our traditional mahinga kai practices have had to adapt due to climate change,"" he says.

NgÄi Tahu has an expansive corporate arm of the tribe, involved in fisheries, tourism, farming and transport. Now, the tribe has launched a sprawling plan to push its corporate activity to net zero carbon emissions: replacing its jet boat fleet with electric, changing its long-haul trucks to hydrogen, and launching regenerative agriculture pilots on its farms.

""We have a whakatauki, a proverb that gives direction for all of our decision making, and that's mÅ tÄtou, Ä, mÅ kÄ uri, Ä muri ake nei: our decisions are for the generation today, the generation tomorrow and those out into the future not yet born yet,"" Tumahai says.

""We, as Indigenous peoples from the small nations that we come from, we didn't create this mess. We didn't create this problem - but we will be disproportionately impacted by it.""

For WhakatÅhea, a central focus for now is kuku - the green-lipped mussel that the iwi considers a taonga [cultural treasure]. Around the country, the mussels have proven highly vulnerable to heatwaves: locked on to the rocks, they are unable to shift when water or sunlight gets too hot to survive. In 2020, hundreds of thousands of mussels cooked to death on New Zealand beach in a heatwave.

The changes brought by climate breakdown ""have that risk of reducing our connection to our mussels by not being able to go out and have it readily"", says Dr Kimberley Maxwell, a WhakatÅhea scientist with the Moana Project, a series of studies funded by the New Zealand government that examine sea temperature changes and their effects.

With mussels near-annihilated on the rocks around the harbour, the tribe has over the last decade invested heavily in an off-shore mussel farm - there, the deeper waters are less subject to temperature leaps. Over time, the tribe hopes to keep expanding it into thousands of hectares of open ocean.

The mussels also play a crucial environmental role, says Maxwell: they filter the water and their shells help sequester carbon. ""It's really important that we try to maintain those connections, because they're part of our identity,"" she says.

Conservation International's Takoko says MÄori ties with the seas are ""part of the cultural fabric.""

""Indigenous peoples enjoyed a very strong affinity with the beautiful oceans - we whakapapa [hold genealogical links], we consider ourselves relatives of these taonga species,"" she says.

""A lot of our cultural knowledge is contained around these species - so in losing these taonga, we actually lose part of our culture.""

Every December, the Grattan Institute pulls together a list of essential new releases for the prime minister to tuck into. Here are this year's top recommendations

Halfway through his first term in office, and things are looking tough for Anthony Albanese. His poll ratings are heading south, there's a failed referendum in the rear-view mirror, and up ahead the policy challenges are mounting.

The prime minister, like most of us, is surely ready for a summer holiday. So to help him - and anyone else interested in public policy - make the most of it, we at Grattan Institute have selected our top six must-reads of the year.

Our 2023 prime minister's summer reading list tackles a broad range of issues, from social services and health to climate and identity. But the books have two things in common: they have something important to say about one of the biggest issues of the day, and they are all good reads. We think they deserve a spot in the prime minister's beach bag - and in yours.

Lifeboat: Disability, Humanity and the NDIS by Micheline Lee

Quarterly Essay

In Lifeboat, Micheline Lee gives moving glimpses into her life as an Australian with disability. The theory of disability policy, cerebral discussions of insurance schemes, and debates about discrimination turn into real-life, embodied experiences, set alongside Lee's compelling analysis of the NDIS and its challenges.

Lee describes how the NDIS's disempowering, confusing and bureaucratic processes have worn out the trust of people with disability and their families.

But reining in the costs, making the services market fairer and more efficient, and looking beyond the NDIS to create an inclusive society seem a near-impossible set of tasks. The reader gradually realises that the NDIS has become the only lifeboat, and it can't sink.

The Careless State by Mark Considine

A seemingly endless stream of inquiries has made clear that Australia's social services are not doing a good enough job at looking after people, while forcing taxpayers to fund burgeoning - and in some cases fraudulent - costs.

Mark Considine, a professor of political science at the University of Melbourne, points to a shift beginning in the 1980s, when successive governments began retreating from providing services directly, instead allowing private providers to compete to deliver services.

Many believed this market-based delivery system would lead to miraculous results, but Considine's analysis shows that this experiment has failed. Limited information or alternatives has made the promised choice illusory, governments have lost the ability to effectively regulate or contain costs, and not-for-profit providers with a longstanding focus on providing quality services have shrunk.

Three case studies - the NDIS, maternal health, and worker health and safety - suggest a better way. Rather than the illusion of choice, vulnerable people need specialists to advocate for them. Transparency should replace secret recipes, so that providers can learn from each other, and governments can genuinely regulate quality and manage costs. And governments need to take responsibility and run these programs as the public services that they are.

Are you listening, Mr Prime Minister?

Ravenous by Henry Dimbleby and Jemima Lewis

Australia has an obesity problem. We are getting heavier, the foods we eat are making us sicker, and the ways we produce them are taking a toll on our environment.

Ravenous invites readers on the journey that led us here. It explores the complex machinations of modern food systems. And it details how our food choices are influenced by the industries that make our food, and the environment that surrounds us. The consequences are rarely good for us, our health, or our planet.

The book is written from a UK perspective, but the lesson applies equally to Australia: governments have failed to protect consumers from the harms of modern-day food systems.

Ravenous is a fast-paced, well-evidenced call for a healthier, more sustainable food system. The PM should devour it.

Personal Score by Ellen van Neerven

In 2023, the Women's World Cup brought football to Australia like never before. For Ellen van Neerven, the ""beautiful game"" is a focal point. In Personal Score, they blend memoir, history, and poetry to explore what it means to play sport on First Nations Land.

As van Neerven sees it, the oldest living sporting culture is about working with community and country - in stark contrast to the competition and conquest inherent in non-Indigenous sport. Van Neerven describes the long tradition of sport in Australia before colonisation: games such as Woggabaliri, played by Wiradjuri people in NSW, where players do not take sides, instead working together to keep a possum-fur ball aloft.

Personal Score is remarkable in its breadth. While sport is their touchstone, van Neerven highlights the disproportionate impact of a changing climate on Indigenous people, the importance to Aboriginal health of story and being heard, and the complexity of gender and belonging, on and off the field.

Wifedom: Mrs Orwell's Invisible Life by Anna Funder

People don't become invisible by accident. In Wifedom, acclaimed Australian author Anna Funder shows the process of erasure of Eileen O'Shaughnessy - George Orwell's first wife - who was ""buried first by domesticity, and then by history"".

The book is a powerful case study of the hidden lives of wives whose contributions are downplayed or entirely disregarded, weaving in the author's own personal experiences of ""wifedom"".

Funder collects pieces of a puzzle that make up a complex - yet incomplete - portrait of Eileen, drawing on letters, notebooks, and writings by others. She fills in the gaps with her own pen, oscillating between fact and fiction, narrating a story of a fascinating and intelligent woman.

Through Funder's careful research, we also see a darker side of Orwell - one that has largely been dismissed, even rationalised, by biographers.

Alongside Funder, we as readers grapple to make sense of Eileen, whose self-worth becomes so diminished that she decides to opt for a cheaper - and ultimately dangerous - hysterectomy surgery, noting in a letter to Orwell that ""I don't think I am worth the money"".

With her sharp insight and poetic pen, Funder exposes the ""wicked tricking power"" of wifedom. In doing so, she makes visible what was once invisible.

Recoding America: Why Government Is Failing in the Digital Age and How We Can Do Better by Jennifer Pahlka

Technology is the front door to many government services. Whether it's applying for a Centrelink payment, paying the rates bill, or claiming a Medicare rebate, we routinely engage with governments online. But too often, the design of online services is an afterthought.

In Recoding America, Jennifer Pahlka argues that the problem goes much deeper than the passing annoyance of a clunky form. Time and compliance costs add up across the population, chewing up resources that could be put to more productive purposes (or fun!).

Worse still, bad design can entrench inequalities. When you need a fixed address, the latest web browser, or a lawyer to get services you're legally entitled to, people already on the margins are at risk of being left further behind.

The book draws heavily on Pahlka's experience founding an American not-for-profit organisation, but the policy principles are universal.

Recoding America is a compelling call to arms for better design and delivery of government services. After reading it, you - and maybe even Anthony Albanese - will never look at a web form in quite the same way again.

402,"Why did we protest at the Grand National? To finally make Britain talk about our treatment of animals","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/16/grand-national-animal-rising-horse-deaths","Why did we protest at the Grand National? To finally make Britain talk about our treatment of animals

Society is wedded to a belief that it is OK to control animals for profit. We hoped halting the race would make people stop and think

As a country of people who love animals, it shocks and saddens many of us that watching a horse break their neck on national TV is still considered entertainment. That's why 300 people from Animal Rising went to Aintree on Saturday to stop the Grand National.

We did not fully succeed, and - like last year - more horses died. Hill Sixteen fell at the first fence and died of its injuries. Hill Sixteen's death followed those of two others at Aintree last week. We mourn the loss of these animals.

These deaths are par for this course, and for racing events overall. The horse racing authorities and betting industry defend slow incremental ""welfare"" improvements, and yet horses continue to die with awful regularity: 50 so far on the tracks in 2023. On average, a horse dies every other day on the tracks, over jumps and on the flat, with many more dying in training and the paddock. The dangerous institution of the Grand National should have been retired long ago.

Where we did succeed is in showing that this is a much bigger problem than just one race. We protested because everywhere we look we see a broken relationship with animals and the natural world.

This broken relationship is at the heart of our climate and nature crisis. We're devouring nature through animal farming and fishing, killing our rivers with slurry from industrial chicken and pig farms, and watching our beloved wildlife disappear in front of our eyes. All because we are stuck in a pattern of outdated beliefs that it is OK to control animals, using them for profit. The Grand National is emblematic of this uncomfortable and one-sided dominance - that's why we tried to stop it.

There is a solution: repairing this broken relationship, beginning where most harm is done, in our food system. A food system without animals is already known to be safer, more secure and more sovereign, providing all the calories and nutrients we need and, in fact, using less land. This freed-up land could be rewilded for nature to recover, and we could see wildlife - including wild horses - return and flourish.

It shouldn't take a committed bunch of caring individuals to put this solution at the centre of national debate. But it has. Up and down the country, everyone is talking about our treatment of animals. This national conversation is essential to challenge the fast decline into climate inaction.

Some prefer to focus on the protests rather than the issues. So let's talk about them. Animal Rising is a peaceful movement; our actions are focused on stopping harm, particularly in the food system, where we breed and kill more than 1.2bn animals in the UK every year. All of our planned actions on Saturday were nonviolent. That's different from being disruptive, of course, but the two have long been compatible: just look at Gandhi or Martin Luther King.

We are a movement for all life and that includes animals exploited elsewhere such as in sports and animal testing. The aim was to stop the race before it began. But sadly it was deemed more important for people to have a bit of fun and a flutter than to stop animals from dying.

For those few claiming that our actions affected the horses and outcome, we point to the fact we were not taking action for the other 2,601 deaths since 2007. Direct action has been part of a healthy democracy for as long as there has been democracy, especially when it is obvious that ""business as usual"" does not represent the values of most of us. In the UK, according to research by the University of York, more than 80% of people under 40 do not want to attend horse racing events because they know it is unethical.

Returning to the bigger picture, has anyone yet taken any action that is proportionate to the coming social and economic collapse that is likely to result from the climate crisis? Have we persuaded our climate-insane government to take proportionate action? Not yet - if we had, it would have already ended animal farming and fishing and supported farmers into safer, more sustainable practices.

That's why we'll be taking more action this year, along with all those acting to challenge the existential threat. We're not against those who attended Aintree, or the trainers or jockeys. But we accept Saturday was the biggest challenge to horse racing in this country for more than a decade.

Let's hope that we've begun the process of having this crucial conversation about our treatment of animals and the natural world, and that others - our government, and all those who say they love animals - stand with us to tackle the mounting crises we face.

This article was amended on 18 April 2023 to clarify that Hill Sixteen was not put down or euthanised, but died of its injuries.

403,"In search of lost fruit: the explorers tracking down ancient trees before they are gone for ever","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/22/fruit-explorers-ancient-trees-virginia","In search of lost fruit: the explorers tracking down ancient trees before they are gone for ever

Fruit and nut explorers traverse the US on an ecological mission to preserve the last cultivars of old and important plants

Eliza Greenman plucks a wrinkly, canoe-shaped leaf from a tree and cradles it in her hands before sliding it into a plastic freezer bag. She's standing beneath a mulberry tree in a field on the banks of the Mattaponi River, a tributary that cuts through eastern Virginia to the Chesapeake Bay. Greenman had to sleuth to find this historical mulberry, which is meandering, ancient, studded with unripe, spiky white fruits, gnarled with English ivy and a distinctive wave pattern on its bark.

""It's so cool to imagine that this field was potentially all just mulberries,"" Greenman says, staring out at the shimmery rye across the road.

Greenman is a fruit explorer: a horticultural enthusiast who roams the United States searching for the last cultivars of old, rare or important plants. Throughout the centuries, the residents of North America - from Indigenous Americans to white botanists in the early 1900s - cultivated various fruit and nut trees. These trees' last descendants now grow on remote farms, in forests, on state lands, tucked along roads. Fruit explorers' mission is to track down those trees, test their quality and then graft them before their genetics are lost for ever.

Buzz Ferver, a nursery owner and fruit explorer in northern Vermont, estimates that thousands of such explorers operate in the US, with about 20 in a ""core group"" who will drop anything to go anywhere and search for a fabled plant.

For some, it's about history: learning about a majestic tree in the historical record and trekking off to the woods to find it. For others, it's about taste. David Shields, an heirloom foods expert at the University of South Carolina, explained that our food system homogenized after the second world war and that many fruit explorers want to preserve old regional flavors before it's too late. ""People realize that they once had great things that reflected the taste of their place and that were marginalized by market forces,"" Shields said. One example: ""The limbertwig apples of the south, which have a wild winey flavor that once you've tasted it will haunt you.""

Then, there are the environmental reasons. Many fruit explorers reject the US's current reliance on monocultural, seasonal agriculture, which means planting massive amounts of animal feed like soy and alfalfa in vast, deforested fields. These explorers want to replace that system with one of permaculture, which involves planting perennial fruit and nut trees instead.

""If we come to our senses and realize that planting 200m acres of corn with tillage is not a good idea from an ecology perspective, we're going to need the best germplasm [genetic resources maintained for plant breeding] in existence,"" said Ferver, who described himself as a ""rabid"" fruit explorer. ""We're going to need to keep that stuff alive so it's there if we need it.""

Greenman shares this ecological mission. She's currently a germplasm specialist at the Savanna Institute, an agroforestry non-profit in the midwest, but she's been fruit exploring since 2009. She started by apprenticing with an apple fruit explorer in Maine and she has searched for a panoply of trees, from persimmons to tannin-free oaks, which produce tastier acorns. Right now, she's in her mulberry phase. She hopes that if she can find and propagate hardy, ancient mulberry trees, then this high-protein plant can replace alfalfa as animal feed.

Finding these trees tucked into the landscape requires detective work. Greenman's hunt for the mulberry along the Mattaponi began in 2019, when she read a book about the history of silk cultivation in the US. She learned that an early Jamestown governor bought a swath of land off the Mattaponi River for mulberry growing, before selling it to the Walker family in the 1660s. Greenman immediately began researching Walkers in the area. Her research led her to a town called Walkerton and a Walker family who had lived on this land for 12 generations. Last winter, she called them and they invited her to visit. She drove down and found a single remaining mulberry.

America has a native mulberry plant - the red mulberry - but Greenman is hunting for white mulberries, which were imported from Spain during the years when the British hoped to make the south-east a hub for silk production. White mulberry leaves are 26% protein, which could be a boon for the animal feed industry. And this tree on the Walkers' property is important because of its longevity.

""These are genetics that are clearly winning in terms of the resilience game,"" Greenman said.

Greenman will take these leaves for testing to learn their protein content. If it's high in protein, she'll come back, cut a branch so she can graft the tree, and then talk with the Walkers about what they want to name their new cultivar. If the mulberries she's hunted and grafted take off as a replacement crop for alfalfa, she plans to give a percentage of sales as reparations to the Indigenous populations that were displaced by these trees centuries ago.

Although Greenman is currently on the hunt for trees older than the US itself, many fruit explorers focus on the early 20th century, another golden age of fruit exploring. During this period, said Ferver, white botanists like the nut tree nursery owner John Hershey and the agroforestry enthusiast J Russell Smith traveled America preserving the best crops cultivated by Indigenous Americans before contact. Soon after, the Tennessee Valley Authority ran contests for the best versions of various trees, then shipped out the winners to nurseries and individuals around the country. As the century mark since those last halcyon days of fruit exploring approaches, many are fixated on preserving the cultivars from that time before it's too late.

""It's crunch time to try to find these trees that are hiding on the landscape,"" said Greenman, who has also searched for trees from that period. The trees are naturally ageing out and also run the risk of being felled by a well-meaning but clueless owner. Greenman once went on a fruit-exploring expedition only to find that the owner had chopped down the sought-after tree the previous day.

But there have been victories, too: through sleuthing and word of mouth, Buzz Ferver found the legendary fruit explorer John Hershey's nursery off a rural highway in Pennsylvania and preserved Hershey's cultivars. Greenman found one of the last remaining lint white oaks, a tree that won a Tennessee Valley Authority contest a century ago because of its edible, sweet acorns. And Shields, with the help of a legendary mulberry hunter, found a famed Hicks everbearing mulberry near Mount Olive, North Carolina, a tree renowned for producing a quart of mulberries every day for two months during the growing season.

After she finishes at the Mattaponi site, Greenman hops in her car (vanity plate: MULBRYS) and drives the 50 miles to Jamestown, the original British colony on the shores of the James River, now a collection of wooden forts, plaques and tranquil old trees by the water. At Jamestown, the mulberries are ripening from pale red to deep purple on the branch. Greenman strolls the park, stopping at each tree to sample the fruit, which tastes like an ethereal, less aggressive blackberry, and to pick leaves for testing.

Most of these mulberries line the walking paths, but there's one that most visitors to Jamestown will never see. It's in a maintenance area of the park, hidden by a fence, tucked next to a shed, blocked off by a tractor and a tarp-covered pile. Greenman has nicknamed this tree ""massive mulb"" and she estimates that colonists planted it here sometime between 1609 and 1650, making it the oldest white mulberry in the US.

""I think this is an original tree,"" she says, examining its bulbous trunk. ""And look where it is. It's treated like trash. It has no dignity back here.""

Greenman found the tree when she visited Jamestown and spotted the mulberry leaves over the fence line - then insisted on investigating.

That's the key to fruit exploring: searching for things that other people have overlooked. And once you start, it's hard to stop.

""All of us in fruit and nut exploring are constantly trying to balance our life with putting on our tree eyes,"" Ferver said. ""I put on my tree eyes and I can't even talk to people. I get on the road and I can identify all the trees by the color of their leaves and how they shake in the wind.""

The Cuyama valley gets only 8in of water a year - and some of the US's top carrot farms want a bigger share of the increasingly precious resource

More than five years ago, Jim Wegis, a lifelong farmer in central California's Cuyama valley, could see the writing on the wall for his water-intensive alfalfa fields.

He switched most of his 140 planted acres from seasonal hay to permanent olive and pistachio groves, drastically reducing his impact on the local aquifer. ""I cut my water use just about in half,"" he said.

The change was costly and stressful. Wegis had to spend over $150,000 to replace his irrigation systems and equipment, and he lost years of earnings while waiting for his orchards to mature. ""There was a significant amount of time with not much income coming in,"" said Wegis. ""And it's not over yet.""

In spite of his personal efforts to cut back on water use, Wegis along with landowners and institutions in Santa Barbara county's Cuyama valley were hit by a lawsuit by two of the world's largest carrot producers, Bolthouse Farms and Grimmway Farms. Together, those operations are big players in a $69m industry, and they're requesting that a court decide just how much water they and all their neighbors can use.

The adjudication, which heads to state court on 8 January 2024, has wrangled in every homeowner, business, small-scale farmer, rancher and even the local schools in this series of state-defined ""disadvantaged unincorporated communities"" near Santa Barbara, which includes the townships of Cuyama, New Cuyama and Ventucopa. The nearly 1,200 residents throughout the valley all rely on the same dangerously diminishing basin for their water needs.

But the adjudication won't be so simple. The geographic boundaries of the basin aren't clear, so neither is which landowners will have to face off against the carrot companies in what's bound to be a long process with multiple stages. The case will probably draw in neighboring residents from all of the small towns in the valley. And even when representatives for Bolthouse Farms and Grimmway Farms seem to be clear about a property that should be included in the case, they can't always find them. Company reps have resorted to attaching documents to stakes placed on properties in question, in an attempt to serve landowners for adjudication.

If they don't show up in court, these residents - who have no other source of household water - could potentially lose their right to pump forever. They are on the frontline of a national groundwater depletion problem, in which 40% of groundwater sites have hit all-time lows since 1920.

The 230-sq-mile Cuyama groundwater basin - which spans Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Kern and Ventura counties - is one of 21 basins in the state that are in ""critical overdraft"". More water is being consumed than replenished; the valley gets an average of 8in of rain a year. And locals are angry they have been forced to lawyer up to preserve that increasingly rare resource.

Grimmway and Bolthouse are, by far, the top extractors. Most of the water in this dry valley comes from underground. Last year, it's estimated that 66,700 acre-ft of water was pumped out of the Cuyama basin, with just 28,200 added. This year, two companies will probably pump more than 35,000 acre-ft of water - more than 75% of the water that's been allocated to the entire valley. That's enough to supply 70,000 California households, blasting from the companies' overhead sprinklers. The verdant carrot fields stand in stark, bright contrast to the muted sandstone of the surrounding hillsides.

As the valley's water levels have dropped, so has the quality. Harmful elements, like boron and arsenic, have begun turning up in tests in some areas of the basin. ""The little town of New Cuyama had to install an arsenic removal system in order to meet drinking water standards,"" said Stephen Gliessman, professor emeritus of agroecology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and co-owner of Condor's Hope Ranch vineyard and farm. ""They're drawing ancient water from so deep it has high levels of contaminants that have accumulated over thousands of years.""

To help remedy these critical overdrafts, in 2014 the California legislature enacted the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA). It requires local agencies and stakeholders to prepare a groundwater sustainability plan (GSP) to map out necessary measures for these basins to reach sustainable conditions by 2040. This includes determining a minimum threshold that aims to ensure the basin is replenishing itself and to prevent overdraft issues, like sinking land, saltwater intrusion and decreased water quality. For Cuyama to reach sustainable conditions, groundwater pumping might have to be reduced by as much as 50% to 67%.

The Cuyama basin groundwater sustainability agency (GSA), which is run by county officials and major landowners, including Grimmway and Bolthouse, announced its first cuts this year. The department of water resources signed off on a 5% decrease in pumping from 2021 levels, a particularly hot drought year when everyone was forced to pump about 20% more. These restrictions apply to the central part of the valley with the most extreme overdraft. This flat, prime growing acreage is also where Grimmway and Bolthouse manage more than half of the land.

Though the companies voted for the reductions in April 2021, they later filed suit, asking a judge to assign specific water rights to each of the 73 wells in the hardest-hit section of the basin as part of the adjudication.

A spokesperson from Grimmway Farms said that the company filed due to ""significant opposition at the GSA board to study the interconnection of pumping areas across the basin or to consider basin-wide cutbacks across all major Cuyama valley water users"".

While the GSA can set rules, it does not have the authority to determine groundwater rights. That requires a court ruling by a judge. Figuring out the fate of every well could take years - possibly decades - to resolve. The nearby Antelope Valley groundwater basin adjudication, another California water rights case in which Grimmway and Bolthouse were both involved, lasted 15 years. ""These things usually draw out for so long that all the small folks go broke trying to retain our water rights,"" said Gliessman.

Before California began requiring groundwater sustainability plans, courts favored the principle of historic use, recognizing each party's consumption over time as the basis for future water allocation. That may be what the carrot companies, which were able to pump as much water as they wanted prior to the GSA cutbacks, are hoping to get out of the suit.

""It's an almost paradoxical situation that the people who were successful in the depletion of the basin are the ones who get the water rights moving forward,"" said Casey Walsh, a sociocultural anthropologist who studies water at the University of California, Santa Barbara. ""It seems a strange result of water adjudications in the past.""

This Cuyama suit is the fifth such adjudication filed in the state since the SGMA passed. And it's probably a chance for the companies to roll back the previous plan - and win more water by extending the cutbacks to every resident and small farm in the region.

Though the GSP should be taken into consideration by the judge, this is essentially a test case to see how far or close the ruling will be to the already approved plan. ""I don't understand how the adjudication and the GSP aren't highly connected, but somehow they're supposed to be separate parallel paths,"" said Brenton Kelly, chair of the Cuyama basin GSA stakeholder advisory committee. ""The big unknown is who has authority at the end of the day.""

The suit is affecting the cash-strapped Cuyama Joint Unified school district, which recently had no emergency funds. The district, which mostly services low-income Latino families, has already spent about $6,000 on attorney fees and is preparing to spend another $15,000 to $20,000 to retain an expert to figure out its water usage. ""That's a big chunk of the reserves we are supposed to have,"" said Superintendent Alfonso Gamino.

If the bills get too big or some other unexpected expenses come up, like a major roof repair, there's a chance the school could slip back into another county-overseen fiscal solvency plan. And, if the school district were to lose rights to its water, there would be no drinking fountains, no sinks, no toilets. ""You can't have schools without water,"" said Gamino.

Grimmway Farms representatives said the company is ""not in favor of cutting the water rights of the Cuyama community services district, the Cuyama valley high school, or de minimis residential water users"", referring to those who pump less than two acre-ft of water a year.

But many other residents and small farms fear that even their minimal water usage could be jeopardized if they don't protect their interests in the adjudication process. Many have formed groups of 10 to 25 individuals to hire a lawyer and keep costs down.

Condor's Hope Ranch's Gliessman and his wife, Robin Jaffee, have spent $5,000 for a retainer even in a group and incur monthly expenses related to the case. They use less than one acre-ft a year for their home and five acres of dry-farm vineyards planted with drought-tolerant varietals purposefully picked for the hot, arid climate.

Wegis pumped far more water than Gliessman and the small users in the valley. Still, the 358.11 acre-ft he extracted from his well last year is a bit more than 1% of what the carrot producers used. He is on the other side of the boundary that is being litigated in the coming months, but he is fighting to keep his section of the basin separate from the main one used by the carrot producers. So far, it has cost him ""a shit lot"" of money, more than $40,000 in attorneys fees to date.

Those expenditures are adding to his financial strain and that of elderly neighbors who could lose water on homesteads their families have owned for generations.

""That upsets me most about Grimmway and Bolthouse - how unfair it is to a lot of people like that,"" said Wegis. ""We know who's causing the problem, and they want to make everyone else share their pain.""

Scientists hope emerging research into new types of animal feeds will make aquaculture more sustainable

Most of the environmental effects of farmed chicken and salmon arise from the food the animals are reared on, new research suggests.

Animal feed given to farmed chickens and salmon account respectively for at least 78% and 69% of the industries' environmental pressures, according to a study published in the journal Current Biology.

Scientists analysed the effects of chicken and salmon farming on greenhouse gas emissions, nutrient pollution, land or ocean disturbances and freshwater use globally.

""Both sectors show similar patterns for greenhouse gas emissions, with more than 55% of emissions originating from feed activities,"" they wrote.

The study's lead author, Dr Caitie Kuempel of Griffith University, said while chicken and salmon farming were more environmentally efficient than other industries such as beef, she was ""surprised mostly by how vast both of the footprints are"".

The study noted that 95% of the cumulative effects of poultry and salmon farming were concentrated into less than 5% of total global area.

While chicken farming required nearly nine times the area used by salmon farming (924,000 sq km v 103,500 sq km), it yielded 55 times more product, it found.

The research also noted an 85.5% geographical overlap between the environmental pressures of the chicken and salmon industries, primarily as a result of the animals being fed similar feed ingredients.

In addition to needing fish oil and fishmeal, salmon aquaculture requires an estimated 2.3m tonnes of crops for feed yearly, largely comprising oil crops, soya beans and wheat. While commercial poultry feed contains primarily crops, chickens are also fed fishmeal and fish oil.

The US, Brazil and China are the world's largest producers of both chicken and chicken feed, while the largest producers of salmon feed are Peru, Norway and Chile.

In the future, the researchers noted, an expected increase in the price of fishmeal would raise ""the question of whether the demand for land or marine feed resources are more sustainable, particularly given shifting diets and consumer preferences"".

""Food is one of the biggest environmental pressures to the planet and we're all trying to be more conscious about what we're eating,"" Kuempel said.

""Anything that requires feed is going to have a higher environmental footprint than things that are not fed,"" she added. ""Many other studies have shown that being vegetarian and vegan are usually better options, and even things like [some] shellfish that don't have these feed ingredients have lower environmental pressures.""

Scientists hope emerging research into new types of animal feeds - such as microalgae and insects - may help to reduce the dependence on fishmeal and oil and make aquaculture more sustainable.

""Since salmon is a premium product, they are looking more into these novel feeds and how they can decrease the feed conversion ratio - how much feed you put in versus how much you get out,"" Kuempel said.

""Salmon is already quite efficient - so around one tonne of feed that you put in, you get the same amount out. But using these novel feeds, you can perhaps get better nutrition for the animal while also decreasing your footprint.""

The study did not take into account the sources of fish oil and fishmeal, which are often derived from seafood waste. This may have affected the environmental footprint calculations, Kuempel noted

The McPhillamys Gold Project at Blayney promises to pump millions into the economy of the central west NSW town but some locals say the cost to farmland will be far greater

In the central tablelands of New South Wales, wheat farmers are holding up traffic. The region was recently declared drought affected, with tractors and combine harvesters on the move in an effort to harvest the last of the spring crops, but the land around Blayney remains green.

That's thanks to the Belubula River, which snakes through the town of 7,500 on its way from the Vittoria state forest to the Carcoar dam and on to Canowindra.

Bec and David Price's family farm looks out over that dam.

""The river flats are all charged with water, all the time,"" Bec says. The flats are still green while the surrounding hills have dried off. They will stay green for months. It's what makes this such valuable farmland: the Price's 1,200ha property includes 10km of river frontage.

The Prices are worried that a development upstream could affect their livelihood.

The McPhillamys Gold Project, owned by Australian company Regis Resources, was approved by the Independent Planning Commission in March. It will see springs along the river's tributaries plugged to make way for a tailings storage dam.

Construction of the mine is currently on hold due to an application for cultural heritage protection under federal legislation, lodged on behalf of Wiradyuri traditional owners in 2020.

Non-Indigenous landowners are also organising against the mine. The Prices are members of the Belubula Headwaters Protection Group, which formed in 2018. They say the proposal for an open-cut goldmine, which will only be in operation for 11 years, is outdated.

""As farmers, we've got to keep up with techniques, we get audited,"" David Price says. ""They're still mining in the archaic way they did years ago, they're going to wreck the river for the sake of this old way of mining.""

A spokesperson for Regis says the company ""presented over 10,000 pages of expert commentary, modelling and analysis"" as part of the approval process. The project will be subject to 193 consent conditions from both the state and federal government, and its compliance with those conditions will be ""regularly audited and enforced by government agencies"".

Bec Price argues the productive land should be kept for farming. ""We don't need gold to survive. But we need to eat, and we need water to eat.""

Blayney art gallery owner Bradley Bradley is more supportive, because mining companies - including Regis and Newcrest, which owns the nearby Cadia goldmine - have a history of supporting local artists.

""It's all about understanding the value of legacy,"" he says. ""Not many businesses understand the value of sponsoring art or artists. Mining companies do.""

He says the proposed McPhillamys mine is not ""essential"" but is ""a benefit"" to the community.

""˜What are the locals left with?'

Mining companies offer substantial financial support to regional communities - at least while business is booming, says Dr Jo-Anne Everingham, an honorary fellow with the University of Queensland and former researcher with the Centre for Social Responsibility in Mining.

""Mining is a finite business, and a volatile one,"" she says. ""While things are booming, there will be some trickle down to the locals, but when the market slumps, or the mine has depleted, what are the locals left with?""

Everingham says mining companies promise jobs and other economic opportunities around the construction and operation of a mine, but the trade-off is the environmental impact. The regulators are housed in the same department as those tasked with promoting the industry. ""Balancing those key tensions is a big challenge,"" she says.

A spokesperson for Regis Resources says it will be seeking to ""recruit locally to fill as many positions as possible"", as well as hiring local suppliers. ""That includes considering rosters for certain roles that make it possible for people like farmers to draw an off-farm income if they choose to.""

The company claims the mine will make an estimated $67m contribution to direct and indirect household incomes across the region each year, based on economic analysis provided to the Independent Planning Commission.

Luke Davies works at the Exchange hotel and Goldfields Motor Inn in Blayney, where rooms have been rented out to Cadia on a two-year contract. He is anticipating hiring further staff once construction begins on the McPhillamys mine.

""It's just gonna be ridiculous,"" he says. ""We indirectly employ 15 or 20 people because of [Cadia], so it's only gonna get better isn't it? The infrastructure is going to have to double, which is great.""

Others are less optimistic.

""These miners aren't going to be living in Blayney,"" says local cafe owner and honey producer Vicki Lockwood. ""They're going to be in Orange or Bathurst, if they're high-end wage earners. They'll want to use the services of Orange and Bathurst.""

Lockwood and her family bought land for their beekeeping and honey processing facility in 2000 and opened the cafe in 2010. She says there have been ""no extensive studies"" done on the potential effect of the mine on surrounding agribusinesses, and particularly on beekeeping.

""We are not a lowly industry, we're the basis of all agriculture,"" she says. ""Everything you eat, even your meat ""¦ we're feeding the miners. We can't put a dollar value on that.""

A condition of the mine's approval is to provide independent apiary monitoring, including baseline studies, to assess and respond to the impact of mining on nearby beehives, but this is not proactive enough for Lockwood.

She is among a group of locals who have raised concerns about air and dust pollution, following investigations by the NSW Environmental Protection Authority into beaches of air quality regulations from the underground coalmine at Cadia, near Orange.

Lockwood says she feels a loss of control over her own business, and fears potential conflict with the mine. ""Why invest in our future?"" she says. ""If we can't work with the mine, if they're going to just walk all over us.""

Bec and David Price fought against the mine since it was first proposed and are now trying to plan around the uncertain impact it may have on their farm. That fight has become a feature in their children's lives - and they are also worried.

""Our kids have lived through this for six years, really quite formative years,"" Bec Price says. ""We've always been really transparent with them, that this may not be where they can potentially get into farming, if they choose.

""We need to stop this from happening anywhere else ever again.""

The development economist Michael Lipton, who has died aged 86, credited an important part of his education to the people of the village of Kavathe in Maharashtra state, India. His research there in 1965-66 anchored a lifetime devoted to understanding, explaining and advocating for poor rural people around the world.

Rather than being backward and conservative as some supposed, such communities acted rationally and managed resources efficiently. In his paper The Theory of the Optimising Peasant (1968), Michael explained that poor, small farmers were often reluctant to adopt new varieties of wheat and rice such as those rolled out in the green revolution of the mid-20th century, despite the average yield being higher than that of traditional varieties. This was because when the new varieties failed, because of drought or disease, they did so more spectacularly than traditional varieties, and thus increased the risk of hunger and destitution. When later generations of the green revolution crops reduced the risk, poor farmers adopted them with enthusiasm.

Michael also showed that in land-scarce situations, poor farmers managed the land more intensively and more efficiently than richer ones; and he debunked the idea that poor farmers were wasteful, showing that grain losses on farms were often minimal.

These ideas helped overturn the idea that national development could only come via industrialisation, at the expense, usually via high taxation, of rural areas. Michael's big book, Why Poor People Stay Poor: Urban Bias and World Development (1977), set out to map in detail the ways in which urban-focused elites and policymakers discriminated against the rural poor.

In other work, Michael crossed the boundaries of disciplines to explore the linkages between agriculture, health and nutrition. In a short book for the World Health Organisation with Emanuel de Kadt, Agriculture-Health Linkages (1988), the authors demonstrated how the health and nutrition of rural people were shaped by agricultural policy: what was grown, at what price, and where. They showed how to make agricultural policymaking and institutions more responsive to the health needs of poor people, especially women, in rural areas.

Michael's interest in development economics was sparked by Paul Streeten at Oxford, and by research for Gunnar Myrdal, author of what eventually became Asian Drama: An Inquiry Into the Poverty of Nations (1968). In 1966 he married Merle Babrow, a historian and political analyst from South Africa, and they shared a long-term interest in rural development and social change there.

The countries he advised included India and Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Sudan, Botswana and South Africa. He worked with banks, aid agencies and foundations, and in 2001 was the main author of the first Rural Poverty report for the International Fund for Agricultural Development. Characteristic of his initiatives were market-based approaches to land reform in southern Africa, seeking to overturn the historic inequity of land appropriation by colonial interests while avoiding violent conflict.

Born in London, Michael was the son of Helen and Leslie Lipton, Ã©migrÃ©s from Hamburg. From Haberdashers' school, then in Hampstead, he went on to Balliol College, Oxford, where he gained a first in philosophy, politics and economics (1960), and to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

He was an elected fellow of All Souls, Oxford (1961-68 and 1983-84), and held professorial posts at both the Institute of Development Studies in Brighton and at the University of Sussex. He was founding director of the university's Poverty Research Unit (1994-97), now the Centre for Poverty and Inequality Research. He also had attachments with the World Bank and the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington, where he was director of the consumption and nutrition division (1987-89).

In 2003 Michael was appointed CMG; in 2006 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy; and in 2012 he won the Leontief prize, for contributions to economic theory that address contemporary realities and support just and sustainable societies.

He was devoted to his family, and to classical music, running and chess. On the last of these, he published a number of books, including the co-authored The Two-Move Chess Problem (1966), and Collected Chess Problems of Michael Lipton (2016). From 2000 to 2002 he was president of the British Chess Problem Society.

In his professional relationships Michael was rigorous and uncompromising, but he was also hospitable, generous and sympathetic.

Merle died in 2022. Michael is survived by his son, Emanuel, and his grandson, Joshua.

Thessaly, one of Greece's breadbaskets, has been left devastated with crops ruined and animals dead

Four years ago, Poppy Georgiou returned to the village where she grew up in north-east Pelion in the hope of creating a better life among the apple and chestnut orchards. She had studied in Thessaloniki but it had been difficult to get by and she decided to move back to Pouri to work alongside her family and community on the mountain in Thessaly that looms above the Aegean.

But that future, along with many others', is in jeopardy. The 28-year-old, who cultivates apples, chestnuts, cherries and olives across 50 acres of land with her husband and parents, found hope hard to find after Thessaly was battered by Storm Daniel at the beginning of the month, devastating the agricultural region that is one of Greece's breadbaskets.

Experts say the storm, which proceeded to claim thousands of lives in Libya, will have lasting consequences. Thessaly is the source of a quarter of Greece's agricultural production, and a leading disaster management expert told Greek state television that after the storm it would take at least five years for the plain to become fertile again. Worries of shortages and price hikes were brewing.

And that was before a second weather event, Storm Elias, battered large parts of central Greece on Wednesday, cutting power and flooding homes. The government has declared that adapting to the climate crisis has become a national priority.

""It's been chaos,"" Georgiou said after torrential rain lashed the region once more. On Wednesday night, the European Severe Weather Database (ESWD) said a month's worth of rain had fallen within the previous 24 hours.

Even before Storm Elias gathered force, the future looked dark for Thessaly's agricultural communities. ""I'm not optimistic, because the damage is enormous - it will be difficult to get compensation on this scale,"" Georgiou said.

""But if we don't get it, we'll be forced to leave our homes. We're all battling together for compensation. Around here, everyone makes a living through agriculture - it's the main source of work.""

Georgiou said her cousin lost 30 olive trees, emphasising that she was using the word ""lost"" in the literal sense: they were swept away entirely, probably into the sea.

The harvest had not yet begun when Storm Daniel hit, and before Storm Elias arrived this week the family had gathered just a fraction of the thousands of apple crates they normally sell. ""So much of the produce has been lost,"" she said. Chestnuts had not yet been harvested. ""It's a very upsetting situation. In the region, we'll have money problems - that's the only sure thing.""

Nearly a month on from Storm Daniel, the situation remains dire for people in the village. The bridge that connects Pouri to the village of Zagora is impassable by car, meaning local children cannot attend school there because of the danger. When emergency supplies including bottled water have been delivered, villagers have had to cross on foot. Water remains unsafe in swathes of Thessaly; after the storm, gastroenteritis cases have plagued the area.

Georgiou and others in the village have been ferrying the produce they have been able to harvest to their cooperative in Zagora. With the bridge still in disrepair, she says of traversing an alternative road that feels unsafe: ""Every time we cross, it feels like we are playing with our lives. But what else can we do?""

To the west in Karditsa, Thomas Gkotzas, a beekeeper, had been married for two days when Storm Daniel hit. The celebratory atmosphere did not last long. ""The day after the wedding, I was incredibly anxious, pacing,"" he said. He was right to worry.

When the storm unleashed a year's worth of rain on Thessaly in 48 hours, Gkotzas lost 300 beehives. In the week after the first cataclysm, he found a hive that had been carried 7km (4.3 miles) away. ""I believe the other hives will be in the sea."" Other hives were filled with dead bees, their honey mixed with mud.

Like Georgiou, Gkotzas, 32, had returned to work alongside his family in Karditsa in recent years, after eight years of living in the UK. The family has been producing honey for generations, and Gkotzas expanded the business, taking their number of hives to 750. Things seemed to be going well, and the family had been exporting their organic honey to the UK. ""Unfortunately, this will take us back years,"" Gkotzas said.

Mosquitoes swarm day and night. ""The smell is horrible - you need to wear a mask,"" he said. It is estimated that more than 85,000 animals have drowned, creating a risk of disease. ""In these kinds of disasters, people around here just try to help each another.""

The devastation wreaked on the surrounding land means Gkotzas will need to move his bees in the coming months. ""Thessaly has been set back years. People are talking about going hungry. In this soil, I don't think you will be able to grow anything properly for three to four years. I've found dead fish in the soil. The earth is sick.""

Gkotzas projects that his output will be halved next year. ""We're still picking up the pieces. It will take years to increase the populations, but we will build them up again.""

In Platikampos, Larissa prefecture, Thanasis Tzikoulis, 40, an arable farmer, had not yet managed to appraise the full extent of the damage before Storm Elias hit, but he believes he lost about 70% of his cotton crop and at least half of his corn. Tzikoulis, who also grows wheat among other crops across 300 acres and sells his produce to local and multinational manufacturers, said the state of farming looked bleak.

The devastation will have knock-on effects across the whole of Greece, with shortages and price rises expected in a country already deeply affected by the cost of living crisis.

""The catastrophe is huge - I was lucky to only suffer the damage I did, others have it even worse. It will be a problem for manufacturers, and consumers will see a rise in prices. There'll be a serious shortage of animal feed too. This time of year, contracts are being signed for produce and wholesale prices are likely to soar. I expect that from this year, we'll see a significant rise in the price of products like feta,"" Tzikoulis said.

Like the others, Tzikoulis did not have much hope of being lifted out of trouble by government assistance. People in some parts of the region remained economically affected by the Medicane Ianos storm in 2020, he said.

""One bad harvest makes the next difficult, even in normal circumstances"" he said. ""But right now, the word ""˜normal' is no longer in our vocabulary.""

The US south-west's Medjool dates are descended from 11 plants brought from Morocco 100 years ago

The air feels like an oven this time of year in the Bard valley. The temperature has reached over 110F every day for weeks now - some days coming close to 120F - forcing most residents of the agricultural valley, nestled at the intersection of the Arizona, California and Mexican borders, inside. But the date palms at Sun Garden Farms love it.

As a heatwave rolls across the south-west, leaving cities like Phoenix and Death Valley national park experiencing record-setting temperatures, crops are wilting in the extreme heat - leaving many farmers worried their yields will fall come harvest. But here, the heat, however extreme it feels, is welcomed. Dates are built for desert climates and the temperature will help the fruits ripen as their sugars develop.

Hundreds of date palms fill Sun Garden Farms' nearly 200-acre property. But each palm, and every other one of the thousands of date palms grown across the Bard valley region, are descendants of just one palm that was growing in Morocco nearly a hundred years ago. When the harvest begins next month, the grandchildren of that Moroccan date palm will feed date lovers across the world - even as other crops struggle to survive rising temperatures.

In the south-westernmost corner of Arizona, just 3 miles from California and 10 miles from Mexico, the town of Yuma is one of North America's most important agricultural hubs. Nicknamed ""The Winter Salad Bowl"", the Yuma area supplies the United States and Canada with 90% of its winter, leafy vegetables - even in the coldest months of winter, temperatures don't generally fall below 50F.

Although most of Yuma's agricultural activity occurs in the wintertime, it's particularly well-known for one summer crop: the Medjool date, which is also grown in neighboring parts of California and Mexico. Nearly 100 years after it first arrived in the United States, the Medjool date is weathering the extreme heat better than many other crops - largely because it was imported in the early 1900s because of its ability to thrive in a hot, dry climate.

""They do well because that's what they like: hot or dry weather, especially in the fruiting season,"" said Dennis V Johnson, author of Imported and American Varieties of Dates in the United States. ""What they really require is about four months of very low rainfall, low humidity and high temperatures.""

Juan Guzman, senior vice-president of operations at the Yuma-based date company Natural Delights, agrees: ""The old adage is that Medjool dates require 100 days over 100 degrees to thrive.""

Date palms have been grown in the Americas since at least the 1700s, when Spanish missionaries began settling in parts of modern-day California and Arizona. But the Medjool date variety did not arrive until much later, after the newly established US Department of Agriculture began hiring ""agricultural explorers"" to travel the world to collect new plants.

One of those first explorers was botanist Walter T Swingle, who traveled to Morocco in 1927 to study a fungal disease that had begun infecting date palms there. Although agricultural explorers had imported dates from Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and Iraq as early as 1890, Swingle was captivated by the Medjool dates he found in Morocco - they were nicknamed ""the fruit of kings"" because they were once only eaten by royalty.

After taking soil and air temperatures, and determining that the Medjool date might successfully be grown in the American south-west - a region then nicknamed ""the Sahara of the United States"" - Swingle purchased 11 offshoots from a single female date palm. But before these Medjool dates could be grown as crops in the US, they had to be quarantined to make sure the fungus that had infected Morocco's Medjools wouldn't spread. For the next nine years, the 11 palms were quarantined in the Nevada desert. In 1936, the palms were finally released - nine had survived, two dug up by a caretaker's dog - and replanted in Indio, California, where the USDA was already growing a variety of dates, including the popular Deglet Noor variety, which Swingle had brought home from Algeria in 1900.

In the 1940s, the USDA began distributing those nine Medjool date palms to growers.

""Six of those were planted in Bard valley at the intersection of California, Arizona, and Mexico along the Colorado River,"" David Baxter, director of marketing at Natural Delights, said in an email. ""Medjool dates demand a very specific set of growing conditions where high heat, low humidity and plentiful water meet, and Bard valley is the most ideal location in the United States."" Alongside the arid climate, the Bard valley also has access to deep aquifers.

All six of those palms, as it happened, ended up at Sun Garden Farms, where businessman and lawyer Stephen Philip Shadle opened a date grove. By the 1990s, Shadle and several other date growers in the region would come together to form the Bard Valley Date Growers Association.

Although there are about 3,000 varieties of dates grown worldwide, Medjools are one of the most popular - in part because of the advocacy of growers' groups and in part because Medjools are larger, softer and sweeter than many other varieties. Like other dates, they're also good for you.

""Medjool dates are a healthy option any time of year thanks to their potassium, magnesium and fiber content in addition to the fact that they are low on the glycemic index,"" said Baxter.

While this year's extreme heat has actually been beneficial to the date crop, there are other ways that climate crisis could affect their growth.

""The thing to worry about would be if there are some climatic changes that bring about more rainfall than normal,"" said Johnson.

Heat itself isn't enough for a successful date crop: it's key that it continues being dry heat.

Today, two of the original date palms that Swingle imported from Morocco still stand - at Sun Garden Farms. Towering nearly 100ft in the sky, the two palms look over the Bard valley, where over the past 70 years thousands of their offspring have grown.

Countries forced to choose between climate resilience, fighting poverty and paying debts, says Ban Ki-moon

The flow of climate adaptation finance to Africa must increase up to tenfold by 2035 to meet the deepening effects of the climate crisis, according to research.

As the Africa Climate Summit continued in Nairobi, campaigners spoke of the desperate need to get funding to people who are already being affected by climate change. Africa, the region most impacted by the climate emergency, receives only 3% of global climate finance.

A Kenyan farmer, Phoebe Mwangangi, told attendees that changes in rainfall patterns in her south-eastern Makueni home town nearly 10 years ago meant that back then she had to walk for hours every day to find water for her livestock, disrupting her and her children's lives. Yields were low and her cattle had grown weak, leaving her struggling to make ends meet.

""Farming and livestock is our livelihood, so we cannot do without it,"" said Mwangangi.

Without investment of roughly £80m a year until 2035, the continent could lose out on as much as £4.8tn of economic benefits within the next decade, according to research by the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA).

""No country should be forced to choose between eradicating poverty, building climate resilience and honouring its debts, but right now that is what is happening,"" said the former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, now chair of the GCA.

The organisation's findings suggest that earlier estimates of Africa's nationally determined contributions (NDCs) towards climate resilience, which placed the required funding at half that, were a ""vast underestimate ""¦ prepared at a time when climate impacts were not projected to occur as quickly or as strongly as they are"".

Africa is witnessing climate extremes. In recent years, southern African countries such as Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe have been hit by deadly cyclones, western African nations such as Nigeria have endured devastating floods and the horn of Africa has grappled with a prolonged drought that has left millions facing food insecurity. All these extreme weather events, experts say, have been made several times more likely by climate change.

The Kenyan president, William Ruto, has been seeking to move on from discussions of historical responsibility for carbon emissions, which, he said, ""have become toxic"" and led to a deadlock between developed and developing countries. With pledged climate funding from western countries, including the 2009 commitment to direct $100bn (£80bn) in annual climate finance, not forthcoming, he said African countries needed to explore other avenues.

""Let me be clear. These conversations are necessary,"" Ruto said earlier this week. ""Africa's carbon footprint remains small ""¦ and a complex interplay of needs and responsibilities is a daily challenge but it should not lead to a deadlock. We must be alert to the fact that they can sometimes blind us to the bigger picture.""

Activists say sidestepping discussions on western accountability for the climate crisis can be harmful. ""It erases the experiences of those who are suffering right now ""¦ and allows business to continue as usual,"" said Vanessa Nakate, a Ugandan climate campaigner.

Ruto and other African leaders are looking to ""business"" solutions to the climate crisis, calling for global carbon taxes and financial reform to free up additional climate funding, and pushing for debt relief for African countries, a number of which are struggling to balance development needs such as education and health against climate action.

Campaigners have expressed reservations about the pivot by African countries into courting private financing, but acknowledge that the need for additional climate funding is dire.

""For communities who are suffering from the worst impacts of climate change, it goes beyond the droughts or the floods they experience,"" said Nakate. ""Failed harvests could mean increases in child marriages, children dropping out of school, it could exacerbate poverty - it creates more problems that are passed on from generation to generation.""

Agricultural organisations are also searching for alternative methods. Aiccra and the International Livestock Research Institute, which promote techniques such as the use of drought-tolerant crop varieties and water harvesting, have been training Mwangangi and a group of two dozen other female farmers in the practices, which she says have boosted their agricultural productivity and helped them navigate harsh weather impacts.

""This kind of information can change the lives of farmers,"" Mwangangi said.

As wolf numbers surge, herders in the north of the country are relearning old ways to keep the apex predators at bay

In the pre-dawn darkness of Sierra de la Culebra, Zamora, Spain, a sudden howl pierces the cold. More join in, until the baying chorus echoes all around. As the sky begins to lighten, their shapes emerge: first the alpha male, and then the rest of the wolf pack, appearing in the twilight where light and darkness merge.

In Europe, this large carnivore was hunted for centuries and almost exterminated, surviving only in inaccessible or sparsely populated areas. Now, thanks to changing attitudes and increased protection, Europe's wolf population is slowly recovering, and the apex predators are gradually returning to their former territories.

Spain - where Iberian wolves had dwindled to just 200-500 individuals by the 1970s - now has the highest concentration on the continent. As the animals return, however, the age-old conflict between shepherds and wolves has intensified.

The Iberian wolf had practically disappeared by the 1970s, but numbers have been steadily growing

For the communities that live and tend animals in proximity to wolves, their return provokes a range of emotions, from fear to euphoria, and conflicts between humans and wolves are quick to resurface. In the pastoral settlements in the hills of northern Spain, shepherds are trying new strategies in an effort to coexist with these large carnivores.

Farmer Fernando RodrÃ­guez TÃ¡bara looks after 100 cows in the Sanabria area in Zamora, Spain - one of the most densely populated wolf areas in Europe

Fernando RodrÃ­guez TÃ¡bara arrives on horseback wearing a wide-brimmed hat, at his home in Cerdillo, a village with just four registered inhabitants. RodrÃ­guez TÃ¡bara knows a lot about the struggle for coexistence with wolves. At 22 years old, he already manages a farm inherited from his parents with more than 100 cows in one of the most densely populated wolf areas in Europe, the Sanabria area in Zamora.

Fernando RodrÃ­guez TÃ¡bara with the mastiff puppies that will grow up with his herd and protect them from wolves

Tonight, however, he will leave his precious livestock to sleep without fear of wolves. His secret? His ""army"" of dogs, as he calls them: 13 mastiffs that guard the cattle. ""Now, I sleep soundly,"" he says, smiling.

His mother, Luisa TÃ¡bara, tells us that it wasn't always like this. ""In 2012, wolves killed 12 calves, it was a tragedy. For me, my cows are part of my family,"" she says. It was at that point, RodrÃ­guez TÃ¡bara says, that some neighbours gave them mastiff puppies to raise alongside the cows and defend them against wolves. ""My father told me it was impossible,"" he says.

Today, RodrÃ­guez TÃ¡bara rides back to the mountains on his mare, Canela. The calves have started to be born, and the mastiffs never leave their side. ""We put them in the stable with the calves from a young age, and in the end, they feel like part of the herd,"" he says. ""We realised that with the mastiffs, the problem is eradicated.""

Juan DÃ­ez leads his flock to fresh pastures

The temperature drops as evening falls near the Picos de Europa national park. The rocky silhouette of EspigÃ¼ete peak stands out against a starry sky, as thousands of sheep make their way to the pen that Juan DÃ­ez has just set up. A transhumant shepherd, DÃ­ez started working with livestock at a very young age, following his grandfather in Extremadura. At the age of 17, he had his own flock and moved to Asturias. ""That's where I really got to know the wolf - because that summer it killed 121 of my animals,"" he says. ""Of course, I was an inexperienced kid.""

DÃ­ez came from an area where the wolf had disappeared a long time before, along with traditional practices to prevent their damage. Later, he returned to LeÃ³n, near to the region where he had lost his animals, walking from Extremadura with more than 500 goats. But this time, he was prepared: the dogs he brought with him were mastiffs.

""That year, they didn't touch a single one,"" DÃ­ez says. When the livestock is in an electric fencing enclosure or gathered with the dogs, ""the wolf won't get to them"", he says. Asked about the conflict between shepherds and wolves, he says: ""Why did the dog enter the church? Because the door was open.""

One of Juan DÃ­ez's mastiffs keeps watch over his flock

The recovery of wolf populations in Spain has taken decades. In the 1970s, with the wolf on the brink of extinction, naturalist FÃ©lix RodrÃ­guez de la Fuente began campaigning to save the creatures. His work, along with that of other organisations, contributed to a significant change in mentality. The Iberian wolf went from being legal to hunt at any time to having the time and method of hunting regulated. In the 1990s, the wolf began to reappear timidly in places where it had long disappeared. Since 2021, a law has prohibited its hunting. Over the past year, however, the recovery of Iberian wolves has again become politicised in Spain, with right wing parties campaigning ahead of elections in July on the promise to make it legal to hunt them once more.

Prevention-focused methods to control the wolves can result in a significant reduction in the number of dead or injured livestock: up to 61% in the case of mastiffs, 99.9% with electric fences, and 100% for fixed enclosures, according to WWF citing research by European project Coex.

SofÃ­a GonzÃ¡lez Berdasco, who grew up as a transhumant shepherd

SofÃ­a GonzÃ¡lez Berdasco grew up as a transhumant shepherd in northern Spain, between the mountains of the Somiedo natural park in Asturias and the pastures of Santa Marina on the coast. Every night as a child, she went to sleep to stories like those of Little Red Riding Hood, but ""they weren't stories, they were real-life experiences"", she says. GonzÃ¡lez Berdasco's mother would send her young daughters to watch over the goats in the mountains because there were wolves. One summer's day, while GonzÃ¡lez Berdasco was tending the livestock, a wolf approached. She was five years old, and it was the first time she had seen one face to face. She saw it take one of the kids and disappear. ""For us, our animals are like our family, and when a wolf comes and kills one of them, it hurts,"" she says. ""You still don't have the idea of, well, the wolves killed a calf because they have to feed their pups, just like I love my kids.""

Over time, GonzÃ¡lez Berdasco discovered the importance of the role of large carnivores in the ecosystem, and decided she had to break the mental barrier: her fear of wolves. She ventured into the hills alone to spend the night in her sleeping bag in an area where she knew the wolves were. ""I came back transformed; I conquered the last step, the most complicated one - the one in my soul,"" she says.

SofÃ­a GonzÃ¡lez Berdasco believes shepherds must find a way to live with the wolves

GonzÃ¡lez Berdasco admits that sometimes she feels as if she is in a no man's land, understanding the needs of shepherds and the wolf packs they live alongside. She now guides tourist groups with her company, Somiedo Experience. ""Working with tourists, I see some who think that if the farmers here disappeared, the wolves could live, and that we, the people from the villages, are superfluous,"" GonzÃ¡lez Berdasco says. ""And then I listen to many farmers who say that all the wolves should be killed, and it will be better for us. I don't see that one side is more right than the other.""

She believes that the only possibility for reaching an understanding is to sit down and negotiate. ""Neither side can lose everything, and the other side gain everything.""

Before the catastrophe in Libya, the cyclone brought devastation to Thessaly - and there are fears the climate crisis will bring more

The whiff of death permeates the once fertile plain of Thessaly. Thirteen days may have elapsed since Storm Daniel pummelled Greece - a prelude to the fatal descent it would make on Libya - but even now, as the flood waters slowly recede, families bury loved ones and the authorities begin to catalogue the scale of the destruction, it is clear the agricultural heart of the country has been devastated beyond recognition.

What remains is a broken land, rain-sodden and bruised, covered with the detritus of all that fell foul of the storm, animate and inanimate, fish, birds, bees, dogs, cats, livestock, buildings, bridges and roads.

This weekend, Greek soldiers in masks and protective suits were frantically collecting carcasses for mass incineration. More than 200,000 animals perished in the storms, officials say, and with fears of outbreaks of infectious disease, there is a race against time to remove putrefying remains from farms and pens in areas frequently described as impassable.

""The stench is unbearable,"" one reporter told viewers on state-run television. ""And it hangs over Thessaly.""

At least 17 people lost their lives in floods whose waters continue to submerge fields of cotton and corn, villages and towns in a thick layer of mud and sludge.

After Daniel's devastating impact on Libya - where the death toll has surpassed 11,000 - Greeks are counting their blessings. But anger is also mounting. In a region hit by a ferocious Mediterranean cyclone, or ""medicane"", named Ianos, exactly three years ago on Monday, fury is widespread that almost no flood prevention measures had been taken even if most accept that this month's storms, energised by a summer of unprecedented heat, had not occurred in several hundred years. The downpours unleashed by Daniel were the worst since records began in the 1930s.

""You could call it the perfect storm,"" Greece's leading climatologist, Prof Christos Zerefos, told the Observer. ""Locked between two meteorological systems it stood still, unable to move from west to east, taking its energy from the ever-warmer sea and [dumping] the equivalent of a year's rain on Thessaly in two days.""

At 80 years old, Zerefos has long been studying changing weather patterns at the Academy of Athens' research centre for atmospheric physics and climatology. He is the first to say that Daniel was ""a very rare"" extreme weather event, a storm whose magnitude he did not think he would ever see.

But what worries Zerefos is with the atmosphere so destabilised by a changing climate Ianos may not be a one-off. ""The Ianos medicane cost about one fifth of the damage [predicted from] Daniel,"" he said. ""What frightens me is that we'll have more events like Ianos, say every four or five years, which would not only be highly destructive but very costly.""

With so many in Greece's agricultural heartland facing financial ruin - livestock recovery alone is expected to take years - the centre-right government of Kyriakos Mitsotakis has been put on the defensive.

After a summer of devastating wildfires - including a blaze described as Europe's biggest after ravaging an area the size of New York City in the north-eastern region of Evros - there are growing public concerns that state authorities are ill-equipped to deal with natural disasters in a part of the world already singled out as a climate emergency hotspot. The sight of hapless residents in Thessaly being rescued by volunteers before civil protection units could get to them has reinforced the image of official incompetence.

On Thursday the polling company Metron Analysis, releasing its first survey of public opinion after the floods, noted that 61% of respondents had a negative opinion of the government's work, versus 57% in May. For the first time since Mitsotakis, who won a second four-year term in June, assumed power, analysts have begun to speak of the nation resembling a ""failed state"".

""There is a prevalent feeling that Greece is a failed state, that it cannot meet our expectations or [global] challenges,"" said Maria Karaklioumi, a political analyst at the polling company Rass. ""When Mitsotakis first came to power [in 2019] he promised that the country and state would work better and that hasn't happened.""

Likening Greek sentiment to the backlash against US president George W Bush, whose reputation was badly hit by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, she added: ""People right now feel unprotected and abandoned. After the floods and fires, any sense of security that the state should offer has evaporated.""

Late on Saturday, in his first annual keynote economic speech since re-election, Mitsotakis emphasised that he would not only highlight challenges posed by the climate emergency - announcing local and EU-funded relief measures for those hit by the floods - but forge ahead with structural changes to a system that has clearly laboured under the pressure of dealing with successive disasters.

With the wildfires and floods expected to weigh on an economy otherwise doing well in the aftermath of Greece's near decade-long debt crisis, the climate, more than any other potential foe has, after Daniel's passing, clearly become the leader's public enemy number one.

Eating to Extinction Dan Saladino

The threat to our food

""Nature has introduced great variety into the landscape, but man has displayed a passion for simplifying it."" These are the words of Rachel Carson in her classic study of the impact of pesticides on the environment, Silent Spring. Food journalist Dan Saladino quotes this at the start of his book in which he travels the world in search of the most endangered foods and those who are struggling to preserve them, ""the seed savers, the innovators, the big-picture scientists and the radical cooks"".

As our diets become more uniform and as industrial farming methods destroy diverse, wild landscapes to make way for monocultural crops, whether they are wheat or bananas, foods with unique flavours and health-giving properties are disappearing around the world.

Saladino begins with a field of Kavilca wheat in eastern Turkey, a variety which was originally grown by the world's first farmers some 10,000 years ago but is now one of the rarest cultivated foods. Today the world's seed supply is controlled by just four corporations and Saladino comments that Kavilca is ""emblematic of the mass extinction taking place in our food"".

In cheesemaking, half of the world's cheeses are now made using bacteria or enzymes manufactured by one company, while most of the pork we eat globally today comes from just one species of pig, the Large White, aka the American Yorkshire. Saladino visits Huntsham Court Farm in the Wye Valley which has most of the world's remaining population of Middle White pigs, once Britain's pig of choice and known as the London Porker. Its meat is far more flavoursome, but in a world where high-yielding breeds dominate farming, it is ""now rarer than the Himalayan snow leopard"".

Saladino writes with real passion and love for his subject. He argues convincingly that as populations increase and the climate crisis impacts our food system, bringing new weather patterns and diseases, our survival as a species may well depend on preserving the diversity of traditional species and food cultures. A brilliantly written book, weaving together scientific, historical and environmental information with first-hand reporting, this is a powerful account of the threat to some of the world's most remarkable foods and the people who produce them.

Louise Erdrich

The Sentence Louise Erdrich

Saved by books

As Louise Erdrich's new novel begins, her heroine, Tookie, has been sentenced to 60 years in prison for an offence both horrible and ridiculous. It's 2005, and though Tookie is in her 30s, ""I still clung to a teenager's pursuits and mental habits"" - drinking and drugging as though she is still an impulsive young adult. Her friend Danae's lover Budgie has died in the arms of his ex, Mara; Danae persuades Tookie to steal a delivery truck in order to snatch Budgie's body back. The judge who sends her away to a Minnesota jail is shocked by her crime; Tookie, however, is not surprised by his harshness. ""I was on the wrong side of the statistics. Native Americans are the most oversentenced people currently imprisoned,"" she says.

But while in prison, books are her salvation. Even when she is not permitted to have them, she calls up a library in her head: ""everything from the Redwall books to Huck Finn to Lilith's Brood"". So when she is unexpectedly released in 2015 - her sentence commuted thanks to the tireless efforts of her tribe's defence lawyer - it is perhaps unsurprising that she finds a job in a Minneapolis bookshop. And here this powerful, endearing novel takes a swerve from its Orange Is the New Black-style opening. It is not Tookie's term in the savage American carceral system that is the true focus of the book, but her life after her release - a life as ordinary and extraordinary as any, delineated with the care and political acumen that have always distinguished Erdrich's work, and which won her the Pulitzer prize for her last novel, The Night Watchman.

Tookie's courage and passion carry us; she is, throughout, a stalwart companion, facing hardship and aware of her own good fortune. ""I live the way a person does who has ceased to dread each day's ration of time,"" she says - a motto to go by, surely, if we can.

Butler to the World Oliver Bullough

Bent Britain at your service

This unmissable, deeply depressing book about exactly how Britain pimps itself to the world's dirtiest money contains stories that have been hiding in plain sight for decades. It has just seemed in no government's interest to notice them.

It took even Bullough a while, though, to nail the exact bent-double relationship that many among the elite of this country's lawmakers and bankers and lawyers and accountants have adopted toward this global kleptocracy. The rouble dropped when he was approached by an American academic and asked to explain what the British government did to protect the nation against money laundering. Which agencies had the most teeth, which prosecutors won the most cases, which politicians were most vocal, where could he find the paper trails? Bullough had to explain that unlike in the United States, where there were well-funded federal bureaux and tenacious homeland security investigators and high-profile cases of launderers brought to justice, in Britain there were very few of these things.

Inevitably, several of the minutely researched case studies Bullough analyses involve Russia and Ukraine. One of the most bleakly instructive is the Ministry of Defence's decision, in 2014, to sell for £53m the former London Underground station at Brompton Road near Harrods to a man named Dmitry Firtash, whom the US government had been seeking to extradite on racketeering charges. Firtash had made his billions as a middleman between the Kremlin and the Russian oil giant Gazprom, and has consistently been forced to deny association with the FBI's most-wanted Ukrainian-born mobster Semyon Mogilevich. In Britain, however, with the cross-bench assistance of MPs he had set up the British Ukrainian Society in 2007 and given £6m to Cambridge University to fund a course in Ukrainian studies. After the invasion of Crimea he was invited in to advise the Foreign Office. ""I tried to persuade them that imposing sanctions against Russia was a bad idea,"" he told a Russian news agency.

In this context, and in the context of many other stories that Bullough tells, Boris Johnson's determination to delay the report of the intelligence and security committee into compromising Russian activity in the UK, and then dismiss it as the work of ""Islington Remainers"", looks ever more alarming. The report highlighted, Bullough quotes, how ""the inherent tension between the government's prosperity agenda and the need to protect national security has been played out across Whitehall departments""¦"" We are, partly as a result of Bullough's digging, likely to hear a good deal more about that ""prosperity agenda"" in the coming months and years.

Visions in a Northern Irish village

The Raptures

Jan Carson

The Raptures Jan Carson

Visions in a Northern Irish village

Two strange things happen in a Northern Irish village in the summer holidays of 1993. First, Hannah's classmates start dying. Then, one by one, they return to haunt her. There's a pattern to the deaths. Strange lumps cluster on the victim's skin, they become feverish, then their organs fail. Within hours of their passing - and even before the village's well-oiled gossip machine has begun spreading the news - they come to Hannah. Each appears just once, flicking through magazines in the doctor's surgery, or scrunched up in the darkness of the bathroom as Hannah gropes her way in for a wee. They are subtly changed: older, with a coat of nail polish here, a drop of extra confidence there. After a few words, they vanish.

Two questions propel Carson's compassionate and meticulously observed third novel. Why has this plague hit Ballylack? And why, of all her class, is Hannah the one blessed with apparent health, and cursed with strange visions?

The Raptures is an intriguingly mixed-up book. It is a study of village life that brings the easy familiarity of a sitcom to its cast, but it's also an Agatha Christie-esque whodunnit, a dark supernatural mystery and an account of mass trauma. Carson forges these parts into a tragicomedy in which fantastic elements slot almost seamlessly alongside kitchen-sink realism.

Reflections on grief and falling in love

Lost & Found

Kathryn Schulz

Lost & Found Kathryn Schulz

Reflections on grief and falling in love

Lost & Found, as befits a book about contrasts, is something of a hybrid. On the one hand, it is a memoir of two shattering events that took place almost simultaneously in Kathryn Schulz's life: the death of her much-loved 74-year-old father, and her falling in love, in middle age, with a woman she calls C. It also veers between two distinct modes: the personal, where Schulz relates these events in affecting prose; and the more detached, essayistic style that will be familiar to readers of her Pulitzer-winning work in the New Yorker.

The narrative truly comes alive when she contemplates her father's story. Her father's mother was the youngest of 11 children living in a shtetl outside ÅÃ³dÅº in the late 1930s, and, since her family was too large and too poor to survive the war together, ""by a private calculus unimaginable to me"", writes Schulz, she was designated as the only one to be sent away to safety, to Tel Aviv. Her son was born there, and at a certain point she received news that almost everybody back home had died. By 1954, visas for the two of them had been secured for the US.

The book's second section describes Schulz's surprise at finding a life partner after years of cherishing a bookish kind of solitude. She writes beautifully about falling in love: ""Everything that wasn't her - the house around us, the rest of the world, the passage of time, the past and the future - retreated from awareness.""

But Schulz's unusual method - part""‘essay, part-memoir - comes into its own in the book's final third. This begins with a description of a meteor hitting Earth during the Eocene period and ends, 35m years later, on a ""beautiful May afternoon"" with Kathryn's marriage to C. There follows a fascinating disquisition on how the ampersand symbol began to fall out of fashion as the final letter of the English alphabet early in the 19th century, which provides Schulz with an opportunity to expound on the paradoxical nature of life: ""In short, we know that, as Philip Roth once put it, ""˜Life is and.' He meant that we do not live, for the most part, in a world of either/or. We live with both at once, with many things at once - everything connected to its opposite, everything connected to everything.""

In these passages, Schulz's prose almost rises to the level of Nietzsche at his most wise and humane, or William James. When, in the final pages Schulz reveals she and C are expecting a baby, her reflections on time, loss and mortality take on an even greater resonance. ""We are here to keep watch,"" she concludes, ""not to keep.""

Send Nudes Saba Sams

Sex and solitude

""I don't know if I was enjoying myself or just in a continual state of curiosity,"" says Meg in Snakebite, one of 10 short stories in 25-year-old British author Saba Sams's exceptional debut collection. Sams joins the ranks of writers such as Megan Nolan and Frances Leviston with these acute portraits of the fragile intimacies and euphoric moments snatched by a generation of women coming of age into a precarious future.

Sams's characters navigate the gaps between expectation and reality that emerge with encroaching adulthood - preoccupied parents, uneven friendships, misleading kisses. Unfolding against a backdrop of grimy pubs, music festivals and yoga yurts, these funny, surprising stories articulate the wonder and disillusionment that go hand in hand with testing new boundaries.

In spare, rhythmic sentences, this exhilarating collection captures the light and dark of negotiating relationships, solitude, sexuality and loss. Sams makes language her own, conjuring piercing imagery that leaves its imprint on your mind, just as traumas mark her characters, even if they do bounce back.

What distinguishes her from millennial writers such as Ottessa Moshfegh, who shares her deadpan humour and visceral style, is that her characters aren't jaded, but voracious. They're not immune to existential angst - ""Do you ever worry that nothing you do matters?"" - but they get on with living, devouring new experiences with gusto. Does this herald a tonal shift in twentysomething fiction? It's too early to tell, but it's precisely this earthy resilience and joie de vivre that make Send Nudes so rare and uplifting.

A panoramic history of getting dressed

Worn

Worn Sofi Thanhauser

A panoramic history of getting dressed

People have always dressed above their station, and other people have always minded terribly. In 1913 the American reformer Bertha June Richardson was taken aback to discover that the girls whom she encountered in the New York tenements looked smarter than she did, with ""everything about them in the latest style"". Unlike many of her pursed-lipped contemporaries, though, Richardson worked hard to understand what was really going on. The Smith graduate and author of The Woman Who Spends: A Study of Her Economic Function, concluded that these immigrant girls, many of them earning no more than $6 a week in the rag trade, were enacting their particular version of the American dream, one silk petticoat and puffy sleeve at a time.

One of the great pleasures of this panoramic history of getting dressed is Sofi Thanhauser's ability to spot moments like these where human desire and material culture collide. When MoliÃ¨re wrote The Bourgeois Gentilhomme in 1670 about a burgher whose ambition to rise into the nobility requires him to get some fancy new outfits, audience members got the joke because they knew someone just like that and it was a relief, finally, to be allowed to snigger. A century later the script was flipped when Marie Antoinette attempted a bit of cross-class cosplay of her own. Enthralled by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's back-to-nature philosophy, the queen built her own toy farm in the grounds of Versailles and started a fashion for peasant costume among the ladies of her court. Not only was impersonating Bo Peep in the Hall of Mirrors a tone-deaf move, it decimated the domestic silk industry, throwing hundreds of Lyonnais artisans out of work. Without meaning to, the queen's newfound passion for imported white muslin brought her a step or two closer to the guillotine.

Worn, though, consists of much more than a string of entertaining anecdotes about people raiding the dressing-up box and embarrassing themselves in the process. Its starting point is the terrible state of our current clothing industry, which, as Thanhauser describes it, exists in a nightmare wasteland of overproduction, toxic waste, choked rivers, child labour and collapsing factories. Following five threads - linen, cotton, silk, rayon and wool - she sets out to chart a deft course through material history, arguing that ""there is scarcely a part of the human experience, historic or current, that the story of clothes does not touch"".

Notes on an Execution Danya Kukafka

A deep, wise thriller

From Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter to Bret Easton Ellis's Patrick Bateman, serial killers stalk the pages of fiction, their actions and motivations drawing readers back again and again. But how many of us can remember the names of their victims; how many of us have imagined what their lives might have been, if they hadn't crossed paths with their killers? Just as the true crime genre is starting to upend the narrative of the killer - in Hallie Rubenhold's award-winning The Five, the women murdered by Jack the Ripper are given their own space on the page - so Danya Kukafka's Notes on an Execution looks at the women left behind as murderer Ansel Packer awaits his fate on death row.

The clock is ticking towards Ansel's death as he plots his escape, and gloats over the ""Theory"" he will leave behind for the world to read. His crimes may be horrific, but Kukafka isn't out to explore the origin story of the murderer. Instead, she tells us about his mother, Lavender, who was 17 when Ansel was born and subject to a world that slowly closed around her in the Adirondack mountains. ""Until the time came, Lavender did not understand what it meant to walk away from a thing she'd grown from her own insides."" Lavender's story is bruising, and brave - but so is Hazel's. She's the twin of Jenny, the girl who married Ansel; Hazel watches as her sister is consumed by her relationship with Ansel, helpless as it destroys her.

And Kukafka tells of Saffron Singh, the detective who has been on Ansel's trail for years - who knew him as a boy, saw what he was capable of then. As the world moves on from the three girls Ansel murdered, leaving the mystery unsolved, Saffy persists. She can't stop thinking about who the murdered girls - Izzy, Angela, Lila - might have been.

Notes on an Execution is Kukafka's second novel, after Girl in Snow, which explored the death of a high-school girl in Colorado. It is deeper, wiser, more painful than her debut: devastating in its impact, and impossible to look away from. I can't remember the last time I finished a thriller in tears, not even sure by that point who my heart was hurting for.

The Gosling Girl Jacqueline Roy

Repercussions of a childhood crime

Michelle Cameron isn't Michelle Cameron any more. The crime she was incarcerated for, committed when she was 10, was so heinous, so shocking, that her identity has been changed for her own safety. But as she puts it: ""What's the point of being safe if everything has been taken from you?"" Michelle is trying to make a new life for herself as Samantha when an old friend of hers is murdered and her identity as the mixed-race murderer of a little white girl is leaked to the press, enraging the public. ""She remembers the judge saying she'd shown no remorse. What's remorse? she'd said, but no one had heard her. No one is hearing her now.""

The Gosling Girl is one of the saddest, most moving thrillers I've read for some time. There is, it turns out, someone on Michelle's side, black detective constable Natalie Tyler. Assigned to Michelle's case and protection, she finds herself drawn to this desperately lonely girl and starts to ask questions about the past. Why did Michelle do it, and why was she the only one prosecuted, when there was someone else there too? Roy powerfully explores the repercussions of a childhood crime, exposing the racism that put Michelle in prison and which is still dogging Tyler today, forcing her into situations where she has to listen to people tell her: ""I expect you think she got some kind of raw deal because she was black, that the trial was racist or some such thing. I know how you all stick together.""

Eating to Extinction Dan Saladino

The threat to our food

""Nature has introduced great variety into the landscape, but man has displayed a passion for simplifying it."" These are the words of Rachel Carson in her classic study of the impact of pesticides on the environment, Silent Spring. Food journalist Dan Saladino quotes this at the start of his book in which he travels the world in search of the most endangered foods and those who are struggling to preserve them, ""the seed savers, the innovators, the big-picture scientists and the radical cooks"".

As our diets become more uniform and as industrial farming methods destroy diverse, wild landscapes to make way for monocultural crops, whether they are wheat or bananas, foods with unique flavours and health-giving properties are disappearing around the world.

Saladino begins with a field of Kavilca wheat in eastern Turkey, a variety which was originally grown by the world's first farmers some 10,000 years ago but is now one of the rarest cultivated foods. Today the world's seed supply is controlled by just four corporations and Saladino comments that Kavilca is ""emblematic of the mass extinction taking place in our food"".

In cheesemaking, half of the world's cheeses are now made using bacteria or enzymes manufactured by one company, while most of the pork we eat globally today comes from just one species of pig, the Large White, aka the American Yorkshire. Saladino visits Huntsham Court Farm in the Wye Valley which has most of the world's remaining population of Middle White pigs, once Britain's pig of choice and known as the London Porker. Its meat is far more flavoursome, but in a world where high-yielding breeds dominate farming, it is ""now rarer than the Himalayan snow leopard"".

Saladino writes with real passion and love for his subject. He argues convincingly that as populations increase and the climate crisis impacts our food system, bringing new weather patterns and diseases, our survival as a species may well depend on preserving the diversity of traditional species and food cultures. A brilliantly written book, weaving together scientific, historical and environmental information with first-hand reporting, this is a powerful account of the threat to some of the world's most remarkable foods and the people who produce them.

Two strange things happen in a Northern Irish village in the summer holidays of 1993. First, Hannah's classmates start dying. Then, one by one, they return to haunt her. There's a pattern to the deaths. Strange lumps cluster on the victim's skin, they become feverish, then their organs fail. Within hours of their passing - and even before the village's well-oiled gossip machine has begun spreading the news - they come to Hannah.

Reflections on grief and falling in love

Lost & Found, as befits a book about contrasts, is something of a hybrid. On the one hand, it is a memoir of two shattering events that took place almost simultaneously in Kathryn Schulz's life: the death of her much-loved 74-year-old father, and her falling in love, in middle age, with a woman she calls C. It also veers between two distinct modes: the personal, where Schulz relates these events in affecting prose; and the more detached, essayistic style that will be familiar to readers of her Pulitzer-winning work in the New Yorker.

The narrative truly comes alive when she contemplates her father's story. Her father's mother was the youngest of 11 children living in a shtetl outside ÅÃ³dÅº in the late 1930s, and, since her family was too large and too poor to survive the war together, ""by a private calculus unimaginable to me"", writes Schulz, she was designated as the only one to be sent away to safety, to Tel Aviv. Her son was born there, and at a certain point she received news that almost everybody back home had died. By 1954, visas for the two of them had been secured for the US.

The book's second section describes Schulz's surprise at finding a life partner after years of cherishing a bookish kind of solitude. She writes beautifully about falling in love: ""Everything that wasn't her - the house around us, the rest of the world, the passage of time, the past and the future - retreated from awareness.""

In these passages, Schulz's prose almost rises to the level of Nietzsche at his most wise and humane, or William James. When, in the final pages Schulz reveals she and C are expecting a baby, her reflections on time, loss and mortality take on an even greater resonance. ""We are here to keep watch,"" she concludes, ""not to keep.""

People have always dressed above their station, and other people have always minded terribly. In 1913 the American reformer Bertha June Richardson was taken aback to discover that the girls whom she encountered in the New York tenements looked smarter than she did, with ""everything about them in the latest style"". Unlike many of her pursed-lipped contemporaries, though, Richardson worked hard to understand what was really going on. The Smith graduate and author of The Woman Who Spends: A Study of Her Economic Function, concluded that these immigrant girls, many of them earning no more than $6 a week in the rag trade, were enacting their particular version of the American dream, one silk petticoat and puffy sleeve at a time.

One of the great pleasures of this panoramic history of getting dressed is Sofi Thanhauser's ability to spot moments like these where human desire and material culture collide. When MoliÃ¨re wrote The Bourgeois Gentilhomme in 1670 about a burgher whose ambition to rise into the nobility requires him to get some fancy new outfits, audience members got the joke because they knew someone just like that and it was a relief, finally, to be allowed to snigger. A century later the script was flipped when Marie Antoinette attempted a bit of cross-class cosplay of her own. Enthralled by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's back-to-nature philosophy, the queen built her own toy farm in the grounds of Versailles and started a fashion for peasant costume among the ladies of her court. Not only was impersonating Bo Peep in the Hall of Mirrors a tone-deaf move, it decimated the domestic silk industry, throwing hundreds of Lyonnais artisans out of work. Without meaning to, the queen's newfound passion for imported white muslin brought her a step or two closer to the guillotine.

Worn, though, consists of much more than a string of entertaining anecdotes about people raiding the dressing-up box and embarrassing themselves in the process. Its starting point is the terrible state of our current clothing industry, which, as Thanhauser describes it, exists in a nightmare wasteland of overproduction, toxic waste, choked rivers, child labour and collapsing factories. Following five threads - linen, cotton, silk, rayon and wool - she sets out to chart a deft course through material history, arguing that ""there is scarcely a part of the human experience, historic or current, that the story of clothes does not touch"".

Notes on an Execution Danya Kukafka

A deep, wise thriller

From Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter to Bret Easton Ellis's Patrick Bateman, serial killers stalk the pages of fiction, their actions and motivations drawing readers back again and again. But how many of us can remember the names of their victims; how many of us have imagined what their lives might have been, if they hadn't crossed paths with their killers? Just as the true crime genre is starting to upend the narrative of the killer - in Hallie Rubenhold's award-winning The Five, the women murdered by Jack the Ripper are given their own space on the page - so Danya Kukafka's Notes on an Execution looks at the women left behind as murderer Ansel Packer awaits his fate on death row.

The clock is ticking towards Ansel's death as he plots his escape, and gloats over the ""Theory"" he will leave behind for the world to read. His crimes may be horrific, but Kukafka isn't out to explore the origin story of the murderer. Instead, she tells us about his mother, Lavender, who was 17 when Ansel was born and subject to a world that slowly closed around her in the Adirondack mountains. ""Until the time came, Lavender did not understand what it meant to walk away from a thing she'd grown from her own insides."" Lavender's story is bruising, and brave - but so is Hazel's. She's the twin of Jenny, the girl who married Ansel; Hazel watches as her sister is consumed by her relationship with Ansel, helpless as it destroys her.

And Kukafka tells of Saffron Singh, the detective who has been on Ansel's trail for years - who knew him as a boy, saw what he was capable of then. As the world moves on from the three girls Ansel murdered, leaving the mystery unsolved, Saffy persists. She can't stop thinking about who the murdered girls - Izzy, Angela, Lila - might have been.

Notes on an Execution is Kukafka's second novel, after Girl in Snow, which explored the death of a high-school girl in Colorado. It is deeper, wiser, more painful than her debut: devastating in its impact, and impossible to look away from. I can't remember the last time I finished a thriller in tears, not even sure by that point who my heart was hurting for.

Repercussions of a childhood crime

The Gosling Girl Jacqueline Roy

Repercussions of a childhood crime

Michelle Cameron isn't Michelle Cameron any more. The crime she was incarcerated for, committed when she was 10, was so heinous, so shocking, that her identity has been changed for her own safety. But as she puts it: ""What's the point of being safe if everything has been taken from you?"" Michelle is trying to make a new life for herself as Samantha when an old friend of hers is murdered and her identity as the mixed-race murderer of a little white girl is leaked to the press, enraging the public. ""She remembers the judge saying she'd shown no remorse. What's remorse? she'd said, but no one had heard her. No one is hearing her now.""

The Gosling Girl is one of the saddest, most moving thrillers I've read for some time. There is, it turns out, someone on Michelle's side, black detective constable Natalie Tyler. Assigned to Michelle's case and protection, she finds herself drawn to this desperately lonely girl and starts to ask questions about the past. Why did Michelle do it, and why was she the only one prosecuted, when there was someone else there too? Roy powerfully explores the repercussions of a childhood crime, exposing the racism that put Michelle in prison and which is still dogging Tyler today, forcing her into situations where she has to listen to people tell her: ""I expect you think she got some kind of raw deal because she was black, that the trial was racist or some such thing. I know how you all stick together.""

Close to half the crisis-hit country's under-fives go hungry and one in five suffer from wasting. Mothers tell here of their struggle as Unicef warns of a blighted generation

For more than a year now, Anne Roshel has had no milk to give her two children, neither fresh nor powdered. Looking out from the kitchen door on a sweltering afternoon in July, she says her eight-year-old son has just a potato-stuffed bun for breakfast. Sometimes it's a packet of rice with pol sambol (coconut relish), chilli and lime.

A single mother, Roshel, 27, lives in her parents' crumbling cement house with the children and her father. Monsoon rain has washed off the pink coating on the walls, and a small veranda opens to a road in Koloniya Wella, a coastal hamlet in Chilaw, 80km (50 miles) north of the Sri Lankan capital Colombo.

On some days, Roshel sells achcharu (raw or semi-ripe fruits dusted with chilli and salt) to schoolchildren from a roadside stall. When the sea is calm, her father goes fishing. Then Roshel can cook fish curry for lunch.

""When he was born, my second son was underweight. My husband had just left and I didn't have proper meals. I want to feed my son apples and grapes, but I can't afford them,"" says Roshel, showing the nine-month-old boy's child health and development report, given to all children in Sri Lanka.

Roshel is no exception. Hunger is the norm in Sri Lanka now. Last October, the healthy ministry found that 42.9% of under-fives in Sri Lanka have some form of undernutrition. A March 2023 report by the Medical Research Institute says that 19.8% of children between six and 59 months suffer from wasting, the most acute form of malnutrition that occurs when children don't have enough quality food or have prolonged illnesses. Children become too thin for their height.

""It's a very alarming situation,"" says Abner Daniel, a nutrition expert at Unicef Sri Lanka. ""We are seeing an overall worsening of all nutrition levels. The nine months of pregnancy and the first two years after birth are the most critical window. It impacts children, even much later in life.""

Last year's economic crash and political upheaval are being felt all over Sri Lanka as worsening nutrition levels take a toll on children's health.

Since independence from Britain in 1948, Sri Lanka has rolled out several welfare programmes to boost food security, but Daniel says: ""The progress made in recent decades seems to have now washed off.""

The crumbling economy, poor agricultural planning and falling buying power have made 6 million people, nearly 30% of the country's population, food insecure. A survey by LirneAsia, a Colombo-based policy research institute, estimates that more than 4 million people have fallen into poverty in Sri Lanka since 2019, pushing the poverty rate up to 31%.

Duleeka Madhunamali, 26, lives in Naththandiya, south of Chilaw. Her husband cuts grass to earn 10,000 Sri Lankan rupees (£24) a week. It's barely enough to feed their three children. ""Even if we don't have food, we make sure we somehow feed our daughters. But we can't buy fish and eggs. It's very expensive now,"" Madhunamali says while repairing clay pots in their one-bedroom cement-block house. One pot earns her only 18 rupees - less than 5p.

""More and more families are adopting coping strategies to put food on the plate,"" says Daniel. They compromise on nutritious food, eat less and skip meals. Protein sources like dal, eggs, fish and chicken are scarce and expensive, so most of them eat carb-heavy food like rice to fill their stomachs.

""We see parents compromise on their children's education, and not send them to school because transport costs are high. So they use that money to put a meal on the table,"" says Daniel.

Child malnutrition is seen all across the country. KS Chithra (who didn't want to give her first name), is a public health midwife working in Bogawantalawa, a tea-growing region 90 miles east of Colombo. She monitors young children's health, and says that most children from the tea estate families are severely underweight.

""Most mothers are impoverished tea pluckers who earn a daily wage,"" she says. ""So within three months of childbirth, they leave their infants to go to work. They don't get to breastfeed their babies. Sometimes, infants maintain a healthy weight during breastfeeding but then their weight drastically drops because families can't afford to feed them.""

Most estate families are now eating flatbread made from wheat flour to sate hunger. Government welfare programmes had been handing out free thriposha, a maize-based nutritious cereal, to all children under five and pregnant mothers every month across Sri Lanka. Now thriposha is only given to children above three now.

""And they only give it from time to time, not every month,"" says Chithra.

Since the economic crisis, pregnant women in some estates haven't received cash vouchers from the National Nutrition Programme that has helped pregnant women, says Chithra.

Children who have acute malnutrition in the estates now receive therapautic biscuits funded by humanitarian aid organisations. Unicef provides four months of small cash transfers of 6,750 rupees (£16) to 110,000 vulnerable families across Sri Lanka to help feed babies born from May 2021 to December 2022.

Back in Chilaw, Roshel has used Unicef funds to treat her son's asthma and buy dry fish for her children. Her nine-month-old is now within a healthy weight range. But Chithra, the midwife, says: ""The help from nonprofits is no longer enough because the crisis continues to put a toll on poor mothers.""

And Daniel, from Unicef, has a warning too: ""Most impacts of child undernutrition are not visible yet in Sri Lanka, but the data and evidence show that the situation is grim, and you cannot wait any more..""

Letters sent to two accreditation schemes say pollution is contributing to the extinction of a critically endangered fish species

More than 80 organisations around the globe have called for two international accreditation schemes to revoke sustainability certifications for salmon and trout farmed in Tasmania's Macquarie Harbour, with letters labelling the certification ""misleading"".

The letters to the Best Aquaculture Practices (Bap) and GlobalG.A.P schemes come as federal and state government workshops are held in Hobart to determine what urgent action is necessary to prevent the extinction of the critically endangered Maugean skate, an ancient fish species found only in Macquarie Harbour on Tasmania's west coast.

It follows work by the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (Imas) that found the number of skate had fallen by nearly half in seven years, with pollution from salmon farming a factor that had led to considerable changes to the skate's habitat.

Signatories from 17 countries sent the letters demanding both schemes withdraw their certification, which they labelled ""misleading"".

""Simply put, greenwashing the extinction of the Maugean skate is not ""˜best practice' or ""˜environmentally responsible',"" the letters say.

The signatories include conservation, animal welfare and community groups, such as Canada's sustainable seafood organisation SeaChoice and Australia's Bob Brown Foundation, as well as scientists and award-winning authors including Richard Flanagan.

Tassal (Cooke Aquaculture) and Petuna (Sealord) are certified through Bap, while Huon Aquaculture (JBS) is GlobalG.A.P. certified.

Kelly Roebuck of SeaChoice said major supermarkets such as Coles and Woolworths relied on these certifications to sell farmed salmon and ocean trout with ""responsibly sourced"" labels.

""Unsuspecting shoppers are being misled into thinking they are buying a responsibly sourced product when in actuality they are contributing to the extinction of a species,"" Roebuck said.

""It's now up to the schemes to show they are going to take this seriously and revoke the certifications in Macquarie Harbour.""

Alistair Allan of the Bob Brown Foundation said the certifications should be revoked or ""they will be the first certification schemes in the world to certify an extinction of a species"".

""These certifications must not shirk their responsibility here. They cannot palm this off to the auditors or wait until the companies' next audit to address this dire situation,"" he said.

Luke Martin, the chief executive of industry peak body Salmon Tasmania, said the salmon industry worked closely with Imas and other scientific organisations and government agencies to sustainably manage the waterways it operated in, including Macquarie Harbour.

He said the industry was a longstanding advocate for ongoing research into the Maugean skate, had contributed more than half a million dollars to this research, and Salmon Tasmania was participating in and presenting at the Hobart workshop.

""We continue our call for all key stakeholders - including Hydro Tasmania, TasWater, the mining industry, recreational and commercial fishers, local, state and federal governments and our industry to step up and be part of the solution,"" he said.

He said the interim Imas report ""makes it clear that there are many factors to consider and the science to date is inconclusive and we believe that other issues may also impact the Maugean skate.""

The gill plates of the extremely intelligent fish - many species of which are already categorised as endangered - are sold across east Asia as remedies said to have ""˜no basis in medical science'

Every morning, starting at 3am, Lakshan hacks up manta rays. A wholesale buyer who plies his trade at Sri Lanka's largest fish market, in the city of Negombo, just north of Colombo, he jostles with fishers offloading their catches. His business is primarily to find fresh tuna but he also buys 700kg (1,540lb) of manta and devil rays every day.

He doesn't want the ray's meat, which most Sri Lankans don't eat. Instead, he's after the gill plates: cartilage that helps manta and devil rays filter out microorganisms in ocean waters.

In a courtyard across from the market, Lakshan dries the gill plates on a corrugated iron board. Then he sells them to another trader for as much as $130 (£104) per kilo. It seems a high price, but Lakshan (who gave only his first name out of concern for his trade) needs 5kg of fresh gill plates for every kilo of dried ones. He has only a vague idea what happens to them afterwards. ""We heard they sell it to the Chinese because they eat them,"" he says.

At sunrise in Negombo, the nightly fish market quietens down and fishers start to return home after many days at sea

Dried gill plates are indeed often sold in medicine and dried seafood markets across east Asia, but are not used in traditional Chinese medicine. The growing demand for ray gill plates stems from market vendors using them to make soup that they tout a remedy for various health issues. The conservation charity Manta Trust calls these gill-plate concoctions ""a pseudo-remedy"" that has ""no basis in medical science"".

The demand for gill plates has generated a sprawling cottage industry. Small-scale fisheries across Sri Lanka kill manta and devil rays (collectively known as mobulids), including endangered and vulnerable species, just to export their gill plates. A recent study showed that more mobulid rays are caught in Sri Lanka alone than the annual global catch across large industrial purse seine fisheries (huge operations that use curtain-like nets to scoop up marine life by the tonne). Their sizes are also declining, the study says.

A man carries a ray by a gill slits (top); each of these is encircled internally by feathery prebranchial appendages known as gill plates; (left) a ray dealer cuts up the large wings into slices which will then be dried over several days at the fish processing beach nearby; (right) gill plates are removed from a large ray

Most mobulid species are classed as endangered, which means - according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's criteria - their populations has reduced by between 50% and 70% in the past decade. Meanwhile, the number of mobulids being caught continues to grow, with India, Indonesia and China the biggest culprits, feeding a thriving trade centred in Guangzhou, China, and Hong Kong.

Sri Lanka fishers don't specifically target mobulids. Instead, the rays get entangled in gillnets used to catch yellowfin tuna, billfish and sailfish. Most Sri Lankans don't eat them, though some add dried ray meat to curry; there's little to no demand for the fresh meat.

Buyers and sellers inspect the wares at the night market, where tuna and sailfish remain the most prized offerings

This meant fishers used to release manta and devil rays back to the sea, but the lucrative gill plate trade has changed that. ""Sometimes fishers used to cut off their heads and toss them out in the seas, because they thought that buyers wanted the meat,"" says Daniel Fernando, the co-founder of the Blue Resources Trust, a non-profit marine research institution. ""But traders didn't want the meat. They wanted gill plates, which are in the head.""

The trade in plates provides much-needed additional income. Last year, Sri Lanka's economy crashed, dragging many families into poverty. In its worst economic crisis since independence, the country ran out of basics such as food, cooking gas and fuel. Many people are still struggling to put meals on the table, and the World Food Programme reported in February that 32% of households remained food-insecure. For fishery workers like Lakshan, gill plates bring much-needed income.

Manta rays are one of the most intelligent species of fish, with a brain up to 10 times larger than that of a whale shark and more highly developed areas for learning, problem solving and communicating. They are playful, curious and are thought to be able to recognise themselves in mirrors, a sign of self-awareness usually limited to the great apes, cetaceans and elephants.

Trading rays is not illegal, although in 2014 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites) brought in stronger protection for manta rays, and the international trade in their meat, gills and fins is supposed to be accompanied by permits and certificates confirming that they have been harvested sustainably and legally.

However, the UN's Bonn Convention stipulates that the animals should not be captured for commercial purposes. Sri Lanka is also signed up to the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, which requires that its members not retain any mobulid catch.

Sri Lanka itself has no legal framework to protect manta and devil rays. It has stopped issuing export permits but there are no national protections, Fernando said. Periodically, customs agents will stop shipments of gill plates being illegally exported, but the trade is persistent: in 2020, authorities at Hong Kong airport seized 300kg of manta ray gill plates worth $116,000, coming from Sri Lanka.

As fishing boats proliferate across the Indian Ocean, mobulids are under pressure. They're particularly vulnerable biologically to overfishing: they have slow reproduction cycles, with young female mantas taking 10-15 years to mature sexually, and giving birth to just one pup every two or three years. ""Their population can collapse in a very short time,"" Fernando says. ""Things will appear to be fine for a few years, and then, suddenly, they can pretty much get wiped out.""

Trade is quiet after dawn and before the market closes

He emphasises that the problem is not limited to Sri Lanka. ""These rays don't respect political boundaries - they go in and out of Sri Lankan waters. It's a regional issue, if not global. Action of one country is not sufficient.""

The organisation is calling for governments to join in declaring protected areas for rays and their habitats to reduce bycatch, and to educate fishers about safely releasing juveniles back into the ocean to improve their chance of survival.

Replacing the use of gillnets - vertical walls of netting used to trap fish - with properly managed sustainable fishing methods such as longlines (miles-long lines with baited hooks) would also help, but the transition could take a long time as gillnets are the main method used by small fisheries.

Rays don't have that time, Fernando says: their stocks are falling fast. He acknowledges that locals rely on them for income but points out: ""We are not putting fish in the ocean and harvesting them. It's not like chicken farming.

""Ideally, we should've looked into protecting them about four decades ago, to ensure they are caught sustainably, but we've waited so long that they now face imminent collapse,"" he says. ""We are going to have to make some very difficult decisions.""

Some Republican-led states are pushing to relax child labour laws but even in the farms of San Luis valley, where most are Hispanic/Latino, youngsters can work an unlimited number of hours

All photographs by Daniel Brenner for the Guardian

High in Colorado's fertile San Luis valley, the collision between Americans' demand for cheap food and the reliance on cheap labour - including children as young as 12 - comes into stark relief. At nearly 2,500 metres (8,000ft) above sea level, the alluvial plain, known for vegetable production, lies far from the turmoil of Washington DC, where child labour laws have long been a flashpoint.

Farmers have grown vegetables here for generations, including for the US potato market, which supports, from cultivation to consumer, about 714,000 jobs and $34bn (£27bn) in wages. As well as potatoes, there are carrots and lettuce - produce that requires a high degree of manual labour.

At rates of about $16 an hour, that labour may be from local people and continue down through generations. More likely, they are people coming from Mexico, Central America or South America on temporary work visas or as undocumented migrants. During the October harvest, they may be from the Navajo Native American reservation. The overwhelming majority (78%) of the agricultural workers identify as Hispanic/Latino.

The work, especially in the lettuce fields, is arduous, requiring lines of workers to move up and down the rows, hoeing and later picking lettuce heads, often from 5am to 3pm, when the heat on this high-altitude plain between the Sangre de Cristo and San Juan mountains begins to soar.

For Jacqueline Aguilar, whose father came from Mexico as a teenager and worked his whole life in the fields until his death last year, the work is, in a sense, traditional. From the age of 12, she worked alongside him.

Now 21, she recently returned from an internship in Washington with the Child Labor Coalition, one of several lobbying groups fighting efforts by 10 Republican-led states to roll back a century of protection laws restricting child labour.

These include expanding permissible work hours, broadening the types of jobs child workers are permitted to do, and limiting employers' liability for injuries, illnesses or workplace fatalities. The laws broadly make it easier for children aged 14 to 17 to work longer and later - and in occupations that were previously off-limits.

However, Colorado is not one of these states. First, the Democrats hold the governorship, as well as majorities in the state house and senate. And second, it already allows children to work.

Children as young as 12 can work an unlimited number of hours in agriculture - so long as they do not miss school. In the potato-sorting warehouses, the minimum age is 16 because it is deemed ""hazardous work"".

In Washington, Aguilar was amazed to find she was the only person of colour in the room. She points out that the US manual labour force is now in effect ""Spanish"", to use a common umbrella term.

""I think Republicans are in denial that white people don't want to work manual labour any more,"" Aguilar says at the petrol station in Center, a farm town in the middle of the valley. ""So they say, ""˜let's just send in the kids.'""

According to a 2018 Government Accountability Office report, more than half of work-related fatalities for children in the US happen in the agriculture sector, where one child employee dies roughly every three days. A separate study, from the National Children's Center for Rural and Agricultural Health and Safety, found that 33 children are injured working on farms every day.

Outstanding investigations include the deaths of three 16-year-olds in Mississippi, Missouri and Wisconsin, including Duvan Tomas Perez, a Guatemalan boy who was killed working in a poultry plant; Michael Schuls, from Wisconsin, who was killed working at a sawmill, and Will Hampton, killed working at a landfill site. But with only about 800 investigators, federal labour authorities are limited in their ability to crack down on abuses and poor conditions.

Investigations have also exposed child labour in factories supplying parts to Hyundai and Kia in Alabama; at slaughterhouses and meat-processing plants in Nebraska and Minnesota; and at fast-food chains including McDonald's in Pittsburgh and Dunkin' Donuts in Massachusetts.

The investigations have resulted in $6.6m in fines for employers, an 87% rise on a year earlier.

Mhia Cazares was 16 when, picking lettuce in the Colorado fields last year, a truck rolled forward and back over her, injuring her spine. She was probably spared a fatal injury because the ground was soft after rain.

""If it had been dry, the driver of the lettuce machine would have crushed me,"" she says. ""The guy panicked, so it was on me for five minutes. I thought, ""˜by the time my mom gets here, I'm going to be dead.'""

Her injury kept her off school, so she lost friends, and there were rounds of visits to doctors. Then there was the legal fight for compensation. ""It's been a long process. I'm constantly in pain. It's changed my lifestyle - and my mental health.""

She has sued her employer. This summer, Colorado passed a law making it easier for injured minors to sue employers for child labour violations.

Mhia's mother, Vanessa Cazares, who also worked in Center's lettuce fields as a teenager, says she did not want her daughter to follow in her footsteps, but adds: ""She wanted the experience.""

""It's work, it's money, and you've got to do what you've got to do to provide for your family,"" says Cazares.

""But I don't want them to do what we had to do. There are other opportunities out there, so go to school and get your grades.""

In the baking fields of Colorado, the conflict between child labour protection and economic need is clear. For Aguilar's family and friends, working in the fields has long been normal in an area with few other opportunities.

""In my home and in my culture, it's normalised to work young. We need to help our families,"" she says. ""I don't want to be making things worse for them but I'd like to see more people of colour advocating for what we're connected to. There needs to be change.""

A bill before Congress, the children's act for responsible employment and farm safety (Care Act), aims to tighten up on loose rules on minimum age, working hours and hazardous conditions for children working on farms.

The bill was first introduced in 2009 by Lucille Roybal-Allard, a Democrat representative for California from 1993 to January this year. It failed, as did similar efforts in 2013, 2017 and 2019. The bill was subsequently reintroduced last year.

But these efforts to tighten regulations concern Cazares and others. ""A lot of families may not be financially stable. I understand they're worried about children, but money controls the world,"" she says.

For farm owners, the need for immigrant and child labour is beginning to change due to several factors. Heavy extraction from a shrinking aquifer beneath the valley has pushed up water prices, causing some farmers to switch from lettuce production to potatoes. But potato production is down, too, from about 30,000 hectares (75,000 acres) to nearer 21,000.

""The only way to get into sustainability and use less water is to farm less, and that's hard for the community and the farmers,"" says Jim Ehrlich, director of a Colorado potato growers organisation. ""It's going to hurt.""

Demand for warehouse labour to sort potatoes is sinking, too, as farmers start using AI-trained robots. The robots try to match each potato on the conveyor belt to 100,000 stored images. Where a match fails, the potato is removed by a robotic arm, reducing the need for hired potato pickers by 25%.

As the technology improves, demand for labour will fall further, and the tradition of children working in the fields, even on summer jobs, is declining.

Jeff McCullough, of the Spud Seller farm, believes that young people can be retained in farming through the use of AI because ""they understand it better"". ""The next generation of younger people just aren't prepared to do those [manual] jobs,"" he adds.

The complexity of Colorado's manual labour supply, the changing nature of agriculture and the impact of the climate crisis may mean that the area's use of child labour in agriculture will eventually die out. But this does not resolve the immediate dilemma for the child workers of the San Luis valley.

""I was only working in the fields because I needed to buy myself food and stuff for school,"" Aguilar says. ""The labour force here is Spanish - from Mexico, Peru, Venezuela, Guatemala - like it is in most of the US. Without the Spanish, this world would literally stop.

""But people don't want to accept that we work jobs no one else wants to work. It's another form of slavery, but one for the modern times.""

447,"""˜Bees are sentient': inside the stunning brains of nature's hardest workers","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/02/bees-intelligence-minds-pollination","""˜Bees are sentient': inside the stunning brains of nature's hardest workers

""˜Fringe' research suggests the insects that are essential to agriculture have emotions, dreams and even PTSD, raising complex ethical questions

When Stephen Buchmann finds a wayward bee on a window inside his Tucson, Arizona, home, he goes to great lengths to capture and release it unharmed. Using a container, he carefully traps the bee against the glass before walking to his garden and placing it on a flower to recuperate.

Buchmann's kindness - he is a pollination ecologist who has studied bees for over 40 years - is about more than just returning the insect to its desert ecosystem. It's also because Buchmann believes that bees have complex feelings, and he's gathered the science to prove it.

This March, Buchmann released a book that unpacks just how varied and powerful a bee's mind really is. The book, What a Bee Knows: Exploring the Thoughts, Memories and Personalities of Bees, draws from his own research and dozens of other studies to paint a remarkable picture of bee behavior and psychology. It argues that bees can demonstrate sophisticated emotions resembling optimism, frustration, playfulness and fear, traits more commonly associated with mammals. Experiments have shown bees can experience PTSD-like symptoms, recognize different human faces, process long-term memories while sleeping, and maybe even dream.

Buchmann is part of a small but growing group of scientists doing what he calls ""fringe"" research seeking to understand the full emotional capacity of bees. His research has radically changed the way he relates to the insects - not only does he now avoid killing them in his house, he has also significantly reduced lethal and insensitive treatment of specimens for his research.

""Two decades ago, I might have treated a bee differently,"" Buchmann says.

The new field of study could have significant implications for agriculture, an industry where bees are critical. That's because approximately one-third of the American diet, including many fruits, vegetables and nuts, relies on bees for pollination. In the past, bee research has focused on their role in crop pollination, but the work being pioneered by Buchmann and his contemporaries could force an ethical reckoning with how the animals are treated.

Commercially managed bees are considered livestock by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and are treated as a workhorse for food production, just as cattle in feedlots serve the beef industry. This mechanized approach to pollination makes no allowances for the kinds of revelations about bees' emotional lives that scientists like Buchmann have recently discovered.

""Bees are self-aware, they're sentient, and they possibly have a primitive form of consciousness,"" writes Buchmann. ""They solve problems and can think. Bees may even have a primitive form of subjective experiences.""

Evidence supporting insect sentience offers clues to what may be driving ""colony collapse disorder"", in which entire honeybee hives die within a single season - a phenomenon that has caused the population of these essential pollinators to precipitously drop over the last two decades. While the cause has been primarily attributed to pesticide use, Buchmann and other scientists argue the decline is also due to psychological stress caused by the brutal practices of industrialized agriculture.

Their work is raising practical and existential quandaries. Can large-scale agriculture and scientific research continue without causing bees to suffer, and is the dominant western culture even capable of accepting that the tiniest of creatures have feelings, too? Buchmann hopes an ethical shift will happen as details about the emotional lives of invertebrates - especially bees - are shared with the public.

""We are blasting bees with huge amounts of agrichemicals and destroying their natural foraging habitats,"" says Buchmann. ""Once people accept that bees are sentient and can suffer, I think attitudes will change.""

""˜A crazy hippy idea'

Because a bee's brain is so tiny - the size of a poppy seed - it's only in the last decade that research technology has become sophisticated enough to analyze its neurobiology. Before these innovations, most scientists studying the insects assumed there could not be much going on in a brain so small and with so few neurons. Insects were considered to be like instinct-driven robots, with no capacity to feel pain or experience suffering.

Now, that premise is being turned on its head. ""If someone would have told me 30 years ago that there might be emotion-like states in bees, I would have regarded that as a crazy hippy idea,"" says Lars Chittka, who has been working with bees since 1987 and is a professor in sensory and behavioral ecology at Queen Mary University of London. Chittka is the author of the 2022 book The Mind of a Bee and his pioneering research is featured prominently in Buchmann's book.

Chittka's attitude about what bees are capable of changed over time as he performed studies on how bees learn and process information. During a study 16 years ago, Chittka's lab set out to determine if bees could learn to avoid predators purely as an adaptive response. The experiment employed a robotic crab spider that lurked in flowers, briefly grabbing a bee and then releasing it unharmed.

After that negative experience, the bees learned to scan the laboratory's flowers to make sure they were spider-free before landing. But much to Chittka's surprise, some bees also seemed to exhibit what he describes as a kind of post-traumatic stress disorder. ""The bees not only showed predator avoidance but they also showed false alarm behavior,"" says Chittka. ""After scanning a perfectly safe flower, they rejected it and flew away, seeing a threat where there was none.""

More recently, Chittka and other scientists studied bee behavior in response to fluctuations in the feelgood neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin. Mood-regulating chemicals increased when bees received a surprise reward of sucrose, similar to when humans enjoy a sweet treat. The improved mood led bees to have more enthusiasm for foraging compared with bees who received no reward. Alternatively, when bees were shaken in a tube or otherwise put in an anxiety-producing situation, dopamine and serotonin decreased. Buchmann reports in his book that studies have discovered bee brains ""have their own internal opioid pleasure centers"".

Both Chittka and Buchmann suspect other insects could possess sentience and emotion-like states too, but studies have not been conducted to prove it. However, Chittka also says bees are in a class by themselves as pollinators, because this vital ecological role probably requires a uniquely sophisticated mind.

Bees are the only pollinators that must get enough food for themselves as well as harvest large amounts of pollen and nectar to support their colony. They must memorize the landscape, evaluate flower options and make quick decisions in a constantly changing environment. Chittka likens it to shopping in a grocery store, where you are rushing up and down aisles comparing products for the best deals and keeping a mental account before you return to the product you ultimately decide to buy.

""This is not a trivial challenge,"" says Chittka. ""Different flowers are blooming from one week to the next. And a flower patch you discovered in the morning that was rewarding might be depleted by competitors half an hour later so you have to readjust.""

Such findings have forced some to reconsider how bees are treated in a laboratory setting. Chittka says he would not run a traumatic experiment like the crab spider test today, but that he did not know such an outcome was possible back then. While Chittka now only conducts experiments he considers ""ethically defensible"", this is not the case for others in his field, particularly when it comes to research on farming and pesticides.

Part of the problem is that there are no animal welfare laws in the United States protecting insects - or any invertebrates - in a lab setting, unlike mice and other mammals. Often, experiments are deliberately designed to stress and kill bees in order to figure out how much the insects can tolerate in the fields.

""Many of my colleagues do invasive neuroscience experiments where bees have electrodes implanted into various body parts without any form of anesthesia,"" Chittka says. ""The current carefree situation that [invertebrate] researchers live in with no legal framework needs to be re-evaluated.""

A devastating threat

While untold numbers of bees are killed for scientific research, this pales in comparison with the number that die while pollinating mass-produced crops, particularly almonds. More than 2m colonies - about 70% of commercial honey bee colonies in the US - are trucked to California's almond groves every February and subjected to the perils of industrialized agriculture, from pesticides to disease, with billions of bees perishing every year.

But finding a way to mass-produce crops while reducing pain and suffering for bees is a daunting undertaking. If vegetarians and vegans who avoid eating animals for ethical reasons were to apply the same standards to foods pollinated by bees, they would have very little on their plates.

""We can't produce nutritious food in this country without bees,"" says a longtime agricultural entomologist working for the USDA. The scientist asked not to be named for fear of retribution by animal rights activists. While attempts have been made to develop mechanical drones that can pollinate crops and to create self-pollinating plants, nothing comes close to the efficiency of nature's original technology.

""We need to make sure that everybody has access to optimum nutrition that is affordable,"" says the entomologist, who is concerned about food deserts in the US. ""And we need bees to accomplish that.""

Commercial pollination is also big business. The California almond industry, which relies almost completely on honeybees, rakes in more than $11bn a year and is the third-most-profitable commodity in the state.

The USDA invests heavily in research to help commercial beekeepers manage disease in their colonies and figure out ways to counteract the stress bees experience in pesticide-laden fields. However, the delicate dance between a bee and a flower could rely as much on the mood of the bee as it does on interventions by beekeepers. And statistics show bees have not been in a good mood lately. According to the non-profit Bee Informed Partnership, commercial beekeepers lost 39% of their colonies in the 2021-2022 growing year. This was just a tad lower than the previous year's loss of 39.7%, the highest mortality rate on record.

While some agricultural operations have tried to improve the survival rate for bees by reducing pesticide use and planting more diverse forage beyond a single crop, a California startup called BeeHero is among the first commercial pollination services to directly address the issue of animal welfare.

The company uses electronic sensors that are placed in hives to monitor the sounds and tonal vibrations of the colony, which BeeHero says reflect the bees' emotional state. ""There is a throb or hum to a colony that is similar to a human heartbeat,"" says Huw Evans, head of innovation for BeeHero. ""Our sensors feel that hum the way a doctor hears a patient's heartbeat with a stethoscope.""

The data from the sensors is collected and analyzed for any variations that could indicate harms being caused by the surrounding environment. The information is also fed into an app that beekeepers can use to track the health of their hives in real time. In addition to periodically driving into the fields to physically inspect their hives, beekeepers can also check on their bees 24/7 through their phones.

BeeHero has raised $64m in venture capital and is pollinating approximately 100,000 acres of California almond groves. But not everyone - Buchmann included - thinks technology that monitors bee health is the right path forward. Buchmann instead wants a solution that addresses the root cause by changing industrial agricultural practices to be more bee friendly so there is no need to put sensors in hives. When he was attending graduate school at the University of California, Davis, in the 1970s, the almond industry was much smaller and the groves were filled with a diversity of flowering plants, like a well-stocked supermarket that blanketed the ground beneath the almond trees.

""The ground used to be buzzing with bees,"" recalls Buchmann. ""But no more. Now the almonds fall on bare ground or plastic sheeting and are vacuumed up by big harvesting units.""

For Buchmann and Chittka, the reason for creating a world where bees can be happy is much bigger than the human need for crop pollination. Both men say they have been profoundly changed by their discoveries of emotion-like states in bees. The mysterious, alien mind of a bee fills them with a sense of wonder as well as a conviction that creatures without a backbone have rights, too.

""These unique minds, regardless of how much they may differ from our own, have as much justification to exist as we do,"" says Chittka. ""It is a wholly new aspect of how weird and wonderful the world is around us.""

448,"Deforestation in Bolivia has jumped by 32% in a year. What is going on?","https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/oct/12/deforestation-in-bolivia-has-jumped-by-32-in-a-year-what-is-going-on","Deforestation in Bolivia has jumped by 32% in a year. What is going on?

Everything points to more, not less, tree clearance, as country's fastest-growing region embraces intensive agriculture

One hot night in RoborÃ©, a town in Bolivia's eastern lowlands, the community leader RubÃ©n DarÃ­o Arias was hunched over a laptop, smoking intensely as he pointed to the red spots where forest fires were breaking out all over the map.

This was in September 2022 - but it could have been any other recent year. Large forest fires are now an annual phenomenon in Bolivia - cause and effect of the deforestation linked to its booming agribusiness.

Bolivia's deforestation has long flown under the radar. That changed when Bolivia reportedly blocked a pledge to end deforestation by 2030 at the Amazon summit in August. But a closer look at the forces driving it leads to an unsettling conclusion: everything points to more, not less, deforestation to come.

In 2022, Global Forest Watch placed Bolivia third in the world for primary forest loss, behind Brazil and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for the third year in a row.

Scaled to population, Bolivia's deforestation is four times that of Brazil. Even as Brazil's deforestation falls, Bolivia's is rising. Its loss rate of primary forest jumped by 32% from 2021 to 2022, according to Global Forest Watch.

Most of this is happening in Santa Cruz, Bolivia's most economically dynamic region, where most of its soya and beef, as well as its sugar cane, corn and sorghum, is produced.

Santa Cruz is also home to the ChiquitanÃ­a, a dry forest ecosystem that is part of the Amazon watershed. Almost a quarter of it has been deforested since 1985.

""Santa Cruz has a vision of development that is very marked by intensive agriculture,"" says Alcides Vadillo, director of FundaciÃ³n Tierra, an NGO. ""We are seeing how capital and machinery can change forest into productive lands.""

Soya farming is the most significant driver of deforestation in Bolivia. In 2022, soya and its derivates were Bolivia's third largest export, generating revenues of more than $2bn. A study by Trase, which analyses supply chains, found that Bolivian soya production was linked to exceptionally high amounts of deforestation compared with neighbouring soya producers Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay.

Anapo, the industry organisation for Bolivia's soya farmers, denies that the sector is responsible for deforestation, saying that the surface area dedicated to soya farming has barely increased in recent years. But Stasiek Czaplicki, an environmental economist who contributed to the Trase report, says this a sleight of hand. New lands are continually being deforested and sown with soya for a few years, with diminishing yields, until they are given over to another activity, such as low-intensity ranching. So, the overall surface area might not be rising - but the sector is still driving deforestation.

In Bolivia, it is cheaper to buy forest land and turn it into farmland than to invest in existing farmland to improve its productivity and longevity. Moreover, that land will appreciate in value - which hints at the thriving business behind agriculture in Santa Cruz.

""The soya business isn't really a soya business,"" says Czaplicki. ""It's the business of land.""

Land is still cheap in Bolivia - much more affordable than in neighbouring countries - but continually increasing in value as Bolivia becomes more integrated into regional and international markets. It also costs relatively little to deforest that land, said Vadillo, because the Bolivian state heavily subsidises fuel - and deforesting land can double or triple its value.

""In the 90s, forest land in Bolivia could be bought for perhaps $20 to $70 per hectare,"" said Czaplicki. ""Today, that land might be worth almost $1,000 per hectare. Imagine if you invested in the 90s and were selling that land today. The profits are extraordinary - I can't think of any other legal business like it.""

The expansion of the agricultural frontier has been a rare point of agreement between the central government in La Paz, led by the Movimiento al Socialismo (Mas) almost without interruption since 2006, and the economic elite in Santa Cruz, who are otherwise rivals on either side of an old regional divide. Santa Cruz has long pushed for greater decentralisation.

""That alliance has been explicit,"" says Enrique Ormachea, an investigator at the thinktank CEDLA. ""The Mas never did a serious agrarian reform that would affect the property of the big landowners in Santa Cruz. Instead, they agreed on expanding the agricultural frontier for exports.""

The Mas has specifically sought to incorporate more smallholders into the supply chain by handing out public lands for nothing to settlers. But its policies have also boosted production by larger landowners and the more than 120 Mennonite colonies throughout Bolivia.

Aside from building infrastructure and keeping taxes on agricultural goods and machinery low, the government has increased the amount of land that can be legally deforested, and retrospectively pardoned illegal deforestation.

Illegal deforestation is rarely penalised. And when it is, the fines are risible: 20¢ a hectare, compared with hundreds of dollars a hectare in neighbouring countries.

The Mas still has big plans for the sector. It wants to produce palm oil in Bolivia, boost beef exports to China and build biodiesel refineries that would use Bolivian produce - all of which would be a boon to agribusiness in Santa Cruz. But this isn't simply an elite pact: there is deep support throughout Santa Cruz for expanding the agriculture frontier.

This can be seen at ExpoCruz, the region's annual business fair. It is also a week-long party that coincides with Santa Cruz Day on 24 September, where the region's economic growth and identity are presented as synonymous with agribusiness. The whole city seems to turn out to celebrate. Families and couples stroll through hangars full of cattle, while farm smells mingle with grilled meat.

The ""CruceÃ±o model"", which claims to explain the region's growth, is on everyone's lips. It emphasises the entrepreneurship, self-reliance and liberal spirit of the lowlands - epitomised by farming and ranching - and plays down the critical role of state investment.

This, says Czaplicki, is part of a search for regional identity, as Bolivia's lowlands define themselves against Andean highlands. ""Turn on the radio, open a newspaper, and you won't find anything to the contrary. It is almost politically incorrect to question it.""

Partly as a result, none of the local or national political parties are against expanding the agricultural frontier - nor is there yet a groundswell of popular resistance that could change that. Meanwhile, beyond the fair, in places like RoborÃ©, the consequences are being felt in the form of drought and degraded soil, displaced communities and more frequent and intense forest fires.

""But still, the model expands,"" says Czaplicki. ""We're heading towards a situation of cyclic water crises, loss of biodiversity and ever greater environmental pollution.

""The future looks dark.""

451,"Starbucks develops coffee seeds that can withstand climate change effects","https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/04/starbucks-arabica-coffee-seed-climate-change","Starbucks develops coffee seeds that can withstand climate change effects

Starbucks-developed seeds of arabica, which accounts for 70% of global coffee production, are cultivated to resist diseases

Starbucks recently announced that it has developed six new varieties of coffee seeds that can withstand the effects of climate change, which some experts say is ""critical"" for the future of coffee.

People in the US drink about 517m cups of coffee a day collectively, with the average American consuming three cups on a daily basis. But coffee, like many other crops, is under threat due to the climate crisis - subject to diseases, droughts and extreme weather conditions.

Most of the coffee consumed worldwide comes from two species - arabica and robusta. Accounting for 70% of global coffee production, the arabica bean is more popular and for a good reason. Its smoother flavor, lower acidity and fruity hints rank paramount to robusta's grainy, more bitter flavor. Native to Ethiopia and predominantly grown in Central and South America, arabica is the only bean that Starbucks uses in its nearly 37,000 locations worldwide. But its sensitivity to rising temperatures makes it especially vulnerable to premature ripening and crop loss.

""More researchers doing work that will provide climate resilient varieties is critical,"" said Sarada Krishnan, a coffee grower and scientist at the Crop Trust, a nonprofit dedicated to conserving crop diversity. Robusta, a thicker bean, is generally more favorable to heat, and therefore easier to grow. Arabica on the other hand, with its low genetic diversity, is more susceptible to diseases like coffee leaf rust - a fungus that can overtake the plant when the conditions are warmer and wetter.

""When smallholder farmers get that, they lose and their whole income for the year is gone,"" Krishnan, who owns an arabica coffee farm in Jamaica and knows the challenges of dealing with the disease first-hand, said. ""Last year toward the end of the harvest, the rust came, and if you let the rust take over then you lose the plant and it will take five years to get a fruit crop.""

Starbucks-developed arabica seeds are cultivated to resist the leaf rust and tests have been shown to generate a higher yield in a shorter period of time. According to the company, the Starbucks agronomy team plants several different varieties and hybrids of seeds, monitoring the trees' resistance to diseases and nutrient absorption through at least six generations or about 12 years.

""Starbucks is committed to ensuring the future of coffee,"" said a representative of the company in an email. ""We have a responsibility to care for the entire supply chain and the many people who make coffee possible, from bean to cup, farmer to customer.""

The company is giving away its six climate-resilient coffee tree varieties to farmers who are free to sell the resulting crop to buyers other than Starbucks. The coffee giant buys from about 400,000 farmers across 30 countries, and over the last five years, it has given away three million climate-resistant seeds annually, developed by others to farms in Costa Rica, Honduras, Peru, Mexico, China, Indonesia, Guatemala and Nicaragua.

458,"Working harder than ever: the last remaining Japanese American farmers","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/16/japanese-american-farmers-california-central-coast","Working harder than ever: the last remaining Japanese American farmers

California families endured wartime incarceration and market changes to stay in business, but gen Z eyes life beyond the farm

Alan Hayashi's 120-hectare (300-acre) farm is an unassuming pillar of Arroyo Grande, a city on California's central coast that's covered by rolling vineyards and ancient oaks. Two vast fields, partitioned by an inland stretch of Highway 1, produce white strawberries, squash, beets, celery and two dozen other crops.

Hayashi, who's up at dawn seven days a week, has devoted the better half of his life to the farm's upkeep: he plants, irrigates and harvests his crops, the roar of rushing traffic an untiring companion. He also packages and sells the goods at his roadside stand and different farmers' markets in San Luis Obispo county. On a good day, he'll wrap up by 6pm and return home for dinner.

""It's not cut out for everybody,"" said Hayashi, 62. ""I'm probably working harder now than I did 30 years ago.""

Four generations of Hayashi sons have grown up and worked on the farmland that Alan's grandfather, Yeiju, leased in 1942. In the 1960s and 70s, the Hayashis farmed on nearly 400 hectares (1,000 acres) of land extending to Morro Bay. Along with several other Japanese families, they were the country's most prolific growers of napa cabbage and bok choy.

The Hayashis are among the last remaining Japanese American farming families in a region once replete with them. Before the second world war, two-thirds of Japanese Americans on the West coast were working in agriculture, cultivating fruits and vegetables on coastal bluffs, arid ranches and defunct gold mines. In California, first- and second-generation farmers, the issei and nisei, produced more than 70% of greenhouse flowers and 40% of commercial vegetables, including nearly all strawberries, tomatoes, celery and peppers.

The incarceration of Japanese Americans during the war led to enormous property losses that not only denied them the chance to build generational wealth - but also buried the vital role these family farmers played in transforming California into an agricultural juggernaut. Now, only a fraction of Japanese farms with prewar roots remain in business. Preserving the legacy of their forebears are a dwindling group of sansei, the aging third-generation farmers who, like Hayashi, are forgoing retirement and adapting to myriad economic and social forces that have upended their industry.

At the turn of the 20th century, Japanese immigrants from rural farming and fishing villages arrived in California to fill a labor shortage created by the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, which barred Chinese immigration to the US. They steadily climbed the agricultural ladder, from day laborers to sharecroppers and leaseholders. But lawmakers soon passed racist ordinances targeting issei (first-generation) farmers: the California Alien Land Law of 1913 barred Asian immigrants from owning agricultural land or signing leases longer than three years.

""Japanese immigrants and their American-born children faced such rampant racism and legal restrictions that the unintended consequence was they really stuck together,"" said Donna Graves, a public historian and co-author of Sento at Sixth and Main: Preserving Landmarks of Japanese American Heritage.

Japanese immigrant farmers, she said, became extraordinarily skilled at growing high-yield crops, such as strawberries and tomatoes, on leased plots of land. (A small percentage of farmers were able to buy property under the names of their US-born children and relatives.) They also created co-ops to sell large quantities of produce to restaurants and wholesalers, she said. Though Japanese operations constituted only 2% of farms on the West coast in 1940, their average value per acre (about half a hectare) was $280, compared to just $38 for other farms.

""These ""˜quick crops' went for good prices and could yield faster profits than, for example, fruit trees that require more secure ownership of land,"" Graves said.

Drawn to its temperate climate and glut of fertile soil, an outsize share of issei farmers settled in the Arroyo Grande valley. In the 1920s, seven local Japanese farming families, including the Hayashis and the Ikedas, formed the Pismo Oceano Vegetable Exchange (Pove), a co-op that allowed them to consolidate supplies and sell to large wholesalers. In its heyday, Hayashi said, the co-op drew more than 70 members; today, only three remain active.

Like many sansei farmers, Hayashi and his four brothers learned everything about the trade from their father, Haruo, who died last year. (Three took over the farm while two became doctors.) In the second grade, Hayashi recalled watching Bonanza on TV with his youngest brother. When Haruo came home, he put them in the back of his truck and drove to a celery field 3 miles away. The elder Hayashi instructed his sons to pull weeds, and left. They were exhausted when he returned some time later.

""He told us, ""˜I never want to see you watching TV and sitting around again,'"" Hayashi said. ""He instilled that work ethic in all of us.""

Hayashi said his mother, Rose, was the ""backbone of the family"". Like the matriarchs of other Japanese American households in Arroyo Grande, Rose cared for the children while working full-time as the farm's bookkeeper.

After Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, Japanese farmers were rounded up into concentration camps and forced to sell their possessions at fire-sale prices. Crops worth millions of dollars were abandoned. Hayashi said his family was lucky, as friends and neighbors took care of their land, trucks and other equipment while they were incarcerated in Arizona. Hayashi's father, who later fought against Japan in the army, returned home to rebuild and lead the farm into its most prosperous years.

Hayashi said he was especially sensitive about incarceration when he was a child. In middle school he would get into fights with classmates who insulted his parents and other Japanese Americans.

""Growing up, I was a little bit angry,"" he said. ""One day, my mom said: ""˜You shouldn't be, because I'm not. If your dad was full of anger, do you think he'd achieve what he has?' I never got into another fight for words after that.""

The decision to incarcerate 120,000 people of Japanese descent was at least partially influenced by anti-Japanese hysteria from white growers, research indicates. The US government seized more than 6,000 Japanese-operated farms totaling nearly 100,000 hectares (250,000 acres), valued at between $2bn and $5bn in 2017 dollars, according to the Commission on the Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians. Much of this confiscated farmland was sold or leased to ""non-Japanese"" farmers, mostly naturalized European immigrants and southern migrants from the Dust Bowl region. By the end of the war, Japanese farms comprised just 30% of their pre-war total. (In 1988, the government passed the Civil Liberties Act, providing an apology and a $20,000 cash payment to each living survivor of incarceration.)

""What [these farmers] were able to revive after the war was a tiny fraction of what they were growing before the war,"" Graves said. ""The idea of rebuilding was overwhelming.""

While the majority of farmers were men, many Japanese American women also took charge of family businesses.

The San Gabriel Nursery and Florist in southern California, helmed by the Yoshimura family, celebrated its centennial in June. ""Our survival is a testament to our tenacity,"" said Mary Ishihara Swanton, 56, the sansei co-owner.

Swanton's grandparents, Fred and Mitoko Yoshimura, had to rebuild twice in 20 years - first after returning from incarceration and then in the late 1960s, when an arsonist burned the nursery down. During the 1990s, Swanton said, the family had to fight back a decade-long crusade by the San Gabriel city council to buy the nursery and clear it for real estate development.

The nursery remains a family-run operation, helmed by Swanton's father, who is 88, and four other relatives. But it has downsized significantly in recent years, Swanton said.

In the 1980s, the nursery catered to the region's burgeoning Chinese and Taiwanese immigrants by importing citrus trees and kumquats for lunar new year gifts. Now, Trader Joe's and other big-box retailers carry such plants, as well as the azaleas, camellias and bonsai that the Swanton's grandparents specialized in growing.

Despite the nursery's uncertain future, Swanton said she'll continue to honor the memory of her grandparents and her aunt, Margie, who was the face of the business until her death in January.

""It was her dream to make it to 100,"" Swanton said.

Over the past few decades, Graves said, large industrial farms have dominated the agricultural economy, making it increasingly difficult for small-scale family operations to compete. Postwar development in the southern California suburbs converted farmland into subdivisions and aerospace plants. Children of the sansei, who are generation Z and millennials, also have more career opportunities than their elders did, and few are choosing to go into the harsh and financially fraught field of farming.

Hayashi said smaller farms are producing less and less over time due to increasing costs and regulations. He's had to pull back on his growing operations to cut losses. Most of his 120-hectare land is now leased to other farming operations.

""There are many variables you're not in control of,"" he said. ""In my dad's days, the roller coaster was flatter.""

Some family farms adopted new business strategies to answer to these changes. In Fresno, David ""Mas"" Masumoto found success organically growing peaches, nectarines and grapes on the farm his parents bought in 1948. Tanaka Farms, which opened in 1940 and is the last family-operated farm in Irvine, made the switch in the 1990s from wholesale to agritourism.

""My generation, the sansei, really gathered the fruits of our issei and nisei forefathers,"" said Glenn Tanaka, 65, a third-generation owner.

Tanaka said small-scale farming became more challenging in the 1980s, when he took the reins from his father. Inflation increased labor costs and interest rates, pushing the farm to the verge of bankruptcy and forcing Tanaka to scale back. Once a 40-hectare (100-acre) strawberry farm, the ranch today occupies just 12 hectares (30 acres) of land, only half of which is reserved for agriculture.

Tanaka still grows some 60 crops, including strawberries, Japanese turnips and Anaheim chilis, and sells them direct to visitors. But what keeps the business alive, Tanaka said, is the farm tours and educational programming, which attract about 200,000 annual visitors and generate 75% of the farm's revenue. During the school year, dozens of delighted children visit the farm every week to pick strawberries and pumpkins.

""If we relied on growing and retail to make money,"" he said, ""we'd be out of business long ago.""

Graves, the historian, said there's no exact data or existing studies on how many Japanese farms with prewar roots are still in business today. But a growing number of community-led projects are aiming to document this history.

In 2017, the History Center of San Luis Obispo County commemorated the 75th anniversary of incarceration by curating an exhibit on Japanese American farming families on the central coast. Hatano Farm, the last Japanese American ranch on the Palos Verdes peninsula, was designated a state historical site last year. Writer Amanda Mei Kim's Kansha History project is a volunteer-led effort to document and digitize all the Japanese American farms seized in California during the second world war.

Hayashi's two adult sons, who are pursuing careers in dentistry and mechanical engineering, will not be following in their father's footsteps. But Hayashi said he isn't worried that his family's 80-year-old enterprise might end with him.

""The Hayashi name will sooner or later fade to the back,"" Hayashi said. ""Our cousins and nieces and nephews will be the caretakers of the next generation.""

Vard Ikeda, 65, is Hayashi's second cousin and president of the Ikeda Brothers farm, just 2 miles north of the Hayashi farm. He's mentoring fourth-generation, or yonsei, farmers in the family business.(Ikeda's cousin, Tom, is the president of Pove.)

""We're sort of in the opposite mode of expanding and growing,"" Ikeda said, noting that his family is currently leasing many acres from the Hayashi farm.

Both Ikeda and Hayashi remain deeply grateful to friends and neighbors who protected their farms during the war - a kindness that few other Japanese farming families experienced. Ikeda, in fact, was named after Joseph Vard Loomis, a prominent Arroyo Grande business owner who not only cared for the farm when his family was incarcerated but also extended credit to help them start over.

Part of what motivates them to wake up at dawn and clock 12-hour shifts well into their golden years, they said, is the desire to ensure the business is in good shape for the next generation, as their forebears did for them.

""I do this because my dad and uncles worked so hard,"" Ikeda said. ""I think in some ways I'm still trying to make them proud.""

For Hayashi, who compared his leathery hands to those of a 90-year-old's, there's a sense of catharsis, and thrill, to the intense physical demands of farming.

""It's not for the mighty dollar, I'll tell you that,"" he said. ""But you feel pretty satisfied at the end of the day when you swap over to your chair.""

Animal welfare organisations and rodeo industry agree on need for a national code, but activists are pushing for rodeos to be banned


Animal rights groups are pushing for a national rodeo code to ensure greater transparency and safeguards to protect livestock used in the sport.

Tens of thousands flock to outback towns across Australia to watch or compete in rodeo circuits. There are more than 1000 rodeo events nationwide each year, which operate subject to animal welfare laws that vary across state borders.

One of the most well-known rodeos happens every October in Warwick, southern Queensland. The almost century-old meet is one of the largest in the country.

Sign up to receive Guardian Australia's fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter

One 19-year-old patron, who said he had attended hundreds of rodeos in Queensland since the age of two, told Guardian Australia the event was ""the holy grail of rodeo"".

""Without this, Warwick would be a ghost town. It's so important,"" he said.

Also in the stands at the recent Warwick rodeo were members of Animal Liberation Queensland, which is leading the charge in lobbying against rodeos.

ALQ activist Gayle D'Arcy has sat in the bleachers of rodeo arenas for nearly a decade, discreetly filming the events.

D'Arcy and a dozen other volunteers have recorded hundreds of hours of rodeo footage in an effort to document what they allege are instances of animals under stress or in pain. The aim is to make the case for more rigorous regulation in Queensland, with the ultimate goal of seeing rodeos banned entirely.

Their footage includes alleged instances of bucking horses being prodded with electric jiggers, despite the practice being banned in Queensland from 2020.

""It's a sport that's had such a good run of publicity,"" D'Arcy said. ""But if you did what they do at rodeos in your local paddock, people would look at you and say: ""˜What the hell are you doing?'""

Biosecurity Queensland said they had received seven reports alleging the use of electric prodders on horses since the ban. There have been no prosecutions but ""regulatory outcomes were applied in some instances,"" a spokesperson said.

Greg Frewin, president of the Australian Rodeo Federation, the country's peak rodeo association, said electric prodders should not be used to make horses buck under any circumstances.

Regulation, selective breeding and better safety standards have made the sport less harmful for animals, according to Frewin.

""The animal welfare side of it thinks we make them [horses and bulls] buck - we cannot make them buck,"" Frewin said. ""We breed the ones who want to buck, the ones that enjoy it.""

Frewin said making sure all rodeo organisations were ""operating at a high level"" in relation to animal welfare was a challenge due to differing rules in each state and territory.

""What is happening in a little outback town should be the same as what's happening in a major city,"" Frewin said.

Frewin claimed the federation was working with government departments to legislate a national code. But the federal department of agriculture told Guardian Australia they were not aware of any approach by the federation or any rodeo other associations for at least the last two years.

The 2023-2024 federal budget includes $5m to renew the Australian Animal Welfare Strategy. The department said it welcomes the input of rodeo associations in developing policy.

The NSW Department of Primary Industries and Agriculture Victoria also said they had not had any contact with any rodeo associations.

Biosecurity Queensland said it ""regularly engages"" with the rodeo associations that oversee events in that state, including the Australian Professional Rodeo Association (Apra). It also carries out compliance monitoring at rodeos.

RSPCA's senior scientific officer, Di Evans, who opposes rodeos, said more monitoring and regulation was needed.

The RSPCA is particularly focused on calf roping, where a competitor on horseback chases a calf into the arena, throws a lasso around its neck, dismounts, and then ties the calf's legs together. Calf roping has been effectively banned in South Australia and Victoria, because those states require that cattle used in rodeo events have a minimum weight of 200kg. All rodeos are prohibited in the ACT.

Polling commissioned this year by the RSPCA found 61% of Australians would support a ban on calf roping, while a 2022 survey found 67% were concerned about the welfare of horses and cattle used at rodeos - an increase on previous years.

""Having spent 20 years in the agricultural sector as a vet, where there is such a big effort from the industry to promote low-stress stock handling, rodeo totally contradicts all those principles,"" Evans said.

""As a first step we would at least like to see calf roping banned, and then very stringent national welfare standards.""

In July, the Australian Veterinary Association ratified a statement outlining their opposition towards rodeo events, including calf roping, and support for a national code. The AVA's statement refers to research which has found calves used in rodeo events experience fear and distress.

""The welfare of the animals involved in the sport must be carefully considered and any negative animal welfare implications must be assessed on a risk-reward basis,"" the AVA said.

The Australian Professional Rodeo Association was contacted for comment.

Experts find evidence at Derbyshire cremation site of horses and dogs originating from the Baltic Shield

When the Vikings arrived in England they didn't just bring their helmets, axes and beards -they also brought their horses and dogs, research suggests.

Experts studying cremated remains associated with the Viking great army that invaded England in AD865, say they have found evidence of animals and humans travelling from the Baltic Shield - a geographical area that encompasses Finland and parts of Norway, Sweden and Russia.

""It's the first scientific proof that the Vikings did bring their animals with them from Scandinavia,"" said Prof Julian Richards, co-author of the study from the University of York.

""It's so nice to have this scientific evidence for something we see later in the Bayeux tapestry with the Normans disembarking the fleet, but this is 200 years earlier.""

Writing in the journal Plos One, Richards and colleagues describe how they analysed the ratio of different strontium isotopes in cremated remains found at the barrow cemetery at Heath Wood, Derbyshire.

This is the only known large-scale Viking cremation site in the British Isles and is linked to the Viking great army, which spent the winter of AD873-874 at nearby Repton. Previous work at the barrow revealed bones belonging to two adults and a child, as well as a dog, horse and another animal - possibly a pig.

Studying the ratio of strontium isotopes in human remains, and comparing it with that of plants in the area, can shed light on whether an individual could have been local to where they were buried.

This is because ratio of isotopes of strontium in the soil reflects the makeup of the rocks beneath. When strontium enters the food chain it is incorporated into our bodies, replacing some of the calcium in our teeth and skeletons. In the case of bones, this process continues to occur throughout life.

""Most of the strontium that is incorporated into your bones is from plants,"" said Tessi Loeffelmann, first author of the research from Durham University.

Crucially, while bones that are buried can exchange strontium with the surrounding soil, potentially confusing results, this does not happen when bones have been burned.

The team's analysis suggests one of the adults and the child could have grown up locally to the barrow, or possibly in Denmark, although the isotope ratios also fit with large parts of Europe.

However, the other adult and the animals either came from very specific parts of the UK with no records of the Viking great army, or from the Baltic Shield - the latter being a much more likely scenario in the team's view.

Richards said that horses and dogs were status symbols in Viking tradition, and may have been cremated with the owner for use after death in Valhalla - although the presence of the pig is less clear. While it might have come from livestock, another possibility, the team writes, is that the bone was part of an amulet.

Judith Jesch, professor of Viking studies at the University of Nottingham who was not involved in the research said the study supported the view that the Viking great army was more of a mobile, armed community than an army, and sheds light on the ships they may have used.

""My own studies of the Old Norse vocabulary of ships indicate that the long, sleek warships that we think of as typical Viking ships did not evolve until a century or so later than this,"" said Jesch.

""In the ninth century, the ships that crossed the North Sea were broader and deeper and capable of carrying substantial cargo, including livestock, as [literary and archaeological evidence suggests] they did when people settled in Iceland at just this time.""

467,"""˜This place wanted to be a wetland': how a farmer turned his fields into a wildlife sanctuary","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/22/farm-wetland-bird-animal-sanctuary-oregon","""˜This place wanted to be a wetland': how a farmer turned his fields into a wildlife sanctuary

Once, Karl Wenner's Oregon land leaked pollution into a nearby lake. Now, 70 acres are home to waterfowl, turtles and endangered fish

Birdsong hums over the rumble of Karl Wenner's truck as it bounces along the dusty trails that weave through his property. For almost 100 years, this farm in southern Oregon grew barley, but now, amid the sprawling fields, there lies a wetland teeming with life.

Wenner installed the wetland on 70 of the farm's 400 acres to help deal with phosphorus pollution that leaked into the adjacent Upper Klamath Lake after his land flooded each winter. With support from a team of scientists and advocates, the project has become a welcome sanctuary for migrating and native birds that are disappearing from the area.

Today, this corner of Lakeside Farms looks far different from a typical American farm. Waterfowl nest among the vegetation, joining pond turtles and even endangered native fish near rows of sprouting barley.

Looking out at the swaying cattails and wocus plants peeking through the water on an afternoon in June, Wenner beams: ""This place wanted to be a wetland.""

It's a remarkable transformation and a promising example of a symbiotic solution to one of the world's most pressing environmental problems.

The stakes are high. Considered ""among the most productive ecosystems in the world"", wetlands are disappearing rapidly. Roughly 80% around the world have already vanished. In the expansive Klamath basin that straddles the California-Oregon border, once described as the ""Everglades of the west"", more than 95% of wetlands have been drained, diverted or dried.

Wenner, a co-owner of the land, hopes the farm won't be unique for long. With an unprecedented amount of federal funding available through the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act and other government programs, Wenner and his partners are encouraging more farmers and ranchers to follow in their footsteps.

""We are demonstrating it is possible,"" Wenner said. ""We just have to do it on a gigantic scale.""

""˜It's a magical thing to see'

The Lakeside Farms wetland broke ground in 2021, flattening the barley fields and carving dikes and channels for water flows that would leave small artificial nesting islands. The water, produced from a natural spring on the property, quickly germinated seeds for marsh plants that had been dropped by birds and long left dormant. By the summer of 2022, the vegetation began to do its work, feeding fowl and cleaning the farm's runoff, pumped within its banks rather than into the lake.

The plan, designed with both conservation and capitalization of the land in mind, took 70 acres of the farm out of production. But Wenner says his costs have largely been covered with government funds, and there's a lot more to go around.

Along with state and locally financed initiatives, close to $5bn in funding will be available through the Inflation Reduction Act to fund projects on agricultural land that solve conservation problems.

The benefits, Wenner says, have been almost immediate.

Wetlands serve as a natural sponge, soaking up harmful minerals and pollution before they seep into the watershed. Tucked between Upper Klamath Lake and an interstate highway, Lakeside Farms' cropland leached high amounts of phosphorus - roughly five times above the amount allowed by regulations last February. It took mere months for the wetland to filter the sediment back to safe levels.

""You set the stage and Mother Nature takes over,"" Wenner said. ""It's just a magical thing to see.""

Wenner is convinced the move has been a boon to business. The farm is no longer running afoul of regulations, while a plan to add a rotating wetland on other parts of its land will enable it to go organic, yielding ""a much higher price for the crop"".

The project comes at a critical time for the region, where one the largest watersheds in the western US coexists with hundreds of farms and ranches. The area is home to rich biodiversity but has struggled as marshes and lakebeds were replaced by cattle ranges and crops.

The climate crisis is making the Klamath basin hotter and drier, creating stress for farmers and wildlife alike. Populations of migrating birds have plummeted, falling from roughly 5.8 million observed in 1958 to a peak of just 93,000 counted last year.

Many are finding hope in plans to demolish four dams along the Klamath River - the largest dam removal project in US history - bringing the ecosystem one step closer to recovery. But more solutions will be needed.

""We have the dams coming out and one of the biggest ecosystems in the county has the potential to be a functioning ecosystem again,"" Wenner said. ""It is a disrupted, screwed-up system - but this is fixable.""

The work is not without obstacles. ""Our biggest challenge is where water is available to manage wetlands,"" said Ed Contreras, a coordinator of the Intermountain West Joint Venture, an organization dedicated to building public-private partnerships to support bird habitats. He added that the Lakeside Farms project was an important case study.

""The way I see this program right now is it is a pilot,"" he said. There was excitement across the region about the potential to expand, he said, ""but it is going to take a lot of people coming together and thinking big picture to scale that up.""

Thousands of miles away, Paul Botts is confronting the same challenges. As the executive director of the Wetlands Initiative, a non-profit conservation organization in Chicago, he is determined to expand the use of what he calls ""smart wetlands"" across productive farm belts and hopes one day they will be as common as any other farming strategy.

""The ultimate goal here is that one day my children or grandchildren are driving around the midwest and every other farm field has one of these wetlands,"" he said. He believes more widespread reliance on wetlands will be essential to meet conservation goals, and will also help stabilize food producers in an uncertain future.

""Our climate is changing and farmers are living it,"" he said. ""One of the best things we can do to adapt ourselves to that changing climate is to put small scattered wetlands back in our landscape.""

These natural systems help blunt climate catastrophes, holding water for dry times and slowing the speed of floods. ""We view smart wetlands as an excellent example of a big-picture climate adaptation solution,"" Botts added.

Back in Klamath, Wenner is checking on his bees. He pulls out a small tray from one of his boxed hives, marveling at the collected pollen as the insects casually come and go. Soon he will send it off to a lab in Belgium that analyzes what the bees have retrieved to give him information about what's taking seed at Lakeside Farms.

""There are a huge number of plants growing out there and the bees are going to tell us what they are,"" he said. Already the results have been exciting. After decades, the once monoculture land is bursting with biodiversity, both plants and animals alike.

Wenner gets emotional when he talks about the change. A strategy to fall in line with regulations sprouted an opportunity. ""I read the news and it is one environmental disaster after another,"" he said. ""But I always hoped that maybe we can be smart enough to fix this stuff.

""Now I am learning that you can,"" he added. Wenner hopes the natural systems will be given a chance. ""We just have to figure out how to do it.""

From law firm to farm: five Ukrainian refugees describe the wrench of adjusting to new lives in strange corners of Europe, as well as the opportunities and generosity they encountered

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, more than 8 million refugees have fled the country for Europe. But according to UNHCR data, only a third of them have found jobs since their displacement and many complain of underemployment.

What is it like to flee your home and then try to earn a living in a foreign country? To lose a career and a lifetime's work, and start all over again? Five Ukrainians tell us what has been lost and what has been gained, since war forced them to transform their working life.

Zug, Switzerland

Olha specialised in business law, handling litigation, contracts and numerous prestigious clients in Ukraine. When Russian tanks approached the outskirts of Kyiv, Olha realised that she might not survive.

""I made a promise to myself: if I survive, I will change something in my life and get closer to my dream.""

That dream was to become a farmer, inspired by a visit to an agricultural exhibition years before. ""I usually attended business meetings filled with bankers and lawyers, but this was something different,"" Olha remembers. ""There was a real sense of community.""

In March 2022, she wrote to the Swiss Farmers' Union, believing that the country's farming traditions offered the best opportunity for her transition. However, the responses were initially discouraging.

""Of course, it was kind of a shock for people, for them to hear from a Ukrainian lawyer,"" she says. """"˜We have no openings,' they said.

""And to work on a Swiss farm, you require specialised education, particularly for animal care.""

Undeterred, Olha persevered and in May last year she received the offer of an internship. The next day, she packed a small bag of clothes and set off.

""I didn't know a single person,"" she says. ""Initially, I cried every other day, then once a week, then once a month. Well, now I'm not crying any more, I'm just learning. I travel a lot, I talk with farmers and cheesemakers in order to acquire knowledge.

""And learning German was a challenge, but now I take exams without the need for interpretation.""

Olha sustains herself on a modest scholarship, which is lower than the minimum wage. ""My standard of living is very different from my life in Ukraine, but I pay for everything myself.""

Her perspective on life and work shifted profoundly after the invasion. ""A neighbour offered me her car to go grocery shopping. Would I have lent my car to someone just so they could buy groceries? I would do it now. Two years ago, I'm not so sure.""

Olha's future plan is to return to Ukraine but not to her legal career. ""I love farming,"" she says. ""These cows make me happy.""

Oxford, UK

""I turned 50 in November,"" Yanina says with a mix of surprise and gratitude. ""My colleagues from the pub treated me in the most incredible way. A cake with the yellow-blue of the Ukrainian flag inside.

""I never expected such warmth away from home,"" she says.

For 15 years, Yanina lived in a resort village in the Kharkiv region, where she had built a guesthouse overlooking the river. ""After university, I was interested in green tourism in Ukraine, and I was engaged in this for most of my life,"" she says.

More than 80% of the houses in her village have been either critically damaged or destroyed. ""Russian troops were just across the river, firing at our village,"" Yanina says. ""My guesthouse, like many others, was lost.""

After several months of occupation, Yanina miraculously managed to escape in May 2022, with only the clothes she was wearing.

She found refuge through the UK's Homes for Ukraine programme in November 2022. ""People here have opened their doors to us. I am literally living in someone's home, as part of their family. My sponsors are a wonderful family, the age of my parents. They helped me a lot.""

Faced with the challenge of acclimatising to a foreign culture and language, Yanina began taking English lessons. ""There are plenty of free courses available for Ukrainians,"" she says.

She appreciates the support she receives in the UK. ""The benefits here keep you afloat, but they also encourage you to seek employment. I don't understand how one could live on £330 even in Ukraine.

""For me, it would be a shame not to work in a country that offers housing, free travel, English courses and more,"" Yanina says.

Last December, she started working in the Dewdrop pub in Oxford, balancing her job as a dishwasher with studying psychology. She washes dishes while listening to online lectures, especially about war trauma.

""All Ukrainians, without exception, need psychological help. Russia is killing us not only on the frontline, but it is killing the civilian population as well.""

The future holds uncertainties, but she remains steadfast in her connection to Ukraine. ""The majority of Ukrainians, both those who stayed and those who left, cannot dream normally. They cannot dream and plan for the future.

""I will return,"" she says, ""but I don't know when or where yet, because there is no way of restoring the destruction I have experienced.""

Vienna, Austria

In the quiet of a February night in 2022, Oleksandr and Olena, both dentists from a small town near the Ukrainian-Romanian border, encountered the ominous signs of the impending Russian invasion and made the life-altering decision to leave.

""We packed our bags and crossed the border just as the war began,"" recalls Oleksandr. ""It was surreal, like we were in a parallel reality, not knowing who or where we were.""

Their destination was Vienna, where they had relatives. ""An Austrian woman provided an apartment for two months, free of charge. It was an incredible act of kindness,"" says Oleksandr, 30, who speaks German.

The couple applied for official status and submitted their medical certificates in the hope of being able to work, but ""we could not officially rent housing because you need to show the last three payslips and pay a deposit"" - something they did not have.

While still undocumented, the couple found work off the books in an Austrian winery. The work was tough, says Oleksandr, ""but we felt capable of doing more.""

Now they have their work papers, and are employed in an orthodontic clinic in Vienna. ""We're in a multicultural team, working with those whose parents also fled war zones like Chechnya, Afghanistan and Kosovo,"" he says.

Despite relative stability, their lives in Austria remain uncertain. Their papers are only valid for three years and they do not yet know if they will be allowed to stay on when their permission to remain expires.

""We're in limbo,"" Oleksandr says. ""And psychologically, we're torn. We worry about our friends and family back home.""

For a long time Oleksandr experienced guilt over those left behind. ""Three of my friends volunteered for the army. One died, one has already returned. The third is still fighting. Our friends didn't understand our decision to leave.

""They might condemn me but I don't want to fight,"" he says. ""Maybe after the war we will all reconcile.""

Paris, France

In a Parisian cafe, Snizhana, a young artist, reminisces about her journey to France, one that began in the war-torn Luhansk region in 2014. "" I lived in many cities across Ukraine after the war in Donbas. I busked - reading poems in the park, collecting money in my hat.

""Then I studied performing arts and I found myself in a theatre in Kyiv. I never looked back. Theatre is my life.""

Paris became Snizhana's unexpected refuge last year. ""I didn't want to leave Ukraine. I arrived in Paris with just â‚¬25. I was on the brink of poverty. Buying cherries for the first time in a year made me cry,"" she says.

Snizhana started working as a nanny to make ends meet, saving nearly everything she earned during the first year in Paris. ""I lived on social benefits of â‚¬400 a month, barely enough to afford daily coffee,"" she says.

In her free time, she reprised her street performances and began participating in festivals. She wrote a script about the Holodomor (a man-made famine that killed millions of Ukrainians in 1932-33), the Soviet occupation of Ukraine and the current war. She used her savings to stage it.

""Forty per cent of the audience were French,"" she says. ""The fact that they understood the message was incredibly valuable. Their tears during the performance gave me strength.""

Now Snizhana attends acting and language courses, trying to grasp the essence and nuances of French drama.

Recently, she began teaching performing arts to children. ""It doesn't bring me much money, but I love the work,"" Snizhana says.

Her future plans are to bring Ukrainian classics to the Parisian stage. ""My goal is clear: to portray Ukraine abroad. I want people to understand the difference between Ukrainian and Russian culture,"" she says.

Porto, Portugal

At the beginning of 2022, Anna believed her future was deeply rooted in her passion project, a Ukrainian brands firm near Kyiv, where she had spent six years as the executive director.

""It was a labour of love, not just work,"" Anna remembers. ""A team that felt like family.""

When Anna, 40, and her family relocated to Portugal after the invasion, they initially planned for a short stay until the situation in Ukraine stabilised. They did not think that it would turn out the way it has. When Anna's income source in Ukraine came to a halt, she began waiting tables in Porto and then became a teacher.

She opened a children's centre in Portugal because ""many families like ours were arriving, and there was no place for their children"", she explains. Initially, the centre operated on a voluntary basis but quickly transitioned into a commercial project due to overwhelming demand.

""We built a strong team, developed an educational programme, and created a great Ukrainian community in Porto,"" Anna says.

Despite its success, the centre eventually closed as more families who chose to remain in Portugal decided to integrate and send their children to Portuguese schools.

Now Anna runs a Kyiv-style brunch cafe in Porto with another Ukrainian family. ""Portugal has welcomed us. The bureaucracy works slowly, but it works and that's reassuring,"" Anna says.

Looking ahead, she would like to expand her cafe franchise, and improve her Portuguese. ""I like the country, its culture, and its people,"" she says. ""It fuels my energy. When you're in a place that feels like home, it's a solid foundation to build something new.""

478,"MS Swaminathan, ""˜visionary' father of India's green revolution, dies at 98","https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/oct/05/ms-swaminathan-obituary","MS Swaminathan, ""˜visionary' father of India's green revolution, dies at 98

Pioneering plant geneticist and agronomist whose work revolutionised farming and brought self-sufficiency in food production to India

The year was 2005. There had been a wave of farmer suicides in the Indian state of Maharashtra. The mainstream press paid scant attention, but MS Swaminathan rushed to the scene with a team of officials. ""He was in tears listening to the families of those who had ended their own lives,"" says journalist P Sainath in a tribute.

This image of the renowned scientist - well into his golden years - championing distressed farmers is one that epitomises MS Swaminathan's life's work.

Swaminathan, who has died at 98, is renowned as the father of the green revolution in India, for his introduction of high-yielding genetic varieties of rice and wheat. His work alongside American agronomist Norman Borlaug led to the doubling of wheat yields in Pakistan and India in the late 1960s.

Mankombu Sambasivan Swaminathan was born in 1925, in Chennai, then known as Madras. He was only 18 when he witnessed the devastating effects of the Bengal famine, which led to the deaths of about 3 million people. The experience spurred him into a career in the agricultural sciences.

After earning degrees from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Wageningen Agricultural University's institute of genetics, and the University of Cambridge, he turned down a faculty position at the University of Wisconsin. He chose instead to return to India with his wife, Mina, who he met at Cambridge (Mina died in 2022). The couple had three daughters, all of whom went on to become established figures in the academia and global development: Nitya Rao is professor of gender and development at the University of East Anglia; Madhura Swaminathan is professor at the economic analysis unit at the Indian Statistical Institute; and Soumya Swaminathan is the former chief scientist at the World Health Organization.

On returning to India, Swaminathan collaborated with Borlaug in crossing Japanese and Mexican dwarf varieties of wheat, which led to the high-yield, disease-free crop strains that revolutionised world agriculture. Borlaug won the Nobel peace prize for his work, and he credited Swaminathan for first recognising the potential value in the successful crop varieties.

Because of Swaminathan's efforts, India went from being drought-stricken and dependent on US imports in the 1960s to being declared self-sufficient in food production in 1971. He was awarded the first World Food prize in 1987 for his work.

He then turned his energies towards supporting India's beleaguered farmers. As head of the National Commission on Farmers, he produced several reports which recommended minimum support prices for crops, suggestions for faster and more inclusive growth, and a holistic national policy addressing farmer suicides.

In a statement to the Guardian, fellow green revolution stalwart Gurdev Khush noted that Swaminathan also played a crucial role in building India's relationship with international organisations such as the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Bank. ""He was a visionary and an inspiring leader,"" says Khush, who worked with Swaminathan during his term as the first Asian director general of the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines.

Several figures have remembered his gentle disposition. Ronnie Coffman, emeritus professor at Cornell and Borlaug's PhD student, looks back fondly on Swaminathan's tenure as honorary professor at Cornell. ""What I remember most about him was his kindness and consideration toward every person he met,"" says Coffman.

The World Food Prize Foundation chief operating officer Mashal Husain echoes his sentiments: ""His keen insight into the many different food and agricultural issues was rivalled only by his warm encouragement and mentoring of young students.""

However, Swaminathan was not without his critics. As a consequence of the green revolution, the agricultural industry witnessed a widespread increase in the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides. He subsequently concentrated his efforts on an ""evergreen"" revolution, which he defined as ""improvement of productivity in perpetuity without ecological harm"".

To address the issue, Swaminathan used the proceeds from the World Food prize to start the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation. The foundation aims to accelerate the goals of the evergreen revolution, taking a ""pro-poor, pro-women and pro-nature"" approach. He would go on to donate the winnings of future awards to the foundation as well.

Swaminathan was garlanded in international and national circles. In addition to the World Food prize, he was conferred awards by the Netherlands, the Philippines, France, Cambodia and China. He was also highly decorated within his country, having received India's second, third and fourth highest civilian awards. Many feel that also he deserved the Bharat Ratna (India's highest honour). ""He was above feeling any resentment over this,"" says the former diplomat Gopalkrishna Gandhi. ""But his conspicuous absence from that scroll of honour in his home country which owes so much to him, impoverishes that list for sure.""

Indian scientist Ashok K Singh reflected on Swaminathan's legacy in a statement to the press. ""An era of agricultural research, education and extension filled with disruptive innovation comes to an end,"" says Singh, who is director at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (Swaminathan himself was a director in the 1960s).

Singh summed up Swaminathan's work by saying: ""If God appears to the poor and hungry in the form of bread, as Mahatma Gandhi said, then that God is Dr Swaminathan, who should be revered by every citizen while partaking in their daily meals.""

Denis Sharonov is part of a historic exodus as hundreds of thousands of Russians seek to escape Vladimir Putin's war

The former minister drove his big white truck north until he reached Michigan. The Great Lakes provided a welcome relief from the scorching Texas heat.

After years navigating the byzantine corridors of provincial Russian power, Denis Sharonov now works as a truck driver, steering his way through the vast highways of the US.

""It is heavenly up here in Michigan. Texas was too hot,"" said Sharonov, a former agriculture minister of the Komi Republic in northern Russia, in an interview.

Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine has set off a historic exodus of his own people. Since the start of the invasion, hundreds of thousands of Russians are believed to have left the country, driven by their opposition to the war and the fear of being sent to the frontlines. Many have scrambled to find jobs in exile and plot out new lives from their laptops.

But few career changes are as unusual as that made by Sharonov, who fled Russia in September 2022 after receiving his draft papers.

""A lot of people don't understand my choice. They mock me. They say I downshifted, from a regional minister to truck driver,"" Sharonov said.

""But I don't see it that way at all. I am proud of what I do,"" he added.

Sharonov's Instagram, once filled with images of him in a suit and tie meeting officials and local farmers in Komi, now resembles one of a travel blogger on a roadtrip across the country.

In 2020, he became the minister of agriculture of Komi, a landlocked region in the north of Russia almost the size of California. He had no previous experience in government but said he had been offered the job after more than a decade in the agriculture industry.

""I was curious to see how government works,"" he said, but he quickly grew disillusioned by what he described as ""rampant corruption and bureaucracy"" that plagued his ministry.

""In Russia, the main reason people get into politics is to steal money. Corruption has ripped my country apart. Either you participate in it or you get tossed out,"" Sharonov said.

He claimed he eventually fell out of favour with the regional head, Vladimir Uyba, after Sharonov refused to enter into corrupt land schemes and was dismissed in January 2022.

The month after his firing, Russian troops invaded Ukraine, a decision that left him feeling ""deeply disturbed"".

""I realised that by staying in the country, I would be participating in this illegal war one way or another,"" he said.

The final straw came when he received a draft order to join the war during Russia's mobilisation campaign last autumn.

""When military enlistment officers came to deliver a draft summons to my registration address, there was nothing left for me to do but leave the country,"" he said.

Sharonov, who at 48 was too old to be mobilised according to Russian law, linked the draft notice to his ""drawn-out conflict"" with Uyba, who he claimed had tried to get rid of him by sending him to Ukraine.

Unwilling to fight in Putin's war, he chose to flee the country. Having studied in Vermont during an exchange in 1995, he decided to try his luck in the US.

After a long journey with stops in Kyrgyzstan and Dubai, Sharonov eventually landed in Mexico, where he crossed the US border on foot and applied for asylum.

The US has recorded a massive spike in Russian emigration since the start of the war, with more than 8,600 Russians seeking refuge at the US border with Mexico over the last six months - 35 times the 249 who did so during the same period before the war.

While awaiting the result of his asylum application, Sharonov started to look for ways to earn an income. ""Working as a truck driver seemed like the most straightforward way to make a living,"" he said.

Pointing to the weak rouble, which hit a 16-month low this week, he said that the money he made driving a truck was not very far off from the salary of a regional minister in Russia, although he quickly added that most officials found other means to make money.

""But it's not really about the salary. It's about feeling free. It is an honest job,"" Sharonov said.

In six months as a truck driver, he said, he had visited 45 US states, describing in detail the beauty of California's west coast. ""Sometimes it feels like one big adventure, discovering the country on the road.""

He hopes to use his experience to find employment in the agricultural sector.

Sharonov is one of the few former Russian officials who have spoken out against the war. Shortly after the full-blown invasion, Anatoly Chubais, a veteran reformer and former Kremlin climate envoy, quietly resigned. Chubais remains the highest-ranking official to leave the Kremlin since the start of the war.

""Many officials are against the war but are gripped by fear,"" said Sharonov. ""They get up every morning and convince themselves that they have no other choice.""

No such thoughts bother Sharonov, for whom the open road awaits again. His next stop - Alabama.

Despite a new relief fund in Sonoma county, farm workers face economic catastrophe when storms and fires strike

As a series of deadly storms whipped through California's wine country, liquefying fields and turning vineyards into wading pools, thousands of farm workers in the region were forced to stay home. Though the power has been long since restored and roads reopened - many of them are still confronting an economic catastrophe.

For Isidro Rodriguez, the storms caused him to lose half his monthly income - about $1,100.

For nearly two weeks, it was too wet and windy to safely prune the pinot noir vines at the estate vineyard where he worked. Even still, he risked the roads to drive over there during lulls in the storms, just in case. ""The storms were ugly,"" he said. ""And still, we had to find a way to survive.""

The 43-year-old single father had to drain his savings to make rent, managing to feed his two kids with provisions from the food bank. He had to tell his 12-year-old son, who'd just joined the school basketball team, that they could no longer afford the shoes for him.

""It's sad sometimes because my kids really understand,"" he said. ""For us farm workers, disasters will strike.""

In recent years, Rodriguez, 43, has been called off work periodically - due to extreme heat waves in the summer and wildfires in the fall, and storms in the winter. Now, for the first time ever, he might be getting some compensation.

A new initiative in Sonoma county is offering low-income residents disaster relief funds for lost wages as well as property damage due to the storm. About 1,100 people have applied for the funds, county officials said. The majority of them farm workers, who will receive a one-time payment of between $250 and $800 this month.

The pilot program was unprecedented, and hard won by Rodriguez and other vineyard workers, who have been fiercely advocating for something like it for years. But especially as the climate crisis brings more intense storms, fires and heatwaves - workers say it's far from enough.

Some state and federal programs cover property damage caused by natural disasters, but there are no support programs for labourers whose ability to work is at the whims of nature. Moreover, more than half of California's farm workers are undocumented, as are 6% of all California workers, according to research from the UC Merced Community and Labor Center. Many of these workers don't qualify for state or federal emergency assistance programs.

And yet, California farm workers grow and harvest nearly half of the country's fruits, vegetables and nuts. The 6m tons of grapes they harvest each year create $45.6bn worth of wine yearly.

""We need the whole country to realise how important we are,"" said Anayeli Guzman, an agricultural worker and advocate with North Bay Jobs With Justice. ""And then help us fight.""

Just north of the San Francisco Bay, Sonoma county is known internationally for its viticulture. More than 60 grape varietals grow here, across a range of microclimates. In recent years, the region has also become notorious for its precarious weather.

In 2017, the Russian River - which runs through Sonoma - had breached, submerging vineyards and causing millions of dollars in damage. Later that year, the Tubbs fire seared through the region, killing 22 people and destroying 5,600 homes.

""That year kicked off what felt like an era of climate catastrophe,"" said Lynda Hopkins, a Sonoma county supervisor. ""We've vacillated between fire and floods ever since.""

Last year, Hopkins proposed a $2m ""community disaster immediate needs fund"", modeled in part after the ""UndocuFund"" created by local nonprofit groups to help immigrant and undocumented Sonoma residents in the aftermath of the 2017 fires. In January, the county made the funds available for the first time - initially setting aside $300,000, then $600,000 and later $1m as demand swelled. Hopkins said she had expected the money would mostly help those who had lost their groceries due to power outages, or had sustained property damage.

""It actually ended up mostly being people who were out of work and horribly distressed about the possibility of not being able to pay their rent,"" she said.

MarÃ­a Reyes and her family had already been struggling by the time the storms hit in early January. A deep frost last winter followed by months of drought and extreme heat wrecked the vines - resulting in the second smallest crop of wine grapes in decades.

For Reyes and two of her adult children, who also work in vineyards, that has meant less work - and less pay. Amidst the storms, she drove to the field a few times - at her supervisor's behest - only to find that the rain had picked up too much and everyone was being sent back home. ""And there was all the money we spent on gas, wasted,"" she said. Not to mention the $50 she had to spend on boots to work in the rain.

Local food banks were running low on provisions. When her younger kids returned from school, hungry, she had nothing to offer. Normally, she'd pick up extra work housekeeping or gardening - but amidst power outages and road closures, few employers were hiring. The local job centre was swamped.

Reyes, 56, and her 18-year-old daughter - who also works in vineyards - both applied for the county's immediate needs fund. They had to drive up to a relief centre, twice, and wait for hours in line. And they are still waiting to hear how much money they might receive.

""I worked the fields when the sky was red and dark with fires,"" she said. ""When it seemed like the world was ending."" During last summer's heart wave, she nearly blacked out while driving home after a shift. And now this.

As a longtime labour organiser and advocate with North Bay Jobs With Justice, Reyes has been advocating for larger, more systemic changes at vineyards - including extra hazard pay for hours worked in dangerous weather, disaster insurance and multilingual safety training - including in the Indigenous languages that many workers from Mexico speak.

As global heating increases the changes of megafloods as well as megafires and droughts in California, however, ""we are absolutely not prepared,"" said Michael MÃ©ndez is an Assistant Professor of Environmental Planning and Policy at the University of California, Irvine. ""Farmworkers are continually being displaced and harmed during disasters and extreme weather events.""

Amidst escalating climate chaos, some local and state lawmakers are beginning to listen. Last week, Colorado became the first state to authorize an unemployment assistance fund for undocumented workers.

In California, some lawmakers have been pushing a similar program. Earlier this year, a group of Los Angeles lawmakers introduced a bill to create an ""excluded workers program"" that would pay undocumented, unemployed workers $300 per week for each week of unemployment, up to 20 weeks.

The program would essentially expand what Sonoma county has done - and could help prevent the most economically precarious families in California from falling into financial ruin. But its chances of becoming law are unclear. Last year, California's governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a similar bill to provide unemployment benefits for undocumented workers. He also axed a $20m pilot program to provide $1,000 monthly cash payments for farm workers affected by the drought due to budget constraints, he said.

So far, the closest thing California has had to unemployment insurance for undocumented and workers, was a 2020 pandemic relief programs that provided one-time payments of up to $1,000.

""So Sonoma county's program is pretty unique in this state,"" said MÃ©ndez. ""It's a recognition that these workers are essential to the county.""

The county, meanwhile, is discussing how to distribute funds more quickly - and effectively - in the future, officials said.

In the weeks after the storms subsided, the region returned to its bucolic norm. Rows and rows of gangly vines swoop across hillsides and along placid creeks. ""It's all gone back to normal,"" Rodriguez said. He hopes to build up his savings again, before fire season hits. ""There is a lot of uncertainty.""

This article was corrected on 13 March 2023 to say that 6% of all California workers are undocumented, and not 6% of California farm workers, as previously stated.

Environmental and health experts say UK grows or imports two and a half times the population's recommended intake

Ministers should cap domestic sugar production to tackle Britain's obesity crisis, according to a new report backed by health experts and environmental campaigners.

The UK grows and imports more than two and a half times the population's maximum recommended intake of sugar, according to Sugar Pollution, a report by environmental campaigners Feedback Global and Action on Sugar, a group of specialists in medicine, nutrition and public health.

That oversupply creates incentives for food manufacturers to use more in their products and for British farmers to grow sugar beet rather than fruit or vegetables, the report argues.

The campaigners have called for a quota that would eventually cut sugar production in the UK by half, introduce tariffs on imports of sugar cane and refined sugar, and subsidise farmers to grow more fruit and vegetable crops.

They also say that sugar producers should be treated according to the ""polluter pays"" principle, similar to rules on product packaging. This would require sugar producers and manufacturers to pay the hidden health and environmental costs of sugar to society.

Jessica Sinclair Taylor, head of policy at Feedback Global and one of the report's authors, said: ""The underlying message of this report is that to tackle consumption and to tackle the problems caused by production, the current level of supply is just far, far in excess of what we need. We have lots of policy about the need to help people eat less, but nothing that focuses on the way that supply might drive and contribute to demand.""

Hattie Burt, senior policy and international projects officer at Action on Sugar, and another author of the report, said public health policies such as the sugar reduction programme from 2015 to 2020, which challenged the food industry to reduce sugar in everyday foods, had actually seen a 7.1% increase in tonnes of sugar sold.

""[Health policies] are never going to be enough, because you've got these trade and agricultural land-use policies which are trying to increase the amount of sugar. When you take a step back, part of the reason there is so much sugar in their products is because it's highly available and relatively cheap.""

By 2022, 63.8% of adults in England were estimated to be overweight or obese, according to the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities, with 25.9% classified as obese. Frontier Economics estimates that obesity costs the UK about £58bn each year in disease, shorter lifespan and lost productivity.

Although obesity is caused by a range of factors, the prevalence of high-calorie foods that are high in salt, sugar and fat are part of the problem, and processed foods not perceived to be sweet can contain surprising amounts of sugar.

According to the Sugar Pollution report, the UK imports or grows 1.91m tonnes of sugar a year, but if the whole population ate the maximum recommended amount, it would be just 0.72m tonnes.

Just over half of the UK's sugar supply is grown domestically by 2,300 farmers, mostly in the east of England and the east Midlands, and processed by British Sugar. The rest is imported - raw sugar cane, mostly from Brazil, or refined sugar or confectionery.

The amount of land used in the UK for sugar beet is about 100,000 hectares, almost as much as for the entire vegetable crop of 107,000 hectares.

""Farmers like beet because it's a convenient crop for them,"" said Sinclair Taylor. Other horticultural crops were bought by supermarkets, so ""the price can fluctuate a lot over the year. With beet, there is a negotiated price set by the NFU and British Sugar. It's also part of their rotation, so they also grow things like wheat and rapeseed. So farmers are making perfectly rational decisions - it's just that the incentives are barmy.""

The report also highlights the environmental effects of beet growing. When beets are dug, topsoil sticks to the roots, which causes the loss of 464,000 tonnes of topsoil a year, the report says.

And for the last three years, ministers have approved the use of neonicotinoid seed treatments to prevent aphids spreading viruses that harm beets. Neonicotinoids have been banned in the EU and the UK because the chemicals are harmful to bees and humans, but the government allows derogations from the rules.

A spokesperson for British Sugar said it was ""proud to be at the heart of the British beet sugar industry"".

""Sugar beet is an important part of our growers' arable rotation, acting as a break crop and thereby improving biodiversity and returning organic material from sugar beet tops to the soil after the crop is harvested. Farmers do not receive any subsidies for growing sugar beet.

""Obesity continues to be a major public health issue in the UK, and one that we at British Sugar take extremely seriously. We remain fully committed to informing and educating people about sugar and the role it can play, as part of a healthy, balanced diet through our Making Sense of Sugar programme.""

Discovery of ""˜anti-cannibalism' pheromone raises possibility of spraying crops with similar chemical as non-toxic insecticide

Locusts are voracious eaters with appetites that extend to members of their own species. Now scientists have discovered an ""anti-cannibalism"" pheromone used by the insects to protect themselves in dense swarms, which could pave the way for novel pest control strategies.

Scientists said the discovery raises a host of possibilities, including spraying crops with something similar to the protective pheromone as a non-toxic insecticide, or finding a way to reduce its impact among locusts and make them turn on each other more.

""You could get the locusts to behave more cannibalistically and potentially control themselves in that way,"" said Bill Hansson, the director of the Department of Evolutionary Neuroethology at the Max Planck Institute and senior author of the research.

Cannibalism is widespread in nature. ""Humans invented ethical rules that stop us from being cannibals, but this is not the general rule in nature. For other species, meat is meat,"" said Hansson. ""A fox will eat a dead fox, a rat will definitely eat another rat, a mouse will eat another mouse.""

He added: ""For locusts, people think they are living from grass and greenery, but they also will very clearly eat each other.""

Migratory locusts exist for most of their lives in a ""solitary phase""; living individually, staying in one area and shying away from other insects. However, when the population density in an area increases beyond a certain threshold, locusts transform within hours into their ""gregarious phase""; changing colour, becoming very active, aggressive and voracious eaters, and ultimately forming collective, highly destructive swarms that consume everything in their path - including, sometimes, each other.

Scientists have previously shown that cannibalism plays a crucial role in swarm formation because as individuals try to eat those in front of them, while avoiding behind eaten by those approaching from behind, the swarm begins to move as one.

The latest work, published in Science, shows that locusts also release a pheromone called phenylacetonitrile (PAN), which keeps cannibalism in check, potentially allowing the swarm to become larger and sustain itself for longer. In a series of experiments, the researchers found that as the number of locusts living in a cage increased, they began releasing more of the chemical.

When the scientists used Crispr genome editing to create locusts unable to produce the PAN enzyme, these insects were more likely to be eaten. And locusts engineered to lack the ability to smell the pheromone were more likely to eat fellow insects.

In one experiment, two locusts - one normal, one that had been engineered not to produce the pheromone - were released into a cage of 50 hungry locusts. ""The poor guy that wasn't smelling was just devoured,"" said Hansson.

Prof Iain Couzin, of the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behaviour, in Germany, who was not involved in the latest study, said the findings were important because locust plagues are estimated, via their impact on crops, to affect the livelihood of one in 10 people on the planet.

Couzin said: ""Discovering a chemical signal that inhibits this, as in this work, therefore offers a means to control swarm movements. Insecticides tend to also target those species that are beneficial to humans, like pollinators. This discovery may allow the future development of control agents that target molecular pathways specific to plague locusts.""

Scientists will attempt to create fruit without the parts that are normally discarded like the core of an apple or orange pith

In the face of growing food security concerns due to climate change, scientists in New Zealand are attempting to grow fruit tissue in labs.

While work on lab-grown meat has made headlines in recent years, similar work on fruit is less common. Scientists at Plant & Food Research in the southern city of Christchurch are aiming to change that by growing fruit tissue from plant cells that they hope will one day taste, smell and feel like real fruit. Researchers hope that the program will help safeguard the country's food security.

""Here in New Zealand, we're good at growing conventional horticultural crops,"" said Dr Ben Schon, the lead scientist for the Food by Design program at the government-backed Plant & Food Research, ""but looking into the future, there's a lot of change coming in the world with population growth, increasing urbanisation and climate change.""

The program aims to grow fruit tissue without the parts that are usually discarded like the core of the apple or the rind of an orange. Providing consumers with only the tissue of fruit will help reduce food waste, said Schon.

Lab-grown foods could play a pivotal role in sustainable agriculture but are still in very early stages of development, according to Dr Ali Rashidinejad, a senior food scientist at Massey University in Palmerston North who is not involved in the program.

Since lab-grown food is a completely new concept, once it is developed, it will then have to prove its safety to regulatory bodies likely through expensive and long clinical trials. ""Overcoming such hurdles can take years if not decades,"" Rashidinejad said.

Consumers will also need to accept the practice; older generations might prove to be hesitant but research shows that younger generations are willing to try new foods if those foods offer health benefits while limiting environmental impact, said Rashidinejad.

The Plant & Food Research program, which started 18 months ago, focuses on cells from blueberries, apples, cherries, feijoas, peaches, nectarines and grapes, but they warn that the end goal of harvesting something that is nutritional and enjoyable to eat is some years away and might not be attainable at all.

The technology would probably be suitable for growing fruit tissue within cities, said Dr Sam Baldwin, a strategy leader at Plant & Food Research, in the hope that it would reduce the cost and carbon emissions created when transporting food into urban centres.

However, it's unclear how the carbon footprint of such lab-grown fruit would compare to those grown using traditional methods, which may have to be transported long distances if imported.

The technology could also offset the food lost in weather events. Earlier this year, Cyclone Gabrielle, decimated parts of Hawkes Bay, an area known as New Zealand's fruit bowl. The cyclone came as many kiwifruit growers were preparing to harvest their crops.

""I'm not sure we realise that we are going to need to produce more food for a bigger population but with less areas to grow and under increasing pressure from a non-conducive climate,"" said Baldwin.

""Business as usual might not be able to address that need.""

The pilot program that ran in 2013 was cancelled by then agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce and the results never released

A pilot program to monitor pesticides in Australian fruit and vegetables was halted by the Abbott government despite it revealing residues up to 90 times the permitted maximum levels in strawberries.

The research also found levels of pesticides in some peach and apricot samples were ""unacceptable from an acute or short-term dietary risk perspective"", meaning eating affected fruit could pose a health risk.

The results of the aborted pilot project by the Department of Agriculture in 2013 were obtained through a freedom of information request.

The previous Labor government had agreed with the states to set up the program, but after the 2013 election the then Nationals' leader and agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce, canned it and withdrew the $25m funding.

The government cited budgetary pressures and the results of the pilot were not released.

Unlike the US, Canada, New Zealand and Europe, there is no regular monitoring of agricultural chemicals in most food sold domestically in Australia.

Meat and some fruit for export such as apples, pears and macadamias, are tested under the national residues survey, run by the department.

But the only monitoring of pesticide residues in fruit sold domestically is by FreshTest, run by the industry body Fresh Markets Australia, which involves growers providing samples once a year.

The pilot studied hundreds of samples of peaches, apricots and strawberries bought at fruit and vegetable markets around Australia.

The documents revealed one sample of strawberries recorded nearly 90 times the maximum residue limit (MRL) for dimethoate, which at the time was set at 0.02mg/kg. Another strawberry sample contained 37 times the maximum residue limit of the same chemical.

A spokesperson for the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA), which approves the use of pesticides and sets MRLs, said residue monitoring was not within its statutory remit.

In August 2011 the APVMA suspended the use of dimethoate on many food products, including fruiting strawberries, but after the monitoring program results, the department found some growers had continued to use it.

Dimethoate can now be used only on very limited crops, including strawberry runner production, but not on berries.

Health authorities have now revised down the acceptable daily intake of dimethoate from 0.02mg/kg to 0.001mg/kg and set an acute reference dose of 0.02mg/kg. The sample that was 90 times over the limit contained 0.76mg/kg.

Large doses of dimethoate can cause acute poisoning, and smaller doses may also be of concern. The US Environmental Protection Agency has classified dimethoate as a possible human carcinogen and the EU banned it in 2019 amid concerns about its impact on reproductive function.

Of the 100 strawberry samples in the pilot, 14 had residues that exceeded the MRL.

""There were 22 different chemicals detected in the samples, and seven different chemicals detected where concentrations exceeded the APVMA's MRL,"" the documents said. ""The majority of chemicals detected (18) were registered for use in strawberries.

""The chemical most frequently detected in non-compliant samples was dimethoate, which was found in seven samples.""

The department then tested 300 samples each of apricots and peaches.

""One apricot and nine peach samples contained residues of fenthion above the MRL that were ""˜unacceptable from an acute or short term dietary risk perspective',"" the report said.

Fenthion is an organophosphorus insecticide used for field and post harvest treatments of fruits and vegetables.

By September 2012, the APVMA had published a health advisory for a number of uses of fenthion, including on stone fruit, saying: ""The APVMA cannot be satisfied that these uses of fenthion would not be an undue hazard to the safety of people using anything containing its residues, and they must be deleted.""

After the completion of a review of fenthion in October 2014, all horticultural uses were withdrawn except for tropical fruit with inedible peels, which has now ceased.

The chief executive of pesticide industry advocacy group Croplife Australia, Matthew Cossey, said MRLs were an early warning system.

""They have massive safety buffers built into them, typically being set dozens or hundreds of times lower than the allowable daily intake, which in turn are set a minimum of 100 times lower than any level which has been shown to have any effect in long-term exposure trials,"" Cossey said.

""While a one-off breach does not pose any immediate safety issue it should be investigated and addressed immediately to ensure the safety of produce in the short, medium and long term.""

The documents reveal that Joyce was lobbied by the National Farmers' Federation (NFF) against the scheme, whereas his department said the program would provide ""valuable feedback"" on state and territory approaches to control of chemical residues.

The NFF said farmers would end up bearing the cost after the initial five years of government funding.

""While the NFF agrees it is often important to monitor agricultural produce, the value of this program is still not clear from an industry perspective,"" it said.

""The NFF has had concerns expressed from members regarding poor program design, lack of integration with existing initiatives (including industry driven assurance schemes) and also from the perspective of yet another cost that is likely to be passed on to industry without prior consultation.""

A spokesman for Joyce restated the reasons publicly provided in 2015, that the Commonwealth had no power to enforce compliance with the domestic use of agricultural chemicals.

""This responsibility lies with the states and territories"", the spokesman said.

At the time, the Department of Agriculture had advised that studies had been made based on limited sampling and that the methodology used was in its pilot stage, the spokesman added.

Joyce killed it off with a handwritten note: ""This is being closed.""

The scheme was scrapped in the 2014-15 budget. Instead, $8m was redirected to improving farmers' access to agricultural chemicals.

A more recent independent review of pesticides regulation has now recommended a national monitoring scheme.

Cossey said Australia had a world-leading, modern and sophisticated regulatory system for pesticides and their use, that ensured the safety of agricultural produce for domestic consumers and export markets.

He said Croplife had never been provided with the results of the pilot, but officials indicated that overall it confirmed very high compliance by farmers with MRLs.

The findings were also provided to grower groups for the specific fruits.

""Afterwards CropLife advocated to the federal government that resources should be prioritised and targeted to ensure improvements to the regulatory system to address MRL breaches, including a nationally harmonised pesticide control of use regime,"" Cossey said, adding that the department failed to take up their proposal.

The NFF noted the results were nearly a decade old and that much had changed, including chemicals like fenthion being withdrawn from use.

Surveys by the Victorian agriculture department between 2015 and 2021 found 7.3% of 1,502 samples had unacceptable residue levels.

The acting chief executive of the NFF, Charlie Thomas, said: ""It is important to Australian farmers they provide safe, high quality produce and the appropriate use of production chemicals is something they take very seriously.""

""Australia has a world-class regulatory system for the safe and effective use of agvet chemicals, administered by the commonwealth regulator and state and territory bodies,"" he said.

""The NFF supports the use of systems that keep chemical residues within reasonable and approved levels to underpin consumer confidence in our world-class produce.""

489,"Global craze for collagen linked to Brazilian deforestation","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/06/collagen-linked-brazilian-deforestation","Global craze for collagen linked to Brazilian deforestation

Investigation finds cases of the wellness product, hailed for its anti-ageing benefits, being derived from cattle raised on farms damaging tropical forest

Tens of thousands of cattle raised on farms that are damaging tropical forests in Brazil are being used to produce collagen - the active ingredient in health supplements at the centre of a global wellness craze.

The links between beef and soya and deforestation in Brazil are well known, but little attention has been given to the booming collagen industry, worth an estimated $4bn (£3.32bn).

Collagen can be extracted from fish, pigs and cattle. Its most evangelical users claim the protein can improve hair, skin, nails and joints, slowing the ageing process. As well as beauty and wellness brands, it is also used by pharmaceutical companies and those producing food ingredients.

However, an investigation by the Guardian, Bureau of Investigative Journalism, Center for Climate Crime Analysis (CCCA), ITV and O Joio e O Trigo in Brazil has found cattle raised on farms causing deforestation were processed at abattoirs serving international collagen supply chains.

Some of this collagen can be traced to NestlÃ©-owned Vital Proteins, a leading producer of bovine collagen supplements. Vital Proteins' collagen range is sold globally, including in the US and UK.

Jennifer Aniston, the actor and chief creative officer of Vital Proteins, has called collagen ""the glue that holds everything together"". She claims to have been using it for years, adding it to her morning coffee.

While there are studies suggesting taking collagen orally can improve joint and skin health, Harvard School of Public Health cautions potential conflicts of interest exist as most if not all of the research is either funded by the industry or carried out by scientists affiliated with it.

Collagen companies have no obligation to track its environmental impacts. Unlike beef, soya, palm oil and other food commodities, collagen is also not covered by forthcoming due diligence legislation in the EU and UK designed to tackle deforestation.

NestlÃ© said that the allegations raised are not in line with its commitment to responsible sourcing and that it has contacted its supplier to investigate. It added that it is taking steps to ""ensure its products are deforestation-free by 2025"".

Bovine collagen is described as a byproduct of the cattle industry, which in Brazil accounts for 80% of all Amazon forest loss.

But ""byproduct"" is a misleading term, according to campaigners. Non-meat products, of which leather and collagen are the most valuable, account for just under half a slaughtered cow's weight and can generate up to 20% of meatpackers' incomes, according to the USDA.

Demand for beef, leather and collagen has seen more and more forest has been cleared and replaced by pasture in recent years, with land often seized illegally.

Most livestock-driven deforestation can be attributed to companies' indirect suppliers, according to Ricardo Negrini, a federal prosecutor in Brazil's ParÃ¡ state who monitors beef processors' climate commitments.

Cattle are often moved from farm to farm for different stages of rearing, so a cow born on deforested land may be fattened for slaughter at a ""clean"" finishing ranch. But Negrini said that, today, all meat companies have the capacity to track the origins of the cattle they buy.

Republic claims turnout for its anti-monarchy protest shows 'republicanism on the rise'

Republic claims that more than 500 people turned up to support its anti-monarchy protest today. (See 12.45pm.) Its CEO, Graham Smith, said:

Our parliament is opened by a king wearing a crown while sitting in the Lords. It is just weird we continue with this pantomime that celebrates the worst, least democratic aspects of our political system.

As Republic continues to enjoy unprecedented growth, our continued programme of protests are showcasing a democratic alternative, a future where we can instead elect our head of state.

Our message today is that this campaign is about more than the monarch, it's about the place of the crown in parliament and the ramshackle state of our constitution.

The growth of our movement shows that Britain is no longer receptive to the status quo - republicanism is on the rise.

The TUC has described the king's speech as ""cheap electioneering"". This is from its general secretary, Paul Nowak.

This is a desperate last throw of the dice from the Conservatives.

There is nothing in today's king's speech to fix the country's problems - just cheap electioneering.

Ministers have turned their back on working people.

Having promised numerous times to bring forward an employment bill to tackle insecure work, the Tories have junked this promise and are now attacking people's fundamental right to strike.

Instead of fixing our crumbling public services the government is trying to blame paramedics, teachers and other key workers for their failures.

The RSPCA has welcomed the news that the speech included an animal welfare (livestock exports) bill that will ban the export of live animals for slaughter. This will compensate for the kept animals bill being dropped earlier this year.

David Bowles, head of public affairs at the RSPCA, said:

This is a historic day for animal welfare. After half a century of campaigning to see an end of live exports, we're incredibly pleased that the UK government has prioritised this - albeit as the only animal welfare issue taken forward in their programme.

The king was booed by a sizeable crowd of protesters from Republic, the anti-monarchy campaign, on his way to and from parliament. It's not the start of a revolution, but it's notable. It didn't happen to his mother.

Steve Brine, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons health committee, has also criticised the omission of a bill to reform the Mental Health Act. (See 12.32pm.) While he welcomed the plans for a tobacco and vapes bill (see 11.41am), he also said:

It is disappointing that the government has failed to bring forward legislation to overhaul the Mental Health Act. The draft bill, among its planned reforms, would outlaw the inappropriate detention of people with learning disabilities and autism. Without change, too many people will continue to be held in secure units, often for years at a time. These reforms are long overdue.

Campaigners criticise omission of long-promised bill to reform Mental Health Act from king's speech

In the queen's speech in May last year the government promised draft legislation to reform the Mental Health Act. The government did publish a draft mental health bill more than a year ago, but that draft bill has not been followed up with the promise of legislation in this session of parliament.

Commenting on the omission, Mark Winstanley, the chief executive of the Rethink Mental Illness charity, said:

Today's king's speech was the last opportunity for this government to honour its commitment to reform the Mental Health Act. The failure to introduce a mental health bill is a profound betrayal to people that have been detained under the Mental Health Act and everyone who has campaigned for decades to reform it. It is difficult not to conclude that the march of progress to prioritise the nation's mental health and challenge the stigma of mental illness has stalled. What makes this decision even harder to swallow is that reform had been mapped out and agreed in draft legislation and has cross-party support.

The Mental Health Act is a crucial piece of legislation that keeps people safe when they are unwell and in crisis. In doing so, it removes rights that many of us take for granted - detaining people, often against their will, and stripping away choices over treatment. Now 40 years old, the legislation has failed to keep pace with the world we live in, and the need to protect people while respecting their wishes and dignity. The act in its current form also exacerbates racial injustice, seeing a disproportionate number of black men detained under its powers.

And this is from Tim Nicholls, head of influencing and research at the National Autistic Society.

The government has ignored the thousands of us calling for reform, so our mental health laws are fit for the 21st century. We do not understand why it is not worth parliamentary time to change the law so that autism can no longer be a reason to section someone. The king's speech was a vital opportunity for the government to commit to reforming the outdated Mental Health Act, and address the ongoing crisis of autistic people being stuck in mental health hospitals. The government has failed to keep its promises.

There are 2,045 autistic people and people with learning disabilities in mental health hospitals in England - and 65% are autistic people. Hospitals are often miles away from families and the average length of stay is more than five years. We hear alarming reports of people being overmedicated, pinned down and shut away in isolation in these settings, often with devastating consequences.

Reforming the Mental Health Act needed to be a key step towards ending this crisis. We urgently need significant, long-term funding for community mental health and social care services, so that autistic people can get the support they need in the first place and don't need to reach crisis point and end up locked away in hospitals.

The king's speech ran to 1,223 words, making it the longest monarch's speech at a state opening of parliament since 2005, PA Media reports.

Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, has dismissed the king's speech as ""cheap gimmicks and reheated policies"". He said:

The country is crying out for change and hope for a brighter future. Instead all Rishi Sunak had to offer was cheap gimmicks and reheated policies.

There was nothing but empty words on the biggest issues facing the country, from the NHS crisis to the sewage scandal.

There were no real solutions for patients left waiting months in pain for treatment, homeowners seeing their mortgages skyrocket or communities seeing their local rivers ruined by sewage.

It shows the Conservative government is out of touch, out of ideas and deserves to be kicked out of office.

Farmed seafood overtook wild caught fish for the first time in 2021-2022. ""˜It can be extremely profitable,' researcher says

Thirty years ago, Colin Valverde and his wife, Ursula, traded in city life for a chance to do something they felt was more meaningful.

They took on fish farming, eventually settling in the Atherton Tablelands of far-north Queensland where they now hatch, breed and grow redclaw crayfish.

Since then, Valverde, now president of the North Queensland Red Claw Farmers Association, has seen the industry grow from small-scale farms to a commercially viable and competitive alternative to traditional wild-catch fishing.

""I have always been a believer in ""˜if we want to eat it, we have to farm it',"" he said from his crayfish farm in Atherton, about 80km south-west of Cairns.


""With the amount of the population that we've got now [wild fishing] is unsustainable. I think we will very quickly deplete any species that we stop farming.""

According to a recent report by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (Abares), Aquaculture has become Australia's most valuable seafood industry, overtaking wild caught fish for the first time in 2021-2022 in terms of gross value of production (GVP) and hitting a peak value of over $2bn.

The report found that the sector's GVP increased 9% in 2021 and now accounts for 56% of the total value of the seafood industry.

""The demand for freshwater crayfish is insatiable,"" Valverde said. ""And the prices are really good. We just have the problem of - as farmers - figuring out how to produce enough of them.

""If you can grow them, you can sell them.""

Dr Kelly Condon, researcher at James Cook University and aquaculture expert, said the industry was growing thanks to large-scale investment and improvements in its resilience and efficiency.

""Aquaculture production is really efficient,"" she said. ""The big costs are in labour and electricity. But if you get to the economy of scale on the farm it can be extremely profitable with a much higher production for unit area.

""You can easily get 10,000kg of stock out of one hectare with a lot more consistent product.""

In 2020-21, the production volume on fish farms grew 24% while wild-catch fish increased by just 0.3%. Farmed fish now makes up 43% of all fish produced in Australia.

Condon said the comparative advantages of aquaculture became clearer during the pandemic and weather patterns have become more volatile, making it harder to predict wild catch rates.

""Aquaculture, particularly in response to Covid, has been a little more resilient,"" she said. ""We can grow a lot of animals with less people in our aquaculture systems, and because a lot of the aquaculture facilities tend to be located regionally, they were a lot less impacted by lockdowns and sickness.""

Aquacultural production is also less reliant on oil than deep-sea fishing boats, which Condon said has been an advantage in this time of global fuel price instability. But she said this came with a ""trade-off"" as fish farms were more affected by electricity prices.

Valverde said fish farms were less market exposed than wild-caught fish because they had greater control on the supply side.

""We're in the fortunate position that if we can't sell today, we can just leave them in the ponds, they just keep getting bigger and worth more and we can sell them later and always get our money back,"" he said.

He added that labour shortages were a bigger concern.

""What holds us back is not having enough farmers to produce,"" he said. ""We desperately need more farmers producing to increase supply, but we do have a lot of new people getting into it, because the prices are so good.""

The Abares agricultural forecast states that aquaculture will continue to grow and will account for 64% of total seafood GVP by 2027-28, despite a decline in real value in 2022-23 as pandemic price spikes stabilise.

However despite that strong growth prediction, the report said that future of the industry was still unsure as demand for many products, such as red rock lobster, were highly dependent on income growth and increased consumer spending domestically and abroad.

Villagers who have kept pre-Hispanic milpa methods alive for years are seeing new markets spring up in the YucatÃ¡n

Teresa de JesÃºs Cen Requena is washing burgundy okra and a rainbow of freshly dug carrots at Mestiza de Indias, a regenerative agricultural project hidden down a dirt track in the jungle near the Maya village of Espita. ""You used to be able to live from your milpa,"" the farm worker says, referring to the traditional smallholding. ""But now many people from the village go to CancÃºn because they want modern luxuries.

""You can't buy a mobile phone with a bag of beans but I don't care - I am connected to this land.""

At first glance, life appears largely unchanged over the centuries in this village on Mexico's YucatÃ¡n peninsula. Women wearing huipiles (embroidered tunics) steam tamales (stuffed maize dough) over open fires in houses thatched with palm, chickens investigate the dust under a canopy of fruit trees, and men melt into the jungle with guns slung over their shoulders to hunt deer.

Teresa de JesÃºs Cen Requena, who works at the Mestiza de Indias regenerative farm, stands outside her home with her mother-in-law in their huipiles

However, instead of the traditional maize, their milpas (farms organised on a pre-Hispanic land system) are more likely to be sprouting a new crop: smouldering mounds of plastic. With the community no longer self-sufficient, those left in Espita have to rely on processed goods from the local supermarkets, and with no rubbish collection in this remote area of the Maya Forest - the second largest in Latin America - packaging, including the plastic, is often burned.

The exodus of people looking for work in the ever-expanding tourist resorts along the Riviera Maya has put milpa farm production under severe strain, and experts fear this could intensify when a new and controversial Maya train launches in December, doubling the number of tourists expected to visit the peninsula.

""It will prove very damaging when it comes to preserving the milpa tradition in the mid and long term,"" says Dr Javier Orlando Mijangos CortÃ©s, senior researcher at the Yucatan Scientific Research Center.

For the past eight years, however, Mestiza de Indias has been encouraging local people to reconnect with their land and milpa roots while also learning new agricultural methods.

The farm combines ancestral knowledge such as the ""Three Sisters"" companion planting method - beans act as a natural fertiliser, squash maintains soil humidity and keeps other plants low so the corn can absorb maximum light - with regenerative techniques designed to combat increasingly severe weather conditions.

Saturnino Vech Pech, 20, harvests some Rampicante heirloom squash at the farm. The project preserves Indigenous farming traditions and native crops, while also aiming to combat the harmful effects of Mexico's agrochemical industry

The farm's 220 hectares (540 acres), 80% of which remains jungle, supplies restaurants and hotels with speciality fruits, vegetables and herbs. ""One of our main missions is to raise awareness about these ingredients among top chefs while giving local people access to organic produce,"" says Gonzalo Samaranch Granados, a Spaniard who co-owns the farm with his wife, Martha Elena Chan Tuz, a Maya woman who was born in Espita.

""At the moment, many restaurants on the Riviera Maya use ingredients that have been flown from industrial farms in Puebla [900 miles away] because they can't access locally grown produce - and often don't know how to cook it anyway.""

Mestiza de Indias employs between six and 15 people, depending on the season, and they each receive a weekly box of fresh produce as part of their wages. Women are paid the same as men and the project covers medical bills for the team and their families.

As well as crop rotation, the milpa tradition is based on ""graze, slash and burn"", which sees farmers routinely setting fire to part of their land to remove weeds before planting new seeds. Although this has been practised for generations, the food demands of a rising population often mean that leaving land fallow for extended periods is no longer an option.

""Although fire is part of the natural cycle, scientists have concerns about this process because when you burn soil you kill the microbes in it, and this is happening more and more frequently. As a result, many farmers have to turn to chemical pesticides to deal with pests, which poses a huge environmental risk,"" says Rafael Mier, founder of FundaciÃ³n Tortilla, an agricultural organisation that promotes knowledge about the environmental and cultural significance of corn in Mexico.

At Mestiza de Indias, the team favours environmentally friendly techniques to improve soil quality. Ash acts as a natural fertiliser, plants are allowed to go to seed and then replanted for next season so they are naturally more adapted to the harsh conditions, and Samaranch favours bokashi composting, which sees yeast and biochar break down organic matter in as little as 15 days.

With water becoming increasingly precious on the YucatÃ¡n peninsula, Samaranch has studied the Aztec system of chinampa, in which fertile raised beds were built on the lakes to cultivate food crops, and an ancient technique used to improve water retention, in which layers of charcoal are placed underneath the crops to act like a sponge.

Another of the project's goals is to protect plants that are on the verge of disappearing; Samaranch has spent years hunting for particularly rare plants in back yards and milpas. This has radically changed the prospects of one local resident, Aurelio Batun Nahuat. At 68, his lifelong passion for growing sweet potato - 120 varieties at the last count - has finally found commercial success.

""Nobody was really interested in buying them until I met Gonzalo. Now he guarantees a certain amount of income and encourages me to plant even more unusual varieties,"" he says, uncovering the purple insides of a particularly rare root with his machete.

Mier says: ""Aside from their cultural and historical significance, native varieties are able to adapt to changing weather conditions because they have genetic diversity. Hybrid and GM crops have very narrow genetic information, which means if something affects one plant, it affects them all. A maize pandemic that could threaten food security on a global scale is a very real possibility.""

Mestiza de Indias is just one of numerous projects aiming to preserve the YucatÃ¡n peninsula's biodiversity, as well as the agricultural heritage of its Indigenous peoples, who live in greater density here than anywhere else in Mexico.

MaÃ­z Criollo Kantunil, a group of farmers and agro-ecologists, has successfully reintroduced three varieties of native maize using seeds supplied by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT). Aldea X-batun in Valladolid's Zaciabil neighbourhood offers tourists the chance to cook alongside the Cen Canche family using produce grown from their milpa, while the menu at Merida's Ramiro Cocina highlights native varieties on the brink of disappearing.

Back at Mestiza de Indias, farm worker MarÃ­a Alba de la Flor Pec has no doubt that working on the regenerative farm has become part of her way of life. ""I love living off the land and now I'm learning to take care of the environment too. I often apply what I learn here to my own back yard,"" she says.

""˜Price tag' of non-communicable diseases, malnutrition, poverty and harm to planet is 10% of global GDP, says UN food agency

The health and environmental damage caused by food production costs the world $10tn (£8tn) a year, or 10% of global GDP, the UN said.

Conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, the consequence of poor diets, account for $7.3tn, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which has put a ""price tag"" on the hidden costs of the global food industry in its annual report, published on Monday.

""In the last [few] years people have realised planetary boundaries have been put under pressure and, in many cases, crossed,"" said David Laborde, director of the FAO agrifood economics division.

""While food is central to our life, it also has significant impact on the environment and health,"" he said. ""Assigning them a value is one way to quantify these different impacts.""

But he added: ""We should not just enter this debate with a high-income lens. In the global north, the public discourse has long included discussion of ecosystems and unhealthy diets, but the cost of poverty and malnourishment is overlooked.""

The report said current food systems increased poverty in low-income countries. Many farmers in poorer countries did not fully benefit from the value of their produce, as they often sold on their crops to traders and manufacturers, who made the profit, it said. This left farmers unable to afford nutritious diets.

""In Uganda, for example, the hidden cost of agricultural system is 20% of GDP; 70% of that is linked to poverty,"" said Laborde.

The FAO director said he expected the financial burden to rise in the coming years as countries became wealthier and ultra-processed food, sugar and fats made up a bigger part of diets.

""Twenty years ago, hunger and malnutrition was still common in many of today's middle-income countries,"" Laborde said. ""Today we know that if you did not have enough to eat when you were growing up, you become more prone to diet-related diseases as an adult.""

A 2020 British Medical Journal study found that experiencing severe malnutrition or famine as a child raised the risk in later life of cardiovascular disease, impaired glucose metabolism and metabolic syndrome (a cluster of medical conditions - such as obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar - that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes).

Laborde called this combination of overnutrition (obesity) and undernutrition (stunting) ""a double burden of malnutrition"", adding: ""High-income countries do not have problems like these.

""So in fact unhealthy diets can become even more problematic for middle-income countries than they are in high-income countries,"" he said.

""If we want middle-income countries to not follow the trajectory of other wealthy economies, they have to tackle the issue of healthy diet front and centre, and concentrate on prevention. Because once someone develops diabetes, they cannot revert back.""

These non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have traditionally been considered a problem specific to the global north, while public health policies in the global south have concentrated on preventing infectious diseases, such as HIV. But today 74% of deaths worldwide are caused by NCDs and 77% of these happen in low- and middle-income countries.

Liz Arnanz, from NCD Alliance, a global organisation fighting these diseases, said: ""Unhealthy products have industries behind them.

""Growing economies are seen as new markets for these industries; often they are attracted by lack of regulation or lack of capacity to enforce the regulation. At the moment we can, for example, see the alcohol industry targeting African countries very aggressively.""

But many middle-income countries are proactively responding to the growing threat of unhealthy foods and products. In Latin America, NCDs account for 70-85% of deaths, but the region had become a global leader on implementing preventative policies, Arnanz said.

""Just this week, Colombia has started implementing taxation not only on sugary drinks but also junk food,"" she added. Noting that this was a more robust stance than that of many wealthy countries, Arnanz said the availability of healthy and nutritious food was not a matter of personal choice but political policy.

Laborde said that reducing the health and environmental costs of food production did not have a universal solution.

""We can't just increase the price of food and hope that the market will solve the problems,"" he said. ""For example, if we simply increase the price of steak to reflect some of the hidden costs associated with its production, it will not be the rich people who reduce their meat consumption.

""The solutions are more multifaceted; in some cases it's education, in others, school feeding programmes. We can do a lot, but not if we oversimplify.""

The FAO plans to outline solutions to improve global health next year.

A Cambridgeshire farm has produced a record crop of the tropical fruit this year, despite the ""˜challenging' British climate

Originally hailing from southern Africa, watermelons and their distinctive green rind and red flesh are traditionally associated with palm trees and tropical climates rather than the British countryside.

However, this year's washout summer has not prevented one UK farm from growing its biggest ever crop of the exotic fruit, in what marks a new domestic production record.

Oakley Farms in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, estimates it has doubled last year's harvest by producing 11,000 watermelons this summer, despite the UK experiencing its sixth wettest July on record.

Nick Molesworth, the farm's manager, admitted that the fruit is ""not that easy to grow"", adding that the British climate ""can also be challenging"". The bumper crop, housed in polytunnels, has come after several years of trialling different growing methods to obtain more fruits from each plant.

Oakley Farms, which also cultivates other cucurbits including pumpkins and courgettes, ventured into watermelons after being approached by Britain's largest grocer, Tesco, seven years ago. ""It made good sense as the crop would fit in perfectly between production of courgettes in late spring and pumpkins in early autumn,"" said Molesworth.

James Cackett, a fruit technical manager for Tesco, has worked for the past 15 years with seed houses and British growers on developing varieties of watermelon that are more suitable for the UK climate and soil.

It remains a ""small and developing industry with just a handful of producers scattered around the UK"", Cackett said. ""When we first started selling them, in very small quantity, about 10 years ago shoppers were curious whether such an exotic-looking fruit could ever be grown over here.

""But they are now very popular with shoppers wanting to support British growers and each year demand gets stronger so it doesn't take long for the entire crop to sell out.""

The homegrown fruit - sold in a standard and mini size - have a sticker to identify them as British-grown. Tesco is pricing the crop at £3.49 each for the standard size and £2.50 for the mini size.

This year has seen a ""particular trend for smaller watermelons"", according to Waitrose. A spokesperson for the grocer said: ""As the summer weather has improved, searches for ""˜mini watermelons' on our website and app have risen 88% this month compared with last.""

Continued rainy weather in July and August has dampened consumers' taste for tropical treats in recent weeks, particularly when compared with last year's hot summer.

Despite this, the market for watermelons, and tropical fruits more widely, has been growing apace over the past five years, according to figures from market research firm Kantar.

Sales of watermelons over the past year were worth £56m, more than 11% higher than in 2019.

British supermarkets sold £618m worth of all tropical fruits in the year to 6 August - an increase of nearly 8% compared with the same period five years earlier.

While Oakley Farms sees watermelons as ""a natural evolution"" of its business, an industry body representing British growers does not believe that many others will follow suit at a time when food producers are under financial pressure.

Jack Ward, the chief executive of the British Growers Association, which represents the vast majority of domestic fruit and vegetable producers and horticulture businesses, said: ""Growers are coming off a period where costs were high and returns haven't kept face with inflation, so many don't want to take on more risk.

""Labour is getting more and more difficult, and you have got be confident that if you are going to plant a crop, especially for one retailer, that it will be the right specification.""

For now the UK remains dependent on imports. Large quantities of the fruit are produced in China and Turkey, as well as in US states including Florida and California, and countries farther south such as Mexico and Guatemala.

Cavendish made to resist fungus threatening variety worldwide is seen as safety net for growers if industry wiped out

Scientists have submitted Australia's first genetically modified fruit - a Cavendish banana - to regulators for approval, saying it has been engineered to withstand a deadly fungus that poses a threat to banana growers worldwide.

The banana, known as QCAV-4, has been genetically modified to resist a fungus known as Panama disease tropical race 4 (TR4), which is threatening the multibillion-dollar Cavendish industry globally.

If approved, the banana would become Australia's first GM fruit to be approved for cultivation and consumption, as well as the first GM banana to be approved worldwide.

Prof James Dale of the Queensland University of Technology, who led QCAV-4's development, said the GM variety offered a safety net for growers in the event that the Australian industry was wiped out by TR4.

The research team is not planning on immediately releasing the banana for commercial production or consumption if approved.

There are between 300 and 1,000 varieties of banana globally, Dale estimates, but the Cavendish banana accounts for about half of commercial growing worldwide. ""It has some disease resistance, it's high yielding, it tastes pretty good and it travels well,"" Dale said.

Cavendish bananas increased in popularity after an outbreak of Panama disease - the strain TR1 - wiped out plantations of the Gros Michel banana, which until the 1950s was the main commercial variety internationally.

In the 1990s a related fungus that affects Cavendish bananas, Panama TR4, was discovered in south-east Asia. It has has since spread to China, India and major banana-growing countries.

""Eighty-five per cent of the world's export bananas come from south and central America, and the other 15% come from the Philippines,"" Dale said. ""The Philippines is already dramatically affected by TR4.

""Once it got to Colombia, and then Peru and now Venezuela, that's when the big exporters suddenly realised that this is really very serious.""

In Australia Panama TR4 was first discovered in the Northern Territory, where it was gradually wiping out the industry, said Leon Collins, chair of the Australian Banana Growers' Council.

""On the east coast, we only have it in the Tully River valley at the moment. We've confined it to that so far because of good biosecurity, and also the big effort that the growers have made.""

The fungus ""attacks the root of the plant and kills it slowly"", Collins said. ""It virtually dehydrates the plant and it wilts.""

Collins described the genetically modified QCAV-4 as ""another string in the bow ""¦ that we can use. One day [we] may not have an industry here growing with normal bananas.""

QCAV-4, the result of 20 years' work, was developed by taking a resistance gene from a wild banana that is immune to TR4 and inserting it into the Cavendish.

Using six transgenic varieties of the banana, Dale and his colleagues began field trials south-east of Darwin in 2012, with good results.

""We did a much, much bigger field trial that we planted in 2018, and that's still going,"" Dale said. One variety, now called QCAV-4, showed a 2% infection rate after four years, compared with 95% and 75% infection rates in two lots of regular Cavendish plants.

""If the disease gets going [in Australia] like it has in the Philippines ""¦ we've got this banana in the back pocket and we'll be able to pull it out.""

Cavendish bananas, including the QCAV-4, are incapable of sexual reproduction - every plant propagated is an identical clone. This means that ""the genes aren't going to flow to any other plant"", Dale said.

A spokesperson for the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator said: ""This is a significant step, but it is the first in a series of steps.

""The gene technology regulator will carefully examine any risks to people and the environment posed by the commercial cultivation of the GM banana plants.

""The regulator will only issue a licence authorising the cultivation of the GM banana if satisfied that any risks can be effectively managed.""

The spokesperson said two rounds of stakeholder consultation would be required, with public consultation expected to occur in August.

Food Standards Australia New Zealand is assessing the banana's suitability for commercial sale and consumption. Its chief executive, Dr Sandra Cuthbert, said: ""Consumers can have trust and confidence in FSANZ's independent scientific assessment. We develop world-leading standards and our experts have a strong track record of assessing the safety of novel foods.

""We will invite public submissions on any proposed changes to the Australia New Zealand food standards code resulting from our assessment of this application.""

523,"Brazil launches biggest operation against illegal cattle farms in indigenous Amazon","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/05/brazil-launches-biggest-operation-illegal-cattle-farms-amazon","Brazil launches biggest operation against illegal cattle farms in indigenous Amazon

Taskforce deployed to remove thousands of cows owned by land grabbers from indigenous territory

The Brazilian government has launched its biggest ever operation to remove thousands of cows owned by illegal land grabbers from Indigenous territory in the Amazon rainforest.

Three helicopters, a dozen vehicles and a heavily armed corps of police and environment rangers are carrying out the cattle drive, which criminal gangs attempted to block by setting fires on the route, destroying bridges and intimidating drivers.

Operation Eraha Tapiro (""Ox Removal"" in the language of the Assurini Indigenous people) aims to restore state control over the Ituna-ItatÃ¡ Indigenous Territory, which suffered some of the worst deforestation and invasions in the Amazon during the previous presidency of the nationalist Jair Bolsonaro.

Since a change of power at the start of this year, the leftwing president, Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, has promised to curb environmental crime, halt the expansion of the agricultural frontier and aim for zero deforestation by 2030. The environment minister, Marina Silva, has launched a series of operations to drive illegal miners and ranchers out of Indigenous territory and other public lands that are under the protection of the state.

The operation commander, Givanildo Lima, who is an agent for the government's main environmental protection agency, Ibama, said this was a politically symbolic operation on the frontline of environmental crime in the Amazonian state of ParÃ¡.

""The deforestation of Ituna-ItatÃ¡ was planned and executed by a gang that had great political power. Making this operation successful demonstrates our ability to fight crime in the Amazon, which is increasingly organised,"" he said

A coalition of federal agencies were involved, including Ibama, federal police, traffic police, the Indigenous affairs agency and the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation.

A government study in 2011 took a step to formally demarcate the Ituna-ItatÃ¡ Indigenous Territory, an area of 142,000 hectares, approximately the size of Greater London, that was the home of an isolated community, the IgarapÃ© IpiaÃ§ava. Once this process begins, the state prohibits non-Indigenous people from entering the area.

To defy this and weaken the application, local land grabbers - known as grileiros - started invading the area, burning the forest and filling the land with cows. This accelerated so much during the Bolsonaro presidency that Ituna-ItatÃ¡ was the most deforested Indigenous area in the entire Amazon in 2019.

Ibama officials said the Rocha farm, where the operation began, is owned by a man named Danilo JosÃ© Barros Rocha, who has houses in MarabÃ¡ and Altamira, the two largest cities in the region. According to AdeparÃ¡ records, Rocha owns only 70 animals.

However, inspectors found 400 cattle in the area of 800 hectares (330 hectares of which are deforested) that he illegally took over and registered in the Rural Environmental Registry. He was told his claim was illegal and ordered to remove the cattle last year. As he failed to comply, his herd will be removed and he will be fined 500,000 Brazilian real (£80,000). Similar penalties are being applied to other land grabbers in the area, whose lucrative illegal farms cover vast expanses of the Indigenous territory.

As soon as the Ibama operation started last week, word rapidly spread on grileiro WhatsApp groups in the village of Vila MocotÃ³, part of Coronel JosÃ© PorfÃ­rio municipality.

The village, which is just 18 miles (30km) from Ituna-ItatÃ¡, is a handful of streets of bare earth with a few dozen houses, most of them very simple and built in wood. These are the homes of the people who look after the cattle on behalf of wealthy land grabbers, who control local politics and have strong influence in the national congress.

Among their most avid supporters is senator Zequinha Marinho, who is a Bolsonaro ally and a pastor of the evangelical church Assembly of God, who sent a letter last year to the government describing environmental agents in the Ituna-ItatÃ¡ area as ""bandits and scoundrels"" and denying there were any isolated Indigenous peoples in the area despite evidence to the contrary from anthropologists, settlers and other Indigenous groups.

In a statement to the Guardian, his office reasserted that Ituna-ItatÃ¡ was not an Indigenous land and said: ""Senator Zequinha Marinho defends and will continue to defend the rights of farming families who have lived for decades in the area known as Ituna-ItatÃ¡ and adjacent areas.""

The operation commander said the confiscation of the cattle would weaken the land grabbers' economic power, which would, in turn, deplete their political influence. ""The main cause of deforestation in this region has always been cattle. So, just apprehending the herds, causing financial loss to the invaders, can solve the problem,"" Lima said.

However, compliance is weak, and many land grabbers go unpunished if they ignore environmental fines.

As the operation's convoy of cars and trucks drove past, residents of Vila MocotÃ³ gathered in doorways to stare at the federal agents who threatened their livelihoods. There was no armed resistance, but they attempted other ways to impede the removal of the herds.

Fires were started at several points alongside the route to scare the cows. One wooden bridge was destroyed by arson. Another was cut into pieces with chainsaws. Most of the drivers of the cattle trucks were scared off.

The federal agents rebuilt the bridges and managed to ensure the first cows were transported at midnight across the Xingu River for slaughter in Altamira. Their meat will be donated to social programmes.

Ibama estimates it will take weeks for the remaining 5,000 cows to be taken from the Indigenous land.

The headline of this article was amended on 11 September 2023 to clarify that the operation is the biggest to remove cattle from Indigenous land in the Amazon, rather than the biggest ever such operation in the Amazon as an earlier version suggested

528,"What can be done to combat air pollution in Europe?","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/21/what-can-be-done-to-combat-air-pollution-in-europe","What can be done to combat air pollution in Europe?

From wood burning to driving, there are things people can do - but industries such as shipping and agriculture bear most of the responsibility

While air pollution is largely invisible to us in our daily lives, the health impacts of breathing tiny PM2.5 particles is increasingly well known. So what can we do about it?

A study from the Barcelona research institute ISGlobal connects health impacts to their sources in more than 800 cities across Europe, and identifies priorities for action. Some sources are obvious, but many have been overlooked for years.

For Europe as a whole, the main source of air pollution is home heating. This is followed by agriculture, industry, transport and shipping, but priorities vary from place to place. For north-west Europe, agriculture is dominant. Transport pollution is the biggest source in the cities of central and north-west Europe, along with northern Italy. Farther east, home heating, energy generation and agriculture are priorities for action.

Here, we explore each of the five sources, which need structural solutions, as well as what you as an individual can do.

1. Home heatingBurning solid fuel is the most polluting way to heat homes. The health cost of air pollution from home heating across Europe is estimated at â‚¬29bn a year in 2018.

The availability of fossil gas from the 1970s meant that many homes in western Europe turned away from solid fuel heating, leading to large improvements in air quality. For the last two decades, this trend is being reversed with the rising popularity of wood stoves as an aesthetic and second source of heating.

In eastern Europe, home heating with coal remains popular. In Italy, the impacts come mainly from wood burning. Studies across Ireland highlight severe particle pollution from wood, coal and peat burning in both small rural towns as well as big cities.

Dr Jurgita Ovadnevaite, from the University of Galway, said: ""Solid fuel burning results in extreme air pollution events, spanning most populated areas in Ireland, with levels frequently exceeding the World Health Organization recommendations for health. The obvious solution would be to ban solid fuel burning completely. To make this feasible, houses should be properly insulated for electricity to become a viable alternative.""

2. AgricultureThe main source of PM2.5 from agriculture is ammonia emitted from fertiliser and animal waste. This pollutes our rivers as well as our air.

Dr Anna Font of the research institute IMT Nord Europe said: ""Agricultural represents about 94% of all ammonia emissions in Europe. Ammonia emitted as a gas will rapidly transform into ammonium particles by combining with sulphate and nitrate. These represent roughly 20% to 40% of total PM2.5 in the air.""

""From satellite data we can see hotspots of ammonia in north-western Europe (including the Netherlands, Belgium, and north-west Germany), Brittany, the Po Valley in northern Italy and the Ebro valley in north-east Spain.""

If farmers reduced ammonia emissions they would need to buy less fertiliser to put nitrogen into their soils.

Prof Mark Sutton, from the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, explained: ""Most ammonia emissions come from livestock excreta and fertilisers.

""With high fertiliser prices in 2022, total UK nitrogen losses were worth around £3bn. This is around the same as the total UK agricultural subsidy. Covering manure stores and incorporating manure and fertiliser in the soil can reduce these emissions by 90%. Reducing ammonia emissions avoids this massive waste of resources and is good for air quality at the same time.""

3. Industry and power generation

In the 1970s, forest die-back from acid rain was a powerful visual image of the impacts of air pollution. Today, large industries across the developed world are subject to inspection and control but they still add to our air pollution.

Examples of sudden health improvements following the closure of polluting industrial sites demonstrate the burden that industry can still create, and therefore the opportunities for better technological solutions.

In 2016, the closure of a coal processing plant near Pittsburgh, US, was followed by an immediate 42% decrease in emergency room visits for heart problems in the local community, and further improvements in the years that followed.

Prof George Thurston, of New York University Grossman School of Medicine, who studied the impacts of the coal processing plant, said: ""We need to focus our clean air efforts on eliminating the most health damaging particles - those emitted by fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes. Documented health effects include increased cardiovascular deaths, hospital admissions and emergency room visits, as well as an increased risk of asthma attacks among children.""

4. Traffic

Vehicles bought in Europe today contain engine management systems, filters and catalysts to clean their exhausts but all vehicles, even electric ones, still produce particle pollution from the wear of brakes, tyres and road surfaces. These are not subject to regulation and there are no mass-market engineering solutions.

Dr Will Hicks, of Imperial College London, said: ""Drivers can help by driving smoothly. This could be encouraged through traffic calming measures (30kph speed limits should help), media campaigns and driver awareness courses.""

Long-term solutions lie in the design of our towns and cities.

Prof Mark Nieuwenhuijsen, of the Barcelona research institute ISGlobal, said: ""Too often we focus on technological solutions. Land use and behavioural changes such as the Barcelona Superblocks, Paris's 15-minute city or London's low-traffic neighbourhoods also reduce air pollution and bring additional benefits such as increased walking and cycling, which is good for health.""

5. ShippingThe seas around Europe are home to some of the world's busiest shipping lanes. New rules have led to better quality marine fuel and the use of scrubbing systems, but shipping remains a major source of particle pollution. In the UK, breathing PM2.5 from shipping is estimated to result in a health cost of about £1.5bn at 2017 prices. The air pollution from shipping reaches hundreds of kilometres inland but it is especially intense in coastal areas and ports.

Dr Matthew Loxham, of the University of Southampton, said: ""Where shoreside power is not used, ships tend to keep auxiliary engines running to satisfy their power. The largest cruise ships require more than 10MW of power at berth (5,000-10,000 times greater than average household requirements), and therefore it is unsurprising that there is some impact on local air quality.""

Loxham added: ""In the future we may see a move towards to alternative fuels, such as liquefied natural gas, hydrogen, methanol and ammonia, or ships being powered by battery (electric) or nuclear energy. Each of these comes with environmental, health, life-cycle, and safety considerations of their own.""

What can I do?There are clearly actions that we can take in our everyday lives to reduce particle pollution. Not heating our homes with solid fuels, if we have that option, is an obvious one. Not driving is another but sometimes our city design leaves us with few other choices.

We can reduce our exposure. Studies in London have shown that walking down a back road instead of a main street can reduce your exposure to PM2.5 from traffic exhaust by more than 30%.

However, it is widely recognised in the climate debate that focusing on individual actions can divert responsibility from the sectors that are really responsible for the problem. Similarly, tweaks to everyday life will not improve particle pollution from farming, shipping and industry, for example. These require action by governments and industries.

An initiative to repopulate depleted waters is teaching villagers sustainable agriculture, providing jobs and improving diets

For years, Eric Ndagijimana's father, Barthazard, poached fish from Gishanda Lake in eastern Rwanda to feed his family. The subsistence farmer struggled to make ends meet and used to catch fish illegally from the lakes of nearby Akagera national park until a government crackdown on poaching in 2010 pushed him and others to Gishanda.

The unchecked plundering depleted the lake's stocks of tilapia. Soon there were no fish left to either eat or sell.

Now Ndagijimana is on a mission to reverse the damage. He manages Gishanda Fish Farm, which is based on the banks of the lake to cultivate tilapia and restock the waters.

In April, the first fingerlings (young fish) raised in the farm were released into the water. More than 100,000 have been released so far and the ambition is to produce 1.5 million fingerlings each year.

""My father was a fisher who poached for money, which paid for my school fees. I wanted to carry on his legacy but in a way that is legal, professional and would benefit the community as a whole,"" says Ndagijimana, as he sprinkles granules of fish food into one of 16 tanks in the farm's main building.

The farm opened in October with funding and support from the conservation organisation African Parks; FoodTechAfrica, a public-private partnership of 21 companies and universities; and the Dutch government.

Ndagijimana wants the farm to produce about 30 tonnes of tilapia annually, of which at least 10% will be sold to the 600 households who live around the lake at half the market price - 1,500 Rwandan francs (£1.13) for a kilo, instead of 3,000. It is hoped the move will not only deter illegal fishing but improve nutrition for the villagers.

""It is exciting for me to work as a fish farm manager where I was born. When my father congratulates me, seeing how our community is changing positively with my intervention, I am motivated further,"" says Ndagijimana, who studied aquaculture at the University of Rwanda and spent a year in Israel researching sustainable agriculture.

He always had ambitions to return home to work. After graduation in 2016, he managed five fish ponds near the capital, Kigali, receiving additional training from the Rwanda Agriculture Board, ""to fully prepare myself for the challenges of managing a fish farm before heading home"".

The farm, which is powered by solar panels and requires a tenth of the water of traditional fish farming by using a recycling and filtration system, is also providing jobs and extra amenities. Two villages now have electricity - and there are plans to connect more - and one school has a borehole. People will be offered training in breeding catfish at three demo ponds, and in growing organic vegetables at the farm.

""With the free training for Gishanda community members in sustainable fishing, they have started to consider themselves guardians of the lake,"" says Eline Nyirandajimana, who is the farm's hatchery manager.

The rehabilitation of Lake Gishanda has resulted in the first sightings of otters, which have not been seen in the area before.

Leah Dufitumukiza, a single mother of a three-year-old, has a job cleaning the fish tanks and assisting the farm managers, and says she is no longer dependent on her parents. ""Before the fish farm, I could never imagine the life I am living today,"" she says.

Eventually, Ndagijimana would like the villagers to manage the farm, and they are working with district officials to identify other suitable lakes in the area that could be rehabilitated.

""We are here to make things happen at the farm and the progress is good,"" he says. ""With the success ""¦ the reward of our efforts will be given back to the community.""

Exclusive: Study finds pests could damage crops and households would incur costs for pesticides, veterinary bills and electrical faults

Failing to stop the spread of an outbreak of invasive fire ants in south-east Queensland could cost the Australian economy more than $1bn a year, including damage to high-value crops, infrastructure and homes.

A previously unreleased cost-benefit analysis, commissioned by a steering committee managing the outbreak of red fire ants and obtained by Guardian Australia, says eradication of the species provides ""much higher returns"" than suppression measures that simply limit its spread.

The study says the spread of the ants, which were first detected in Brisbane in 2001, would cause ""cascading negative impacts on future generations"".

Australian governments have a $400m eradication program but, despite the investment, red fire ants continue to spread. Finds on the Gold Coast have raised concerns the pests are moving quickly towards New South Wales.

""Fire ants are just a few kilometres from the NSW border and, when they break out, they can quickly spread everywhere in Australia,"" said Reece Pianta from the Invasive Species Council.

The report, by economists at Central Queensland University, modelled the economic impacts of the spread of fire ants if their invasion progressed at 5km a year, and a ""maximum"" spread of 48km a year.

In the first scenario, the pests will have reached high-value farmland in the Darling Downs by 2035. In the worst case, fire ants reach the Liverpool plains and the northern outskirts of Sydney in the same time period.

By 2035 the annual cost to the economy in the 5km invasion scenario was about $890m, increasing significantly year on year. Under the 48km scenario, the costs would be about $1.2bn a year.

The biggest cost would be to households, including the cost of pesticides, veterinary bills and electrical faults.

""There are much higher returns available from eradication options compared to suppression options, largely because suppression would still lead to large impacts by [2035], especially on households and agriculture,"" the report said.

Pianta said the report supported calls for more investment in eradication measures. ""The cost of action on fire ants is far cheaper than the cost of living with fire ants,"" he said.

""Fire ant damage predicted in the report is becoming a reality in southern Queensland. Fire ants are closing playing fields, garden centres and parks, impacting cane fields, schools, housing construction and natural habitat.

""If we do not urgently step up eradication efforts, we face the fire ant future being experienced in the United States where fire ants cost $7bn per year in damage and control.""

According to the Queensland government, fire ants may have arrived in Australia - possibly via shipping containers from the Americas - decades before they were detected.

Changing habitats and behaviours lead to interactions with a negative outcome for wildlife and humans

From blue whales colliding with ships to African elephants raiding crops in villages, the climate crisis is causing a rise in conflicts that lead to injury or death for humans and wildlife, new research shows.

The climate crisis is making food, water and healthy habitats harder to come by, forcing animals and human populations into new ranges or previously uninhabited places. It is also changing the way they behave. This means a rise in human-wildlife conflicts, as well as damage to personal property and loss of livelihoods for people, according to a review paper led by the University of Washington.

The team looked at 30 years of research and found that the number of studies linking climate breakdown to conflict had quadrupled in the past 10 years compared with the previous two decades. They warn of an ""extraordinary breadth"" of places already affected.

The paper, published in Nature Climate Change, looked at 49 cases of human-wildlife conflict on every continent except Antarctica, and in all five oceans. From 2.5mg mosquitoes to 6,000kg African elephants, conflicts involved all major wildlife groups - birds, fish, mammals, reptiles and invertebrates.

Changes in temperature and rainfall were the most common drivers of conflict, cited in more than 80% of case studies. The most common outcome was injury or mortality to people (43% of studies) and wildlife (45% of studies). Conflicts are defined as direct interactions between humans and wildlife that have a negative outcome for one or both.

""We were surprised that it's so globally prevalent, this was one of the big takeaways of this paper,"" said the lead researcher, Briana Abrahms, a wildlife biologist from the University of Washington.

""There hasn't been as much recognition as there should be that climate change is exacerbating these conflicts,"" she said. ""We might see new conflicts in places they haven't been in the past, as well as conflicts intensifying in places they have been in the past.""

Human-wildlife conflicts are already a leading cause of decline and extinctions among large mammals, which can trigger changes in ecosystems, according to the paper.

""Recognising the connection between climate change and human-wildlife conflict is essential for anticipating, and ultimately addressing, new and intensified human-wildlife interactions in the 21st century and beyond,"" the researchers concluded.

They give a number of examples of where human-wildlife conflict is growing due to climate change:

In Sumatra, forest fires after an El NiÃ±o-induced drought drove tigers and elephants into new areas, causing at least one human death.

Animals may be increasingly nocturnal to avoid hotter temperatures during the day, which leads to more attacks on livestock when people are asleep, which can then lead to retaliatory killings.

Across the Arctic, climate change is reducing the amount of sea ice, meaning polar bears are increasingly forced to hunt on land. The number of human-polar bear interactions tripled in the Canadian town of Churchill, Manitoba, known as the ""polar bear capital of the world"", between 1970 and 2005.

Blue whales are changing their migration timings as marine heatwaves become more frequent, increasing collisions with ships.

Drought is forcing elephants in Tanzania to look for food and water nearer villages, causing crop damage and retaliatory killings.

In Scotland, warming temperatures are driving an increase in barnacle geese, which eat grass farmers want for their sheep.

""Our systematic review revealed an extraordinary breadth of systems in which climate-driven conflicts are occurring worldwide,"" the researchers said. They did not look at the spread of disease transmission but this is ""also a well-documented consequence of climate change"".

They also highlight the need to anticipate where conflict is likely to occur in the future, and work out ways to minimise it, such as creating early warning systems about wildlife moving into areas prone to drought or megafires.

A success story highlighted in the paper is California's Whale Entanglement Risk Assessment and Mitigation Program (Ramp) in the north-west Pacific Ocean, which looks at real-time changes in climate, ecosystem and fisheries to work out the risk of whales getting entangled in fishing gear and acts to reduce the probability of this happening, such as temporarily closing fisheries.

Northern states on alert for invasion of cross-bred pig that threatens flora and fauna - and is difficult to stop

For decades, wild pigs have been antagonizing flora and fauna in the US: gobbling up crops, spreading disease and even killing deer and elk.

Now, as fears over the potential of the pig impact in the US grow, North America is also facing a new swine-related threat, as a Canadian ""super pig"", a giant, ""incredibly intelligent, highly elusive"" beast capable of surviving cold climates by tunneling under snow, is poised to infiltrate the north of the country.

The emergence of the so-called super pig, a result of cross-breeding domestic pigs with wild boars, only adds to the problems the US faces from the swine invasion.

Pigs are not native to the US, but have wrought havoc in recent decades: the government estimates the country's approximately 6 million wild, or feral, pigs cause $1.5bn of damage each year.

In parts of the country, the pigs' prevalence has sparked a whole hog hunting industry, where people pay thousands of dollars to mow down boar and sow with machine guns. But overall, the impact of the pigs, first introduced to the US in the 16th century, has very much been a negative, as the undiscerning swine has chomped its way across the country.

""We see direct competition for our native species for food,"" said Michael Marlow, assistant program manager for the Department of Agriculture's national feral swine damage management program.

""However, pigs are also accomplished predators. They'll opportunistically come upon a hidden animal, and the males have long tusks, so they're very capable of running and grabbing one with their mouth.

""They'll kill young fawns, they're known to be nest predators, so they impact turkeys and potentially quail.""

The wild pigs are also responsible for a laundry list of environmental damages, ranging from eating innocent farmers' crops to destroying trees and polluting water. They also pose ""a human health and safety risk"", Marlow said.

A pig is a ""mixing vessel"", capable of carrying viruses, such as flu, which are transmittable to humans. National Geographic reported that pigs have the potential to ""create a novel influenza virus"", which could spread to humankind.

The first record of pigs in the continental US was in 1539, when the Spanish explorer Hernando De Soto landed in Florida with an entourage which included 13 swine.

During the four-year expedition, which saw De Soto order the slaughter of thousands of Native Americans, declare himself ""an immortal ""˜Son of the Sun'"", and then die of a fever, the number of pigs grew to about 700, spread across what is now the south-eastern US.

But it is only relatively recently that the pigs have become a problem.

""They lived a benign existence up until, you know, probably three or four decades ago, where we started seeing these rapid excursions in areas we hadn't seen before,"" Marlow said.

""Primarily that was the cause of intentional releases of swine by people who wanted to develop hunting populations. They were drugged and moved around, not always legally, and dropped in areas to allow the populations to develop. And so that's where we saw this rapid increase.""

The number of pigs in the US has since grown to more than 6 million, in some 34 states. The pigs weigh between 75 and 250lbs on average, but can weigh in twice as large as that, according to the USDA. At 3ft tall and 5ft long, they are a considerable foe.

Marlow said his team had managed to eradicate pigs in seven states over the past decade, but with little realistic hope of getting rid of the swine completely, there are also fears over the potential impact of pig-borne disease, particularly African swine fever.

The disease is always fatal to pigs, and in China, which is home to more than 400 million pigs - half of the world's pig population - African swine fever wiped out more than 30% of the pig population in 2018 and 2019. African swine fever has presented in Europe, too, but Marlow said it has not yet been detected in the Americas.

That's something that Ryan Brook, who leads the University of Saskatchewan's Canadian wild pig research project, hopes to maintain.

In Canada, like in the US, wild pigs are a relatively recent problem. Up until 2002 there were barely any wild pigs in the country, but Brook said the population has exploded in the past eight years. The animals are now spread across 1m sq km of Canada, predominantly in Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.

""Wild pigs are easily the worst invasive large mammal on the planet,"" said Ryan Brook.

""They're incredibly intelligent. They're highly elusive, and also when there's any pressure on them, especially if people start hunting them, they become almost completely nocturnal, and they become very elusive - hiding in heavy forest cover, and they disappear into wetlands and they can be very hard to locate.""

Brook and others are particularly troubled by the emergence of a ""super pig"", created by farmers cross-breeding wild boar and domestic pigs in the 1980s. The result was a larger swine, which produced more meat, and was easier for people to shoot in Canadian hunting reserves.

These pigs escaped captivity and swiftly spread across Canada, with the super pig proving to be an incredibly proficient breeder, Brook said, while its giant size - one pig has been clocked at more than 300kg (661lbs) - makes it able to survive the frigid western Canada winters, where the wind chill can be -50C.

""All the experts said at that time: ""˜Well, no worries. If a wild pig or a wild boar ever escaped from a farm, there's no way it would survive a western Canadian winter. It would just freeze to death.'

""Well, it turns out that being big is a huge advantage to surviving in the cold.""

The pigs survive extreme weather by tunneling up to 2 meters under snow, Brook said, creating a snow cave.

""They'll use their razor-sharp tusks to cut down cattails [a native plant], and line the bottom of the cave with cattails as a nice warm insulating layer.

""And in fact, they're so warm inside that one of the ways we use to find these pigs is to fly first thing in the morning when it's really cold, colder than -30, and you will actually see steam just pouring out the top of the snow.""

Given the damage the pigs have wrought, a range of attempts have been made to get rid of them. Scientists and researchers in the US and Canada have had some success with catching whole sounders of pigs in big traps, while in the US attempts have been made - sometimes unsuccessfully - at poisoning wild pigs.

One method that has worked in the US, Brook said, is the use of a ""Judas pig"". A lone pig is captured and fitted with a GPS collar, then released into the wild, where hopefully it will join a group of unsuspecting swine.

""The idea is that you go and find that collared animal, remove any pigs that are with it, and in ideal world then let it go again and it will just continue to find more and more pigs,"" Brook said.

Brook said a variety of methods are required to tackle the pig problem. But the efforts are more about managing the damage caused by these non-native mammals, rather than getting rid of the pigs completely. In Canada, that chance has gone.

""Probably as late as maybe 2010 to 2012, there was probably a reasonable chance of finding and removing them. But now, they're so widespread, and so abundant, that certainly as late as 2018 or 19 I stopped saying that eradication was possible. They're just so established,"" Brook said.

""They've definitely moved in, and they're here to stay.""

539,"April Mediterranean heatwave ""˜almost impossible' without climate crisis","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/05/april-mediterranean-heatwave-almost-impossible-without-climate-crisis","April Mediterranean heatwave ""˜almost impossible' without climate crisis

Extreme event would have been expected once in 40,000 years before global heating, scientists estimate

The record-shattering temperatures that hit the western Mediterranean last week would have been ""almost impossible"" without the climate crisis, according to scientists.

The heatwave across Spain, Portugal, Morocco and Algeria was made at least 100 times more likely by global heating, the researchers calculated. Before the climate crisis, such an extreme event would have been expected only once in a least 40,000 years, making it statistically impossible on human timescales.

The scientists said such heat early in the year was especially harmful to people, who were less prepared than in summer. Farmers were already suffering under a prolonged drought and the heatwave struck at an important time in the crop-growing season, particularly for wheat.

Extreme temperatures in the region are increasing faster than predicted by climate models - a problem that worries scientists - and intensive research is in progress to understand the reasons.

Human-caused global heating was already known to be increasing the severity and frequency of heatwaves. But the number of extreme events that would have been essentially impossible without the climate crisis is rising, destroying lives and livelihoods across the planet.

In April, scientists showed that the devastating drought in the Horn of Africa would not have happened without global heating. A Guardian analysis in 2022 found that at least a dozen serious events, from killer heatwaves to broiling seas, would have been all but impossible without human-caused global heating.

""The heatwave was a rare event in current climates, but an event of this extremity would have been almost impossible in the past colder climates, and we will see more intense and more frequent heatwaves in the future,"" said Dr Sjoukje Philip at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, one of the researchers who conducted the study as part of the World Weather Attribution collaboration.

""The Mediterranean is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change in Europe,"" said Dr Friederike Otto, at Imperial College London, who was one of the study team. ""These heatwaves are definitely not going away, so these kinds of conditions will occur ever more frequently until we stop emitting greenhouse gases.""

Dr Fatima Driouech, at the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University in Morocco, who was also part of the research team, said: ""The intense heatwave came on top of a multi-year drought, exacerbating the lack of water in the region and threatening 2023 crop yields.""

The researchers used peer-reviewed methods to assess the influence of global heating on the 26-28 April heatwave, and the results are the fastest yet for such a study, produced in just a week. The heatwave brought temperatures never previously recorded in the four countries at that time of the year, ranging from 36.9C to 41.0C.

The team used weather data and climate models to compare the likelihood of the high temperatures in today's warmer world with their likelihood before the climate crisis. They found that global heating had made the heatwave at least 100 times more likely, with temperatures up to 3.5C hotter than they would have been without global heating.

Heatwaves tend to be the deadliest type of extreme weather, the scientists said. Mortality data from the April heatwave is not yet available, but heatwaves in 2022 led to nearly 4,000 deaths in Spain and more than 1,000 deaths in Portugal.

Roop Singh, at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, said: ""The results of the study indicate the need to work more urgently to put in place adaptations known to reduce heat-related mortality."" Lisbon, for example, has reduced the city heat-island effect by increasing the area covered by green spaces and water features.

541,"Fentanyl, cartels or simple market glut: what's behind collapse of Colombia's coca market?","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/13/colombian-coca-market-collapsed-cocaine-precursor","Fentanyl, cartels or simple market glut: what's behind collapse of Colombia's coca market?

As the price of coca has slumped, the rural families who depend on the shrub are wondering how they're going to get by

Noralba Galvis usually returns home to her village in the Colombian jungle with fresh supplies of rice, meat, salt and other foods stuffed into bags. But today, as the 40-year-old steps onboard a boat for the two-hour journey home along the Putumayo River, she carries just a single cardboard box.

""My mother gave me these chicks,"" she says. ""Chickens are great in times of emergency like these, when there is nothing else left to eat.""

Like most farmers in Putumayo, a vast southern department where the Andes meets the Amazon and where Colombia borders Ecuador and Peru, Galvis depends on selling coca to make a living.

Despite decades of efforts from successive Colombian governments to stamp out the green shrub used to make cocaine, it has thrived across the country's most remote corners since the 1990s.

If families in the region do not grow coca, there is a good chance they are employed in fields to strip coca leaves, or in rudimentary labs chemically transforming the plant into white powder. Many have abandoned growing food entirely to focus on the small green shrub, depending on coca buyers for their income.

But no buyer has come to Galvis's village for three months now, pushing her family - and nearly half a million other households - deeper into poverty.

""For most of us, coca is the only income we have,"" says Galvis, who is the community representative for her remote village of 50 families. ""Now no one is buying and many of us mothers are having to go hungry.""

After three years of rising prices, over the past 12 months the coca market in Colombia has inexplicably collapsed, fuelling speculation from government officials and organised crime analysts as to why cartels have stopped buying.

While experts debate whether the collapse of the market was triggered by the US fentanyl boom, Mexicans cartels muscling in on Colombia's drug trade or a simple market glut, many rural families have been left wondering if they will be able to afford their next bag of rice.

The price drop has been so severe and sudden that it has prompted concern from the Colombian government and international organisations such as the World Food Programme that it could cause widespread hunger.

""Coca is a lifeline for many families. For several decades it is what people have looked to in times of crisis, such as when other crops fail. So the question is, what can they look to now?"" said Elizabeth Dickinson, senior analyst for Colombia at the International Crisis Group.

About 400,000 households depend on the coca crop to get by, but in departments such as Cauca in central Colombia the price for coca base - the first step in the production of cocaine - has almost halved from £0.60 ($0.75) a gram to about £0.35.

As coca's market value has plunged, the cost of the pesticides, gasoline and chemicals used to make cocaine base has spiked. So too have food prices.

In communities like Galvis's, the coca buyer who came every week started coming monthly and then disappeared entirely, leaving families wondering anxiously when he will return.

""Things are never easy here. Coca is the uncomfortable way that we can get by, but now even that is becoming impossible,"" the mother of three says, spooning a serving of chicken and rice on to a metal plate for her four-year-old son.

Coca production in the Putumayo region leapt 77% last year, helping drive national cocaine production up 24%, to 1,738 metric tonnes- a more than 20-year high, according to the UN.

Billions of dollars are made from the illicit cocaine trade, which in Colombia has perpetuated six decades of conflict between armed guerrillas, paramilitary death squads and the military.

But precious little of that wealth has made its way to the jungle settlements where the drug's journey begins.

There is little state presence in Galvis's village, where residents live hours away from the nearest town in rickety wooden shacks and must fetch water from a well and construct their own bridges from concrete and wooden planks.

Coca farmers live in constant fear of violence, but continue anyway, since it is the only way to make a dignified living, said Meily CalderÃ³n, 50.

A kilogram of plantain fetches about 15,000 pesos (£3, $3.75) at the nearest market, but by the time a farmer has paid for it to be dragged through the rainforest on a mule and for a boat to ship it upriver, only about 6,000 pesos (£1.15, $1.44) remains.

""What are you supposed to do with 6,000 pesos?"" CalderÃ³n asked as she walked through a forest clearing filled with rows and rows of fully grown coca plants.

Theses crops reached harvest maturity weeks ago but have been left abandoned when nobody turned up to buy the harvest.

The effects of the coca crisis have also rippled out far beyond the coca fields, hitting regional capitals.

Three years of rising coca prices had caused a flurry of new restaurants and bars to pop up in the town of Puerto AsÃ­s, but as coca money dries up, the local economy is slowing down, say small business owners.

""Many of my friends studying in Puerto AsÃ­s suddenly stopped coming to class,"" said 20-year-old university student Neider Cortes. ""Without the coca money coming in they can't afford the semester and had to drop out.""

The Colombian government is aware of the crisis but so far its response has been limited. Addressing the issue is complicated by a lack of clarity as to precisely why armed groups have suddenly stopped buying coca.

A recent report published by the Washington Office on Latin America listed 12 leading theories for the collapse in the price of coca - among them the deadly fentanyl boom in the US hurting demand for cocaine and the fragmentation of Colombia's drug cartels into tiny competing businesses.

""Many of these theories don't make sense as the market in the USA for cocaine is relatively stable and continues to grow in Europe and Asia,"" said Gloria Miranda Espitia, Colombia's director of drug policy, while on a visit to dialogue with coca producers in Putumayo. ""So we think this is only an issue in Colombia and only in certain regions, which is associated with the dynamics of armed groups. There are some armed groups that are managing to sell to the international market, and there are others that are not.""

The government sees the coca crisis as an opportunity to entice farmers away from the illicit coca economy and out of the orbit of armed groups.

In Galvis's village, campesinos are returning to legal crops such as plantain, yuca and sugar cane, which were sown by previous generations before coca swept the region.

But coca farmers could just as easily swap one illicit economy for the other: in areas with mineral deposits, struggling coca farmers are reportedly leaving coca cultivation for illegal mining.

Successive governments have tried the carrot-and-the-stick approach to halt coca production and end the cocaine trade, but neither spraying herbicide from the skies nor paying farmers cash to grow legal alternatives has prevented the crop's relentless expansion.

Now that rural families can no longer guarantee putting food on the table by growing coca, Galvis hopes they may finally be able to leave the crop behind and with it the armed conflict.

""Even though we are screwed right now, maybe this could help farmers find their way again back to their roots,"" she says. ""Maybe this is just the wake-up call we need.""

This article was amended on 14 September 2023. Herbicide, not insecticide, is sprayed to try and halt coca production.

Study adds to fears Amazon is approaching tipping point after which it will not be able to generate its own rainfall

For the first time researchers have proven a clear correlation between deforestation and regional precipitation. Scientists hope it may encourage agricultural companies and governments in the Amazon and Congo basin regions and south-east Asia to invest more in protecting trees and other vegetation.

The study found that the more rainforests are cleared in tropical countries, the less local farmers will be able to depend on rain for their crops and pastures.

The paper, published in the journal Nature, adds to fears that the degradation of the Amazon is approaching a tipping point after which the rainforest will no longer be able to generate its own rainfall and the vegetation will dry up.

People living in deforested areas have long provided anecdotal evidence that their microclimates became drier with lower tree cover. Scientists already knew that killing trees reduces evapotranspiration and thus theorised this would result in lower local rainfall.

The team at Leeds University have now proven this using satellite and meteorological records from 2003-17 across pantropical regions.

Even at a small scale, they found an impact, but the decline became more pronounced when the affected area was greater than 50km squared (2,500 sq km). At the largest measured scale of 200km squared (40,000 sq km), the study discovered rainfall was 0.25 percentage points lower each month for every 1 percentage point loss of forest.

This can enter into a vicious cycle, as reductions in rainfall lead to further forest loss, increased fire vulnerability and weaker carbon drawdown.

One of the authors, Prof Dominick Spracklen of the University of Leeds, said 25% to 50% of the rain that fell in the Amazon came from precipitation recycling by the trees. Although the forest is sometimes described as the ""lungs of the world"", it functions far more like a heart that pumps water around the region.

He said the local impact of this reduced water recycling was far more obvious, immediate and persuasive to governments and corporations in the global south than arguments about carbon sequestration, which was seen as having more benefits to industrial countries in the northern hemisphere.

""Demonstrating the local benefit of keeping tropical forests standing for the people living nearby has important policy implications,"" Spracklen said. ""I hope our work will provide a strong incentive for policy and decision makers within tropical nations to conserve tropical forests to help maintain a cooler and wetter local climate, with benefits for nearby agriculture and people.""

The authors also looked forward at the possible effects of further deforestation. For the Congo basin, they estimated a rainfall decline of 16mm a month by the end of the century based on projections of forest loss.

In all regions, the consequences are likely to be felt in cities and farm fields hundreds or thousands of kilometres outside the cleared forest. The study notes that crop yields could decline by 1.25% for each 10 percentage point loss of forest cover.

Cremona residents say life becoming unbearable amid pollution from industry, cars and farm animal waste

For almost two weeks, the inhabitants of Crotta d'Adda, a village in the heart of the Po Valley, have barricaded themselves indoors.

Emanating from the vast area of farmland directly adjacent to their homes is an unbearable and potentially noxious stench, which has caused vomiting, breathing difficulties, dizziness, swollen eyes and headaches.

""It is impossible to live like this,"" said Cristiano Magnani. ""You can't go out, you can't do anything. Even your house is no longer safe as the stench gets into everything and lasts for weeks on end. The icing on the cake is that we live in an area surrounded by all the things that cause pollution.""

Crotta d'Adda, home to about 600 people in Cremona, a province south of Milan in Italy's Lombardy region, is encircled by farms packed with pigs and poultry, from which the faeces are transformed into fertiliser before being thickly coated on to farmland in a process known as ""sludge spreading"".

A byproduct of the procedure is ""defecation chalk"", a solid material obtained from the hydrolysis of biological materials using lime and, or, sulphuric acid. While defecation chalk is considered to be a versatile product in agriculture, the risk is that the chalks can originate from material classified as waste, and therefore banned from use in fertiliser. However, while the Lombardy region has standards governing sludge spreading, the rules are somewhat vague, making it difficult to control the treatment process and to know if the fertilisers contain contaminants harmful to the environment or human health.

But the sludge is not the only issue blighting the lives of people in Crotta d'Adda and other villages in the Cremona province.

The Po Valley, a huge geographical area straddling northern Italian regions including Piedmont, Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, is among the worst in Europe for air pollution. A Guardian investigation found more than a third of the people living in the valley and surrounding areas breathed air four times the World Health Organization's guideline limit for the most dangerous airborne particulates.

While the sprawling industrial hubs of Milan and Turin have long been notorious for smog, Cremona, the provincial capital of about 60,000 residents, emerged as one of the cities with the worst quality of air in Europe in a ranking published this year by the European Environment Agency (EEA).

Poor air quality was linked to 50,303 premature deaths in Italy in 2020, according to the EEA, and while most were in Milan, Cremona was the Italian province with the highest proportion of deaths - between 150 and 200 per 100,000 residents - attributed to fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5.

What is PM2.5?

PM2.5 particles are those less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter. They are invisible to the naked eye and small enough to penetrate deep into our lungs. Exposure to these tiny particles dominates the health harm from air pollution and is the leading environment risk factor for early death. 

PM2.5 comes from the burning of solid and liquid fuels, through power generation, domestic heating and motor traffic. It can also form in the air from chemical reactions between other pollutants.

A growing body of research shows that these particulates are responsible for a huge range of health problems from lung and heart disease to diabetes and cancer, brain function to premature births. As well as leaving millions of people with life-limiting chronic health conditions, they also lead to the early death of more than 400,000 people across Europe each year. Experts say more than 200,000 of these could be saved if the air in Europe met World Health Organization guidelines.

The current WHO guidelines state that annual average concentrations of PM2.5 should not exceed 5 micrograms a cubic metre (µg/m3).

Gary Fuller

""No body organ is unscathed from PM 2.5,"" said Maria Grazia Petronio, a representative from ISDE, an environmental association of medical doctors. ""So we are dealing with all types of cancer, respiratory illnesses, fertility issues and also cardiovascular illnesses - when PM 2.5 is high we see an increase in heart attacks.""

Flanked by the Alps and the Apennines, far from the coastline and with little wind, the Po Valley is naturally prone to pollution.

However, as Italy's economic powerhouse, the area is also heavily industrialised and agriculture-intensive. Lombardy produces huge amounts of animal waste, much of it concentrated in farms in Cremona and neighbouring provinces, while the region produces more than 40% of Italy's milk and hosts the largest number of pigs.

Cremona's pollution woes are also due to a steel factory close to Crotta d'Adda, an ageing waste incinerator and the constant passing of heavy vehicles.

""We really don't miss a thing around here,"" said Giovanna Pirotta, a volunteer in Cremona with Legambiente, Italy's most prominent environment association.

But while the issue of bad air in Cremona, an otherwise refined city famous for violin-making, has long been known, Pirotta said the topic, especially when it came to premature deaths, was mostly ""swept under the carpet"".

""Unless they've really been affected by it, people here like to pretend as if nothing is happening. In reality, the atmospheric conditions are worsening, also because of the changing climatic conditions.""

While local initiatives such as cycling paths and restrictions on pollution-emitting vehicles have gone some way to tackling smog across the Po Valley, authorities hesitate to take stronger action as it would come at an economic cost.

""If we know that the main source of pollutants are cars, then why is there not a strong intervention on sustainable mobility?"" said Michele Arisi, from Stati generali Clima Ambiente e Salute, a Cremona-based environment association. ""While you see a lot of bikes in Cremona, it is also the city with one of the highest ratios of cars per citizen.""

Arisi's association has come together with others, including Critical Mass, launched last year by a group of young people to raise awareness about environmental issues, to fight plans to build a new shopping centre and motorway.

""[The authorities] are aware of the pollution problem but act in the opposite way by creating even greater hubs for traffic,"" said Arisi.

As part of a plan drawn up alongside authorities in Piedmont, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, the Lombardy councillor for the environment, Giorgio Maione, argues that the region has made good progress in recent years in its attempts to reduce pollution.

Over the past decade, the level of coarse dust particles (PM10) in Lombardy, a region with more than 10 million inhabitants, has been gradually decreasing, as has the number of days in which the 50mg/m3 limit was breached, even if the 35-day limit was still exceeded in 2022.

Measures including traffic restrictions, greener heating systems and providing financial incentives to encourage people to improve home insulation, as well as those targeting the agricultural sector, have contributed to the improvement.

Maione said Lombardy invested â‚¬19bn (£16bn) on such initiatives between 2018 and 2022, the bulk being spent on improving mobility infrastructure, including incentives allowing residents and businesses to swap vehicles for cleaner ones.

He argued that the region was making ""an enormous effort"" but that it was impossible to meet the EU's 2030 air quality targets due to the disadvantage of its geographical location. Italy is among countries pushing for the rules to be loosened.

""We're not against the objectives, we are asking for a different approach, such as extending the timeframe,"" said Maione. ""Even the EU says that the goal is not technologically achievable today, even with the best existing technologies, without stopping use of all cars, closing businesses and all of our production activities and eliminating livestock.""

Consumers are being ""˜misled' into believing dairy cattle graze in fields, says animal rights campaign

Some of the UK's biggest food firms are accused of misleading consumers after buying their milk from intensive industrial dairy units despite using images to promote their products that show cows grazing in green fields.

Tens of thousands of dairy cattle in England are kept in hangar-style sheds with no or very limited access to pasture. They will typically be milked three times daily, often on large electronic rotating milk parlours, producing up to 32 litres of milk each day.

The animal rights charity Viva! is this weekend launching a campaign on the conditions of ""zero-grazed"" cattle. It cites research showing zero-grazed cows have a higher level of health problems, such as lameness and mastitis, and mortality.

""These battery cows are denied their most inherent instinct: grazing on grass outdoors,"" said Juliet Gellatley, the founder and director of Viva!, which promotes veganism. ""Consumers are misled into believing that cows graze outdoors.""

Campaigners describe the units as a ""disgrace"" and there is mounting pressure on the dairy industry for better labelling and transparency in the supply chain, identifying products containing milk from cows with no access to pasture. At present, there is no requirement for mandatory welfare labelling on milk products.

The Observer has established:

Tesco's fresh milk is promoted with an image of a grazing cow on its cartons. One of its biggest suppliers is the Lea Manor farm in Cheshire, part of the Duke of Westminster's Grosvenor group, with 2,600 dairy cattle kept in open-side sheds, with no access to pasture.

Arla Foods has promoted its Cravendale milk brand and its Care welfare and environmental programme with farmer suppliers singing ""everybody's free"" in fields. It has confirmed that its supply chain for other products includes milk from zero-grazing units. Viva! has complained to the Advertising Standards Authority.

Viva! argues that the advert for Cravendale milk is misleading because it considers that it gives the impression that all Arla milk comes from cows with access to pasture.

MÃ¼ller UK & Ireland has pictures on its website of cows standing in fields in front of a table with a glass and cartons of fresh milk. Its milk supply chain includes some cattle units with no or limited access to pasture, the dairy giant confirmed this weekend.

It has been estimated that up to 20% of the UK dairy herd of 1.9 million cattle have no or very limited access to pasture, but regulators do not collate figures on intensive units. The average annual milk production of a dairy cow has risen significantly over the years, with many cows now producing as much as 12,000 litres of milk a year.

The dairy industry says well-managed units provide high animal welfare. An expert report by the government's animal welfare committee in 2021 found that ""fully housed systems"" and access to pasture both offered welfare benefits.

The Viva! campaign identifies some of the biggest intensive dairy units, including the Lea Manor farm near the Duke of Westminster's stately home, Eaton Hall, in Cheshire. The complex produces enough milk for 430,000 people daily, according to Grosvenor. The milk is processed by MÃ¼ller and supplied to Tesco.

Grosvenor says its facility is larger than typical industry standards, with natural light and space to roam. It says the ""state-of-the-art"" facility offers ""exceptional standards"" of animal welfare, cutting use of antibiotics by more than 60% in the past five years and reducing incidence of illnesses such as mastitis to ""industry-leading levels"".

Viva! also identified two intensive units in the south and south-west of England which provide milk for the UK's two biggest dairy processors, Arla and MÃ¼ller. There is no suggestion or evidence of any breaches of regulations in the milking facilities.

Peter Stevenson, the chief policy adviser at the charity Compassion in World Farming, said: ""The public still sees cows as being outdoors in fields and are unaware of their high yields to which they have been pushed and the fact that quite a chunk of them are zero-grazed. This intensive part of the dairy sector is an utter disgrace.""

Arla, a farmer-owned company, said last week that supplier farms met ""strict and non-negotiable animal welfare standards"", but not all milk was produced under its Care environmental and welfare programme which stipulates access to pasture. It said more than 90% of its supplier farms were grass-based.

""Within Arla, we have a variety of farming systems and do not believe that any one is better than the other,"" said a company spokesperson. Arla has an ongoing trial measuring ""cow happiness"" in grazed and housed dairy cattle.

A spokesperson for MÃ¼ller UK & Ireland said: ""We purchase milk from around 1,300 dairy farms throughout Britain, which have different farm sizes and production systems. Animal welfare is a key priority for our business. Our products are marketed in compliance with all regulations and our farmers must comply fully with our own MÃ¼ller standards as well as those of the Red Tractor dairy assurance scheme.""

Supermarkets say they know animal welfare is important to customers and only source from accredited farms, with regular vet inspections.

A Tesco spokesperson said: ""We work closely with our dairy farmers to ensure high animal health and welfare standards. Cows on Tesco farms are some of the best looked after in the UK."" Tesco considers that since a large proportion of its supplier dairy farms use outdoor grazing, it is appropriate to use an image of grazing cows to promote its fresh milk.

Dairy UK, the trade association for the UK dairy supply chain, said: ""The leading determinant of cow health in the UK is the quality of the management on farms. Time spent housed or out in pasture has not been shown to be correlated with poor health, at least in the UK."" It denied it was misleading to promote brands which may contain milk from zero-grazing systems with images of cows in fields.

In the government's food strategy, the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) committed to consult on improving and expanding mandatory animal welfare labelling. A Defra spokesperson said: ""All farm animals are protected by comprehensive animal health, welfare and environmental legislation within the Animal Welfare Act 2006.""

The country's transformation into one of the world's biggest pork producers is helping to accelerate rural depopulation, claim opponents of the industry

Photographs by Pablo BlÃ¡zquez for the Guardian

The village school shut down more than four decades ago. The two-storey stone hotel closed its doors in 2008. Yet the past 15 years have seen a population boom - of sorts - in the Spanish village of Balsa de Ves.

""We're being invaded by pigs,"" says the mayor, Natividad PÃ©rez GarcÃ­a, pointing to a cluster of elongated sheds on the outskirts of the village. The buildings are home to 3,900 sows, who produce approximately 100,000 piglets a year. ""We're at more than 800 pigs for every resident,"" says PÃ©rez GarcÃ­a.

It's a transformation playing out across rural Spain, with close to half of the pork industry located in municipalities with a population below 5,000. In 2021, the country of 47 million people slaughtered 58 million pigs - up 40% from a decade earlier - turning Spain into Europe's largest pork meat producer.

But promises that pork production would revitalise Spain's rural communities remain unfulfilled in Balsa de Ves, about 60 miles (100km) inland from Valencia.

PÃ©rez GarcÃ­a remembers the early days in 2006, when a representative of the industry turned up at a council meeting. ""He said we would be the envy of the surrounding villages,"" she says. ""That the world was going to want to come and live here. That the village school would reopen and we would have green spaces.""

His pitch - which convinced all the local councillors save PÃ©rez GarcÃ­a to sign off on the idea - offered a glimmer of hope amid a battery of alarming statistics. In the past decade, 90% of Spanish villages with fewer than 1,000 inhabitants have seen their populations shrink. As villages across the country peddled bargain land or even the local bachelors to stave off their demise, Balsa de Ves gambled on intensive pig farming.

""That was the beginning of the nightmare in my village,"" says PÃ©rez GarcÃ­a. ""In one of the hamlets about three kilometres from the farm, it smells 362 days a year. A constant stream of heavy trucks come and go, destroying our roads.""

In May, testing carried out by Greenpeace suggested that one of the village's five water sources - albeit one that is not connected to the drinking water supply - had a nitrate level of 120 milligrams per litre, more than doubling the EU directive limit of 50mg/l. PerÃ©z GarcÃ­a hastily moved to curb residents' habit of filling up jugs with the spring water.

The presence of nitrates has been linked to the spread of manure by the farm, a correlation found across Spain. In the north-eastern region of AragÃ³n, home to roughly seven pigs for every inhabitant, a recent investigation found that nearly 50 municipalities had recorded dangerously high levels of nitrates in their drinking water at some point between 2016 and 2020.

The farm in Balsa de Ves employs few people, but more worryingly for PÃ©rez GarcÃ­a, the village's population has dropped 40% since its arrival.

A 2021 study comparing nearly 400 small villages across the country found that 74% of the municipalities where pigs outnumbered people had shrunk over the previous two decades; by comparison, 25% of municipalities where pigs were not being farmed in large numbers had undergone a similar decline.

""It makes sense,"" says PÃ©rez GarcÃ­a. ""What do people prefer? The smell of pine, rosemary, or the smell of shit?""

The farm did not reply to a request for comment.

The proliferation of intensive farms has polarised rural Spain, pitting those who see the farms as a source of much-needed jobs against the more than 70 grassroots groups who oppose their rapid growth.

""You can't fill empty Spain with pigs,"" says Antonio Escribano, a winemaker based in the village of Quintanar del Rey, who has for years been part of a grassroots group battling plans for a farm that would produce nearly 40,000 piglets a year. ""Who would come and live in a village with polluted water, where one can't open the window and breathe healthy air?""

The debate has at times shredded the social fabric of these villages. ""Before we were a village like any other village,"" says Milagros Herreros, who has spearheaded opposition to a farm housing as many as 6,300 pigs in the municipality of Cardenete.

Amid complaints about a persistent bad smell and concerns over the potential for nitrate-laden runoff to enter the water supply, an atmosphere of ""tense calm"" set in, Herrero says. ""Some neighbours stopped speaking to others.""

About 50,000 jobs in the pork industry are located in Spain's least populated municipalities, according to Interporc Spain, which represents the large-white sector - the breed widely used in intensive pig farming. Businesses create ""jobs, opportunities and a future for families who want to remain where their roots are"", the trade body says.

Addressing the concerns of some communities, it says: ""A farm is not set up indiscriminately. There is a strict series of requirements that must be followed in order to be granted the appropriate permits by the different administrations involved. This includes distances to municipalities and strict environmental regulations.""

In Balsa de Ves, PÃ©rez GarcÃ­a argues that the arrival of the pig farm has ruled out other possibilities for the village's survival. ""We could be living perfectly well from tourism, we have some beautiful spots,"" the mayor says. ""But nobody is interested because of the megafarm.""

The singer and activist is releasing a single with RosalÃ­a to support action against intensive salmon farming. She talks about being a guardian of Iceland's wilderness and how young people will make real change

It is hard to think of anyone as symbolic of their nation as BjÃ¶rk. The singer has lived away from Iceland over the years - in London and New York, and is often on tour - but when she's been away she has always felt, she says, like she is ""holding her breath"", both in anticipation of return and in memory of purer air. In recent years, since her relationship with the artist Matthew Barney ended in 2013, she has lived pretty much full-time near Reykjavik, where she has witnessed the great surge in tourism to the island, which has risen from a few hundred thousand annual visitors 20 years ago to almost 2 million now.

You couldn't quantify exactly what proportion of that interest in volcano and glacier is down to BjÃ¶rk's own one-woman nation branding, but there is no doubt that her wild and whirling music, with its operatic cutting edges of trance and techno, has done much to establish the unique cool of her native island in the eco-traveller's mind. It is for this reason that when she adds her trippy voice to any environmental campaign, it has ripples well beyond the north Atlantic.

She has been involved in protest for 30 years, she explained to me, ""but always in Iceland, where I know it can actually make a change - which later maybe could be an exemplary case [internationally]. We have,"" she says, ""the largest untouched natural area in Europe and a lot of us feel like guardians of this, you know, the way that you guys are guardians of whatever""¦ "" she laughs. ""Brexit, maybe?""

Her current obsession is to try to halt the practice of intensive salmon farming in Iceland's fjords, an industry that threatens not only the island's historic wild salmon, she argues, but also its entire ocean ecology. ""We were organic before organic. But now what is starting in the last five or 10 years is this open-pen fish farming, basically factory farming,"" she says. She describes a practice, imported from Norway, of intensive salmon rearing, in which fish development is accelerated. Diseases - particularly those associated with parasitic sea lice - are, she claims, prevalent, pointing to photographs of disfigured farmed fish as evidence.

This is not a simple battle between ecology and local economies in BjÃ¶rk's view - only a few hundred people are employed in the salmon farming businesses. ""It's like two Norwegian billionaires,"" she says, exaggerating a little. ""They fucked everything up in Norway. And now they have come to Iceland. People say it's like the bank crash, a few people getting millions and [nobody else] getting anything."" The problem made headlines in August when thousands of the farmed salmon escaped and swam up all Iceland's rivers. ""We were sending divers with harpoons, trying to capture them,"" BjÃ¶rk says, but the task was hopeless and she claims the ""mutant fish"" spread sea lice among the Atlantic stock. (All of these allegations of disease and mistreatment are disputed by the salmon farming companies. Speaking to the Guardian last month, a spokesman for Arctic Fish, the company responsible for the nets from which farmed salmon escaped, said: ""We have systems in place that ensure wild salmon are not put at risk. On top of that, our licences have an expiry date. If we do not behave, we don't get licences renewed."" There is an ongoing police investigation into whether environmental laws have been breached.)

The battle against the expansion of open-net farming is concentrated now in a village called SeyÃ°isfjÃ¶rÃ°ur in the east of the island. ""A lot of bohemian artists live there,"" she says, ""and they have been protesting in the streets and have brought a test legal case, which uses the argument of protecting biodiversity."" The protesters have run out of money, so BjÃ¶rk is releasing a single to raise funds.

The song dates back to 2002 - she had been trying to find it in her extensive archives for many years but had forgotten the name it was filed under. Then, serendipitously, on tour in Australia, a news item was playing on a loop in her hotel room. The news concerned a politician involved in a scandalous affair and the strapline was, apparently, ""oral or not?"" - the word ""oral"" was, she says, laughing, the one she had been trying to remember, the name of her song. It has a Jamaican dancehall beat, and to update it she invited the Catalan star RosalÃ­a to provide some vocals and a ""2023 reggaeton sound"". ""One great thing about having RosalÃ­a in on this is we can get a Spanish audience,"" she says, ""and the countries where this [salmon farming] is the biggest problem are Argentina and Chile.""

If the new song represents direct environmental action, BjÃ¶rk's ongoing Cornucopia tour provides much wider context. The tour is the live version of her last-but-one album Utopia, which is set in a science-fiction future: ""Not postapocalyptic,"" she says ""but post-optimistic."" It features a monologue by BjÃ¶rk's friend Greta Thunberg, ""which clashes with the animation fantasy elements of it"".

Does post-optimistic describe her own mood, these days, I wonder?

""I'm still hopeful,"" she says. ""I have a lot of nephews and nieces and I see the friends of my daughter [Isadora is 21; BjÃ¶rk also has a son, Sindri, who is 37]. These kids are all in university studying how to run a national park or how to sue fossil fuel companies. Basically, I think that when they finally take over from the 80-year-old men who run the world, that's when we start to see real changes.""

She deals with those hopes and fears in Cornucopia, she says, ""in my usual humorous way"". ""We have all escaped to an island away from western civilisation and started all over again,"" she says. ""And yes, we are mutants of birds and flutes and so on - kind of like the weird fish in The Simpsons - but we're sort of fine!""

She believes ""biology is stronger than you think"" and has little time for ""that postapocalyptic aesthetic of Hollywood films: we're all gonna die and be survivalists with tinned food and machine guns."" Her preferred option is more: ""We are going to be hybrids of plants and mushroom spores, you know, something interesting is going to happen with biology that's out of our control, but I think we're going to ride with it because we are - what's the word?""

""Unhinged?"" I suggest. Then: ""resourceful?""

""Yes, resourceful.""

Her most recent album - made during the pandemic - is called Fossora, the feminine version of the Latin word for digger. It saw her heading underground, metaphorically, and musing, musically, on the regenerative power of mushrooms, among other things. One result of that - ""a dream come true, I always wanted to be David Attenborough"" - is that she has been invited to narrate a documentary based on Merlin Sheldrake's fabulous bestselling book about fungi, Entangled Life. ""It's one place we can look for solutions,"" she says, referencing experiments with plastic-digesting mycelium, and the radiotrophic fungi reportedly discovered repurposing radiation in the Chornobyl area.

As well as magical mushroom meditations, Fossora also includes tender valedictory tributes to her mother, Hildur RÃºna HauksdÃ³ttir, who died in 2018 after a long illness. Hildur RÃºna was a radical feminist and homeopath, who divorced the singer's father - an electrician and trade union leader - when BjÃ¶rk was two, and raised her in a commune. I wonder if she sees her environmental activism as keeping her mother's flame alive?

""Good question,"" she says. ""It's hard to know, like the chicken and the egg. Obviously, she brought me up being aware of all these things. I was brought up to think hamburgers were from the devil, and when we watched cowboy and Indian movies the cowboys were the baddies and Indians were the goodies. To this day, I can't listen to country music because that's, like, evil. She was quite radical in that way. That's basically me saying ""˜yes' to your question. But she wasn't that active [as a protester]. We - me and her and my father - all sort of started around the same time, in the 90s.""

She thinks about that connection a bit more, has another go: ""I think her biggest radical thing was basically taking me out of the patriarchy to live in a tiny little house that leaked when it rained. Right on the edge of wild nature. But I think what happened is in the 90s, both my mother and my father, we all started in three very different ways, with our group of friends, becoming quite radical with the environment."" Hildur went on a hunger strike, for example, in 2002, to protest against the US company Alcoa building an aluminium smelter and dams for a hydroelectric plant in the Icelandic highlands. She lasted 23 days, before ending her fast.

Was she successful?

""There were plans to harness all of our rivers for aluminium factories. They built the factory, but not all the dams. Iceland is the size of England, without Wales or Scotland. But if you had harnessed all the rivers to create the biggest aluminium factory in the world - as they wanted to - basically the highlands would have gone, that would have been it.""

That protest was in some respects a prototype for her current campaign. ""Basically, we plan to be stubborn as fuck,"" she says.

Back in the early years of this century, it was tourism and culture that saved Iceland from the aluminium takeover. ""Food in Iceland was like, hamburgers at the gas station at that time,"" she says, ""but that has totally changed now. Every tiny village you go to you can buy amazing local lamb and cheese, and homemade beer, there will be people who can take you to see glaciers, or go snowmobiling or river rafting. Fifteen years ago, it was the aluminium factory or nothing. But we showed there are alternatives. Now there's a lot of people who come here to fish wild salmon, and they're not going to come if they are catching these Frankenstein mutants.""

She has, over the years, tried different models to use her fame to drive change. At around the time of the banking crash she promoted a green venture capital fund, run by women, that offered seed funding to eco-friendly startups. Her 2011 Biophilia Educational Project has become part of the school syllabus, designed to get kids following in her footsteps and studying music and technology.

In 2019, she and Thunberg joined forces with Iceland's prime minister, KatrÃ­n JakobsdÃ³ttir, to declare a climate emergency in the country, only for JakobsdÃ³ttir to back out when the moment came. ""She didn't say a word. She didn't even mention it,"" BjÃ¶rk said later. ""I was so pissed off.""

That kind of experience has convinced her that politicians will never be proactive in addressing the problems we face without the sort of pressure she tries to exert culturally. There were hopes for a women-led revolution in Iceland after the banking crash wiped out the country's economy in 2008. Does she feel that moment was lost - or has it had an effect?

""Yes, and no,"" she says. ""It's a marathon. We were one of the few countries that actually sent some of the banksters to jail ""¦ Of course, they could have stayed longer in there and more people could have gone, but at least some went. Not many countries managed that. And if you look at the figures, we are one of the strongest countries when it comes to feminism in the world. But it's not good enough.""

A couple of days after we speak she was planning to join Iceland's first full-day women's strike in 48 years, in which the country's women stopped work, childcare, cooking and cleaning and took to the streets for a day in order to protest about the persistent gender-based pay gap. ""It is getting closer, but we are still not there yet,"" she says.

I wonder how she is treated at such protests - is it easy for her to live a relatively normal life in Reykjavik or does she have to be wary about where she goes?

""It's very easy,"" she says. ""That's another of the reasons why I love Iceland, we don't give a fuck about celebrities. You will meet the president in the supermarket. If you're going to be on a high horse, you're just going to be knocked down from it very quickly. There's not much hierarchy here. It's just the tourists that sometimes can be a pain in the ass for me if I'm out and about. But I just don't go on the streets where I know they are.""

Was that one of the reasons that she came back from New York?

""When I had a house in Brooklyn, I was half there and half here. So I never let go properly. My daughter went before Christmas to school here in Iceland, and after Christmas in Brooklyn."" The pandemic, she suggests, which saw her confined to her native city for the first time since she left home at 16, only deepened her roots. ""I won't leave,"" she says. ""I love the fact that I'm in a capital in Europe, but I live on a beach and I can see the mountain range. And then of course all my friends and family live literally five minutes' walking distance from my house. Even better, particularly in the last 10 years, we have one of the best film festivals in Europe here, one of the best music festivals, one of the best dance festivals, one of the best book festivals.""

It goes without saying that a good deal of that cultural capital has been enabled by her own career. We've talked for a while, I suggest, and hardly touched on music. Is she still as excited at 57 about being in the studio and on tour as she ever was?

""I'm always discovering new songs, every day,"" she says. ""And writing something, always, in the back of my head. I try to focus everything I've got on music, but I do stop once in a while, and maybe roughly 20% of my time I use to try to fight for these environmental issues. I'm thinking, obviously, about the next generation and the generation after that. Between those two things, that's where all my time goes."" She laughs. ""I wish I had five bodies,"" she says, ""but there's just this one.""

Early frost, heavy rainfall, and drought have significantly impacted the output of the world vineyard, international body says

Global wine production has fallen this year to its lowest level since 1961 as vineyards were pummelled by extreme weather events, the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) has said.

Output reached 244.1 million hectolitres, down seven percent from 2022, the intergovernmental body said as it presented its first estimates.

""Once again, extreme climatic conditions - such as early frost, heavy rainfall, and drought - have significantly impacted the output of the world vineyard,"" said the organisation, which provides data to grape and wine producing and consuming countries.

A number of major producers in the southern hemisphere had significant drops in production. Australia, Argentina, Chile, South Africa and Brazil all saw output drop between 10 and 30%.

Italy lost the title of top world producer as its output fell 12%, allowing France to reclaim first place as its production held steady.

Spain held on to its position as the world's third largest wine producer although its production fell by 14% and was down 19% from its five-year average.

The silver lining, if any, for the industry is that it may help alleviate the market imbalance.

In ""a context where global consumption is declining and stocks are high in many regions of the world, the expected low production could bring equilibrium to the world market,"" said the OIV.

While the OIV speaks of extreme weather events affecting production, they have yet to definitively link it to climate change, said Inaki Garcia de Cortazar-Atauri at the French national agronomical research institute INRAE.

A specialist on the impact of climate change on agriculture, he said that damage in Italy was due to farmed land not being able to absorb water as well as natural soil.

But ""one can observe that extreme weather events are becoming more and more frequent,"" he said, with heatwaves or rainy periods striking certain regions and adding to existing problems like mildew.

Since 2001, 7% of the habitat has been lost globally due to logging, wildfires and agriculture, scientists report

An area of mountain forest larger than the state of Texas has been lost since 2001, with the amount disappearing each year accelerating at an ""alarming"" rate, a study warns.

Scientists found 78m hectares (193m acres) of mountain forest have been lost across the world in the past two decades, which is more than 7% of all that exists. The main drivers of loss were logging, the expansion of agriculture and wildfires.

Mountains are home to more than 85% of the world's birds, mammals and amphibians. These habitats were once more protected than their lowland equivalents because their rugged terrain made them less accessible, the paper notes. Today, they are increasingly threatened as humans exploit harder-to-reach areas of the planet, and lowland forests are given greater protection.

""Our global analysis of mountain forest loss identifies an alarming acceleration over the past two decades,"" the researchers, led by scientists from the University of Leeds and the Southern University of Science and Technology in China, wrote in the paper, published in the journal One Earth.

They found that logging was responsible for 42% of mountain forest loss, wildfires for 29%, slash-and-burn cultivation 15% and semi-permanent or permanent agriculture 10%.

The researchers tracked changes in forests between 2001 and 2018, documenting both increases and decreases in tree cover, and working out possible impacts on biodiversity. They found that Asia, South America, Africa, Europe and Australia were all badly affected. Much of the loss in northern Asia was due to wildfires, especially in large parts of Russia. Droughts and bushfires led to significant losses in Australia.

The annual rate of loss rose sharply after 2010, increasing by 50% in 2010-2018 compared with 2001-2009. Expansion of agriculture and logging in the highland areas of south-east Asia was found to be a key driver. During the period of study, more than half of global forest loss happened in Asia.

The climate crisis is putting pressure on specialist - and often sensitive - mountain wildlife, as warmer temperatures force species to move to higher ground. At some point, they are likely to run out of suitable habitats, a process known as the ""escalator to extinction"".

Previous studies have shown that alpine plants are not keeping up with climate breakdown, with invasive species colonising the tops of mountains faster. Botanists working in the Scottish Highlands also found Britain's rarest mountain plants were retreating higher.

In this latest paper, researchers warned: ""Mountain forests are undergoing dramatic changes in many regions due to their sensitivity to climate change and anthropogenic pressures, which will become a major threat to mountain species.""

More than 40% of the total loss was in tropical mountain forests, which are considered biodiversity hotspots, putting even more pressure on threatened species. Zhenzhong Zeng from Southern University of Science and Technology, one of the paper's authors, said: ""What needs our attention is that mountain forest loss has encroached on areas of known high conservation value to terrestrial biodiversity, especially in the tropics. Various types of agriculture expansion and forestry activities are key drivers there.""

The paper found that creating protected areas within biodiversity hotspots lowered the rate of loss. ""Increasing the area of protection in mountains should be central to preserving montane forests and biodiversity in the future,"" it said.

Dr Marco Mina, a researcher at the Institute for Alpine Environment, Eurac Research, in Italy, who was not involved in the study, said: ""My overall opinion is that the use of large-scale data such as remote-sensing satellite products are a great tool to monitor forest change in almost real time. However, we should be cautious to draw global conclusions based solely on remote-sensing products.

""A forest that is well managed through a careful planning process can still provide high levels of habitat for plants and animal species.""

The headline of this article was amended on 20 March 2023 to remove a reference to ""alpine"" wildlife. As the article states, the study refers to losses in forest, not alpine, zones.

An area of primary rainforest the size of Switzerland was felled last year suggesting world leaders' commitment to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030 is failing

An area the size of Switzerland was cleared from Earth's most pristine rainforests in 2022, despite promises by world leaders to halt their destruction, new figures show.

From the Bolivian Amazon to Ghana, the equivalent of 11 football pitches of primary rainforest were destroyed every minute last year as the planet's most carbon-dense and biodiverse ecosystems were cleared for cattle ranching, agriculture and mining, with Indigenous forest communities forced from their land by extractive industries in some countries.

The tropics lost 4.1m hectares of primary rainforest in 2022, an increase of around 10% from 2021, according to figures compiled by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the University of Maryland. The report's authors warn that humans are destroying one of the most effective tools for mitigating global heating and halting biodiversity loss.

Land use change is the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions behind the burning of fossil fuels and is a major driver of biodiversity loss. Limiting global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels is unlikely without stopping the destruction of rainforests, according to scientists.

At Cop26 in 2021, more than 100 world leaders, including Joe Biden, Xi Jinping and Jair Bolsonaro, signed up to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030 in a commitment that covered more than 90% of the world's forests. The new data suggests that leaders are failing to deliver on their promise.

Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Bolivia headed the table for tropical primary forest loss in 2022. Indonesia and Malaysia managed to keep rates of loss near record low levels after significant corporate and government action in recent years. Bolivia was one of the few big forested countries that did not sign the Cop26 commitment on stopping the loss.

Ghana, a major producer of cacao for chocolate, has suffered the biggest relative increase in forest loss of any country in recent years, although the absolute figures are small.

Away from the tropics, the loss of Russia's boreal forests slowed after a record year for destruction in 2021, but researchers said this was not an indication of a positive trend.

In response to the new figures, Inger Andersen, the UN's environment chief, has called for a higher price for forest carbon to eliminate the short-term economic incentive to clear rainforests. Through carbon markets, countries with forests that are critical to the climate - such as Gabon, Brazil and Peru - could receive payments to keep them standing, although there are doubts about their conservation success and ability to scale to the required size. In April, a report calculated that at least $130bn (£100bn) a year was needed to protect the most at-risk areas.

""Forests are critical for our wellbeing and the wellbeing of planet Earth. Ending deforestation and halting forest cover loss are essential ingredients to fast-tracking climate action, to building resilience and to reducing loss and damage. We need to put a higher price on forest carbon, one that reflects the true value of forests, that reflects the actual cost of emissions and that is sufficient to incentivise the sellers to protect standing forests,"" Andersen said.

""Forest protection and forest restoration is about so much more than a carbon price. It is about protecting biodiversity; protecting the livelihoods of Indigenous people and local communities, and sustaining the hydrological cycle to stabilise weather patterns and protect ourselves against landslides, soil erosion and flooding. We simply cannot afford to lose more forest cover,"" she added.

The 2022 figures cover the final year of Jair Bolsonaro's presidency in Brazil, during which huge areas of the Amazon were cleared. Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, his successor, has promised to end deforestation and is holding a pan-Amazon summit later this year where the issue will be discussed.

Brazil, Indonesia and the DRC, which are home to around half of the world's remaining rainforests, are increasingly working together at UN environmental talks to demand money for protecting forests in a coalition called the ""Opec of rainforests"".

The figures describe tree-cover loss, which is not necessarily deforestation. Deforestation is always done by humans while tree cover can be lost through wildfires and other events. The figures do not include regrowth or regeneration of a forest.

565,"EPA accused of failing to regulate use of toxic herbicides despite court order","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/24/epa-monsanto-toxic-herbicides-dicamba","EPA accused of failing to regulate use of toxic herbicides despite court order

Instead of yanking products, EPA made Monsanto and others amend labels before reapproving dicamba, lawsuit claims

The US Environmental Protection Agency has in effect ignored a 2020 federal court order prohibiting the use of Monsanto and other producers' toxic dicamba-based herbicides that are destroying millions of acres of cropland, harming endangered species and increasing cancer risks for farmers, new fillings in the lawsuit charge.

Instead of permanently yanking the products from the market after the 2020 order, the EPA only required industry to add further application instructions to the herbicides' labels before reapproving the products.

A late 2021 EPA investigation found the same problems persist even with new directions added to the label, but the agency still allows Monsanto, BASF and other producers to continue using dicamba.

""The new litigation was prompted by the EPA's decision to ignore the court's ruling and move forward with reapproving the pesticide,"" plaintiffs in the lawsuit wrote in a statement. ""In re-approving dicamba, the EPA once again failed to weigh the true costs to farmers and the environment.""

The fillings are a continuation of the 2020 lawsuit, which was brought by the National Family Farm Coalition, Center for Food Safety, Center for Biological Diversity and Pesticide Action Network North America. The groups are asking the court to again order the EPA to rescind approval of the controversial products.

The EPA's move is another example of the agency ""treating the pesticide industry not as regulated companies, but as clients"", said Nathan Donley, environmental health science director with the Center For Biological Diversity.

The EPA's pesticide office is included in allegations that career managers are influenced by or have colluded with industry, and in some cases falsified science to make dangerous substances appear less toxic. About one-third of the pesticide office's funding comes from industry fees.

""The pesticide industry has a ton of clout in the EPA's pesticide office, a ton of ability to persuade people there, and the culture at the office is very in alliance with the pesticide industry,"" Donley told the Guardian.

The EPA did not respond to a request for comment.

The agency in 2016 approved the dicamba-based herbicide developed by Monsanto, which was to be used on genetically modified soybean and cotton crops that the company designed and are ""dicamba-tolerant"".

The herbicides are sprayed over fields and efficiently kill weeds. However, they are also highly volatile and prone to drifting into neighboring fields when they are spread, or can lift off the ground and plants and travel up to a mile.

When that happens, the herbicide can damage or kill neighboring crops and plants that are not engineered to be dicamba-resistant. Most frequently, the substance impairs their ability to grow or flower, and it reduces height and yield of non-dicamba-resistant crops.

The results are ""devastating"" and destroying millions of acres as ""as never before seen in the history of US agriculture"", the plaintiffs said.

The herbicide also impairs plants and flowers' ability to produce nectar, which environmental groups say deprives pollinators of food. In some cases, direct dicamba exposure can kill insects, mammals and other animals, Donley said, and it is linked to reproductive harm and developmental problems in animals.

Peer-reviewed studies also found dicamba likely doubled the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in Canadian farmers and increased rates of liver cancer in highly exposed US farmers.

Monsanto and BASF's own science found the herbicide would probably cause such harm, according to documents released during a successful $265m lawsuit brought against both firms by a Missouri farmer. The court in 2020 wrote in its order that the EPA ""refused to estimate the amount of dicamba damage"" that would be caused, and said it was ""exceedingly unlikely"" the agency could legally approve the herbicides.

Still, four months after the 2020 ruling, the EPA reapproved the herbicides after producers added directions to the labels. But the tweaks have not meaningfully reduced the problems, plaintiffs say, because ""the real issue is that the weather-related usage instructions are so numerous and restrictive as to make it impossible"" to properly apply the herbicides.

The EPA arrived at a similar finding in its investigation into the herbicides' use during the 2021 growing season, and in December that year published a report detailing the ""substantial"" destruction of food crops in neighboring fields. It noted the label tweaks did not reduce the ""number, severity, or geographic extent of dicamba-related incidents"".

The agency also documented damage to university research farms, cemeteries, churchyards, state fish and game properties, state natural areas, city parks, state and national wildlife refuges, state parks and other several public spaces.

It also acknowledged that the herbicide has ""fractured"" rural communities and led to ""threats of violence"".

Still, the EPA did not rescind the approvals in 2022. In Bremer county, Iowa, Robert Faux's organic Genuine Faux Farm sits in a rural region amid farms that heavily rely on dicamba fertilizers, Faux said in a declaration filed in support of the lawsuit.

After the EPA approved the herbicide in 2016 and his neighbors began spreading it, he has watched his farms' production of up to 14 tons of food annually dwindle to seven tons in 2018. Prior to 2017, the farm produced up to 3,000 bell peppers annually, but that number dropped to seven in 2018.

Faux noted that he started growing some peppers in a wind tunnel that protected the plants from dicamba, and used the same methods as those plants that were unprotected. The protected plants thrived and the unprotected were stunted, he said.

Dicamba travels long distances and is widely used in the area, so it's impossible to identify the source, Faux wrote, and he said it has strained his relationship with his neighbors who resent him for not using genetically engineered crops, which forces them to be more careful.

""It is clear to me that some of the solution needs to come from the source of the problem, which would be EPA's registrations of dicamba products,"" Faux wrote.

Nearly 50% of US bee colonies died off last year, although efforts have helped the overall bee population remain ""˜relatively stable'

The US's honeybee hives just staggered through the second highest death rate on record, with beekeepers losing nearly half of their managed colonies, an annual bee survey found.

But by using costly and herculean measures to create new colonies, beekeepers are somehow keeping afloat. Thursday's University of Maryland and Auburn University survey found that even though 48% of colonies were lost in the year that ended 1 April, the number of US honeybee colonies ""remained relatively stable"".

Honeybees are crucial to the food supply, pollinating more than 100 of the crops we eat, including nuts, vegetables, berries, citruses and melons. Scientists said a combination of parasites, pesticides, starvation and effects of the climate crisis keep causing large die-offs.

Last year's 48% annual loss is up from the previous year's loss of 39% and the 12-year average of 39.6%, but it's not as high as 2020-2021's 50.8% mortality rate, according to the survey, which was funded and administered by the non-profit research group Bee Informed Partnership. Beekeepers told the surveying scientists that a 21% loss over the winter is acceptable and more than three-fifths of beekeepers surveyed said their losses were greater than that.

""This is a very troubling loss number when we barely manage sufficient colonies to meet pollination demands in the US,"" said former government bee scientist Jeff Pettis, president of the global beekeeper association Apimondia, which wasn't part of the study. ""It also highlights the hard work that beekeepers must do to rebuild their colony numbers each year.""

The overall bee colony population is relatively steady because commercial beekeepers split and restock their hives, finding or buying new queens, or even use starter packs for colonies, said University of Maryland bee researcher Nathalie Steinhauer, the survey's lead author. But it is an expensive and time-consuming process.

The prognosis is not as bad as it was 15 years ago because beekeepers have learned how to rebound from big losses, Steinhauer said.

""The situation is not really getting worse, but it's also not really getting better,"" she said. ""It is not a bee apocalypse.""

Despite big annual losses, the situation is a far cry from 2007, when many bee experts expected an end to managed pollination, said US Department of Agriculture research entomologist Jay Evans, who wasn't part of the survey.

""There are threats certainly in the environment and honeybees have persisted,"" Evans said. ""I don't think honeybees will go extinct, but I think they will always have these sort of challenges.""

Some commercial beekeepers who have previously succeeded in maintaining their bee populations lost as much as 80% of their colonies this past year, while other beekeepers did well, Evans said. Pettis, who has 150 colonies on Maryland's eastern shore, had less than 18% loss, saying he used organic acids for mite control.

The parasitic mite Varroa destructor, which transmits viruses, is the chief culprit, but bad weather and queen issues were also big problems in the past year, Steinhauer said. Pesticides also make things worse because they make bees more vulnerable to diseases and less likely to seek food, she said.

""It really can be like death by a thousand cuts with the most obvious one being varroa,"" Steinhauer said.

The varroa mite is a flat creature that crawls on the bee - it would be the equivalent in size to a Frisbee or flat softball on a human body - Evans said. The mite seems to make it easier for viruses to attack and kill bees, he and Steinhauer said.

It used to take a large infestation of varroa, such as in 60% of a colony, to cause virus problems, but now even small populations, at 1% or 2% in a colony, can cause trouble, Steinhauer said.

""We are fighting this evolving enemy,"" she added.

Another problem is landscapes that have only one crop or homogenous landscapes that deprive bees of food, while pesticides and bouts of extreme weather also have affected the bee population.

For example, unusually warm weather in the Washington DC area in January - with temperatures up to 80F - brought some bees out of their normal winter routine. And then when it turned cool again, they suffered, Evans said.

""The impact of climate change on bee colony survival is real and can go undetected,"" Pettis said in an email.

The demand for pollination from commercial bee colonies is growing even as beekeepers have to work harder to make up for losses, Steinhauer said. The US Department of Agriculture says 35% of the human diet comes from insect-pollinated plants and the honeybee is responsible for 80% of that pollination.

""There is this whole side of our agricultural industry that relies on these colonies,"" Steinhauer said. ""And the fact that every year the commercial beekeepers have to invest so much more effort to keep those numbers up because they have to fulfill those pollination contracts puts a lot of stress on those beekeepers and the bees.""

Microsoft co-founder leads $12m investment Rumin8, which is developing supplements for cows to cut methane output

Bill Gates has led a new $12m investment in an Australian company that is aiming to feed seaweed to cows in order to reduce the planet-heating emissions that come from their burps.

Breakthrough Energy Ventures, which the Microsoft co-founder created in 2015, has spearheaded the funding of the Perth-based startup, which is called Rumin8. Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, and Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma are also backers of the Breakthrough fund.

Rumin8 is developing a range of supplements to feed to cows in order to reduce the amount of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, they belch out. The feed includes red seaweed and rangeland plants that replicate ""nature's anti-methanogenic compound"" and cut methane output.

Gaseous ruminants are not often thought of as significant causes of the climate crisis, unlike cars or power plants, but the hoofed beasts can belch out 220lb of methane a year, equivalent to burning 900 gallons of gasoline.

Combined, this endless procession of burps is a major contributor of methane, a gas that traps heat 80 times more effectively than carbon dioxide and is rising in emissions globally. A study last year found that the combined methane emissions of 15 of the world's largest meat and dairy companies are higher than those of several of the world's largest countries, including Russia, Canada and Australia.

The US and EU are among those to have signed a global pledge to reduce methane emissions 30% by 2030 but with worldwide meat-eating expected to rise in the coming decades some companies have looked at ways of directly reducing the climate impact of the planet's 1 billion cows.

Research has previously found that adding seaweed to cow feed can reduce methane formation in their guts by more than 80%. Gates has previously spoken out about the climate impact of meat eating and has advocated that people switch entirely to consuming synthetic beef.

""There is a genuine desire to fund solutions to enteric methane emissions from livestock and fortunately for Rumin8, they can see the benefits of our technology,"" said David Messina, managing director of Rumin8, which will use the funding to commercialize its product.

""Our laboratory results continue to yield excellent results, our animal trials are reflecting the laboratory results, and the financial modeling we are undertaking is indicating we will be able to supply our products at a commercial price point.""

Dingo lovers seek a political response to new understanding of a carnivore considered kin by First Nations people and villain by many farmers

A dingo called Pumbah entered Australian parliament this week in an effort to persuade the country's lawmakers they have been persecuting his species based upon a myth and mistruth.

Pumbah, who journeyed from the foothills of Victoria's Macedon Ranges, was ushered through a side entrance to parliament on Thursday while a group of his human allies strode through the main foyer. Scientists, Indigenous people and lifelong dingo warriors, they travelled from opposite ends of the continent, from far north Queensland, through coastal New South Wales and central Victoria to be there.

""This is momentous for us,"" the Australian Dingo Foundation director, Mel Browning, said.

Browning not only proclaimed Pumbah the first dingo in parliament, but the moment as another step in the radical reimagining of Australia's largest land-based predator.

In May, DNA analysis led by the University of NSW's Dr Kylie Cairns upended the widely held belief that most ""wild dogs"" roaming the continent were dog-dingo hybrids, finding instead that the majority are pure dingoes.

Now, dingo lovers Australia wide are seeking a political response to our updated understanding of a carnivore considered kin by First Nations people, and villain by many farmers.

In September, a group of scientists petitioned state governments to stop using the ""inappropriate and misleading"" term ""wild dog"" and end baiting programs aimed at destroying the native species in national parks. Weeks later in Cairns came the first ever First Nations dingo forum that declared dingoes ""Boss of Country"" and demanded an immediate end to all dingo killing.

Sonya Takau, a Jirrbal rainforest woman from Tully, was a driving force behind the First Nations forum. She grew up with a dingo and now has another in her care - a black and tan rainforest dingo called Bina - in defiance of Queensland law which forbids it.

That state's laws exemplify the seemingly irreconcilable contradictions which dog the dingo.

On one hand is Queensland's Nature Conservation Act 1992, which defines the dingo as ""native wildlife"". Under its Biosecurity Act 2014, however, it is defined as a ""restricted invasive animal"" - a designation which confers upon landowners a ""general biosecurity obligation (GBO)"" to ""manage"" dingoes using methods ""including shooting, poisoning [and] trapping"". In some states, there are no protections afforded to dingoes, even in conservation areas.

""First Nations people across Australia, and I know personally with my own self, I have a GCO, a general cultural obligation, to protect these animals,"" Takau, who travelled to Canberra this week, says.

""They are family to my people.""

Despite dingoes having been ""entwined so strongly"" through the strands of her life since childhood, the term wild dog was not one she had heard of until she learned about what was being done to wild canids in other parts of Australia.

""All along the white man has been telling people in this country that there are no pure dingoes any more,"" she says. ""Purity has got nothing to do with it. If it looks like a dingo and acts like a dingo, then it's a bloody dingo.""

Takau says the term ""wild dog"" has wrought ""so much damage to dingoes in this country"".

""And it's not true,"" she says. ""Kylie [Cairns] has debunked that. What Aboriginal people have been saying orally, all along, has now been proven through western science.""

Cairns was there in parliament on Thursday too - the population geneticist says she drove to Canberra from the NSW central coast to ""witness history"".

""This is a pretty significant moment,"" she says. ""The information that we thought we knew about dingoes in the wild has basically been transformed.""

Until recently, Cairns says, scientists used to think that there was widespread hybridisation of canids going on that was ""potentially going to drive dingoes to extinction in parts of Australia"".

Cairns says that her recent study, which found that 69% of wild dingoes are ""pure"" rather than hybrid, also discovered those that do have dog ancestry ""don't have as much as we thought"".

She says that it built upon a wealth of DNA studies that prove ""that feral dogs do not persist in the wild in Australia"".

Despite the ""transformative body of evidence"", Cairns says it could be difficult to overcome the widely held notion that feral dogs roam the bush in Australia while dingoes are confined to places like K'gari.

She believes that is due to an underappreciation of the diversity of dingo varieties, some of which may be black and tan, white or sable, or look ""vaguely German shepherd-ish"".

""Sometimes dingoes don't look ""˜the typical dingo',"" she says.

""What I think has happened is that people have seen those animals and have been told, in the past, that it was because of hybridisation,"" she says. ""And now we have learned that that's not true.""

The reaction from some state governments to her research has not been ""as constructive as could have been"", Cairns says, while others have shown downright reluctance to engage in the politically charged topic of wild canids.

""It is quite a dramatic shift and it is taking quite some time for government and policymakers to come to terms with it and consider how they are going to proceed,"" she says.

""At the same time the science is not being challenged.""

Faced with the inertia of state and territory governments who are largely responsible for dingo policy, the advocates want Canberra to take a leadership role, adopting a national strategy that would direct public money away from killing dingoes and invest instead in living with them.

To do so, they would have to completely turn around deeply emotive and established views about dingoes from the livestock industry.

The current National Wild Dog Action Plan says it applies to ""all wild-living dogs, which include: dingoes, feral dogs and their hybrids"". It describes wild dogs as an existential threat to the sheep and goat industry and one that inflicts ""serious emotional and psychological damage to landholders and their families"".

Dr Barry Traill, who emceed Pumbah's event on Thursday, helped set up Landholders for Dingoes, connecting farmers around the country who are bucking the trend and embracing dingoes on their land.

""These are cattlemen who independently came to the same realisation that they were better off with dingoes,"" the zoologist says.

Traill says dingoes could eradicate feral goats from most landscapes and prevent overgrazing by kangaroos, which means both healthier country and more grass in the paddocks for livestock.

While he acknowledges that ""dingoes in paddock with sheep and goats don't work"", those livestock could be protected from dingoes using nonlethal methods such as guardian dogs and donkeys.

But he says the focus of government and industry investment over more than 150 years has been on a policy of eradication, rather than on supporting farmers to protect their livestock without killing wild canids.

He hopes the new DNA research will end the killing of dingoes on public land and lead to their nonlethal management on private land.

""It all got very confused,"" he says. ""It's clear now: domestic dogs don't go feral.""

Takau says that clarity should make Australians stop and ""take a really good look in the mirror"".

""That word coexistence, that's not going to go away, because we are going to have to learn, sooner or later, how to coexist with nature and with animals,"" she says.

""Aboriginal people have been doing it a long, long time.""

570,"E coli from meat behind half a million UTIs in the US every year, study suggests","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/23/e-coli-meat-half-a-million-uti-urniary-tract-infection-us","E coli from meat behind half a million UTIs in the US every year, study suggests

Fatal bloodstream illnesses driven by urinary tract infections could rise, warn scientists as research shows link to food-borne bacteria


Meat bacteria are the likely cause of over half a million urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the US every year, a new study has found, with one of its authors warning that deaths from UTI-driven bloodstream infections could be on the rise.

The study found that of the 6-8m UTIs caused by E coli bacteria in the US every year, between 480,000 and 640,000 could be linked to strains known as FZECs, or food-borne zoonotic E coli. Women are far more likely than men to suffer from UTIs. The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) estimates that about half of all women in the UK will have at least one UTI in their lifetime.

""People are carrying the strain of E coli that causes the UTI in their gut, so the bacteria has travelled from the anus [into the urinary tract to cause the infection],"" said Lance Price, one of the study's authors and a professor specialising in antibiotic resistance at the George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health in Washington DC.

However, he added: ""Our question was: how did the E coli that caused the UTI get into the gut in the first place?"" Whether the food-borne E coli are found on plant or meat products, their source is generally livestock, Price said.

While UTIs are often considered no more than a painful annoyance, Price said the bladder can act as a gateway to the bloodstream for E coli, via the kidneys, causing much greater risks. In the US, E coli bloodstream infections kill between 36,000 and 40,000 people every year. In the UK, BSAC describes UTIs as ""the leading source of bacterial bloodstream infections"" and a ""chronically neglected area of infectious diseases"".

Price warned that as E coli, already resistant to some antibiotic treatments, became resistant to more antibiotics, the number of people dying from bloodstream infections could rise. Reducing UTIs caused by meat-borne E coli strains would help reduce those deaths, he said.

For many people, Price said, the link between UTIs and meat was not ""as intuitive"" as other meat-related illnesses, mainly because there can be a long delay between the bacteria entering the body and a person developing a UTI.

Working in the small US town of Flagstaff, Arizona, Price and his team spent a year matching the UTI-causing E coli found in patients attending the local hospital, to that of E coli found in turkey, chicken and pork products sold in the area. The meats were chosen because they had been identified as most likely to carry the E coli that cause UTIs.

""Flagstaff was the perfect place,"" he said. ""We could go to the shops, buy the meat and then go to the local hospital and get all the UTI E coli samples and compare them."" The study used 1,188 human clinical urine and blood isolates taken at the hospital.

""At the end of the year we sequenced the E coli we'd collected, and because I learned that E coli adapt to different hosts - people, chickens, whatever - by pulling in packets of DNA, we could look at the DNA packets and work out their statistical relation to each host ""¦ [and then] we could estimate the proportion of UTI E coli coming from food animals.""

The Flagstaff study showed that 8% of the UTIs were caused by E coli from local meat samples. That, said Price, translates into a national figure in the US of 480,000 to 640,000 UTIs caused by E coli originating from those meats.

Asked about links between industrial farming and UTI-causing E coli found in meat, Price said the high densities of animals in indoor sheds had probably helped spread the risk of infection. ""When you are packing animals together very tightly, pigs or poultry, and buying them from same breeder, yes, the dangerous strain of E coli is going to spread very quickly.""

The strains spread between the animals would also have the opportunity ""to develop new characteristics that could cause worse disease and be more resistant to antibiotics"", he added.

One solution proposed by Price and his team is inoculating animals against the most dangerous strains of E coli to prevent the bacteria from entering the food chain in the first place. For poultry the vaccination could be at the egg stage.

Other routes would be limiting contact with meat products - and also following existing public health food preparation guidelines. These recommend workers wash their hands frequently and use different knives and chopping boards for meat products and for fruit and vegetables.

Although Price and his team found that some of the meat-borne UTI-causing E coli were resistant to antibiotic treatment - with 11% not responding to a trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole combination often used to treat UTIs - he said this was not a significant discovery as many E coli are already known to be antibiotic resistant in the US.

""In other countries, that might be different, though,"" Price said. His next goal is to use the team's methodology to look at antibiotic resistance to meat-borne E coli in other countries. Another study is already under way to examine the presence of UTI-causing E coli in beef.

Victorian grassland earless dragon was once common west of Melbourne but numbers declined due to habitat loss and predators such as feral cats

A tiny earless dragon feared to be extinct in the wild has been sighted for the first time in more than 50 years - at a location that is being kept secret to help preservation efforts.

The Victorian grassland earless dragon, Tympanocryptis pinguicolla, has now been rediscovered in the state, according to a joint statement issued by the Victorian and federal Labor governments on Sunday.

Sign up for Guardian Australia's free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup

The last confirmed sighting of the dragon was in the Geelong area in 1969. Once commonly found in native grasslands west of Melbourne, the reptile's numbers declined due to habitat degradation and fragmentation, inappropriate livestock grazing, and predators such as feral cats.

Ecologists had previously made ""considerable but unsuccessful efforts"" to locate the species in recent years. Zoos Victoria had been actively searching for the dragon since 2017.

The animal is listed as critically endangered under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act and the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.

The lizard lacks an external ear opening and functional ear drum, and measures about 15cm from head to tail when fully grown.

For conservation reasons, the state and federal governments have declined to reveal the location of the newly rediscovered population, but they say surveys are ongoing to better understand the site's population size.

The Victorian and federal governments will invest $188,000 in a trial of detection dogs to sniff out more populations of the dragon, which Tanya Plibersek, the federal environment minister, described as an ""effective and non-invasive way to find this highly cryptic and critically endangered lizard in the wild"".

Plibersek said in a statement: ""I want to protect our precious creatures for our kids and grandkids. It's such exciting news that the Victorian grassland earless dragon has been rediscovered. It's a reminder about why it's so important to invest in habitat restoration and the eradication of feral species like cats and foxes.""

Zoos Victoria is also establishing a conservation breeding program for the lizard.

Dr Jenny Gray, Zoos Victoria's chief executive, said in a statement: ""The extraordinary rediscovery of this critically endangered and cryptic lizard inspires optimism for the recovery of this Victorian species, and Zoos Victoria is proud to be lending years of expertise honed through the breeding recovery program at Melbourne Zoo for Canberra dragons.""

Several other species of earless dragon were previously erroneously classified as Tympanocryptis pinguicolla. However, research in recent years led to the discovery of five other distinct species, resulting in concerns for the fate of the true Victorian grassland earless dragon.

It is not the first time a Victorian species has returned from feared extinction after decades without being seen in the wild. The endangered Leadbeater's possum, for example, was presumed extinct by the early 1900s but was rediscovered 1961.

Global trade in chocolate, worth more than $1tn a year, is leading to widespread deforestation in Ivory Coast and Ghana

The world's hunger for chocolate is a major cause of the destruction of protected forests in west Africa, scientists have said.

Satellite maps of Ivory Coast and Ghana showed swathes of formerly dense forest had become cocoa plantations since 2000, according to a study.

It found cocoa production was linked to 360,000 of a total 962,000 hectares (37.4%) of the deforestation since 2000 of protected areas in Ivory Coast, and 26,000 out of a total 193,000 hectares (13.5%) of the deforestation of similar areas in Ghana.

The global trade in chocolate was estimated to be worth more than a trillion dollars last year. Cocoa, its most important ingredient, is produced from the seed of the tropical Theobroma cacao tree. It is native to South America, but most is now produced in Africa, with Ivory Coast and Ghana accounting for two-thirds of production.

An estimated 2 million farmers in west Africa, operating farms of an average of just three to four hectares each, rely on cocoa for their income - usually less than $1 a day. They supply a complex network of middlemen, including public and private companies, who connect them to the world market, making the supply chain opaque.

This obscurity has made cocoa production a haven for human rights abuses, and chocolate has long been linked to slavery. But the latest research also links the indulgent snack to the climate and biodiversity crises that risk the catastrophic breakdown of the planet's biosphere.

Like tropical regions, west Africa is rapidly losing its forests. Ivory Coast is estimated to have lost more than 90% since 1950, while Ghana is thought to have lost at least 65%. Cocoa production had been identified as one of the main causes of deforestation in both countries, alongside mining, selective logging and other agriculture, but the extent to which it bore responsibility was not certain.

An international team of researchers set out to accurately map the extent of cocoa cultivation in deforested areas using satellite imagery. They trained a neural network to scour the satellite imagery and identify cocoa plantations, double-checked their findings with teams on the ground in Ivory Coast and Ghana, then cross referenced them against areas mapped on the World Database of Protected Areas.

In total, the researchers found, cocoa was being grown on more than 1.5m hectares of protected areas across the two countries, including nearly 14% of Ivory Coast's protected areas and 5% of Ghana's. In some classified forest or forest reserve areas, close to four-fifths of land had been cleared to grow cocoa.

""The single most significant driver of deforestation in cocoa production is poverty,"" said Kwame Osei, the country director for Ghana and Nigeria for the Rainforest Alliance, which was not involved in the research. ""Cocoa farmers in west Africa receive a mere 6% of a chocolate bar's retail price. They are on the losing end of the supply chain, too, bearing the brunt of chronically low prices and with few opportunities to negotiate.

""Cocoa farmers are also on the front lines of the climate crisis, which leaves them vulnerable to drought, pests, and diseases that can decimate a harvest. In turn, land degradation often leads to the transformation of forest areas, including protected areas, into new cocoa plantations.""

Campaigners say Britain becoming ""˜toxic poster child of Europe' and accuse ministers of breaking Brexit promise on standards

The UK has failed to ban 36 pesticides that are not allowed for use in the EU, as campaigners say it is becoming the ""toxic poster child of Europe"".

Though ministers promised the UK would not water down EU-derived environmental standards after Brexit, there have been multiple instances of divergence since the country left the bloc.

Now, the country is failing to phase out pesticides that have been found to be harmful to human health and the environment at the same rate as the EU, according to research from Pesticide Action Network (PAN).

Thirteen of the 36 chemicals are considered highly hazardous pesticides under UN definitions used to identify the most harmful substances. Four of these are highly toxic to bees, one contaminates water and one is highly toxic to aquatic organisms.

Thirty of the 36 were allowed for use in the EU when the UK left on 31 January 2020 but have since been banned by the bloc, and the remaining six have been approved by the UK government but not the EU since then.

The UK government has given emergency authorisation every year since Brexit for the use of a neonicotinoid that is highly toxic to bees. In that time, the EU has banned emergency use of these chemicals.

Nick Mole, from PAN UK, said: ""The UK is becoming the toxic poster child of Europe. The government has repeatedly promised that our environmental standards won't slip post-Brexit. And yet here we are, less than four years later, and already we're seeing our standards fall far behind those of the EU. With UK bees and other pollinators in decline, and our waters never more polluted, now is the time to be taking steps to protect nature. Instead, the government is choosing to expose British wildlife to an ever-more toxic soup of chemicals.""

Of these chemicals, 12 have been classified as carcinogens, nine have been found to be endocrine disruptors, which interfere with hormones and are linked to infertility, and eight are developmental or reproductive toxins that have also been linked to fertility problems. Two are cholinesterase inhibitors that can impair the respiratory system, and one is classified as acutely toxic.

Researchers said the divergence was caused partly by a new UK licensing regime for these chemicals after the UK government decided to grant all pesticides with licences due to expire before December 2023 an automatic extension of three years. Previously, all pesticides had a maximum licence of 15 years before they had to be reapproved.

PAN is calling for the government to bring standards back in line with the EU to protect human health, the agriculture industry and the environment.

Mole said: ""The emerging gap between UK and EU pesticide standards is incredibly concerning for our human health and environmental protections, but also for the future of UK agriculture as our standards fall further and further behind those of our largest trading partner. UK food exports containing pesticides that EU growers aren't allowed to use, are likely to be rejected. Given that the EU still accounts for around 60% of UK agricultural exports, the impact on farmers could be devastating.""

A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: A Defra spokesperson said: ""Very strict regulation only permits the sale and use of pesticides where scientific assessment clearly shows they will not harm people or pose unacceptable risks to the environment. Pesticides have to be authorised for use on the market in Great Britain by our expert regulator, the Health and Safety Executive or by ministers, following those thorough scientific risk assessments. More widely, the Health and Safety Executive is developing a programme to review our pesticide approvals and can take action to review approval at any time if they identify serious concerns.""

Ken Beagley, who has died aged 71, was a puppeteer and educator. He was an excellent maker who always encouraged and involved others. He and I were friends and collaborators for nearly 40 years.

Born in Woking, Surrey, to Beryl (nee Mair), a housekeeper, and Frederick Beagley, a draughtsman, Ken attended Woking grammar school. He studied sculpture at Kingston Polytechnic (1971-74), where he met the artist Don Pavey with whom he later worked on Art Arena games - a team game format designed to develop social interaction and group skills by creating large works of art. At Kingston, Ken also discovered an abiding fascination with the labyrinth and he met Jill Betambeau, whom he married in 1975.

Ken was great at networking and making exciting projects happen. While an undergraduate, he organised many play schemes for local resident groups on the Tolworth estate in southwest London and, when he completed his degree, Kingston social services asked him to join their team of community workers.

In 1977, Jill and Ken, who led a self-sufficient lifestyle, and kept bees and chickens, moved to Bristol to qualify as teachers at the University of Bristol. There, Ken was a founding member of CoLignum, a successful carpentry cooperative, and their daughters, Melissa and Saffron, were born.

In 1985, along with other families from around the country, the Beagleys moved to Harberton in south Devon, seeking alternative education support - they called themselves ""the village group"". Ken and Jill started Armchair Puppet Theatre in 1988, which runs superb shadow puppet workshops all around Britain and creates shows with beautifully designed sets. Ken is also remembered for the phenomenal bonfire celebrations and lantern processions he organised in Harberton in the early 90s.

In 1989, he helped me create The Biggest Puppet Show on Earth, working with thousands of children. We also set up a company for participatory artists called The Moveable Feast Workshop Co (2002-12), and Ken was instrumental in founding Creation Myth Puppets (2014), which makes huge shows for schools nationally and internationally.

If Ken believed in a cause, his commitment was absolute. A keen beekeeper, he represented several beekeeping organisations at the national inquiry into GM crops in 2000, travelling to London with a bee puppet in the pocket of his suit. He was deeply involved in the Men's Movement, and was especially influenced by workshops with the poet Robert Bly - in 1985, Ken co-founded a Devon-wide men's group that is still going strong 30-plus years on.

From 2015, Ken and I ran labyrinth workshops in communities and schools, the first of which included making a community labyrinth high above Welcombe Bay, on the north coast of Devon. In 2021, when he was diagnosed with an incurable brain tumour, Ken deepened his investigations into the labyrinth. We discussed his insights across his last year and wrote a labyrinth novel as a legacy for our grandchildren.

Ken was a fighter for justice and a joy-bringer who shared his great imagination far and wide. He is survived by Jill, Melissa and Saffron, his grandchildren, Iris, Arthur, Miriam and Asher, and siblings, Mya and Tony.

Agreement between California, Arizona and Nevada will cut water consumption by 13% but experts warn river is still in serious peril

A hard-fought agreement between California, Arizona and Nevada to slash the states' use of the shrinking Colorado River is only a temporary salve to a long-term water crisis that continues to threaten the foundations of life in the American west, experts have warned.

The deal, announced on Monday, between the three states that make up the lower portion of the sprawling Colorado basin will pare back 13% of water consumption from the beleaguered river over the next three years if adopted, averting the prospect of more stringent cuts imposed by the federal government. Backed by $1.2bn in federal funds, the bulk of the reductions are structured to encourage voluntary cuts taken by rights holders, in exchange for grant money.

Now under federal environmental review, the agreement is being hailed as a breakthrough after months of stalled negotiations and missed deadlines. But the emergency intervention will not itself be enough to head off the existential crisis faced by the Colorado River, a result of decades of over-allocation to slake the thirst of a rapidly expanding US west, and it is now caught firmly in the teeth of global heating.

The flow of the river has declined by about 20% since the turn of the century, a period defined by a ""megadrought"" that is the most severe the west has seen in 1,200 years. The future of a river that supports 40 million people, underpinning the existence of cities from Los Angeles to Denver, and millions of acres of cropland remains precarious.

""This deal is clearly a Band-Aid solution for a short-term fix,"" said Katharine Jacobs, an expert in water and climate adaptation at the University of Arizona.

""It's better than nothing, but we are just putting off a much more dramatic change needed to resolve this problem. The problem we're trying to solve is just far greater than this. We have a significant shortfall between the river's supply and demand.""

Jacobs said it is ""almost unfortunate"" that the US west was deluged by a glut of snow and rainfall over the winter that eased some of the pressure on parched farmland and puddle-like reservoirs, taking some of the onus off negotiators from the seven states - which also include Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah - that rely upon the river to agree on more ambitious cuts to confront its long-term decline.

The cuts looked like they would be much tougher last summer, when the federal government said one-third of the river's annual average flow needed to be saved or it would step in to impose reductions itself.

The warning came as Lake Mead, the US's largest reservoir, which collects water behind the hulking art deco edifice of the Hoover dam, slumped to a record low level of 1,040ft, revealing dead bodies and sunken boats in its now-desiccated underbelly.

If the lake drops much further, it will not be able to generate the hydroelectric power that millions of people rely on. At an even lower point - 895ft - no water would be able to pass through the dam at all, a disastrous situation called ""dead pool"" which would essentially cut the water flow to California, Arizona and Nevada.

Scientists have warned that the flow of the river will come under increasing strain due to warming temperatures caused by the burning of fossil fuels, with more water evaporating in the heat and a shrinking of the Rocky Mountain snowpack that nourishes the river at its origins.

The whole basin, which stretches from Wyoming to northern Mexico, is going through a process of ""aridification"", in which a hotter, drier state prevails, rather than simply a drought, researchers have warned.

Even without the climate crisis, the Colorado River would probably be stressed. Its allocation is based upon a compact struck in 1922, an unusually wet year, which guaranteed highly optimistic levels of water to states based on a system of seniority (California has always been at the head of the queue).

The apportionment of 17.5m acre-feet of water (an acre-foot is the amount of water that would cover an acre, about the size of a football field, in foot-deep water) a year hasn't been met, on average, at all over the past century, and during the last two decades of severe drought the shortfall has been stark - less than 10m acre-feet, on average, has flowed through the river each year.

The lower-basin proposal shaves 3m acre-feet off the states' consumption but the mismatch in supply and demand remains glaring. ""This deal does not address the long-term water sustainability challenges in the region,"" Dave White, who specialises in water sustainability at Arizona State University, said.

The seven states and the federal government now face the unenviable task of forging a longer-term deal, to last beyond 2026, to bring some sort of stability to the system. Deeper questions may have to be asked about profitable but thirsty crops - like alfalfa - grown in the desert, or the booming levels of housing development happening in water-stressed states like Arizona.

Tempering the growth of the US west in an increasingly punishing climate will probably require fraught compromises, a slew of lawsuits and buckets of compensation - the latest deal will funnel more than $1bn to states, water districts and tribes to offset their lost water. Upper-basin states' desire to develop their water resource like lower-basin states will somehow have to be managed on a rapidly dwindling resource.

Farmers may be required to fallow land, or shift to different forms of irrigation or even switch crops, but this will require time and money, according to Sharon Megdal, a water policy expert at the University of Arizona.

""Our system requires compensation for taking of property or property rights. You can't just start with a blank piece of paper and redesign the system - we have to be mindful of that,"" she said.

""We need to get to an equilibrium where we use the amount of water nature is providing us. Three million acre-feet probably isn't enough of a cut but we just can't let the system crash. This deal at least buys us some time.""

In Grasse, droughts, heatwaves, and excessive rainfall have made growing flowers increasingly difficult

When heatwaves used to hit the French town of Grasse, the perfume capital of the world, townspeople didn't water their flowers. Instead, they marched along the town's cobblestone streets, in a procession towards the church.

""They were calling for rain from the spirits,"" says Carole Biancalana, a fourth-generation perfume flower producer whose grandmother participated in the rain ceremonies. ""But I don't think this procession would cut it in today's climate.""

Since the 17th century, Grasse has been known worldwide for its fragrant flowers. Situated just inland from the French Riviera, Grasse enjoys a microclimate that allows fields of may rose, tuberose, lavender and jasmine to blossom. Today, the region produces flowers for some of the world's biggest luxury brands, including Dior and Chanel, who spend significant amounts on raw materials from the region - Grasse's jasmine sells for a higher price than gold.

Around the world, Grasse's producers are recognised as leaders in the industry: in 2018, Unesco placed the region's perfume culture on its intangible cultural heritage list.

But climate change is threatening this tradition. Extreme weather patterns such as droughts, heatwaves, and excessive rainfall have made growing flowers increasingly difficult. Last summer, Grasse faced extreme droughts, resulting in some producers losing nearly half of their harvest. High temperatures affect the future quality of roses and prohibit some flowers, such as tuberose, from growing. Biancalana felt these impacts directly: this year, her tuberose harvest dropped by 40%.

""The elders here keep telling us there are no more seasons,"" says Biancalana, noting that winters are now warmer, with unseasonal cold spells in the spring. She jokes: ""We can't count on the spirits anymore.""

Grasse is not alone. Around the world, primary materials for perfumes are threatened by increasingly extreme weather patterns. Vanilla, a key material for the industry, has taken a particular hit. Grown primarily on the African continent, vanilla crops have been struck by heatwaves in recent years. In 2017, a cyclone in Madagascar destroyed 30% of crops, pushing the price to more than $600 (£502) a kilo.

""Climate change may not have an impact on the smell of perfume,"" says Benoit Verdier, the co-founder of the custom perfume house Ex Nihilo Paris. ""But it will affect the price.""

Ex Nihilo has watched the costs for raw materials like vanilla and saffron soar as a result of the limited supply caused by climate-induced droughts and disasters. Though they have not yet increased the price of their perfumes, rising costs for raw materials might force them to. As a result, they are considering turning towards synthetic alternatives.

""The romantic view of perfume is for it to be natural,"" says Verdier. ""There is mysticism around a place like Grasse, it gets people dreaming. But it isn't always more sustainable.""

Crops for perfumes require a lot of water and land. Shipping raw materials around the world also results in significant carbon emissions. ""It's more sustainable to make perfume in the laboratory,"" says Verdier.

Producers in Grasse disagree. ""We actually consume very little water,"" says Biancalana, noting that producers in the region use drip irrigation, which has historically accounted for only 5% of the region's water use.

Producers in the region have made significant efforts to ensure their crops are environmentally friendly. In 2006, Biancalana founded Les Fleurs d'Exception du Pays de Grasse, an association that brings together producers from the region. One of their key mandates is that all producers be organic to ensure the protection of biodiversity, which they believe is one of their greatest weapons against climate change.

""What can we do, how can we adapt, who should we ask for support, what research needs to be done?"" says Armelle Janody, the president of the association. ""These are the questions we are asking.""

But to find answers, the association needs support. Currently, there have been few scientific studies on how climate change is impacting crops in the region.

""We are observing changes but we do not have scientific studies on what is objectively happening,"" says Janody.

Leaders in the industry have already begun supporting local producers by investing in research and adaptation techniques, which they know is critical for their companies' futures. But while producers welcome this support, some are wary of the potential strings attached.

""The question for us is how to have industry support without losing our autonomy and sovereignty,"" says Janody, who fears companies could demand greater control over the means of production under the pretence of supporting climate adaptation.

""These brands want to associate their perfumes with our history and our heritage, yet they come in and want to change everything. We do not want to be servants to the industry.""

For producers, it's not just their agricultural practices that are at stake: it's their culture and way of life. The perfume industry has been at the beating heart of Grasse's identity for centuries. Since 1946, the town has paid tribute to the region's jasmine in an August ceremony that spans an entire weekend.

""This is so much more than just a job,"" says Biancalana, whose family has been working the same fields for more than a hundred years. ""We have a moral duty to our ancestors and to our territory. People here have always been ready to fight. That's not going to change because of climate change.""

Artificial intelligence has implication across the board, solving problems and raising others

The high profile race to enhance their search products has underscored the importance of artificial intelligence to Google and Microsoft - and the rest of the economy, too. Two of the world's largest tech companies announced plans for AI-enhanced search this month, ratcheting up a tussle for supremacy in the artificial intelligence space. However, the debut of Google's new chatbot, Bard, was scuppered when an error appeared, knocking $163bn (£137bn) off the parent company Alphabet's share price. The stock's plunge showed how crucial investors think AI could be to Google's future.

However, the increasing prominence of AI has implications for every corner of the economy. From retail to transport, here's how AI promises to usher in a wave of change across industries.

Farming

Monitoring weather patterns, managing pests and disease, working out the need for extra irrigation, or even which crops to grow where: many farmers believe agriculture is fertile ground for artificial intelligence.

Many food producers are using AI to collect and analyse data in their efforts to improve productivity and profitability.

AI's capacity for combining and analysing large datasets is already supplying farmers with real-time information on how to improve the health of their crops and increase yields. Drones and in-ground sensors can play a role in observing growing crops and soil conditions across hundreds of acres of land, including checking whether they need more water, fertiliser or herbicide and whether they are being affected by disease or destroyed by animals.

Ali Capper, who grows apples and hops at her family farm on the border of Herefordshire and Worcestershire, has invested in new technology, including automated orchard sprayers, to use alongside the digital soil mapping she has employed since 2017.

""Many agri-tech innovations will help us to be kinder to the farmed environment as well as more efficient and profitable,"" Capper said.

In the face of labour shortages, especially acute since Brexit, farmers have long hoped that advances in robotics - ""agribots"" - will help to make sure crops get picked on time. A lack of workers led to £60m of food wasted in 2022 alone, according to the National Farmers' Union.

While four-armed robots, designed for the delicate work of picking soft fruits, are being developed, robots with the dexterity of the human hand, capable of picking at speed without damaging fruit such as raspberries, may be a decade away from widespread use. Nonetheless, automation has already changed some of the most laborious jobs in farming, from drilling seeds to spraying and watering crops. Joanna Partridge

News media

Media companies have embraced machine learning to boost subscriptions and advertising and to help make decisions about what stories to promote.

News organisations are hiring data scientists on six-figure salaries to pull together data to track customers and guide them towards particular products, while also providing workers with tools to take the grunt work out of finding and writing stories.

Lisa Gibbs, the director of news partnerships at the Associated Press, said in a London School of Economics study that her organisation could ""find news faster and break news faster"" with the aid of AI.

Media organisations are using data analysts to create targeted content that generates higher subscriptions and advertising revenues.

Jane Barrett, the global news editor in Reuters' media strategy unit, told the LSE: ""AI will help us get exactly the right content to the right person."" Phillip Inman

Energy

There are possible AI applications in every corner of the energy
industry: from predicting and identifying faults at power plants to
using weather forecasts to plan offshore windfarm projects.

With tight margins in a sector where almost 30 companies have gone bust during the energy crisis, retail energy suppliers are expected to increase the use of AI to cut down call times. Chatbots are used to ask basic questions before customers speak to a human adviser.

Ultimately, suppliers envisage AI will play a central role in future ""smart grids"", allowing supply and demand to be more closely aligned, with a new generation of devices from smart meters and electric vehicles to solar panels and heat pumps able to improve efficiency. Jobs for engineers, meter readers and supply analysts are most under threat.

AI is also valuable to track carbon emissions. Boston Consulting Group has estimated that applying AI to multinational companies' sustainability plans could be worth $1.3tn to $2.6tn through additional revenues and cost savings by 2030. Late last year, the government launched a £1.5m programme to study the use of AI to reduce the UK's carbon emissions. Alex Lawson

Manufacturing

Manufacturing veterans know all too well how automation can sweep through an industry. In 2019, the UK's Office for National Statistics said almost two-thirds of metalworking machine operatives were at risk.

Part of the automation drive is for efficiency. Machine learning algorithms are already being deployed on the burgeoning piles of data produced within big factories for ""predictive maintenance"" - replacing parts before they fail and potentially requiring fewer technicians.

But the rapid rise of generative artificial intelligence suggests it will not only be people on factory lines who will be affected. Generative AI is already being used to design products much more quickly, test them virtually as a ""digital twin"", and manufacture them much more quickly. Combined with innovations such as 3D printing, this could lower development costs dramatically and would require fewer engineers in aerospace, automotive and consumer electronics.

One logical end is something like the Star Trek replicator, a bot that designs and makes whatever its user desires from a text prompt - without human involvement. Jasper Jolly

Government

Running the country means the government collects vast amounts of personal and business data, all of which could be plugged into artificial intelligence and machine learning systems to improve the efficiency of policymaking and delivery of services. Everything from bin collections, call centres and analysis of data to prioritise spending could be targeted for improvement. However, it is not without challenges and controversy - not least for how algorithms are held to account.

The former head of the civil service, Mark Sedwill, has said greater use of AI and automation will probably lead to a reduction in headcount.

Some councils are building computer models using personal data to help predict child abuse and intervene before it can happen, while Blackpool council is using AI-powered satellite images to help fix potholes.

There is concern in government that AI systems can build in human biases, risking the perpetuation of stereotypes and discrimination. Meanwhile, relying on computer models has stoked fear in the past that some public priorities are overlooked, including investment in the north of England and green projects.

More use of AI could improve efficiency but authorities will need to carefully check its effects. As the postwar US president Harry Truman said: ""When you have an efficient government, you have a dictatorship."" Richard Partington

Transport

Transport workers have stubbornly held on to their jobs since the first driverless trains were tested on the tube - a development that was met with ""Robots take over"" headlines six decades ago. However, they are still regarded as most vulnerable in the long term, according to a 2021 report by PwC for the business department forecasting that proportionately the biggest job losses in the next 20 years would come in the transport sector.

Nonetheless, drivers are far from expendable, and are demanding high salaries whether operating HGVs, buses or trains - even as the first autonomous buses are trialled in Scotland and Milton Keynes. Recent dreams of imminent robotaxis have yet to become widespread reality, and Uber says its London drivers earn £34 an hour. Pilotless planes are technically possible, although few might fancy them after Boeing's software-led 737 Max disasters.

Transport for London uses AI to help traffic flow and forecast disruption, while train operators have used simulators or digital twins to check train paths, platforms and timetables. The Rail Safety and Standards Board is working with academics to use machine learning from high-resolution video to tackle leaves on the line. Similar AI and video projects in Australia could teach driverless trains to recognise a green light - or whether the movement on a remote track is an encroaching human or a nearby kangaroo.

But the next iterations of AI could be profoundly political, as the current rail dispute in Great Britain underlines. Network Rail is hoping to shed more than 1,000 jobs, arguing that automation could create a more efficient and safe inspection regime by using data to predict faults. Gwyn Topham

Financial services

The financial services sector is at greater risk of job losses from AI than other sectors, according to government forecasts, but experts say this is partly a matter of catch-up.

""Other industries have already made these cuts,"" said Sarah Kocianski, an independent fintech consultant.

For example, banks and wealth managers will need fewer staff to onboard new clients as they automate more of their customer background checks and will rely more heavily on AI to detect and flag potential fraud and money-laundering risks.

They will also be able to feed new guidelines from regulators into those machine learning programmes, to flag any potential breaches or shortfalls in the company's systems, rather than relying on humans to conduct an initial review.

But these systems will still require human oversight, not only to build and programme the technology but also to conduct additional checks and sort out more complex problems.

""A critical risk is that firms succumb to the temptation to trust AI to make smarter lending or insurance decisions without understanding the reasoning process, and over-rely on the AI system without properly stress-testing its fitness for purpose,"" said Karishma Brahmbhatt, a data and technology lawyer at Allen & Overy.

Alongside booming demand for tech staff to build and monitor AI programmes, firms will be competing for higher-skilled staff who can do forensic work if they suspect fraud or error, or provide bespoke support to customers. ""You need more tailored people but you need fewer people,"" Kocianski said. Kalyeena Makortoff

Retail

Almost a third of retail jobs could be displaced by technology by 2030 compared with 2017 levels, as automated tills, warehouse robotics and AI-based planning tools affect the UK's biggest employer.

The most obvious change to any shopper is the rise in the use of self-checkouts and self-scanning systems in supermarkets in the last five years. Change was supercharged by the pandemic when labour became more expensive and difficult to find while shoppers became wary of interactions with staff.

Analysts at the advisory firm McKinsey have predicted that the number of cashiers could almost halve between 2017 and 2030 as these technologies are rolled out. Bryan Roberts at the industry body IGD said the majority of sales in most UK supermarkets are now rung up on self-scanning or automated tills.

The rise of labour costs has also led non-food retailers to give the technology a go. The Japanese-owned clothing chain Uniqlo introduced a system linked to radio frequency identification tags a few years ago.

The next step is the checkout-free store, led by Amazon Fresh, where cameras and shelf sensors mean that shoppers' purchases are automatically registered on an app on their phone enabling them to just walk out and pay later.

Technology doesn't stop at the till. Retailers are experimenting with robotic or AI-powered systems to spot gaps on shelves - with Marks & Spencer trialling a system that uses fixed cameras. Others have experimented with Dalek-type machines that cruise up and down the aisles.

Electronic labels on shelves, so prices can be changed automatically from head office, alongside AI-led technology to guide buying decisions and more robotics to pick and pack products in warehouses will also affect thousands of jobs. Sarah Butler

Examination of trees alive at the time shows three years of severe drought that may have caused crop failures and famine

Researchers have offered new insight into the abrupt collapse of the ancient Hittite civilization, with an examination of trees alive at the time showing three consecutive years of severe drought that may have caused crop failures, famine and political-societal disintegration.

Around 1200 BC, human civilization experienced a harrowing setback with the near-simultaneous demise or diminishment of several important empires in the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean region, an event called the Bronze Age collapse.

One of the mightiest to perish was the Hittite empire, centered in modern Turkey and spanning parts of Syria and Iraq.

""There was likely near-complete crop failure for three consecutive years. The people most likely had food stores that would get them through a single year of drought. But when hit with three consecutive years, there was no food to sustain them,"" Brita Lorentzen, a University of Georgia anthropology professor and study co-author, said.

""This would have led to a collapse of the tax base, mass desertion of the large Hittite military and likely a mass movement of people seeking survival. The Hittites were also challenged by not having a port or other easy avenues to move food into the area,"" Lorentzen added.

The Hittites, with their capital Hattusa situated in central Anatolia, were one of the ancient world's great powers across five centuries. They became the main geopolitical rivals of ancient Egypt during its glittering New Kingdom period.

""In pre-modern times, with none of our infrastructure and technology, the Hittites controlled and ruled a huge region for centuries despite myriad challenges of space, threats from neighbors and entities incorporated into their empire, and despite being centered in a semi-arid region,"" said Cornell University professor of arts and sciences in classics Sturt Manning, lead author of the research published in the journal Nature.

Scholars long have pondered what triggered the fall of the Hittites and broader collapse that also devastated kingdoms in Greece, Crete and the Middle East while weakening the Egyptians. Hypotheses have included war, invasion and climate change. The new study offers some clarity about the Hittites.

The researchers examined long-lived juniper trees that grew in the region at the time and eventually were harvested to build a wooden structure south-west of Ankara around 748 BC that may have been the burial chamber for a relative of Phrygia's King Midas, who legend holds turned anything he touched into gold.

The trees offered a regional paleoclimatic record in two ways: patterns of annual tree-ring growth, with narrow rings indicating dry conditions; and the ratio of two forms, or isotopes, of carbon in the rings, revealing the tree's response to water availability.

They detected a gradual shift to drier conditions from the 13th century BC into the 12th century BC. More importantly, both lines of evidence indicated three straight years of severe drought, in 1198, 1197 and 1196 BC, coinciding with the known timing of the empire's dissolution.

Hattusa, enclosed by a monumental stone wall with gates adorned with lions and sphinxes, was burned and abandoned. Texts written on clay tablets using the cuneiform script common in the region - detailing Hittite society, politics, religion, economics and foreign affairs - went silent.

""I think this study really shows the lessons we can learn from history. The climate changes that are likely to occur for us in the next century will be much more severe than those the Hittites experienced,"" Cornell professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and study co-author Jed Sparks said. ""And it begs the questions: what is our resilience? How much can we withstand?""

When my country, Pakistan, flooded last year, women faced particular suffering. That's true around the world

Last summer, a third of Pakistan was underwater. My country, the fifth most populous in the world, was submerged. Two million homes were destroyed, thousands of acres of agricultural land were flooded and 90% of the crops in Sindh, a food belt, were damaged. Thousands of kilometres of roads were rendered unusable, a million livestock killed, hospitals and schools obliterated, and 30 to 50 million people - a number as large as the population of Canada or Spain - were displaced and dispossessed.

It was the climate crisis that brought this nightmare to Pakistan. Pakistan has the second largest number of glaciers after the Arctic poles and thanks to global heating, they are melting at unprecedented, unmanageable speeds. Glacial melt combined with another consequence of the Earth's warming climate, erratic monsoon patterns, and together they created what was called a super-flood.

What happened in Pakistan last summer was only a teaser. The IPCC report noted that extreme weather events are ""increasingly driving displacement"" of people across the global south. But drought, floods and fire will come for the north, too - it is only a matter of time.

I am from Pakistan, I was born in Kabul and I am half Afghan. My grandmother was from Iran and I grew up in Damascus, Syria. I am a Muslim woman; I was born and raised across the Muslim world and Asia. There is no more urgent fight for women right now than that of climate. The crisis will affect women more than everything else in the world - more than abortion rollbacks, more than oppressive governments, more than lower pay grades. Already, 80% of people displaced by the climate crisis globally are women. Climate justice is a global feminist issue. There is no greater feminist cause today than saving the planet and each other.

Water Aid, a not-for-profit organisation, estimated that while Pakistan's super-floods had been impressively democratic in the havoc they wrought, by any metric it was women who suffered the most. Nearly 700,000 pregnant women in Pakistan were deprived of maternal healthcare during the floods. They had no support for themselves and their newborns, no food, no security, no basic medical care. Miscarriages rose drastically during the floods. Besides anxiety and trauma, girls with their periods had no menstrual care, and an estimated 70% of women in flood-affected areas suffered UTIs from lack of access to bathrooms and from using dirty fabric in the place of clean pads. The climate emergency will affect the rich, the poor, the educated, the illiterate, the urban, the rural, the beautiful, the brave, the lonely, but it will be women and girls across the global south who will bear the biggest burden.

Women and children are 14 times more likely to die during a disaster, according to at least one study. One reason is that they are often the group with the most limited resources at hand during an emergency. But besides that, the threat of sexual violence shoots up during extreme weather events - the United Nations found that with drought in Uganda came rising rates of domestic violence and sexual abuse. Floods in Pakistan and cyclones in Bangladesh brought not only maternal health crises but also increased violence towards women. And yet 0.01% of global funding is spent on initiatives that touch women and climate change. I dread to think how little attention we devote to the issue.

Afghanistan, already ravaged by war and occupation, also suffered flash floods last summer. Today 95% of the country does not have enough food to eat and Afghans are facing a hunger crisis of ""unparalleled proportions"", according to UN representatives. Those same representatives pointed out that almost 100% of women-led households were experiencing dire hunger.

Climate change is such a soft word for the horrors that await us. They called it climate change on purpose to defang it, to make it seem less frightening, less urgent a battle. Frank Lutz, the Republican strategist and pollster who advised George W Bush's administration to move away from the more worrisome ""global warming"" and adopt the completely antiseptic ""climate change"" now concedes that he was wrong to do so, acknowledging the need for different language to address the urgency of the matter, though the damage is already done. The Guardian updated its style guide three years ago, now generally using ""climate crisis"", ""climate emergency"" or ""climate breakdown"", though in light of recent reports we need even more radical names and weapons to fight the calamity at hand. This week, the IPCC released a ""final warning"" on the climate crisis. The world's leading climate scientists are urging radical and immediate action in the face of mounting greenhouse gas emissions that will end life on earth as we know it.

Soon everywhere in the world will be on fire. Or flooded. Or starving or thirsty. And if the global south is not sexy enough as a movement - after all, the climate catastrophe will not have a catchy hashtag - then there are plenty of other examples.

The fires in Australia in 2020 killed or harmed 3 billion animals. It has been called one of the worst wildlife disasters in modern history. When wildlife disappears, the world doesn't just lose life, it is deprived of splendour and innocence. When animals are endangered, when they lose their habitats, when they come under massive physiological stress, they get sick. When they get sick, we get sick. We get pandemics. The damage is endless. This month, researchers found that the smoke from those Black Summer bushfires depleted the ozone layer by up to 5%.

For 44 years, scientists have tracked Antarctic sea ice. This month, Antarctic sea levels have dropped to the lowest levels ever recorded. And yet, while climate breakdown is bringing terrifying destruction all across the world, Saudi Aramco - the world's largest oil company - recorded profits of $161bn in 2022, the largest annual profit ever recorded by any oil and gas company. Its windfall rose by nearly 50%, making the Saudi-owned company more money than Shell, BP, Exxon and Chevron combined. Climate justice is not just a feminist issue, it is an existential one. It is quite literally the fight of our lives. And we are running dangerously out of time.

As Mike Davis, the ""prophet of doom"", said before he died last year: ""Despair is useless. What keeps us going, ultimately, is our love for each other, and our refusal to bow our heads, to accept the verdict, however all-powerful it seems. It's what ordinary people have to do. You have to love each other. You have to defend each other. You have to fight.""

Oronsay, Argyll and Bute: The whelks, winkles and limpets brought people here in the first place, and create the stunning white beaches

It's a curious sensation, cycling over the seabed, but it's a neat way to reach the tidal island of Oronsay. I study the wet sand beneath my wheels. Human history is long in this remote corner of the Hebrides and has always turned on the tide. Sea blends into rocky shore in a convoluted landscape where every few metres perspectives change. It's like inhabiting a child's kaleidoscope, a shifting and wholly absorbing picture framed against today's clear blue sky.

The focus on Oronsay is its long-defunct priory, emptied in the Reformation, and the grand farmhouse next door. Both are tucked against the island's highest hill, mighty Beinn Orasaigh. There are a handful of permanent inhabitants and this is where they live, marooned twice a day. The walls of the priory remain, a chapel and barn, and an elegant colonnade. In front of the priory, pasture stretches evenly towards the coast. The shellfish that create the island's stunning white beaches have also rewarded Oronsay with a calcareous substrate that grass relishes. The RSPB manages the land here in a canny balance of livestock farming and conservation; there's a rare colony of choughs and corncrakes to protect.

It was the shellfish that first brought humans here. Oronsay is famous for its five middens (heaps) of shells and fish bones dating back 6,000 years to the Mesolithic. One is located close by the priory. Every winter, for several centuries, when the fish moved offshore, the original islanders camped here, collecting shellfish to eat and tossing the remains on to growing piles. Limpets were favourite - like chewing a pencil eraser, but more nutritious than whelks or periwinkles. Archaeologists have found the pieces of deer antler - probably from nearby Jura or Islay - that these pioneers used to chisel the meat from its shelter.

Outside the priory is a weathered cross, more than 600 years old, broken and later reassembled: faith setting stones against the world's turning. The rock is rough and weathered from numberless gales; you can't help but run your hands across it. And from the apex of the priory itself, perched high above the ground, is a wren, king of the birds, belting out its life song in spite of time.

Case brought under Bern convention on nature may set precedent for destruction of biodiversity in war

Azerbaijan has launched a landmark legal challenge against Armenia for allegedly destroying its environment and biodiversity during nearly three decades of occupation of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region.

An international tribunal will consider evidence of widespread environmental destruction during the conflict between the two nations, including deforestation and pollution, and will be asked to order Armenia to pay reparations.

It is the first time any country has sought inter-state arbitration under the Bern convention. If Azerbaijan wins, it will set a precedent for putting an economic value on biodiversity and environmental destruction.

War erupted between Armenia and Azerbaijan in the early 1990s, when the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave moved to declare independence as the Soviet Union collapsed. Armenian forces won the war and governed the territory for nearly three decades until most of it was captured in a major Azeri offensive in September 2020.

Azerbaijan says that when the territories were retaken it found habitats and species had been harmed, natural resources depleted, and biodiversity destroyed.

The lawsuit is part of a wider diplomatic conflict between the two states. Azerbaijan occupies a key strategic point between Europe and Asia in geopolitical terms, but is also a biological crossroads for plant and animal species.

According to Azerbaijan's ecology and natural resources ministry, mining during the occupation damaged much of the forests, which are a biodiversity hotspot, home to rare, endangered and endemic species including the Caucasian leopard, brown bear, grey wolf, as well a the greater spotted and steppe eagles.

The ministry said more than 7,000 hectares (17,000 acres) of protected forests were damaged. Some of these reserves were established to protect rare and fragile ecosystems, such as an oriental plane forest in the Basitchay River valley.

Ancient trees in the war zone, some 2,000 years old, were reportedly cut down. As well as having an important role in regulating microclimates and conserving biodiversity, these trees are culturally important.

A UN Environment Programme report written last year for Azerbaijan found serious damage to valuable farmland and water-management systems. It outlined evidence that coal mining at Chardaghli and quarrying took place without proper environmental controls, raising the risk of chemical pollution and cave-ins.

Landmines remain a problem and have killed livestock and wildlife, as well as sparking fires. Heavy metals and residues from explosives contaminate soil and water.

But UNEP also found that road-building begun in January 2021 as part of Azerbaijan's reconstruction programme also reduced forest cover. And the report said biodiversity may have actually benefited during the war, re-establishing itself around abandoned settlements.

Azerbaijan claims Armenia violated its obligations under the Bern convention to maintain all wild flora and fauna, to ensure habitats are conserved and restored, and to protect specific species, including migratory ones.

""Instead of preserving biodiversity and the environment during its illegal occupation, Armenia destroyed them,"" said Elnur Mammadov, a deputy foreign minister and Azerbaijan's representative in the arbitration.

He said Azerbaijan had tried for more than 18 months to resolve the dispute diplomatically. ""Regrettably, Armenia has stonewalled and ultimately ignored Azerbaijan's efforts. We have therefore been left with no choice but to bring these proceedings to hold Armenia to account for its irresponsible damage to the environment.""

A spokesperson on international legal matters within the Armenian prime minister's office said:

""Armenia is committed to the protection and conservation of the environment and will continue to comply with its obligations under international environmental instruments, including the Bern Convention""¤""

The legal challenge, part of a wider trend in biodiversity litigation, is the first known case to test the Bern convention. Zaneta Sedilekova, a lawyer at the London-based firm Clyde & Co, said it provided a unique example of a challenge to vast biodiversity destruction by an occupying state that affects healthy ecosystem services to people.

""Although premised on the fact of illegal occupation, and thus difficult to translate into a different context, it points towards an increasing appreciation by states of the irreplaceable value of biodiversity-rich, balanced and healthy ecosystems,"" she said.

Concern about environmental destruction in wartime and understanding of its complex effects is growing. In December, the UN general assembly agreed 27 legal principles for protecting the environment during armed conflict and occupation, including on corporate conduct and the use of natural resources.

Both countries now have three months to appoint arbitrators who will consider evidence of any damage and decide whether and how much Armenia must pay in reparations. As a signatory to the Bern convention, Armenia is legally bound to respect the ruling.

""If Azerbaijan succeeds in its case, this will be the first time that an arbitral tribunal allocates damages for environmental destruction and, very likely, assesses the economic value of biodiversity loss and decline in ecosystem services on a particular area, and to a particular nation,"" said Sedilekova.

""Such a precedent could have a profound impact on how state and non-state actors perceive the cost of biodiversity loss and, possibly, accelerate protection, conservation and restoration of biodiversity.""

As well as seeking compensation, Azerbaijan wants the tribunal to order Armenia to stop ongoing activities that it says continue to damage the enivronment. Analysis of the Okhchuchay River by Azerbaijan in 2021 showed extremely high concentrations of heavy metals, including cadmium, lead, nickel, iron, molybdenum and zinc in water and sediment. Azerbaijan says several protected fish and amphibian species are threatened and claims the problem is caused by wastewater from copper and molybdenum mines upstream in Armenia, as well as domestic effluent.

The UNEP report noted that contamination of the Okhchuchay had long been a concern in Armenia. It said Armenian environmental and civil society organisations had regularly ""expressed alarm over the river's contamination with heavy metals and other pollutants, and research by Armenian scientists has revealed worsening conditions"".

Communities in Ngorongoro say government is shutting down vital services to remove them from ancestral lands to expand lucrative game reserves

Late last year, William Ole Seki, a Maasai elder, ascended to the top of a dry, grassy Tanzanian hillside where about a dozen Maasai had gathered. From there, Ngorongoro conservation area's 2m acres (809,000 hectares) of woodland and plains expand to the horizon in every direction. Cattle and zebras graze on dry tufts of grass, near to small clusters of bomas (traditional Maasai houses).

To the south, a road sweeps Toyota Land Cruisers carrying tourists to the gates of the Serengeti national park. In the distance looms the Ol Doinyo Lengai, the Mountain of God, a sacred place of worship for the Maasai, a semi-nomadic pastoralist ethnic group who live in Tanzania and Kenya.

Ole Seki points out where the construction of new school bathrooms has been halted since the government banned imports of building materials into the area. Just beyond that, he can point to the region's only hospital, which is under threat of closure. Further to the north, Ole Seki says, are two villages that have been without water for weeks.

""This is really becoming a war zone,"" he says.

For decades, Maasai communities adjacent to the park in northern Tanzania have faced eviction attempts to make way for a game reserve and, the government says, help protect the environment.

In 2017, in Loliondo, about 100 miles (160km) north of Ngorongoro conservation area, government security forces burned 185 Maasai houses along the park border in what rights groups called a forced act of eviction. The government said the houses were built inside the park, a claim upheld by the east African court of justice. Similar eviction attempts were made in 2003 and 2007, according to Joseph Oleshangay, a lawyer with the Legal and Human Rights Centre, Tanzania's human rights advocacy organisation. Last year, Maasai communities in Loliondo protested when police began demarcating 580 square miles (1,500 sq km) of their land for a game reserve. According to witnesses, police opened fire, stole cattle, and destroyed property. One police officer died, more than 30 Maasai were injured, and thousands fled into Kenya.

In Ngorongoro, a type of protected area created in 1959 that allows tourism and grants Maasai communities and their cattle permanent residence, the approach has been less confrontational. Human rights lawyers and Maasai leaders allege that the government is using a quieter, more tactful approach to force about 70,000 people out of their homelands by cutting off access to water, healthcare and education. Meanwhile, the government is offering a troubled relocation scheme to move Maasai ""volunteers"" to resettlement sites in Msomera, in Handeni district, and Kitwai, in Simanjiro district, both several hundred miles away.

""The government is trying to suffocate the communities and make the situation uncomfortable for them,"" says Denis Moses Oleshangai, a human rights lawyer at the Ramat and Jad Law Point law firm. ""This is a war on the Maasai.""

In April 2021, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority, which manages the land, released a 30-day eviction notice to 45 people living in the area. The authority identified an additional 166 ""immigrants"" illegally living there who would later be targeted for eviction, according to the Oakland Institute, a US thinktank. The agency called for more than 100 homes, churches, schools, medical dispensaries and administrative offices, including a police station, to be destroyed within 30 days of the order because they were built without permits, the agency claimed, even though some of the buildings were decades old, according to locals. After protests from the Maasai communities, the authority suspended the evictions and demolitions.

In March 2022, Ngorongoro district council sent two notices, seen by the Guardian, to six public schools ordering them to transfer nearly 200m Tanzanian shillings (£70,000) in Covid relief funds to the Handeni resettlement site. Government funds to build or renovate schools and improve water supply have been halted.

Since September 2022, two wards - Ngorongoro and Misigiyo - have had no access to water, according to a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Farmers claim that about 100 cattle had died as a result.

In October, the Ngorongoro health officials convened staff at Endulen hospital - largely financed by the Catholic church and the only hospital providing comprehensive medical services to Maasai living in the conservation area - and ordered them to reduce staffing from approximately 60 to 17 and downgrade their status from health centre to clinic, permitting provision of basic primary care and pharmacy services only, according to hospital staff who attended the meeting. Although staff numbers have been cut, the hospital continues to provide all regular medical services.

Human rights activists say the government's actions represent obvious efforts to make the conservation area uninhabitable. ""Shutting down vital services such as a hospital, severe restrictions on livelihoods ""¦ [this] basically creates a scenario where people would be better to pick up and leave,"" says Anuradha Mittal, the Oakland Institute's executive director.

A representative from the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority's public relations unit denied accusations that basic public services were being withheld.

""Under no circumstance can any government create such kind of tension or commotion. All services are still fully available to all the people. That would be so inhumane,"" said the representative. ""Any move in terms of resettlement of anybody is strictly voluntary. Nobody has been forced out of Ngorongoro. For those who are not willing to leave nobody has evacuated or evicted them.""

Ole Seki shakes his head at this response. ""How are people willing to move out if actually you've simply taken away life support systems that make these people [move] who are already so impoverished? The government is going to the international community saying they are not coercing us and indeed they do, but then we don't have a way to counter what the government is doing because our word cannot get out. Their lies are so bad. We just cannot continue to take it.""

While reducing public services in the conservation area, the government is building about 100 new homes and more than 15 classrooms in Handeni. But there are problems with the resettlement plan. For one, although the government agreed not to relocate any Maasai until construction was complete and water and electricity services were available, an estimated 250 people have already relocated to Handeni. Maasai leaders say there is not sufficient water or land for livestock as much of the land is covered in trees and non-edible foliage.

The resettlement sites are already inhabited by communities who were not approached by the government before relocation activities began, the Oakland Institute reported. Clashes between existing tenants and new arrivals have already begun, says Mittal, and are expected to worsen as resources for livestock become scarcer.

""I don't know who they are trying to hoodwink,"" says Mittal. ""Sitting in the capital of Tanzania they can convince donor countries and ambassadors that everything is fine, but the communities have been rising up and speaking out and sending letters. It is nothing else but just government lies to fool people and fool the outsiders.""

The government claims the Maasai and their herds are expanding and now represent a threat to conservation in Ngorongoro and the wider Serengeti ecosystem, home to a high concentration of endangered species including the black rhinoceros, elephant, wild dog and cheetah.

But the Maasai insist they have always lived in harmony with nature. Scientists and conservation experts agree. Last year, more than 275 researchers from around the world signed an open letter calling for a halt to eviction efforts.

Ole Seki and others suspect the government's goal is to make way for game reserves, as they are working to do in Loliondo, and expand the lucrative tourism sector.

""It's all about money. Dirty money,"" Ole Seki says.

Terms such as ""˜steak', ""˜grill' and ""˜spare ribs' to be removed from plant-based foods if agriculture ministry's decree is accepted by EU

France's long-running battle over vegan food names has escalated as the government published a decree banning meaty terms such as ""steak"", ""grill"" or ""spare ribs"" being used to describe plant-based products.

Marc Fesneau, the French agriculture minister, said the new government decree on products such as ""vegan ham"" or ""plant-based steak"" was about helping shoppers and ""an issue of transparency and honesty responding to the legitimate expectations of consumers and producers"".

But some vegans and animal rights groups said it showed that the French government was favouring the meat industry. French farmers and meat companies have long complained that customers are unjustly confused by the notion of vegetarian ""meat"".

France remains a predominantly meat-eating nation and is the European country with the highest beef and veal consumption per inhabitant.

According to an Ifop poll in 2020, fewer than 1% of the French population is vegan, and the word ""vegan"" itself had become laden with negative political associations amid rows over activism against butcher shops.

About 24% of French people identify as flexitarian and are cutting down on meat., but studies have shown that sales of vegan products in French supermarkets, including fake meat, are less than in neighbouring countries, such as the UK.

France last year became the first country in the EU to attempt to issue a decree protecting meaty words against use by plant-based products. But the government's first decree was considered too vague and was suspended by France's top administrative court, the council of state. The court has asked for guidance from the European court of justice before making its final ruling at a later date.

But the agriculture ministry has instead gone ahead and prepared a new decree, which it says takes into account the judges' complaints.

The draft decree, which applies only to products made and sold in France, not European imports, bans a list of 21 meat names to describe protein-based products, including ""steak"", ""escalope"", ""spare ribs"", ""ham"" or ""butcher"".

More than 120 other meat-associated names such as ""cooked ham"", ""poultry"", ""sausage"", ""nugget"" or ""bacon"" will still be authorised but only if the products do not exceed a certain amount of plant proteins, with percentages ranging between 0.5% and 6%. This would effectively mean that products marketed with labels such as vegan bacon or vegan cocktail sausages would have to change their name.

The decree has been submitted to the European Commission for checking against its detailed food labelling rules.

Guillaume Hannotin, a lawyer for the Proteines France organisation representing makers of vegan and vegetarian alternatives, said the term ""plant-based steak"" had been in use for more than 40 years.

He told AFP that France's new decree still contravened EU regulation on labelling for the products, which - unlike milk - lack a strict legal definition and can be referred to by terms in popular use.

Brigitte GothiÃ¨re, of the French animal rights' group L214, tweeted that the decree was an example of ""manipulation"", calling the French agriculture ministry ""the ministry of meat"". She said: ""Do people confuse motor oil, olive oil and jojoba oil? I think not. No more than they confuse vegan steak from beef steak.""

She told Europe 1 radio that the decree was ""scandalous"".

Charlotte Minvielle, of the French Green party Europe Ã‰cologie Les Verts, tweeted that the government had made a priority of ""defending the meat lobby"".

Catherine HÃ©layel, from the Animalist party, tweeted that rather than attacking words, the government should focus on animal and human suffering as well as the climate crisis and the impact of animal farming.

The decree will come into force three months after publication to give operators time to adapt their labelling. It also leaves open the possibility for manufacturers to sell all product stocks labelled before it comes into force, at the latest one year after publication.

A pilot program by the agriculture department in 2013 detected chemicals not found by the wholesalers' system

The pesticide testing Australia relies on to pick up chemicals in fresh fruit and vegetables sold domestically routinely picked up far fewer breaches than a government study in 2013.

Unpublished results of a 2013 pilot study for a national produce monitoring system (NPMS) by the federal agriculture department have been revealed under freedom of information laws.

The study was shelved by the former Coalition government despite some disturbing findings.

Testing of strawberries revealed samples with up to 90 times the maximum residue limit (MRL) set for dimethoate, while one apricot and nine peach samples contained levels of the now-withdrawn pesticide fenthion that were ""unacceptable from an acute or short term dietary risk perspective"".

The study also looked at the adequacy of the self-regulatory system run by the fruit and vegetable wholesalers, known as FreshTest.

The federal government runs a national residue survey that checks pesticides in exported meat and some fruits, but surveillance of food sold in Australia is left to the industry.

Under FreshTest growers are tested once a year as part of their food certification. They know when they will be tested and provide the sample to FreshTest.

In contrast, the department's 2013 pilot on strawberries, peaches and apricots involved randomly buying growers' produce at the wholesale markets in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Adelaide, without notice.

The department found many more violations of the MRL than FreshTest over the same period.

The department also detected agricultural chemicals that were not found at all by FreshTest.

In the peach and apricot survey, FreshTest found one sample over the MRL for dimethoate out of eight detections of that chemical. The departmental survey found four samples over the MRL out of five detections.

In the case of fenthion, which has now been withdrawn from use in Australia, FreshTest detected 32 instances and no violations. The department found 66 detections and 12 violations.

The FreshTest survey did not detect any samples with thiabendazole. The department survey found three, all over the limit.

The documents note that the discrepancies are not surprising, given the different sampling methods. FreshTest gives growers notice of when they will be tested, allowing them to potentially reduce their pesticide use and adhere to withholding periods.

In relation to apricots the department wrote: ""There were clearly big differences, the most striking being dithiocarbamates being detected at a high rate in the NPMS survey, but not at all in the Farm-Fresh survey. This difference is highly significant. The other differences are much weaker.""

Gail Woods, the general manager of Fresh Markets Australia, which runs FreshTest, said the information in the NPMS related to processes that were in place over a decade ago.

""FreshTest® is an independent fee based, commercial service offered by Fresh Markets Australia (FMA) to provide chemical residue and microbial testing for industry,"" she said.

""FreshTest® only uses NATA (National Authorities Testing Australia) accredited laboratories of which there are a number across Australia offering residue testing.

""The integrity of the test is of utmost importance to FMA, and it is underpinned by a strict regime of collection, sample identification, labelling and reporting.""

She did not elaborate on the methodology. The results of FreshTest testing are not publicly available.

""As industry requirements, products being used by growers and the regulatory environment have evolved over the past 22 years, so has FreshTest®. For instance, we are now able to test for over 460 [agricultural] chemicals in one test compared with under 100 in 2001,"" Woods said.

""The completion of residue testing of produce is a verification of the ongoing management of chemicals and treatment programs by a business.""

State and territory governments have responsibility for monitoring pesticide use and misuse.

Food Standards Australia New Zealand, which is responsible for setting standards, said the most recent Australian total diet survey, released in 2019, found concentrations of agvet chemicals were generally low, with a large proportion of food samples containing no detectable residues. It was based on samples collected in 2013 and 2014.

The spokesperson said: ""The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority and FSANZ take action to review chemical permissions and MRLs where relevant data supports the need to do so.

""For example, the approved uses for fenthion have been removed and no MRLs for residues in food remain in the Code,"" they said.

The agriculture department said the final report of an independent review of the pesticides regulatory system had recommended the establishment of a national domestic produce monitoring program.

The department has also recently asked a consultant to identify the sources of data available on pesticide use, residues in food and environmental exposures.

""The government is currently considering the final report and its recommendations,"" a spokesperson said.

The Great Fen scheme in Cambridgeshire will attract rare wildlife and play a vital role in restoring the UK equivalent of the rainforest - and it has just taken a great step forward

Looking north from Woodwalton Fen nature reserve, in Cambridgeshire, visitors get an uninterrupted view of Britain's flattest landscape. An entire hemisphere of sky hangs over a network of carefully drained fields that stretch to the horizon without a hill or mound in sight. Potatoes and other root crops grow in profusion in the rich, peaty soil.

But change is coming to this quiet corner of fenland - thanks to one of the largest and most ambitious restoration schemes ever launched in Europe: the Great Fen project. Organised by Wildlife Trust conservationists, the project has already cost £10m and its price tag could reach £30m by the time it is completed, they say.

The money - which has included an £8m donation from the National Lottery Heritage Fund - is being used to buy large sections of farmland to create a 9,000-acre site around two nature reserves - one at Holme Fen and the other at Woodwalton Fen, the latter being one of the very first wildlife refuges created in the UK . The land will then be transformed by allowing water to return to previously drained fields, restoring it to its former damp glory.

Mosaics of pools, streams and water meadows will take over fields that recently brimmed with onions and carrots. Recreating these old habitats should then entice a host of animals and birds - from voles to kingfishers - into the Great Fen. Rare species that have already been recorded in the area include marsh harriers and scarce chaser dragonflies as well as plants such as cuckooflower, purple loosestrife and greater water parsnip.

""We have very high hopes for restoring biodiversity here,"" said Henry Stanier, the project's monitoring and research officer. ""We should have all sorts of species - hobbies, bitterns, snipe and sticklebacks - coming in soon.""

New methods of farming will be tested at Great Fen to create types of agriculture that are sustainable and resistant to climate change, while the land will also be used to provide open access for visitors and ecotourists.

And central to these aspirations has been the purchase of Speechly's Farm. This was completed a few months ago and is important because its land connects two separate chunks of rewilded countryside that have been developed around the Holme and the Woodwalton reserves. Thanks to the purchase of the farm, these two restored landscapes can be united.

""For the first time this century, we will have a continuous corridor of natural wet fenland that will stretch over thousands of acres of the Great Fen,"" said Kate Carver, manager of the rewilding project. This point was backed by Lorna Parker, restoration manager for the Great Fen. ""It's quite simple. This piece of land is a game-changer for the project,"" she said.

A major focus of the Great Fen project is its reserves of peat. The land in this East Anglian region was once thickly coated with peat, but it is now being lost at an alarming rate. It is estimated that every year a layer of about 2cm is destroyed as the land is drained and dried and peat is blown off as dust.

And that loss could have a crucial impact on the countryside. Peatlands reduce flood risk by slowing water flowing from upland areas; they provide nesting and feeding grounds for many wading birds; and they are vital habitats for rare insects and plants. Most importantly, however, they are key stores of carbon dioxide. ""An acre of peatland holds as much carbon dioxide as an acre of rainforest,"" said Parker. ""Everyone worries about the rainforest but they forget that we are stripping back our peatlands at a terrible rate as well.""

The process of draining the Fens began in earnest in Victorian times with the development of powerful steam-driven pumps that brought dramatic changes to the landscape - as is revealed at Holme Fen reserve where, in 1848, a post was driven into the peat so that the top of it was at ground level. That post now towers four metres above the ground, demonstrating starkly how peat levels have shrunk over the past 170 years.

""We are now losing around 4.5m cubic metres of peat every year, and at this rate we will not have much left in a just couple of decades,"" said Carver. ""We have got to find ways of farming that do not use up our precious peat and do not increase carbon emissions.""

Part of the Great Fen project will therefore be to trial new farming systems that will not lead to peat loss and associated rises in carbon emissions. The solution is to employ wet farming techniques, or paludiculture, as it formally known.

As the water table rises in the area, the land will get wetter and a new range of crops will be grown. Candidates include bilberry, celery, cranberry, nettle, sedge grains, sweetgrass grains, watercress and water pepper.

""Systems which rely on having wet farmland could have all sorts of benefits,"" said Carver. ""It would help prevent the loss of carbon dioxide from dry arable land and it would prevent the loss of our supplies of peat which are dwindling at an alarming rate. These are our goals for the Great Fen project.""

This point was backed by Stanier. ""This place is the cradle of conservation and it is entirely appropriate that it is going to help to make a real difference in our battle to preserve our biodiversity.""

Humane alternatives to killing rampant creatures such as wild boar, deer and grey squirrels are being developed

Conflicts between humans and wildlife are triggering growing numbers of disease outbreaks, road accidents and crop damage. And the problem is likely to get worse unless new, humane measures to curtail animal numbers are developed in the near future, say scientists.

It is a critical environmental issue that will be debated this week at a major conference in Italy where experts will discuss how best to limit numbers of grey squirrels, wild boar, deer, feral goats, pigeons, parakeets and other creatures that are causing widespread ecological damage in many countries.

A key approach to be highlighted at the meeting will be the need to develop contraceptives for animals. These would provide conservationists and farmers with a means to curtail animal numbers in a humane way, say researchers.

Wild boar provide an illustration of the issues involved. Their numbers are rising across Europe, and UK breeding populations have been established in areas such as the Forest of Dean. With their large snouts and muscular necks, boar are good at rooting up fungi and seeds and can destroy crops, vulnerable habitats, ground-nesting animals and fragile root systems. Wild boar have also been linked to the spread of African swine fever to domestic pigs.

""Controlling numbers of animals like wild boar used to be achieved by shooting them, but hunting is not as popular as it used to be and is also more expensive, requiring expensive licences,"" said Dr Giovanna Massei, Europe director of the Botstiber Institute for Wildlife Fertility Control at York University.

She added: ""Numbers of individuals who hunt animals are declining in many parts of Europe. As a result, controls of boar populations have weakened.""

One solution is to develop boar contraceptives. ""Preventing these animals from breeding is a humane way to limit numbers,"" added Massei, who will be speaking at the European vertebrate pest management conference in Florence.

In the US and Europe, scientists have launched projects aimed at developing contraceptive chemicals that could be mixed with food and would drastically limit boar fertility. ""It is not easy to develop contraceptives but the good news is that once we get one, we have a way to deliver it,"" said Messai.

The delivery method is known as the Boar-Operated System and it uses metal cones placed over dishes of food that only wild pigs can lift with their snouts. Other animals cannot access the plates. ""That means we can get contraceptives into boar and only boar,"" said Massei.

A similar approach has already been implemented to tackle grey squirrels. After the rodent was introduced to the UK from the US in the 19th century, its numbers have reached 2.7 million and it threatens to replace native red squirrels. Grey quirrels also cause considerable damage to UK woodlands by stripping bark from trees.

Massei and other scientists are now carrying out research on an oral contraceptive in the form of a vaccine that prompts the squirrel's immune system to reduce the production of sex hormones, leaving both males and females infertile.

Mixed with hazelnut spread - a top squirrel treat - the drug is placed in pots in feeding boxes that only they can access. The environment minister, Richard Benyon, recently argued that the project could help eradicate the grey squirrel in the UK - without killing them.

Other contraceptive targets include deer. Apart from the widespread crop and woodland destruction they cause, deer are involved in car accidents that injure an estimated 700 people a year: some due to collisions with vehicles, others because drivers swerved to avoid hitting the animals.

Deer vaccines have been developed but problems remain about delivering them to their targets.

The development of animal oral contraceptives will not be sufficient on their own to remove the problems posed by wildlife and human conflicts, admitted Massei: ""However, they will certainly be an important asset in dealing with the problem. The crucial point is that we have too many people and too many animals, and that is causing conflict.

""We need to control numbers in ways that are publicly supported, and that means relying on non-lethal methods which are popular with the public.""

The ""˜seed keepers' of the Unesco-designated Urok Islands pass creole seeds from generation to generation, protecting their traditions and climate-resistant varieties from extinction

SanhÃ¡ JoÃ£o Correia is restless, walking around the boat and urging people to sit. He's worried that a turn in the weather will mean a missed chance to cross the Geba River.

The agricultural engineer from the Guinea-Bissau NGO Tiniguena ensures everyone embarks promptly and the boat leaves Bissau, the country's capital, loaded with drinking water, fuel and rice.

The crossing to Ilha Formosa, one of the Urok Islands in the BijagÃ³s archipelago, takes four hours. It is home to a unique group of women, ""the seed keepers"" - farmers who are preserving the ancestral grains of the BijagÃ³s.

The boat is the Cantoucha - the name of a respected seed keeper who died in 2021 - and is crewed by BijagÃ³s sailors. ""Only those who belong to the archipelago are allowed to navigate in these fierce waters,"" Correia says. ""To navigate safely you must ask permission from the gods.""

Correia and operational coordinator Emanuel Ramos are agroecological technicians in Urok, working with Tiniguena, and supporting the Women Keepers of Agricultural Biodiversity Seeds project, to conserve creole plants and their precious seeds.

The BijagÃ³ ethnic group inhabit several islands of the archipelago, a Unesco biosphere reserve off the west African Atlantic coast. The Urok Islands have been designated a community marine protected area since 2005. About 3,000 people live there.

Creole seeds have been passed from generation to generation and are vital for the survival of the BijagÃ³s. These are varieties and species, from corn to rice and peanut, that resist pests and the region's fierce climate, which is getting more intense due to global heating.

The project has already trained more than 150 women in seed care, with 12 women elected as head seed keepers. SÃ¡bado Maio, 70, is one. She says storing seeds is a cultural task of BijagÃ³s women.

""This is my work in nature. Women are the mother of everything, so women take care of the seeds more than men. Women are the ground, men are the sky. Women give birth, men don't, so plants survive because of women.""

Born in the tabanka (village) of Canhabaque, on Ilha Formosa, her garden boasts 19 varieties of crops and a shady banana plant that bears ripening fruit. Maio is worried that the rains will soon destroy it. She says it has been raining more this season than last year - a recurring complaint in the islands.

Maio is in charge of the seeds including red-skinned yam, geneva yam, cassava, horse-corn and pumpkin. ""I'm a keeper because I watched my grandparents do it. I know the importance of having seeds to ensure our way of survival,"" she says. Even her language is now endangered: BijagÃ³ is spoken only by the elders.

Two community adobe bembas (barns) have been built where 15 varieties of rice have been preserved and seeds are distributed to growers.

Anjuleta Gomes, president of the female horticulturists in the tabanka of Abu, has been keeping seeds since she was a child. ""I would take them out, dry them, and protect them in jars,"" she says. ""I'm 44, and in 1993 I was the youngest female horticulturist. The community chose me.""

Under the palm thatch, protected from the relentless rain, Gomes is busy removing the chabÃ©u, the palm tree fruit. ""In the BijagÃ³ tradition, the palm tree is everything,"" says Gomes, ""because you can use all its parts. Wine, oil, fruit, fish baskets, ropes, mats and ceilings are made from it.""

The barn is steps away from her house. ""I save seeds of cherry tomatoes, pumpkin, okra, cucumber, eggplant, corn, rice, yam and lime."" Once dried in the sun, she explains, seeds are put in a dry jar. ""You put some ash on it, to keep the bugs away, and close it well."" There's a secret to preserving each type of seed, she says.

In Guinea-Bissau, as in many African countries, it's mostly women who do the heavy labour on the land. In rural communities, women and girls ensure the water supply and household energy.

According to Tiniguena, less than 1% of these women own the land they cultivate, because of laws and customs that discriminate against them.

The BijagÃ³s ethnic group represents 2% of the total population of Guinea-Bissau. Specific social roles are organised according to gender and age, with ceremonies as people move from one age group to another. Such celebrations had been under threat, as they involved foods and produce that were disappearing, replaced by cash crops such as cashew.

Since the beginning of the intervention in the Urok Islands, diversification of food production has helped hundreds of women and their families gain greater autonomy and strengthened female leadership, says Beatriz Lopes, a mother of nine and a celebrated cook in her tabanka.

As one of the oldest horticulturists on the island, she was part of the women's group until 2018, when her health failed, but her garden still feeds 35 family members. ""I have children studying in Bissau, but others, along with my grandchildren, help me produce tomatoes, cucumbers, okra, onions, carrots, cabbage, lettuce and kale.""

She saves seeds to distribute to other farmers. ""I still manage to have enough to sell, buy rice, buy notebooks for the kids, pay for school, for medicine, and if I get sick we can go to the hospital.""

EsperanÃ§a Correia, 45, is one of her husband's four wives. She had no opportunity to go to school but started working on the land as a young girl. She now has four children and life is ""a flip-flop"", she says, because ""it demands looking for alternatives for survival all the time"". But as a seed keeper, she says she has more freedom, and she goes regularly to the Guinean capital, Bissau, to sell seeds.

In Abu, Maimuna Augusto, 47, keeps some tomato seeds stuck on the wall. They could be mistaken for dirty marks, but are precious. ""Here, the seeds stay protected from bugs, too, as they are stuck into the clay so they do not reach it.""

For her, life has improved since the horticulturists have organised and shared knowledge. ""I don't depend on anyone and today my children can study more than I could, because I can help them.""

A 40-minute boat ride from Ilha Formosa is the island of Maio, where SÃ¡bado Madjo, 48, lives. A widow, she interrupts her work to tell us that she keeps ""watermelon, manfafa, and yam genebra"". She started to store them as a game when she was a girl after watching her mother store seeds in improvised containers. ""It is the garden that makes every woman valuable and this is our responsibility to provide for the future. My dream is to see my four children educated,"" she says

A decade ago, Tiniguena first warned that the knowledge of the BijagÃ³ society was in danger of being lost as cashew trees replaced palms, which were being destroyed for charcoal, and as garbage and other forms of environmental pollution appeared in the villages, loosening, the organisation said, ""the ties of intimacy with the land"".

The climate crisis has made matters worse, warns Correia. ""The Urok Islands are going to suffer with the rise of [the sea] and whatever happens to agriculture will first happen here.""

Seed keeper SÃ¡bado Luis lives in the tabanka of ChediÃ£ on Maio island and talks about the increasingly frequent and longer heavy rains. ""When it rains, the water is not swept out to sea, it stays on the land, it floods everything and this is problematic for us, for our survival and food security.""

The growth of commercial cashew cultivation is a worry. ""It is taking over our soil, because it destroys the land around it, taking all the resources nearby so we can't produce anything else. The cashew root needs a lot of water and it only gives once a year and a few months. It is a waste of land.""

The 53-year-old mother of three keeps rice, beans and peanuts. For her, ""natural resources are the survival of the BijagÃ³s ""¦ We cannot give in to the pressure of commerce, we have to look out for the health of nature and resist the exploitation of resources, otherwise the BijagÃ³ people have no future,"" she says.

Annabel Streets is searching for a conifer. It is a bright, early March day and we are looping around the gardens of Fulham Palace in southwest London. She spots what she is looking for: a large spreading yew tree. We stand looking up at the clusters of leathery, spiked leaves and breathe deeply. ""Every day I stand under an evergreen tree now,"" she says. ""I have become obsessed with terpenes.""

Terpenes are a type of organic compound produced by plants, part of a protection system against insects, disease and rot. They are the reason pine trees smell piney and citrus trees smell citrussy. They are also one of the reasons humans are drawn to trees. The presence of these tiny molecules has an anti-inflammatory effect on the body. Laboratory research has shown that the terpene a-pinene, found in conifers such as our yew tree, could have properties that prevent cancer. Studies on the citrus compound D-limonene suggest it is an effective mood-booster and antidepressant.

""Terpenes are the trees' own immune system,"" says Streets, ""and when you walk underneath them you breathe that self-protection mechanism. There are studies showing that the blood pressure of people walking under evergreens was significantly lower than that of the people walking in a control group.""

This is just the start of our walk and only the first of Streets's remarkable facts. She has just published a book, 52 Ways to Walk, which is full of clearly presented science, nuggets of history and infectious enthusiasm for being out in the world and simply walking as a way of tackling so many of our ills. She's the ideal companion for an afternoon's urban ramble.

""While I was writing the book, I found myself thinking of my granny quite often,"" she says. ""All the things she would say - ""˜Go for a walk and take a few deep breaths and then you'll feel calmer' - that sort of thing. I thought it was just my granny being whimsical. But it turns out that she was right all along.""

One of the joys of 52 Ways to Walk is discovering that there's a scientific basis for much of what we'd call common sense or folk wisdom - and so much of it is rooted in leaving the house and going for a walk: getting the sun on your skin can help your immune system, and there's nothing harmful in getting covered in mud. In fact, it can help your gut health.

As a little girl, Streets fell in love with walking. She remembers being four or five years old and out near her grandparents' house in Sheringham. The big skies and flat lands of the North Norfolk coast were ""amazing, beautiful, these great swathes of sand""¦"" and the small Annabel would walk for miles.

But in adulthood, she fell into a pattern familiar to many of us - days spent hunching towards a computer, evenings prone on the sofa. Working out in the gym, but using the car to get there. The combination of desk job and driving made her body ""rounder, softer, achier, stiffer, stooped"" and her mind anxious and unsettled. She made a resolution to do as much as she could on foot, getting a dog and proper wet-weather gear for extra motivation.

For Streets, it was a spark, a gleeful rekindling of an old love affair. ""Walking had never seemed more beguiling or thrilling,"" she writes in the book's introduction. Her friends, and especially her family, didn't catch the same vibe. It was wet. It was cold. It was boring. It was slow. It was just""¦ walking.

""I wanted to show people all the reasons there were to walk,"" she says. ""Even in the darkness, even in the rain, there will be something that part of us will respond to, whether that's physiological or emotional or cognitive. I didn't want to be the person who was just telling everyone to get their 10,000 steps.""

The 52 Ways to Walk project was actually the product of over-enthusiastic research. Streets, who also writes as Annabel Abbs, has written several historical novels, all based on real women, like Lucia Joyce, a professional dancer and the daughter of James Joyce; or Frieda Weekley who eloped with DH Lawrence and is considered to be the inspiration for Lady Chatterley. Streets had been working on a nonfiction book, Windswept, where she walked the routes taken by famous women, such as the artist Georgia O'Keeffe or the nature writer Nan Shepherd. ""There was memoir and biography and I had also included a lot of scientific research about walking,"" she says. ""My editor, quite rightly, insisted I remove it."" Rather than let it go to waste, that research was the start of 52 Ways. ""Other people, who were much more expert than me on various topics, were very generous with their knowledge and their time,"" she says. ""There are shelves and shelves of research on walking, but I think people have largely found it unsexy.""

We have turned on to a path that follows the Thames. Reflected sunlight gives a chrome cast to the river. ""It's magical,"" says Streets, looking out at the refracting glitter, ""and when the sun shines down on the water like this it means you get twice as much light, so you get twice the serotonin boost and serotonin is what makes us happy."" This is a typical blend of the scientific and the romantic found in the book. For Streets, a waterfall doesn't stop being inspiring and wonderful when you know that the presence of negative ions, molecules of air and water charged with electricity, are the reason for your lowered heart rate and reduced stress. Studies on the potential effects of the full moon - covering everything from a higher rate of women going into labour to increases in violent crime - are inconclusive, but Streets feels that adds to ""the eerie, enigmatic qualities of a moonlit walk"".

Her enthusiasm extends to the extremely practical. She shows me her walking boots which don't taper, as most shoes do, but let your toes splay naturally. They have thin, flexible soles and no heel, mimicking shoeless walking. ""There was an interesting study on people who wore barefoot shoes for six months,"" she says. ""The muscles in people's feet improved by 60%. So you are building muscle and, possibly, strengthening the bones.""

She also shows me how to walk, which sounds ridiculous but, as Streets points out, ""so many of us walk as though we've just come off our laptop. I certainly did."" The trick is to hold your chin parallel to the ground, push your shoulder blades down your back and roll your stomach slightly inwards as though tucking it under your rib cage. You then, with each step, roll through your foot heel-to-toe. It's basic postural alignment. But for me, having spent most of the previous two months indoors nursing an injured ankle, it feels like someone has suddenly flicked a switch and completed an electrical circuit.

Walkers of all kinds stride through Streets's book. There are nomads and pilgrims, soldiers and children, protesters and paraders. There is something to learn from everyone, whether that's the military practice of tabbing - covering mile after mile with a backpack - that is good for both heart and mind, or the mindful breathing that allows Afghan livestock herders to walk far and fast with little fatigue.

In the book, she doesn't often mention women as a specific group (although the chapter on getting lost makes the interesting point that the observed differences in spatial skills between men and women have nothing to do with the brain and everything to do with cultural conditioning). But in conversation she is a passionate defender of the right of women to walk alone and at all times of day. ""I walked from Toulouse to Bordeaux by myself,"" she says. ""Occasionally, a barge would come down the canal, but there was nothing on the river. There was nothing around me to be scared of."" She talks about silver water and spotting herons and picking wild figs to eat. The only time she felt unsafe was, ironically, in an Airbnb, booked to avoid solo camping, where the promised host couple turned out to be a single man who was too keen for company.

""I wonder if sometimes it's about perception,"" she says, about walking alone. ""At home we know all the horror stories and all their locations, but when we're elsewhere we don't have that knowledge. We don't know about the horrible things, so we think we're safe. And nine times out of 10 we are. We look at women in the past who've done big journeys and think they're intrepid or brave, but they also didn't have daily news stories about what could go wrong.""

Walking side by side creates another kind of vulnerability, or at least an easy intimacy. Streets cites an anthropological study that suggests a rhythmic pace, coordinated movement and a lack of eye contact make it easy for us to open up as we walk along with another person. And, as we cross a bridge and head back up river, I find myself sharing things about my own life, something I would never usually do while interviewing.

Walking with Annabel Streets means getting caught in the current of her enthusiasm. As a talker and as a writer she's full of information, but avoids coming off as a preacher or a know-it-all. She is delighted to be out with the blackthorn blossom and the shouts of practising rowers. Her book has this spirit, it wears its research light and it's suffused with the simple pleasure of putting one foot in front of the other. When Epping Forest comes up in conversation, she zooms in on the map to review this unknown area and rapidly decides she could walk from northeast London to Cambridge in a couple of days, stopping off to see a friend in Saffron Walden. Walking is an activity that can thud with dull-but-virtuous tones, like a solid loaf of too-wholemeal bread, but, for Streets, walking is freedom, an escape for the mind and the body.

""One day last summer, I woke up really early,"" she says, ""around 5am, no going back to sleep. I got the tube to Victoria and then the train out to Tonbridge. By 9am I was in the middle of Kent. I followed the river all the way up to Maidstone. And, of course, the brilliant thing about rivers is that you don't need a map.""

Really, the title 52 Ways to Walk is somewhat misleading. There are hundreds of reasons, grouped roughly into a year's worth of weekly walks. You can get technical with mountains and backpacks, or you could just open the front door and see where the road takes you.

52 Ways to Walk, the Surprising Science of Walking for Wellness and Joy, One Week at a Time, by Annabel Streets, is published by Bloomsbury at £10.99 and is available from guardianbookshop.com at £9.67

A burgeoning farm holidays movement on the Peloponnese lets producers make extra income while offering visitors a glimpse of the country's slower side

In a large sunlit kitchen on Eumelia farm, an idyllic agritourism and wellness retreat set amid the endless olive groves of Greece's southern Peloponnese, my classmates and I take turns using a long dowel-like rolling pin to stretch and roll balls of dough that we hope will become filo pastry. It won't be the flaky, paper-thin kind sold frozen in supermarkets though; the pastry we're striving for is two to three millimetres thick, the kind you're likely to catch a whiff of while walking past this area's many outdoor wood-fired ovens.

When we've each created an approximation of our host and teacher Marilena Karadima's perfect circle of pastry, we use them to make savoury spinach pies that we snack on while we learn to cook other traditional dishes, including a hummus-like dip called fava, made from yellow split peas, a roasted aubergine dish brought to Greece by refugees and moustalevria, a pudding made with Eumelia olive oil, local walnuts, flour, sesame seeds, and must (juice) from the farm's grapes.

Before class, we worked in the garden with Marilena and her young son, harvesting spinach, rocket, a colourful variety of lettuces, purple-striped aubergines and aromatic herbs. Cooking done, we gather around a long outdoor table, enjoying wine produced on the farm and the dishes we've made together. Lunch doesn't end until the evening sun slings a golden hue across the silver canopy of the farm's organic olive grove.


Whether it's through garden-to-table cooking classes like this or a chance to help with the olive or grape harvest, Eumelia's guests are invited to roll up their sleeves, get back to the land and experience a slower, more traditional side of Greece.

The farm is near Gouves village in the Laconia region and a world away from modern life. Together with her husband, Frangiskos Karelas, Marilena offers a variety of experiences that vary with the seasons. During August and September's grape harvest, guests can join in and ""stomp"", pressing the grapes to music, learning to make wine and tasting natural wines from across the Peloponnese. A five-day immersive olive oil experience in October and November sees guests harvesting olives from centuries-old trees and learning about olive history, oil varieties and pairings, and organic production. Cooking classes, culinary tours, yoga and massage are available year-round. Five cottages shaded by olive trees offer a comfortable night after a long day in the fields.

While Eumelia is among the better known agritourism destinations on the Peloponnese, it is one of many across the peninsula and throughout Greece - and the opportunities for visiting farms and food artisans in this region are growing. As producers look to diversify in response to challenges posed by a volatile market and climate change, more and more are turning to agricultural and culinary tourism. The Greek government is paying attention, spearheading new efforts to support them through funding and legislation. ""Greek farms are treasures,"" says Tasos Kannavos, cofounder of Cellarhopping, which works to connect travel professionals with agritourism destinations across Greece. ""This kind of tourism is a wonderful way for visitors to know a different, more sustainable side of Greece - and help support Greek agriculture.""

Three more foodie experiences in the Peloponnese

Magna Grecia Agriturismo, Ancient Olympia, Ilias

Alexis and Francesco Karabelas grew up learning to produce high-quality olive oil on their family's farm a short walk from Ancient Olympia. The brothers returned to the farm after university, bringing new ideas for sustainable cultivation: they implemented organic practices and designed a modern olive oil mill to streamline production. In 2022 and again this year, Karabelas oil won gold awards at the World Olive Oil Competition.

Taking a cue from their parents who began a modest agritourism business in 2008 in response to low market prices for olive oil, the brothers now run a fully fledged ""oleotourism"" enterprise, offering guided tours of the olive groves and mill, olive oil and wine tastings, a chance to participate in the harvest and lively lunch or dinner gatherings complete with folk dancing. The Karabelas family and their neighbours are no strangers to the challenges posed by climate change: in 2021, devastating wildfires scorched more than 425,000 olive trees in their area. Today, the family is part of an initiative to restore the region's groves and support olive farmers.

Orias mountain guesthouse & farm, Kerpini, Arkadia

This down-to-earth guesthouse is on a 20-acre organic farm at nearly 1,000 metres at the foot of Mount Chelmos in the northern Peloponnese. Giannis Chouliaras and his colleagues invite guests and day visitors to work in the gardens, help with the farm animals and, each October, participate in the grape harvest and pressing.

They also offer cooking classes, guided mushroom hunts, hiking, backcountry skiing, mountain biking and an annual summer camp for kids and teens. Ingredients from the Orias gardens and nearby producers are on the menu at the farm's restaurant. All this takes place amid herb and flower gardens, a cherry orchard and fir trees with a stunning view of Mount Chelmos.

Mama's Flavours, Kalamata, Messinia

Mama's Flavours' tours are rooted in the founders' belief in supporting Greece's farmers and food artisans, particularly rural women. ""Greece isn't just Mykonos, the Acropolis, and souvlaki,"" says Maria Monastirioti, who founded Mama's Flavours in 2018 with a group of friends. ""It's a place of rich gastronomic traditions based on what's fresh, local and in season - and it's a place of filoxenia, or hospitality. But producers are really struggling to earn money for the food they work so hard to grow and make. If we can work together, maybe we can help each other.""

To this end, Maria and her partners lead culinary and agricultural tours and experiences in the seaside city of Kalamata and across the Peloponnese, offering access to small-scale farmers and other producers. Guests can choose from a variety of experiences including visits to cheesemakers, vineyards and wineries, an organic olive farm and traditional stone mill, urban food tours, wine tastings and cooking classes.

On the day I join, Maria leads a half-day tour that includes a visit to an olive press and an olive oil tasting followed by a delicious and convivial lunch of local fare at a taverna next door. Maria says: ""I don't want to be rich and neither do the producers we work with. We just want to live with dignity and do work that comes from our hearts.""

630,"Be warned: the next deadly pandemic is not inevitable, but all the elements are in place","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/08/next-pandemic-bird-flu-mink-farms-transmission","Be warned: the next deadly pandemic is not inevitable, but all the elements are in place

Bird flu is a mass killer, and mink farms are perfect for infection and transmission. They are a grave threat and must be banned

If you wanted to kill as many people as possible, deniably and with no criminal consequences, what would you do? You'd do well to start with a bird flu. Bird flus are responsible for all the known flu pandemics: the great influenza that started more than a century ago, ""Asian flu"", ""Hong Kong flu"" and ""Russian flu"", which killed tens of millions between them. They also cause many of the annual outbreaks that slaughter hundreds of thousands of people.

Once you have found a suitable variant, two further components are required to weaponise it. The first is an amplifier. The best amplifier is a giant shed or factory in which thousands of birds are packed. These birds should be genetically homogenous, so that your viral strain can travel freely between them. Intensive poultry farms would serve very well. Before long, a low-pathogenic strain should mutate in these circumstances into a highly pathogenic variety.

To ensure maximum transmission, you should move some of the birds around, faster than the flu's incubation period. You might carry them across borders. Some would be shifted to free-range or hobby farms, to enhance the possibility of infecting wild birds.

But it's difficult for a flu virus to travel directly from birds to humans, so another component is required: a mixing vessel. This is a species that can simultaneously harbour the newly pathogenic bird virus and a flu variety already adapted to humans. Then the viruses, conveniently brought together, can exchange genetic material - a process known as ""reassortment"".

Pigs are reasonable mixing vessels. They might have played this role in some previous outbreaks and pandemics. But there's a much better candidate: mink. Mink readily harbour human and avian flu viruses. As predators, they can easily acquire avian flu from the meat they eat. The distribution of sialic acid receptors - a key determinant of infection - in their respiratory tracts is similar to that of humans. Human flu strains can pass between them through aerosol transmission.

Mink also possess, to a remarkable degree, what scientists call ""zoonotic potential"": in other words, they can be infected by, and infect, many different species. During the first phases of Covid-19, they proved to be highly effective intermediaries, partly because the virus seemingly evolves faster in mink than in humans. They appear to have generated at least two new variants that spread to humans, one in Spain and one in Italy. Mink are the only known species that both received Covid-19 from humans and passed it back to them.

To enhance their mixing ability, you would cram hundreds or thousands of the tiny cages housing them together, so that this usually solitary animal is forced into contact with others. You would reduce genetic diversity by breeding only those with a particular fur type. In other words, you would do what mink farms do today. Then you would sit back and wait.

The next pandemic might not have been seeded by a murderous psychopath, but, unless we are lucky, the effect could be the same. H5N1 was a fairly harmless bird flu until a highly pathogenic variant was hatched in a Chinese goose farm in 1996. It is deadly to humans. On the rare occasions when people have contracted this variant, it has proved fatal more often than not: of 868 infected up to October last year, 457 have died. Though it has been devastating to both poultry flocks and wild birds, however, its transmissibility from birds to most mammals, and from person to person, is thankfully extremely low.

But mink farming offers the mixing vessel it needs. In 2021, a paper in the journal Emerging Microbes & Infections reported that about a third of the mink the researchers tested harboured both bird flu and human flu antibodies. It warned that this joint infection could generate novel viruses ""with high human infectivity"". The public health threat ""should not be ignored"", as it had ""pandemic potential"". Needless to say, it was ignored.

A few days ago, the journal Eurosurveillance revealed the first known case of large-scale mammal-to-mammal transmission of the H5N1 flu virus. It happened, to no gasps of surprise, on a mink farm; in Galicia, northern Spain. While the mink were fed with poultry products, a practice scientists have long warned against, it seems that the likely cause of infection was contact with a sick wild bird that might have fallen against the bars of a cage, and was dragged through and eaten. Once inside its mixing vessel, the virus mutated to become transmissible to the other mink, then spread rapidly in this farm of more than 50,000 animals from cage to cage.

This epidemic was contained before it left the farm. All the mink were killed, and we might narrowly have missed a pandemic potentially more deadly than Covid-19. But farming mink for their fur, a cruel and pointless practice, continues in Europe, North America and China. There's a high chance that the next pandemic, whatever it may be, will emerge in one of these places. Because of both the abominable cruelty suffered by the animals and the grave threat it presents to human life, we need a global treaty to ban mink farming.

The H5N1 virus, having acquired its deadly mutations on a poultry farm, is now raging through wild bird populations with horrific consequences. It is killing so many that, in conjunction with other threats, it could drive some species towards extinction. In particular, it is shattering colonies of seabirds. As they reproduce late and slowly, they're especially vulnerable to extinction. Wild birds could easily introduce the virus to another mink farm.

This threat is bookended by grotesque cruelty: the poultry, mink and pig farms whose horrors we have somehow normalised and accepted. If you treated dogs or cats in the same way as we treat these animals, you would be sent to prison. But do it to farmed species on a large enough scale and you are treated with the special respect accorded to a ""captain of industry"". Governments will sweep the dust from your path. Newspapers will write panegyrics of the kind once accorded to emperors.

So who is the homicidal maniac in this story? It's a scarcely examined abstraction we call ""the economy"", a monster to whom anything and everything must be sacrificed without question or resistance: farmed animals, wild ones, even, unless we are fortunate, human beings in their millions. We will prevent the pandemics of the future only when we value life ahead of money.

Cindy McCain warns food supplies will not be safe until Russian invasion of Ukraine has ended

The global food price crisis will carry on this year, the US ambassador for food has warned, and supplies will not be safe until the Russian invasion of Ukraine has ended.

Cindy McCain, the US ambassador to the UN agencies for food and agriculture, called the crisis ""huge ""¦ the worst food crisis, the worst humanitarian crisis since world war 2"" and warned that some countries in Africa were on the brink of famine. She laid the blame for soaring prices squarely on Russia, and president Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

McCain also warned that US funding for UN agencies working to ease the food crisis was likely to be ""tight"" this year, and she urged speculators in the financial markets not to take advantage of the turmoil to drive up prices further.

Food prices have declined from their peaks last year, sparking hopes that the crisis - during which there has been rampant food inflation across both the developed and developing world, and shortages of key staples in some countries, following Putin's invasion of Ukraine almost a year ago - could be abating.

McCain said: ""The fact that food prices are going down does not mean this crisis is anywhere near being over ""¦ We are looking at some difficult times. This would be spring planting season [in Ukraine]. There's no way they can plant because of the invasion and because of the destruction that's been done, to the land and to machinery.""

She added that grain exports in the region were also stuck owing to Russia's actions. ""We have not been able to get a lot of the grain out. Normally we could bring out somewhere near 20m tonnes, and we are nowhere near that number. There's over 100 ships waiting to get in [to Black Sea ports]. So this crisis is anything but over, and with regards to food and food security, it's only exacerbated even more.""

Several factors have combined to create the crisis, following Russia's invasion. Ukraine is not only a major exporter of grain and vegetable oil, but also of fertiliser, and the spike in energy prices resulting from Russia's threats to gas supplies has also pushed up the cost of food production. Many countries were already in a precarious position with food supplies because of the lingering impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The impacts have been global, McCain said. ""It has a ripple effect. It ripples down into Africa, affecting countries that can't feed themselves in any way. It's affecting all of us,"" she said.

""We're very near famine in a sizable portion of Africa right now, although I think we can stave it off a little bit in Yemen. Famine is a disastrous state to be in. And again this is completely [the result of] what Russia has done.""

Some food experts have warned that speculation in the commodities markets, with financial traders taking bets on food prices, and a small number of companies dominating the physical trade in key commodities such as grain, have helped to drive up prices further.

Asked whether speculation could be having an impact, McCain said: ""Probably so. I say that without a lot of exact information, but sometimes there are bad players.""

She declined to say whether such speculation should be penalised, but said she would speak out against it. ""You can't tolerate it - people are starving. Speculation does nobody any good during a crisis. [We need to] keep reminding the world that food security is a national security problem. This has not only community effects, but has national security implications.""

McCain warned that funding from the US for both research and international food efforts could be reduced this year. Pointing to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, the UN World Food Programme, and their sister organisations that deal with food issues, she said: ""We're going to see less funding because there's a financial crisis here. It's going to be a tight year.""

McCain also warned that the climate crisis was having an impact on food. The widow of John McCain, the former Republican senator and presidential candidate, she reflected on her home state of Arizona, saying: ""Climate change is a huge part of this [food crisis]. Where I come from, there is no water. And yet, there's golf courses everywhere. So at some point we have to step back and say, what's the right use of this? Should we be putting all of this in, should we do something different?""

Agricultural shows are a highlight of the British summer, combining farming heritage with the village fete to bring an eccentric joyfulness

10 of the UK's best country shows

Several years ago I was asked to judge the homemade wines at a local agricultural show. I have written to tight deadlines at World Cups and delivered a speech in the Long Room at Lord's; neither filled me with quite the same feelings of pressure and anxiety. I knew how seriously such competitions are taken, the strength of feelings they evoke. I had nightmares of being strangled with a siphoning tube. Fortunately my co-judge was more experienced and sanguine. She also held the old-fashioned opinion that swirling the wines around your mouth before spitting them in a bucket was uncouth, and so following her lead I drank a small glass of each. There were more than 20 entries, and after half an hour my fears had dematerialised into a fuzzy summer glow.

That was before the pandemic. These days anyone taking a similar approach to judging homemade wines would probably end up being hospitalised, thanks to the sheer range and number of entries. During lockdown people all over the country filled their days rediscovering old crafts, baking, brewing and winemaking among them. Entries for the industrial tent (originally for displaying the work of rural craftspeople, but showing everything from baking to children's art, knitting, jam and photography) at agricultural shows have soared.

With its complex rules and brutal truth-telling, it is not a place for the fainthearted. At a show in North Yorkshire I once saw an entry for the bread competition damned with a handwritten notice reading: ""This is not a loaf!!!"" Each exclamation point a dagger to the heart. A friend who entered cheese scones with chives in them to a show in County Durham still shivers when she recalls the reaction.

Held up and down the country - in cities as well as remote rural locations - these county shows are a highlight of the Great British summer. Besides the agricultural heart, elements of the village fete bring an eccentric joyfulness - and they're becoming ever more popular. Attendance at agricultural shows has risen to previously undreamed-of heights since anti-Covid measures were lifted.

This year, the Great Yorkshire Show saw the highest ticket sales in its 185-year history, the Royal Highland Show broke its attendance record, and the Northumberland County Show saw an increase of 25% on admissions on pre-lockdown numbers. A growing interest in the local environment and food production, coupled with the rising cost of living, has made people look for affordable amusement closer to home. Many shows are registered charities and staffed by volunteers.

The industrial tent remains at the heart of the action and is not to be missed. Here you will witness the dadaist juxtapositioning of everything from a fruit scones contest to a children's animal-made-from-vegetables competition (cucumber crocodiles abound). As a friend of mine once remarked after a happy half-hour examining the ""garden-on-a-plate"" exhibits: ""Why go to Papua New Guinea or the Amazon to see the exotic and the bizarre when it's right here on your doorstep?""

Beyond that, there may also be stalls selling cakes, plants, novelty doormats, fishing-fly pictures and hand-painted salt dough sheep. There will be tents run by societies from the Country Land and Business Association to the Game & Wildlife Conservation Trust, and trade stands of companies specialising in dairy hygiene. Eventually you'll find the livestock, the historical core of any show.

By the mid-18th century, a boom in the population of Britain generally blamed on the Industrial Revolution had left the nation wobbling on the edge of famine. British farming had to change as swiftly as manufacturing had done. The reformation was led by a new breed of go-ahead farmers, such as Thomas Coke, Lord Townsend and Robert Bakewell. Their network of county agricultural societies promoted new scientific methods of stock breeding and crop management. But not enough people took any notice.

Then someone, possibly Coke, hit on the idea of the agricultural show, where all the advances would be displayed and explained, the superiority of the new methods demonstrated and, to encourage good practices, prizes would be awarded to the best stock and produce. The shows were educational and progressive. They were also high-minded and serious. If people wanted fun, they could go to the circus.

Most larger shows have thousands of animals on display, in a bewildering number of guises. Perhaps surprisingly, Britain has more varieties of farm animal than any other country.

Among the sheep pens, farmers lean over the fences and study, scratch and chat. The air is full of their chatter, merging with the buzz of electric clippers from the sheering contests and the nervous, throaty warbling of the sheep (halfway between Edith Piaf and a baby monitor). At most big county shows prizes are fought over by up to 30 breeds of sheep - from handsome grey Herdwicks (whose existence owes much to the work Beatrix Potter did to conserve the breed) to chunky Ryelands, whose high-quality wool was once so valuable it was nicknamed Leominster Ore.

The goats will be housed nearby, in a marquee that smells oddly cheesy. There'll be leaflets and notices about the huge benefits that goats bestow: the nutritive value of the milk, the rich flavour of the meat, the high quality of the wool. The pig pens are generally awash with excited children, pointing at a snoozing Tamworth sow, whose hair is stripy black and brown (brindle) and whose nose is so pointy it is often said (well, by people who care about pigs, anyway) that a Tamworth can ""pick a pea from a pint pot"".

In the cattle sheds the mood is calmer and more serious. The breed societies have their own stalls. Sheep may occasionally fetch fortunes, goats may attract passionate enthusiasts and pigs spawn children's TV franchises, but this is where the real money is, among the giant Simmentals and white-faced Herefords. The cattle sheds were the favourite haunt of Victorian show judges, whose descriptions of prize dairy specimens sometimes teetered on the Jilly Cooper side of country life - ""grand bosoms"" and ""perfect loins"".

Somewhere far off they are calling out the entries for the Pony Club fancy dress parade. There's a roar from the chainsaw carving demonstration. This year the Northumberland County Show had camel racing and ""giant Aldabra tortoises"" alongside the more traditional gundog scurry and the Young Farmers' Club tug-of-war. Amid the bubble football and the axe-throwing demonstrations it's hard to believe that until the 1950s most agricultural shows refused even to countenance show jumping because it was too frivolous. (Surveying the events of the Great Yorkshire Show, one critic harrumphed that it was now nothing but ""a giant car boot fair with a few animals attached"".)

But that is to miss the point. Over the years agricultural shows have become popular traditions, and popular traditions are shaped by what people want, not what they need. And these days fun is high on the agenda - from folk bands to local cider stalls, ferret racing to wrestling, there's no end of entertainment for all ages.

Yet despite the parachute display teams, quad bike stunt shows and appearances by celebrity farmers such as Kaleb Cooper, Adam Henson or the Yorkshire Shepherdess, agricultural shows still fulfil their role as promoters of modern farming. This year the Great Yorkshire Show boasted an Innovation Zone featuring hi-tech farming kit including an automatic Hoofcount footbath for cattle and a 100% methane-powered tractor. Lord Coke would surely have approved.

European Environment Agency says Ukraine crisis cannot be used to justify delay

The EU's environmental watchdog has hit back at calls to stall a 50% cut in the use and risks of synthetic pesticides and a 20% cut in fertiliser use by 2030, arguing that the Ukraine crisis provides scant justification for delay.

EU states with the backing of powerful farm unions and centre-right parties have blocked the proposed pesticide reform unless the European Commission completes a second impact study by 28 June to assuage food security fears.

Among campaigners and scientists, anxieties are rife that the bloc's flagship green farming pledge could be unceremoniously buried.

Dario Piselli, a European Environment Agency (EEA) expert and author of a new analysis published on Wednesday, said there were ""compelling"" reasons not to hesitate further with the draft law.

""There's limited justification to use the war as a reason for postponing action,"" he told the Guardian. ""Food security as an issue is not only to do with immediate food supply - and a lot of the concerns there have subsided a bit compared to the beginning of the war - but with medium-long term security which is influenced by other things [like] climate change and the impact of a loss of biodiversity on food production.""

Since 1990, farmland bird and grassland butterfly populations have plunged by more than 30% in Europe, while almost one in 10 of the continent's bees face extinction, mainly because of habitat loss caused by intensified agriculture.

In 2020, pesticide thresholds for human safety were breached at more than one in five rivers and lakes across Europe, the EEA paper says and 83% of agricultural soils tested in 2019 were also found to contain pesticide residues.

Almost the same percentage - 84% - of people tested across five European countries in 2021 were found to contain at least two pesticides in their bloodstreams, according to a large human biomonitoring study cited by the paper.

Environmentalists say this is partly down to increased pesticide sales volumes in the EU, which remained stable between 2011 and 2020 at about 350,000 tonnes a year, compared with annual averages closer to 220,000 tonnes between 1992 and 2003.

One EU country, Denmark, has cut sales by using pesticide taxes linked to product toxicity, but the commission does not expect the present modest rises in pesticide prices to affect demand.

By contrast, fertiliser sales in countries such as Germany have fallen by up to 40% after prices doubled between May 2020 and the end of 2022, owing to high gas costs and war-related supply disruptions.

One EU diplomat said this had caused ""mixed feelings"" in Europe's capitals about the commission's green farming reform. ""Last year the Germans were desperate to push the proposal forward but how this will end up I don't know,"" the official said.

Another EU diplomat added: ""If the pesticides regulation is dead, there is no one to blame but the commission itself. The moment it stepped away from a scientific and evidence-based approach in favour of ideology and dogmatic solutions, it condemned its flagship legal proposal.""

The commission's targets for EU nations, which take into account actions already taken, would force Italy to cut its pesticide use and risks by 62%, Germany by 55% and France and Spain by 54%, according to a report in Politico.

Hostility to the measures is strong among Europe's agricultural business class and in several governments, where the EU's green deal commissioner, Frans Timmermans, is viewed darkly.

""Unless EU citizens suffer from hunger and protest in the streets, he does not care,"" the first diplomat said.

In a concession to such sentiments, Brussels last year shelved a proposed ban on pesticide use in ecologically sensitive areas - so long as low-risk pesticides were used instead. But it will not abandon the goal of a less chemically drenched countryside, despite the ""complex"" impacts of the Ukraine conflict on food security, said Stefan De Keersmaecker, a commission spokesperson.

""We must continue making progress in the discussions so that the proposal can become a reality to protect farmers, pesticide users, citizens, vulnerable populations, and the environment,"" he said. ""European citizens have a clear desire to reduce the use and risk of pesticides.""

Research highlights benefits forests bring surrounding regions in terms of cooler air and more rainfall

Deforestation has a far greater impact on regional temperatures than previously believed, according to a new study of the Brazilian Amazon that shows agricultural businesses would be among the biggest beneficiaries of forest conservation.

The research has important political implications because farmers in Amazonian states have, until now, led the way in forest destruction on the assumption that they will make money by clearing more land.

The new research highlights the other side of the picture. It shows the agricultural heartland of Mato Grosso, where crops are already suffering from drought and extreme heat, would be just over half a degree celsius hotter by 2050 if deforestation continued at the rapid rate of recent years.

The paper, published on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, demonstrated Amazon deforestation causes warming at distances up to 60 miles (100km) away. The greater the forest clearance, the higher the temperature. This is in addition to the wider climate impact of global heating.

Dominick Spracklen of the University of Leeds said the average tree had a cooling effect equivalent to two to three 2.5kW air conditioners working at full power every hour of every day. This works through evapotranspiration, which he said was very similar to the sweat humans produce to lower body temperature. He said the effect spread wider than anyone had realised.

""We always thought this might be happening, but the extent is bigger than I would have thought,"" he said. ""More and more, we are demonstrating the big benefits the forests bring to surrounding regions. For farmers, they bring cooler air and more rainfall. Hopefully putting numbers on these benefits will help to persuade a broader set of people to protect forest areas.""

An increasing number of peer-reviewed studies are proving the importance of the Amazon in maintaining a stable regional climate. Earlier this year, a paper showed that forest clearance reduced rainfall up to 125 miles away. More recently, research at a greater scale demonstrated that the Amazon was coupled with the South American monsoon and that continued deforestation could reduce regional precipitation by 30% with dire consequences for food production.

Until now, studies on the impact of forest clearance on heat have concentrated on local effects with a clear correlation between loss of tree cover and higher temperatures in the area where the trees were cut down. The new research went further by looking at whether there is also a warming effect over a wider area. Using satellite data and artificial intelligence, the authors found a 0.7C increase in temperature for each 10-percentage point loss of forest within a radius of 60 miles.

In areas that have been extensively cleared, the impact is considerable. As the paper concludes: ""We show that regional forest loss increases warming by more than a factor of four with serious consequences for the remaining Amazon forest and the people living there.""

However, the lead author, Ed Butt, said this should be seen not as an alarm, but as a useful tool to incentivise the sustainable management of the forest. ""If we could reduce deforestation, then we could avert a good amount of regional warming. I see that as a big opportunity. It demonstrates the big benefit of reducing deforestation for local farmers ""¦ The most important thing is that states like Mato Grosso can follow different futures. This hands back control to regions and states. They could really reduce the amount of warming they will be exposed to.""

637,"Cattle, not coca, drive deforestation of the Amazon in Colombia - report","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/19/colombia-cattle-ranching-coca-amazon-deforestation","Cattle, not coca, drive deforestation of the Amazon in Colombia - report

Authorities have blamed the growing of coca - the base ingredient of cocaine - for clearcutting, but a recent study shows otherwise

Cattle-ranching, not cocaine, has driven the destruction of the Colombian Amazon over the last four decades, a new study has found.

Successive recent governments have used environmental concerns to justify ramping up their war on the green shrub, but the research shows that in 2018 the amount of forest cleared to cultivate coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, was only 1/60th of that used for cattle.

The study's findings vindicate conservation experts who have long argued that Colombia's strategy to conserve the Amazon - often centered on combating coca production - has been misplaced.

""We want to finally eradicate this narrative that coca is the driver of deforestation,"" said Paulo Murillo-Sandoval at the University of Tolima, who led the study.

Deforestation spiked after the guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) signed a landmark peace agreement with the government in 2016 and laid down their weapons.

As the rebels came out of the jungle, land-grabbers took advantage, clearing trees with chainsaws and burning vast areas. Deforestation reached a record high of 219,973 hectares (543,565 acres) in 2017, up 23% from the previous year.

Then president IvÃ¡n Duque used the environmental destruction caused by coca cultivation to justify stepping up military action against coca farmers. Prohibited from spraying coca crops with glyphosate after the chemical was banned in 2015 for health concerns, the Duque government sent in choppers and armed troops into the Amazon rainforest, sometimes into deadly confrontations with coca farmers.

Yet while cattle ranches cleared more than 3m hectares (7.4m acres) of Amazon rainforest in 2018, coca's impact was negligible.

Only 45,000 hectares (111,200 acres) were cleared for coca in 2018, the latest year available in the study.

Using a deep learning algorithm to differentiate between land used for coca and cattle, Murillo and his colleagues were for the first time able to distinguish between the activities on a mass scale from 1985 to 2019.

""We have always contested the government's argument that coca was driving deforestation but lacked the evidence,"" said Angelica Rojas, liaison officer for Guaviare state at the Foundation for Conservation and Sustainable Development, a Colombian environmental thinktank. ""Now we have real data with which we can oppose this mistake.""

The figures show that previous governments have used the environment as a false justification to wage war on coca farmers, said Rojas, who was not involved in the study.

""They didn't want to prevent deforestation, they just wanted to justify spending more money and resources on their real political goal: eliminating coca,"" she said.

The study also adds to evidence that despite lives being sacrificed and billions of dollars being spent, Colombia's ""war on drugs"" has failed to halt coca production - and in some cases it may have even made it worse.

When farmers have their crops eradicated they simply establish new plots, often just a few kilometres deeper into the forest canopy, Murillo said. ""The war on drugs started 40 years ago now, yet everyone knows where coca is: in the same place they have always been.""

As the government has engaged in a game of whack-a-mole with coca farmers, the real driver of deforestation, cattle farming, has been allowed to swallow up vast swathes of land, the authors argue.

Flaws in Colombian land regulation have incentivised the conversion of biodiverse tropical rainforests into barren pastures.

To get their deeds recognised, landowners must demonstrate that 75% of their plots are productive, and it is far easier for farmers to use cows than crops, said Carlos Devia, a forest engineer at BogotÃ¡'s Javeriana University who was not involved in the study.

""Ranching is the easiest way to show you're using land, as it's unregulated. You could have 100 hectares of land and just throw 10 cows in there, whereas for potatoes or corn only a hectare would require a year of great work,"" Devia said.

Landless farmers often clear a few hectares of rainforest and sell them illegally to members of criminal organisations who then join up multiple small lots, transforming them into vast swathes of lifeless, arid pasture.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who took office in August last year, is proposing a U-turn on Colombia's failed anti-narcotics strategy.

Petro, a former member of the defunct M-19 rebel group, has turned the focus away from forced coca eradication, and is buying up millions of hectares of land to give to farmers.

""Reducing drug use does not require wars, it needs us all to build a better society,"" Petro told the UN general assembly in September last year.

As scientists in the drought-stricken state worry about water use, winemakers believe grapes are the perfect crop for the dry land

The high desert of Arizona may seem like an odd place for wine tasting. But you wouldn't know it from the crowds that gathered at the Verde Valley Wine festival, two hours north of Phoenix, on a hot day in May.

As the sun beamed down, hundreds of wine lovers jostled for a spot to enjoy their drinks in the shade. On the edge of a lawn, producers offered up tastings, to-go bottles and cases of wine - much of it grown just down the road.

Kelley Ratliff and her husband drove three and half hours from Tucson for the festival. ""We love coming up here to spend the weekend,"" she said as she sipped a piquepoul from one of her favorite local vineyards, Chateau Tumbleweed.

The Ratliffs are part of a burgeoning fanbase for wine grown in this famously arid region. The Verde Valley is home to dozens of wineries making everything from assyrtiko to malbec, and wine tourism is already generating tens of millions of dollars for the state, according to a 2019 study by the University of Arizona.

But amid the clink of wine glasses, questions loom about whether Arizona is the right place to encourage the next Napa Valley. The US south-west is mired in a decades-long drought, the Colorado River basin is in crisis, and cities like Phoenix - which faced a record-breaking heatwave this summer - are limiting new construction over water concerns. Is there space for a luxury crop that typically relies on irrigation and, by some estimates, takes 29 gallons of water to produce one glass?

Winemakers argue that the Verde Valley - with its rich limestone soil, high altitudes, large aquifer and temperature shifts - is actually an ideal place to grow European-style wines. They also say that wine is a more water-efficient crop than others being grown here, such as alfalfa and corn.

Wine has been cultivated in arid regions since the start of civilization and needs very little water to grow. A variety of grape known as canyon grapes is native to parts of the south-west, including Arizona, Texas, Utah and Mexico, proving that the land is ripe with possibility. Grape growers in Arizona are finding ways to make it an even more efficient water crop, from developing more sustainable vineyard practices to tapping into their own water supply and growing more drought-resistant grape varietals.

While running out of water is ""a very real, stark concern"", wine could be an example of a low-water use crop that fits the dry Arizona climate, said Michael Pierce, viticulture and enology director at Yavapai Community College, home to the state's only wine program.

""I would argue it's probably the best crop you could grow [in Arizona],"" said Pierce. The land here is rocky, which grapes love, he said. ""Wine grapes love those really coarse soils. They don't like to have wet feet. Meaning you don't want soggy, clay rich soils that really hold water. So that's why they do well in arid places [like Arizona].""

Growing wine in an arid climate

The Verde Valley is pocketed with low-lying mesas that stand out against white limestone hills. Thanks to a wet winter and spring, the valley is a vibrant green this summer, with the area around the river full of lush cottonwood and sycamore trees. Alcantara Vineyard, positioned along the Verde River, is reminiscent of a vineyard in southern Europe, with a Spanish-style villa and small flowering grapevines growing 17 varieties including malbec, sangiovese, merlot, petite sirah and grenache.

Like most winemakers in Arizona, Alcantara Vineyards irrigates its vines using groundwater. Most winemakers here prefer irrigation to other methods, such as dry farming, when farmers rely on rainfall and moisture captured in the soil. Controlling the amount of water, they say, is crucial to getting superb fruit.

Ron Brumley, head winemaker at Alcantara Vineyard, came out of retirement four years ago to run the vineyard, which also includes kayaking, horse riding, a restaurant and doubles as a wedding venue. The vineyard gets its water from an ancient aquifer that comes off the Colorado Plateau.

""It is clean, as clear as Perrier, as Calistoga, as Fiji, unfiltered. It's mineral water it has seeped through the basalt, the volcanic. It's picked up the minerals of the Earth, it's been filtered. It is marvelous,"" he said.

As a fourth-generation Arizonian, his biggest concern is the water demands of Arizona's growing population, which rose 11.9% between 2010 and 2020. While Alcantara Vineyard has its own well and the rights to groundwater, Brumley is worried about state officials ""coming up here and taking the water"" and using it for housing developments in the Phoenix and Tucson area.

""They're gonna have a problem. Their aquifer is low. I don't have a problem up here,"" he said.

A few miles from Alcantara, Page Springs Cellars is finding ways to make its water stretch further. It comes from wells and a small spring, for which the vineyard is named, that runs across its vineyards and is maintained by the people who live in this small community.

""There's no regulatory body that controls it. It's absolutely gorgeous artesian spring water, our wells on-site tap into it,"" said Kelsey Hammond, sustainability coordinator at Page Springs Cellars.

The vineyard also uses drip irrigation that slowly releases water directly at the root of each plant, a method that is better for the fruit and less water intensive, Hammond said. The vineyard also makes its own compost that, over time, helps retain soil structure and moisture and avoids water runoff, she added.

Elsewhere in Arizona, some winemakers are feeling more of the squeeze.

Sam Pillsbury, a former New Zealand and American filmmaker, operates a vineyard in the Willcox Basin, a remote 2,000 sq mile area in the state's south-east. The sunny weather, cheap land and free, unregulated water supply have attracted farmers from around the US. Today it's one of the state's most productive agricultural regions, growing about 80% of Arizona grapes along with many other agricultural commodities, like corn, cotton, alfalfa and dairy, all putting a strain on the water supply. Some residential wells have run dry and the land has started to sink in spots due to overpumping of groundwater.

Pillsbury estimates he uses about 5ft of water a year. He recently had to drill a new 800ft for his Pillsbury Wine Company, where he grows everything from chardonnay to grenache, after his 450ft well started to dry up. He worries that one day, he'll have to drill even deeper.

""We're pulling more water out of the aquifer than there is,"" he said. ""Why should some big dairy company owned by people from another part of the world be sucking all the water?""

A battle over Arizona's water needs

The tension between grape growers, other farmers and urban development highlights the complex nature of water regulation and distribution in Arizona. Water here comes from two places: surface water from rivers, including the Colorado River, and groundwater from aquifers that lie deep in the bedrock.

Who gets to use that water depends on the type of water and where it's located. Cities like Phoenix and Tucson are in Active Management Areas (AMAs), which are subject to strict regulations for groundwater. In rural areas where Arizona's grapes are grown, such as the Verde Valley, Willcox and Sonoita, all that's required is registering a well and certifying the water will be put to beneficial use, such as farming. ""It's a literal free-for-all for groundwater pumping,"" said Christopher Kuzdas, senior water program manager at the Environmental Defense Fund.

Arizona today looked very different than when the AMA was passed in the 1980s, Kuzdas said. ""As the Colorado River shrinks, Arizona's reliance on groundwater is going to increase ""¦ But the challenge is we're not actually managing all the groundwater we have.""

Last year, voters rejected a citizen ballot initiative to create an AMA in the Willcox Basin, an initiative that would have limited water use for farmers. It would also have stopped new agricultural farms or vineyards hoping to expand, like Carlson Creek Vineyard, a 320-acre property off a dusty road owned by Robert Carlson III, where their most prolific grape is malbec, which he thinks is the future wine of Arizona. He's only planted 60 acres of vineyards and hopes to expand to all 320 acres in the future.

""We're not opposed to regulation. We just don't want it to be the laws that were written 43 years ago, because they don't take into account sustainability,"" said Carlson. ""If they were to just put a stop to all expansion of irrigation ... that land would basically be worthless.""

Still, many argue something needs to change. The climate crisis is making the region drier and weather patterns more extreme, leading to ""warmer growing seasons and greater water demands"", according to Jeremy Weiss, climate and geospatial extension scientist at the University of Arizona.

2020 and 2021 are good examples of what the future could look like. ""We went from record hot, record dry to near normal temperatures but record wet in the span of two different growing seasons back to back,"" Weiss said. ""The extremes are making themselves more extreme. How much of an extra challenge that makes for the growers?""

Winemakers argue they might be part of the solution.

Matt Halldorson, a viticultural researcher at the University of Arizona, points out that vineyards use an average of 1.5 acre-feet of water per year, or about 326,000 gallons of water. In comparison, alfalfa uses 4 to 9 acre-feet, while cotton requires around 4 acre-feet. ""It's an extremely water-efficient crop,"" Halldorson said.

Meanwhile, vintners have been experimenting with European grape varieties like barbera and viognier that might do even better in Arizona's dry and hot climate. This makes wine an ideal crop to help spur a conversation for best use practices when it comes to water use, advocates say.

""Because it's an arid climate, we need crops that want an arid climate, not something that you have to throw so much water on to change the climate around it,"" said Pierce as he walked among cases of wine grown and produced by his students, ready to be labeled and sold in the adjoining tasting room. ""I think wine grapes are positioned to really be a leader in that conversation of let's make better choices for the future.""

As tech changes the world, Ghana has the young experts to unlock the next industrial revolution, says the vice-president

As we see the artificial intelligence furore sweep across continents, one thing is clear: Africans have a goldmine at our fingertips. A rapidly growing population of 1.4 billion people, 70% under the age of 30, combined with huge growth in AI investments, creates a potent recipe for Africa. We will not sit back and wait for the rest of the world to reap our rewards.

Africa and the Middle East are set to see the fastest growth in AI spending worldwide, reaching $3bn (£2.4bn) this year and a predicted $6.4bn by 2026.

Africa missed the first, second and third industrial revolutions, but I am determined that our continent will not miss the fourth and fifth.

The piece in the puzzle that will make this a reality is data, driven by highly skilled national tech expertise, and private-sector investments. For every dollar invested in data systems, there is an average return of $32. Data is the lifeblood for making decisions and is what will unlock an independent, wealthy future for Africa, making sure that new economic opportunities are shared.

Since Google opened its first Africa-based AI research centre in Accra in 2019, we have already seen progress in agriculture, healthcare, education and more.

Farmers, in particular, are set to benefit. One project is helping Ghanaian cashew farmers use unmanned aerial vehicles in an AI-powered disease-detection innovation. The flying robots collect data from the leaves, stems and trunks of the cashew trees, allowing farmers to detect pest and disease symptoms before they become visible and lead to serious crop damage.

The initiative, funded by the German development agency GIZ, holds particular value because half of the world's cashew nuts are grown in Africa.

Another project uses AI to help smallholder farmers in Ghana predict post-harvest shortages and gluts. The technology aims to build better prediction models for crop yields that will give Ghana and the region far greater food security. Given the volatility of managing a smallholder farm, this project - run by the Ghanaian non-profit organisation AGRI-WEB - will help the farmers secure a more stable and sustainable income.

As the 33m smallholder farms in Africa contribute up to 70% of the food supply, the potentially transformative impact of this data-driven technology on livelihoods and food security across the region is vast.

During the pandemic, I saw first-hand how essential data is for us in shaping our decision-making. Through a project with the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data, Vodafone Ghana and others, our scientists gathered anonymised mobile phone data from across Ghana's districts. By looking at how the number of active users changed, we could see how effective lockdowns were in restricting people's movement. This was vital in telling us when to lift and when to renew measures. Having in-country experts who collect and analyse data holds enormous potential for African decision-makers.

With the growing numbers of young people being trained in data and AI in Ghana, we have a workforce ready to take on the tech revolution and drive progress and economic transformation across the continent. In 2021, Ghana's Academic City University College in Accra became the first African higher education institution to launch a degree in artificial intelligence.

But we, and the world, cannot sit back and wait. We must stay focused on growing and nurturing this workforce of data experts. As the AI acceleration changes the nature of work, we must prepare a generation of young people to be at the forefront of the revolution, leading Africa into this new era.

This year's global summits, from New Delhi to New York, provide a historic opportunity for a new way of doing development. In Ghana, we welcomed the Indian government's commitment to making data for development a priority at this year's G20 meeting.

But world leaders must show commitment to this agenda at the UN sustainable development goal summit in New York in September, focusing on funding, and building capacity development, skills and partnerships. Data is critical for Africa and the world to achieve the sustainable development goals. And yet decisions are still being made in the dark. For eight of the 17 goals, fewer than half of all countries have data to report.

There is no time to wait. I know that investing in private- and public-sector workforces and building joined-up data systems will unlock the potential opportunities that AI offers. This is what will break down the digital divide between countries and allow Ghana and our African neighbours to be in control of our own success.

It is critical that this revolution is driven by locally led solutions - and brains.

Mahamudu Bawumia is vice-president of Ghana and head of the government's Economic Management Team.

A miserable harvest in Florida has led to a fevered market some are likening to the GameStop run

Eddie Murphy jumps into Dan Aykroyd's arms, the pair shouting in delight. Playing Billy Ray Valentine and Louis Winthorpe, they've just gamed the orange juice futures market and are in line for a fortune as the denouement of 1983's Trading Places plays out.

Four decades on, the film and the breakfast drink commodity remain synonymous with the more esoteric corners of the stock market. But global investors have more reason than in most years to pay attention to orange juice trading over more conventional commodities such as oil, gas, wheat and metals. The price of OJ futures has surged of late, up 92% since the start of the year, relentlessly setting fresh highs.

The contracts, for future deliveries of frozen concentrated orange juice, traded on the Intercontinental Exchange in New York, were changing hands at $3.97 (£3.27) a pound on the spot market this week. Its part of a global market for ""soft commodities"", which includes everything from cocoa, sugar and coffee to soya beans and pork bellies.

The price rise has come as a result of a devastatingly poor orange harvest in Florida this year. The Sunshine State typically produces more than 90% of US orange crops annually, but producers have been hit by the combination of a long-term decline in the lucrative industry and the triple whammy of Hurricanes Ian and Nicole last autumn followed by freezing conditions. Production levels are expected to be the lowest level for more than a century this year.

The hurricanes wiped out about 10% of Florida's orange trees just as farmers began harvesting in September 2022, while an incurable citrus greening disease has been ravaging trees for years. The disease, also known as Huanglongbing or yellow dragon disease, typically kills off crops within five years. (In Trading Places, Murphy and Aykroyd use a fake crop report to scam the market. Wall Street eventually made it illegal to trade on inside information obtained from the government, in legislation nicknamed the ""Eddie Murphy rule"".)

Florida's travails have proved a boon for Brazil, the world's largest orange juice producer, which has been exporting record volumes to the US.

Like the traders in energy commodities, volatility and a vibrant market are as important as the actual spot price: the choppier the market, the higher the potential earnings. The investment case broadly runs: OJ is a bet on climate change and emerging markets. Unpredictable weather conditions - increased hurricane frequency in Florida, droughts in Brazil - spell supply shocks, and subsequent volatility. (OJ is not alone in being affected by this year's extreme weather, which climate scientists say is in line with their predictions of the impact of greenhouse gas emissions. For example, European olive oil supplies have been badly affected.)

Agricultural commodity trading has traditionally been controlled by the so-called ""ABCD group"", namely ADM, Bunge, Cargill and (Louis) Dreyfus. China's Cofco are also a significant player, in a high consolidated industry, with 10 commodity traders in 2020 dominating a market worth half a trillion dollars. In OJ, trading is dominated by dedicated arms of big producers, including Louis Dreyfus, the 172-year-old business now controlled by Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, head of a family worth $3.6bn. Brazil's Citrosuco and Cutrale - controlled by the Cutrale family - are also significant players.

For consumers, the biggest brands include PepsiCo's Tropicana, as well as supermarket own brands. The global orange juice industry is worth more than $6bn, and by 2027 it is expected to grow to $7.6bn, Market Watch estimates. Even as rampant grocery price inflation has cooled, UK fruit juice inflation was 11.5% last month.

Orange juice consumption has broadly fallen in western countries in recent decades, particularly in the US where it exploded in the 1940s when frozen orange juice concentrate took off (see: Minute Maid). The pandemic spurred a brief revival: sales jumped as consumers desperately sought ways to improve their immunity to Covid-19.

Producers hope a growing middle class in emerging markets could open up a new consumer base, but short-term consumption patterns appear to be returning to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, a surge in production in California - which could exceed Florida for the first time - may soon puncture high prices.

The futures rally has attracted the interests of day traders and social media users, who are now speculating on when the top of the market will land. Jay Kaeppel, a senior research analyst at Sentimentrader.com, says the price run bears comparison to huge spikes in the price of sugar in the 1970s, and silver later that decade - as well as the GameStop ""memestock"" shares surge (now immortalised at the box office in this autumn's Dumb Money).

""The problem is that trying to pick the top is like strapping yourself to a rocket headed higher and hoping it runs out of fuel. By the time it does, you may already be dead - financially in terms of trading, and literally in terms of actual rocket-riding,"" Kaeppel jokes.

Russ Mould, an investment director at AJ Bell, says: ""A lot of professional traders look at OJ for a living, so the chances of a private individual having an information edge on them are pretty slim.""

Kaeppel adds that short-sellers may be considering huge gains from any sharp sell-off, as well as further gains when any subsequent bounceback fades. If that happens, The Big Short may provide more apt Hollywood inspiration for investors than Trading Places.

Comm-oddities: some of traders' more unusual bets

Since the Dutch ""Tulipmania"" of the 17th century, financial bubbles have emerged around everything from rhodium to bitcoin, but somewhat less volatile niche markets have sprung up too. Here's some options for a varied investment portfolio:

Skimmed milk powder - ""SMP"", as it is known on trading floors, results from the partial removal of fat and water from pasteurised milk including UHT milk, cheeses and yoghurts. Prices have waned this year after hitting seven-year highs last year due to shortages in EU dairy production.

Sunflower seed futures - another hot agricultural trade, it has been spurred to record highs by ructions in global commodity markets caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Frost - weather futures may feel like betting on Liz Truss versus a lettuce, but frost, rainfall and snowfalll seasonal futures trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Some contracts are based on temperature differences from an average, others on number of days frost occurs, and others on the amount of snowfall in a given location.

644,"Microplastics detected in clouds hanging atop two Japanese mountains","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/09/microplastics-clouds-study-mount-fuji-mount-oyama","Microplastics detected in clouds hanging atop two Japanese mountains

Findings regarding clouds above Mount Fuji and Mount Oyama highlight how microplastics are highly mobile

Microplastics have been found everywhere from the oceans' depths to the Antarctic ice, and now new research has detected it in an alarming new location - clouds hanging atop two Japanese mountains.

The clouds around Japan's Mount Fuji and Mount Oyama contain concerning levels of the tiny plastic bits, and highlight how the pollution can be spread long distances, contaminating the planet's crops and water via ""plastic rainfall"".

The plastic was so concentrated in the samples researchers collected that it is thought to be causing clouds to form while giving off greenhouse gasses.

""If the issue of ""˜plastic air pollution' is not addressed proactively, climate change and ecological risks may become a reality, causing irreversible and serious environmental damage in the future,"" the study's lead author, Hiroshi Okochi, a professor at Waseda University, said in a statement.

The peer-reviewed paper was published in Environmental Chemistry Letters, and the authors believe it is the first to check clouds for microplastics.

The pollution is made up of plastic particles smaller than five millimeters that are released from larger pieces of plastic during degradation. They are also intentionally added to some products, or discharged in industrial effluent. Tires are thought to be among the main sources, as are plastic beads used in personal care products. Recent research has found them to be widely accumulating across the globe - as much as 10m tons are estimated to end up in the oceans annually.

Humans and animals ingest or inhale large amounts of microplastics, which have been detected in human lungs, brains, hearts, blood, placentas, and feces. Their toxicity is still being studied, but new research that exposed mice to microplastic points to health issues, like behavioral changes, and other studies have found links to cancer and irritable bowel syndrome.

Waseda researchers gathered samples at altitudes ranging between 1,300-3,776 meters, which revealed nine types of polymers, like polyurethane, and one type of rubber. The cloud's mist contained about 6.7 to 13.9 pieces of microplastics per litre, and among them was a large volume of ""water loving"" plastic bits, which suggests the pollution ""plays a key role in rapid cloud formation, which may eventually affect the overall climate"", the authors wrote in a press release.

That is potentially a problem because microplastics degrade much faster when exposed to ultraviolet light in the upper atmosphere, and give off greenhouse gasses as they do. A high concentration of these microplastics in clouds in sensitive polar regions could throw off the ecological balance, the authors wrote.

The findings highlight how microplastics are highly mobile and can travel long distances through the air and environment. Previous research has found the material in rain, and the study's authors say the main source of airborne plastics may be seaspray, or aerosols, that are released when waves crash or ocean bubbles burst. Dust kicked up by cars on roads is another potential source, the authors wrote.

Life on planet is in peril, say climate experts, as they call for a rapid and just transition to a sustainable future

Earth's ""vital signs"" are worse than at any time in human history, an international team of scientists has warned, meaning life on the planet is in peril.

Their report found that 20 of the 35 planetary vital signs they use to track the climate crisis are at record extremes. As well as greenhouse gas emissions, global temperature and sea level rise, the indicators also include human and livestock population numbers.

Many climate records were broken by enormous margins in 2023, including global air temperature, ocean temperature and Antarctic sea ice extent, the researchers said. The highest monthly surface temperature ever recorded was in July and was probably the hottest the planet has been in 100,000 years.

The scientists also highlighted an extraordinary wildfire season in Canada that produced unprecedented carbon dioxide emissions. These totalled 1bn tonnes of CO2, equivalent to the entire annual output of Japan, the world's fifth biggest polluter. They said the huge area burned could indicate a tipping point into a new fire regime.

The researchers urged a transition to a global economy that prioritised human wellbeing and cut the overconsumption and excessive emissions of the rich. The top 10% of emitters were responsible for almost 50% of global emissions in 2019, they said.

Dr Christopher Wolf, at Oregon State University (OSU) in the US and a lead author of the report, said: ""Without actions that address the root problem of humanity taking more from Earth than it can safely give, we're on our way to the potential collapse of natural and socioeconomic systems and a world with unbearable heat and shortages of food and freshwater.

""By 2100, as many as 3 billion to 6 billion people may find themselves outside Earth's livable regions, meaning they will be encountering severe heat, limited food availability and elevated mortality rates.""

Prof William Ripple, also at OSU, said: ""Life on our planet is clearly under siege. The statistical trends show deeply alarming patterns of climate-related variables and disasters. We also found little progress to report as far as humanity combating climate change.

""Our goal is to communicate climate facts and make policy recommendations. It is a moral duty of scientists and our institutions to alert humanity of any potential existential threat and to show leadership in taking action.""

The analysis, published in the journal Bioscience, is an update of a 2019 report that has been endorsed by 15,000 scientists.

""For several decades, scientists have consistently warned of a future marked by extreme climatic conditions caused by ongoing human activities,"" the report says. ""Unfortunately, time is up ""¦ we are pushing our planetary systems into dangerous instability.""

Prof Tim Lenton, at the University of Exeter in the UK, the co-author, said: ""These record extremes are alarming in themselves, and they are also in danger of triggering tipping points that could do irreversible damage and further accelerate climate change.

""Our best hope to prevent a cascade of climate tipping points is to identify and trigger positive tipping points in our societies and economies, to ensure a rapid and just transition to a sustainable future.""

The scientists said: ""We are shocked by the ferocity of the extreme weather events in 2023, [which caused] profoundly distressing scenes of suffering to unfold. We are afraid of the uncharted territory that we have now entered.""

The report highlighted severe flooding in China and India, extreme heatwaves in the US and an exceptionally intense Mediterranean storm led to the deaths of thousands of people in Libya.

The report said that by mid-September, there had been 38 days with global average temperatures more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, which is the world's long-term goal for limiting the climate crisis. Until this year, such days were a rarity, the researchers said.

Other policies recommended by the scientists included phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, ramping up forest protection, a shift towards plant-based diets in wealthy countries and adopting international treaties to end new coal projects and phase out oil and gas.

""We also call to stabilise and gradually decrease the human population with gender justice through voluntary family planning and by supporting women's and girls' education and rights, which reduces fertility rates,"" they said.

""Big problems need big solutions. Therefore, we must shift our perspective on the climate emergency from being just an isolated environmental issue to a systemic, existential threat. Although global heating is devastating, it represents only one aspect of the escalating and interconnected environmental crisis that we are facing - eg, biodiversity loss, fresh water scarcity, and pandemics.""

Dr Glen Peters, at the Global Carbon Project, said recently that the preliminary estimate for global CO2 emissions in 2023 was a rise of 1% to yet another record. Global emissions must fall by 45% to have a good chance of staying under 1.5C of heating.

In September, a different analysis of the Earth system using nine planetary boundaries concluded that this planet's life support systems had been so damaged that Earth was ""well outside the safe operating space for humanity"". The planetary boundaries are the limits of key global systems - such as climate, water and wildlife diversity - beyond which their ability to maintain a healthy planet is in danger of failing.

Technology has the potential to make deep cuts to emissions of the potent greenhouse gas but requires major investment

Bacteria that consume the greenhouse gas methane could slow the rate of global heating, according to a study out this week.

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas emitted from energy (natural gas and petroleum systems), industry, agriculture, land use and waste management activities.

Now a group of researchers from the University of Washington are proposing a method of removing methane by using a group of bacteria known as methanotrophs to naturally convert methane to carbon dioxide and biomass. All the bacteria in this group """"˜eat' methane, removing it from air and converting part of it to cells as a source of sustainable protein,"" according to the lead researcher, Mary E Lidstrom.

Lidstrom's team have found a strain of bacteria within this group called methylotuvimicrobium buryatense 5GB1C that can remove methane efficiently even when it is present in lower amounts. If it became widespread, the technology has the potential to help slow global heating, the researchers said.

Typically, this group of bacteria thrive in environments with high levels of methane (between 5,000 and 10,000 parts per million (ppm)). The normal concentrations in our atmosphere have much lower levels of only about 1.9 ppm of methane. But certain areas such as landfills, rice fields and oilwells emit higher concentrations of about 500 ppm.

""Bacteria that rapidly eat methane at the higher concentrations found around cattle herds, etc could make a huge contribution to cutting methane emissions, especially from tropical agriculture,"" said Euan Nisbet, professor of Earth sciences at Royal Holloway, University of London, commenting on the findings of the study.

The strain's high methane consumption rate is probably due to a low energy requirement and greater attraction for methane - more than five times more than that of other bacteria, according to the study.

""The bacteria oxidise the methane to CO2 (a much less powerful greenhouse gas) and so you can even use the exhaust to pump into greenhouses and grow tomatoes,"" said Nisbet.

""The biggest barrier to implementation now is technical: we need to increase the methane treatment unit 20-fold. If we can achieve that, then the biggest barriers become investment capital and public acceptance. We believe we could have field pilots tested within three to four years, and scale up would then depend on investment capital and commercialisation,"" said Lidstrom.

The agriculture sector is the largest source of methane emissions due to livestock manure and gastroenteric releases. Methane has more than 85 times the warming power of carbon dioxide over the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere, and poses a particular problem as a greenhouse gas. Atmospheric methane has been rising rapidly over the past 15 years, reaching record highs, and currently accounts for at least 30% of total global heating. In 2021 several of the world's largest economies agreed at Cop26 to work together to urgently reduce methane levels. However, they continue to rise.

To implement methane-eating bacteria on a mass scale, thousands of high-functioning reactors will be needed.

""This may be daunting but if our survival depends on lowering atmospheric methane now the cost may be a lower priority in allocating resources. Lack of political will and understanding in the private and public sectors about the urgency of the need to reduce methane now will make global heating even worse in coming years,"" said Mary Ann Bruns, professor of soil microbiology at Pennsylvania State University.

Currently, most proposed methane reduction solutions are focused on decreasing emissions but this is not always possible. Researchers stress that both methane removal and decreased emissions strategies are needed to meet climate targets. However, Lidstrom warns that any emissions reduction strategies that enhance bacterial activity in natural communities may also result in increased nitrous oxide (N2O) emission, which has 10 times the global heating potential than that of methane. Critically, this methanotrophic bacteria-based technology does not produce nitrous oxide emissions.

Recent projections predicted that global heating can be reduced 0.21C to 0.22C by removing 0.3 to 1 petagrams of methane by 2050. Temperature decreases of this magnitude are predicted to be significant especially when combined with other emissions reduction strategies.

Award-winning Catalan peach farm drama AlcarrÃ s joins an impressive crop of movies""‹ about living off the land""‹, from Minari and The Grapes of Wrath to Babe

We're officially into spring now, a time when even lifelong city-dwellers like me start entertaining bucolic thoughts. Pleasing as it is to see daffodils blooming in a London park, the seasonal rewards of new life and renewed warmth are always best illustrated in a farming environment.

Which isn't to over-romanticise the farming world: Spanish director Carla SimÃ³n's lovely AlcarrÃ s (2022; now streaming on Mubi and coming to DVD on Monday) certainly doesn't. Earthy and angry, this portrait of a Catalan peach-farming family being forced off the land they've held for generations captures the occasional, elemental rewards of agricultural life, but also its punishing grind - and thus fits into a rich tradition of films where the dramatic stakes, tensions and catharses all derive from the unpredictability of living off the land.

French director Jean Renoir travelled to America to make one of the great examples of the form in his 1945 film The Southerner (free on Plex), in which a Texan cotton-picker sets out to establish his own cotton farm with little more than seed in his pocket. It's an American dream story that Renoir nonetheless de-sentimentalises with a tactile sense of soil and struggle. It would pair well, in fact, with a more recent tale of forging a future from nothing in US farm country. Drawing inspiration from Willa Cather's rural immigrant saga My Ãntonia, Lee Isaac Chung's wistful Minari (2021) doubles down on the American dream theme by focusing on a family of South Korean immigrants, but doesn't offer them a simple, rosy path to self-realisation.

Both films are positively idyllic, of course, next to John Ford's sinewy, sorrowful adaptation of Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath (1940), a Depression-era study of sharecroppers turned migrant workers that doesn't stint on the novel's visceral sense of struggle - and works toward the most conditional of happy endings as its beleaguered hero's eyes open to the cause of workers' rights. Foreclosures and flooding are the obstacles impeding a Tennessee farming family in the underrated, pleasingly classical 1984 saga The River, which presents their plight as equal parts tragedy and adventure - increasingly closing in on the doughty farm wife (a fine Sissy Spacek, oddly paired with Mel Gibson) holding everything together.

Drifting far from the states, Filipino director Lav Diaz made one of the essential modern farming epics with his gargantuan, experimental 2005 film Evolution of a Filipino Family (Mubi). Filmed over the course of a decade, it charts the variable rise, fall and rise of an impoverished farming family, mapping their fortunes against that of the Philippines at large. It clocks in at a whopping 10-plus hours too: you may prefer to treat it as a miniseries. It has hybrid documentary elements, though if you're after pure nonfiction in your farm films, look to the gutsy, stoically moving family survival study Troublesome Creek: A Midwestern - a big Sundance winner in the mid-90s - or Andrea Arnold's recent Cow (free on BBC iPlayer), an uncompromising bovine-eye view of the dairy farming industry.

Not that all such films (farmadramas, if you will) have to be downbeat. The irresistible talking-animal fable Babe (1995) remains cinema's great example (in the continued absence of a good Charlotte's Web adaptation) of a farm setting as a playground for childhood whimsy. The wordless, deadpan slapstick of Aardman's glorious Shaun the Sheep Movie (2015) takes that to a sillier place still.

For adults, farm life serves as a mere cosy backdrop to the daffy, horny entanglements of English eccentrics in John Schlesinger's manic 1995 film version of Stella Gibbons's Cold Comfort Farm (free on ITVX), while Francis Lee's Yorkshire sheep-farmer romance God's Own Country (2017) serves up substantially more realism in its portrayal of windswept life on the moors, but doesn't let weather or hardship get in the way of a heart-swelling happy ending.

Clothes made from regenerative fibre farming practices are hard to find. We talk to the designers at the forefront of ""˜the future of fashion'

~

Much like the term ""sustainable"", ""regenerative"" is increasingly used in vague ways in fashion marketing. For a garment to be truly regenerative, the raw materials must have been farmed without synthetic fertilisers or pesticides using techniques that restore the health of the soil, improve ecosystem functionality, water cycles and biodiversity.

A regenerative system provides better outcomes for the farmers and communities along the supply chain. But on a broader scale, regenerative agriculture has been described as integral to the future of fashion.

In the industry, the transition to regenerative fibre farming is only just getting under way, meaning regenerative fashion can be hard to find, and often, eye-wateringly expensive - an unfortunate reality of sustainable supply chains as they work to compete with fast-fashion business models. Here are some designers who already have regenerative garments in their collections.

Angel Chang

Made by indigenous artisans in the mountainous province of Guizhou in China, every garment produced by Angel Chang is regenerative. Her collection is made with native seed cotton that has been grown without chemicals and dyed with locally harvested indigo and gardenia.

Chang says her favourite piece ""is literally called my favourite shirt"". The shirt is entirely handmade: the cotton is hand-spun into yarn then woven into fabric on a handloom, while the shirt is hand-stitched together.

""The cotton is unprocessed and unbleached - so the oil of the seed is retained on the fibre and keeps the fabric soft,"" she says. ""By strictly following the traditional processes [of the Miao and Dong ethnic minority grandmothers] we have created clothing with a nearly zero carbon footprint.""

A.BCH

Courtney Holm has worked extensively to produce truly low- or positive-impact clothing for her Melbourne-based label A.BCH. The brand's linen shirt is made from 100% global organic textile standard certified linen, grown in France by a collective of organic-flax farmers. Flax generally grows with minimal irrigation and when farmed without chemical fertilisers and pesticides can be a carbon sink (that is, the flax plants can absorb more CO2 than they emit).

The first stage of processing the linen is done locally. Then the fibres are spun into yarn in Hungary and the yarns are sent to Belgium where they're woven in a carbon neutral mill and whitened with low-impact oxygen whiteners. ""Our Belgian linen supplier has been milling linen since 1864 and are recognised by The Masters of Linen,"" says Holm.

From there, the linen is sent to A.BCH's Melbourne factory where it's cut and sown into the A.05 linen shirt, a mainstay of the label's collection since its launch in 2017. While the shipment of fabric from Europe to Melbourne may seem like a lot of carbon emissions for a low-impact garment, most fabric in the industry travels much further to be converted from raw material to textile, and currently, there is no flax grown and processed in Australia.

Another Tomorrow

""We believe that impact starts at fibre,"" the CEO of New York-based label Another Tomorrow, Vanessa Barboni Hallik, says. Take, for example, the tuxedo jacket, which forms part of her ""daily uniform"".

The jacket is made with wool from a Responsible Wool Standard certified farm in Victoria, Australia. RWS certification requires farms to uphold the highest standards of animal welfare, so no mulesing is allowed. Farmers must use progressive land management techniques that protect soil health, biodiversity and native species.

""We have six farms now in our portfolio across Australia and New Zealand with deep commitments to biodiversity, carbon management and extremely stringent animal welfare standards,"" says Barboni Hallik.

Maggie Marilyn

""We love merino for its temperature-regulating properties, its durability,"" says Maggie Hewitt. The New Zealand designer is renowned for integrating the highest standards of sustainability and traceability into her merino knitwear label Maggie Marilyn. Her collection is made with ZQRX certified merino wool - that is, grown in New Zealand by producers whose farming techniques restore waterways, protect native species, offset carbon, and enhance local communities.

For Hewitt, the certification is notable for its ambition, and describes it as ""a measure beyond sustainability, where the aim is continuous improvement - not a minimum standard.""

KitX

Kit Willow, the founder of Sydney based clothing label KitX, is a pioneer of sustainable fashion who describes hemp as a fibre of the future.

Hemp is an extremely resilient crop that grows with minimal irrigation and without synthetic pesticides or fertilisers. Because of its deep taproot system it can pull toxins from the soil, while research suggests industrial hemp can be twice as effective than trees in sequestering carbon.

In the KitX collection, the ""hemp tee"" is made from a hemp-cotton blend fabric knitted in Melbourne and constructed in Sydney using Citizen Wolf's zero-waste production technology.

Mara Hoffman

While Mara Hoffman's headquarters are in New York, all their wool knitwear and accessories are made using ""climate beneficial"" wool from Emigh ranch in northern California.

The wool is part of a wider regenerative agricultural program by not-for-profit Fibershed. Mara Hoffman's vice-president of sustainability, produce and business strategy, Dana David, describes the main stakeholders of the initiative as scientists and community organisers who measure how fibre ecosystems adapt to and mitigate climate change. They are focused on giving ranchers and farmers the tools needed to practise carbon farming; and to put in place land stewardship efforts such as prescribed grazing, creating pollinator habitats, restoring creeks and a host of farming techniques known to support healthy soils.

""These practices aid in sequestering carbon back into the soil and vegetation, which removes carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, enriches the soil and helps to restore healthy ecosystems,"" says David. The wool from these landscapes have been turned into a line of beautiful, soft knitwear for Mara Hoffman's collection.

Joslin

The creative director of Melbourne-based label Joslin, Elinor McInnes, is renowned for her love of linen. So much so, Joslin only works with suppliers and textile mills that have received European Flax certification. This ensures a commitment to farming that respects the environment and commits to zero irrigation, non-GMO seed and low waste. She says ""[the] linen is a renewable resource, grown from rainwater, that can be produced without damaging the environment.""

From the field to the fibre, the production of Joslin's linen is fully traceable. The combed flax is exported from Europe to a mill in Jiangsu, China where it is spun and woven into batiste cloth.

Since the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement banks have provided some $3.2tn to the fossil fuel industry to expand operations

Banks are pouring trillions of dollars into the expansion of the world's most emitting industries in the global south, according to a new report.

Developing countries are often on the frontlines of the climate crisis yet lack the resources to enact climate action plans. As such, they require trillions of dollars in aid to decarbonize their economies and adapt to a warming world.

But financial firms are helping to push such countries in the opposite direction, the Monday analysis from international non-governmental organization ActionAid argues.

""They say that money makes the world go round, but money is making the world go backwards,"" Teresa Anderson, global lead on climate justice for ActionAid International, told reporters.

For the report, ActionAid worked with the international trade consulting company Profundo to compile data on major international banks' loans and underwriting to fossil fuel and agribusiness corporations.

They found that between 2016 and 2022, those banks have provided some $3.2tn to the fossil fuel industry to expand operations in the global south.

The leading fossil fuel financiers include Chinese banks funding coal, oil and gas buildout within the nation. Top US banks like Citigroup, Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase have also offered trillions to Saudi Aramco, Exxon and other fossil fuel companies for fossil fuel activity in developing countries in regions such as South America and Africa.

In that same time span, the analysis says, major international banks have also loaned and underwritten at least $370bn for the expansion of global south-based industrial agriculture. Europe's HSBC and the United States' Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup lead the pack, offering billions of dollars to big agricultural giants like Bayer (which acquired Monsanto in 2016), ADM, Cargill and ChemChina.

Industrial agriculture is the second-most planet-heating industry globally, due to pollution from the production and use of chemical fertilizers, methane emissions from livestock, and the widespread practice of clearing carbon-sequestering greenery to make space for farms, the report explains.

""Industrial agriculture has somehow stayed out of the limelight and we feel that that needs to change for climate reasons,"" said Anderson.

The research, Anderson said, highlights the disconnect between financial institutions' public statements on climate change and their actions.

""Global banks often make public declarations that they are addressing climate change, but the scale of their continued financing of fossil fuels and industrial agriculture is simply staggering,"" she said.

A separate Sierra Club analysis published last week found that major global banks have announced climate pledges but nonetheless financed coal energy across the US.

Some banks have updated their climate policies in recent years. Citigroup, for example, last year set emissions reductions targets for its energy financing and pledged to set similar targets for its agricultural loans by 2025.

And Gina Bartlett, a spokesperson for HSBC, said the bank updated its energy finance policy in December.

""Our updated energy policy, means that HSBC will no longer provide new finance or advisory services for the specific purposes of projects pertaining to new oil and gas fields, or related infrastructure in environmentally critical areas,"" she said, adding that separate forestry and agricultural commodities policies ""make it clear that HSBC will not provide financial services to customers directly involved in, or sourcing from suppliers, involved in deforestation"".

But between 2016 and 2022, the report says, international banks spent an average of $513bn annually on fossil fuels and industrial agriculture combined. That massive stream of funding dwarfs the amount of money global north countries have funneled to global south countries to help slash emissions and support climate adaptation.

Across the same timespan, global north governments have collectively spent just $22.25bn on international climate finance on average each year. It's a sign that the causes of the climate crisis are receiving far more support than the solutions to it, the analysis says.

""The scale-up in the funding for fossil fuels really doesn't make sense when we, and most of us in this world, are in this planetary crisis,"" Farah Kabir, who leads ActionAid's advocacy in Bangladesh, said.

Lorne Stockman, research director at non-profit Oil Change International, who studies the climate implications of investments, did not work on the report but said the data is ""important"".

""Many fossil-fuel projects wouldn't be able to be developed without the financial institutions backing them,"" she said.

Discussions about sustainable investment and development, she said, will fail if investments aren't redirected.

The new report's authors call for global north governments to increase no-strings-attached public grants for renewable energy, low-carbon regenerative agriculture and climate adaptation plans in poorer nations, and also to increase regulations on the financial sector in an effort to decrease funding to polluting industries.

""We need the banks that are funding this crisis to stop funding climate destruction, and we need governments to step up so that they can provide money in a way that is fast and fair,"" Amerasinghe said.

Basav Sen, climate policy director at the Institute for Policy Studies, who did not work on the report, said that because the report quantifies banks' responsibility for the proliferation of fossil fuels and agriculture in the global south, it could also be used to bring about accountability.

""These perverse financial flows should be accounted for in calculations of how much reparations wealthy countries owe to the global south to fulfill their historical responsibility for climate change,"" he said.

BASF among firms selling chemicals to sugar industry despite links to human health risks

Pesticides banned in the EU because of their links to human health risks are being exported and used on farms in Brazil supplying NestlÃ©, an investigation has revealed.

Europe is home to some of the world's biggest and most profitable chemical companies, including the Swiss-based Syngenta and the German multinationals BASF and Bayer.

But a number of the pesticides and fungicides they produce have been banned by European health officials after they were linked to cancer, reproductive problems and neurodegenerative diseases.

Despite the ban, millions of pounds worth of the products are still being exported to Brazil, where they are used on farms that supply the international sugar market, according to a new investigation by Lighthouse Reports and RepÃ³rter Brasil.

Documents from the Brazilian agriculture ministry obtained through a freedom of information request reveal that a fungicide made by BASF and based on epoxiconazole, a chemical banned in the EU, was sprayed over two sugar plantations that supply NestlÃ©.

One of the farms using this banned fungicide is part of the giant Brazilian sugar corporation Copersucar, which sold â‚¬1bn (£880m) of sugar to Europe in 2020.

In SÃ£o Paulo state, Usina Atena, a Brazilian sugar plantation, is under investigation after a complaint from a neighbouring resident about the health impacts from the spraying of chemicals on the farm.

Justice ministry officials in SÃ£o Paulo found the farm had the Syngenta fungicide Priori Xtra. This contains the active substance cyproconazole, which is banned for use in the EU.

They also found the insecticide Regent 800WG, produced by BASF, and Certero, made by Bayer, which include the active ingredients fipronil and triflumuron. Both substances are banned in the EU.

The ECHA has classed epoxiconazole as a suspected carcinogen, and similar concerns were highlighted by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).

Marcos Orellana, UN special rapporteur on toxics and human rights, called the continued export of the chemicals by EU-based companies an ""abhorrent practice"" and urged the EU to implement a ban.

CropLife International, which represents agri-chemical companies including BASF, Bayer and Syngenta, said the active ingredients in the pesticides had ""valid use registrations in several OECD countries"".

It said in a statement: ""A non-registration or deregistration in the European Union does not automatically mean a product cannot be used in another country. Pesticides are not automatically ""˜more hazardous' or ""˜less necessary' because they are not authorised in Europe.""

Bayer and BASF maintain that all their products are safe for humans and the environment.

Copersucar said it complied with Brazilian and international legislation, exporting its products within safety standards in the regions where it operates.

A spokesperson for NestlÃ© said all its suppliers must meet NestlÃ©'s responsible sourcing standard, including in relation to good agricultural practices. ""We continue to closely follow regulatory developments everywhere we operate to ensure full compliance for all our products. NestlÃ© is not involved in campaigning against an export ban on pesticides and active ingredients banned in the EU.""

Officials at DG Sante, the EU body responsible for regulating pesticides, said the export of banned pesticides would be phased out in line with the chemicals strategy for sustainability, although no timetable had been set for implementation.

This article was amended on 25 April 2023. Although fipronil and triflumuron have been banned in the EU they have not been identified as potential carcinogens.

Climate commissioner says pace of reductions needs to speed up in buildings, transport and agriculture to meet 55% target by 2030

The EU must cut greenhouse gas pollution almost three times more quickly than it has over the past decade to meet its climate targets, a European Commission report has said.

In an attempt to stop weather growing more extreme, the EU has promised to pump 55% less planet-heating gas into the air in 2030 than it did in 1990. But over the past three decades it has cut emissions by just 32%, leaving behind ""significant gaps"" for the next seven years, the commission found in its latest State of the Energy Union report.

Current policies will cut emissions in 2030 by just 43%, according to new estimates from the European Environment Agency project. The figure rises to 48% if they include policies that have been planned but not yet put in place, but still leave a deficit in climate action of seven percentage points.

""To fully achieve these targets, the pace of emissions reductions needs to step up,"" said Wopke Hoekstra, the EU's new climate commissioner.

The commission report praised efforts to quickly ditch gas from Russia in the wake of its war in Ukraine, which rapidly pushed up energy prices. The EU slashed imports of Russian gas from 155bn cubic metres in 2021 to 80bn cubic metres in 2022 and to an estimated 40-45bn cubic metres in 2023.

The EU also oversaw a boom in clean technologies such as wind turbines and solar panels, the report found, but the commission cautioned that renewable energy needed to grow much faster than it had over the past decade. On average, the share of renewables in European energy has grown 0.67 percentage points each year to hit 21.8% in 2021. Reaching the EU target of 42.5% by the end of the decade ""will require a much faster growth in the coming years"", the report found.

Emissions are falling steadily but three things stand out, said Hoekstra. ""One, significant emissions cuts are needed in buildings and transport. Progress in these sectors has been sluggish at best. Two, the natural carbon sink needs to grow. In certain places the carbon sink has become a source of emissions, and that is worrying. And three, we need much more substantial progress in cutting emissions in agriculture.""

Hoekstra, a former employee of oil firm Shell and consultancy McKinsey, also said fossil fuel subsidies were ""unhelpful"" for the clean energy transition and reminded national governments of their promises to get rid of them.

Most EU member states responded to the energy crisis by making it easier for people and industries to buy and burn fossil fuels. Subsidies surged to â‚¬123bn in 2022, half of which do not have an end date this decade, the report found.

At the Cop28 climate summit next month the EU has said it will push for a global phaseout of unabated fossil fuels - ie those where the planet-heating gases emitted are not captured - and certain subsidies.

Hoekstra said: ""In the Cop28 mandate, all member states - I'll say again, all member states - agreed fossil fuel subsidies that do not address either energy poverty or the just transition must be phased out as soon as possible.""

Several European governments have dragged their feet on climate action in recent months despite prodding from the EU. Only a handful of member states met the commission's June deadline for submitting their draft climate and energy plans and action plans are still missing from three of the five biggest polluters: Germany, France and Poland.

According to a new report from the European branch of campaign group Climate Action Network (CAN), the policies in the drafts that were submitted are not enough to keep the planet from heating by 1.5C above preindustrial levels. They are also too weak to comply with minimum EU climate and energy requirements for 2030.

Chiara Martinelli, the director of CAN Europe, called on governments in the EU to ""match the magnitude of the challenge"" in their action plans. ""This report starkly highlights the glaring contrast between the urgent demand for accelerated climate action and the sluggish on-ground progress.""

668,"Experts call for ""˜loss and damage' fund for nature in developing world","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/29/loss-and-damage-fund-nature-developing-world-aoe","Experts call for ""˜loss and damage' fund for nature in developing world

Rich nations should pay for biodiversity loss, which disproportionately affects poor countries, say scientists

Wealthy countries should pay for the loss and damage they cause to nature in poorer countries in the same way as for climate impacts, researchers have argued.

At the Cop27 climate talks in November, world leaders agreed to a dedicated ""loss and damage"" fund providing financial assistance to poor nations stricken by climate disaster. More developed countries, which are largely responsible for driving climate breakdown, are to pay compensation to poorer nations, which are typically more vulnerable to its impacts.

Now researchers are arguing a similar fund should be created for nature loss. This is because habitat loss and overexploitation of resources in poor countries is driven by consumption in the global north, researchers argue in a comment piece published in Nature Ecology & Evolution. The trade agreements between the two are based on historical injustices and power imbalances.

Researchers state: ""Global biodiversity loss has been disproportionately driven by consumption of people in rich nations. The concept of ""˜loss and damage' - familiar from international agreements on climate breakdown - should be considered for the effects of biodiversity loss in countries of the global south.""

Like climate breakdown, loss of wildlife has significant social and economic impacts. As a result of the expansion of destructive mining, agriculture and deforestation by wealthy nations, people in poorer nations often have fewer natural resources to feed themselves, fewer opportunities to generate an income, and have a loss of cultural values, according to the researchers.

EU fleets overfishing in west Africa to feed consumers in Europe is an example, with researchers saying this has caused ""considerable negative impacts on local communities who are reliant on fish for income and for food, resulting in poverty, unemployment, declining health and social stress in the local communities"". In the UK, a recent government report calculated that our domestic consumption of crop, cattle and timber commodities was associated with 35,977 hectares (88,863 acres) of tropical deforestation in 2018.

""It's the most vulnerable, poorest people that are the hardest hit by biodiversity loss and need extra support in dealing with its impacts. That's the issue,"" says the lead author, Dr Dilys Roe, from the International Institute for Environment and Development in London. ""There are these additional losses and damages which aren't linked to climate change, and aren't currently taken into account.""

With the climate, the ""polluter pays"" principle is based on the notion that those who produce pollution should bear the costs of reducing its damage to human health and the environment. Researchers are exploring the idea of ""consumer pays"" for biodiversity: those who consume natural resources (ie timber, meat) should pay for the impacts. ""The first step is opening up the discussion about this and whether the principle of ""˜consumer pays' is a valid principle in the same way as ""˜polluter pays',"" says Roe.

At Cop15 in Montreal last year, it was agreed rich nations should pay more to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, but there was no discussion of compensation for historical losses. ""I think the issue of biodiversity loss is several years, if not decades, behind climate change discussions,"" said Roe. ""We lament the loss of species and beautiful rainforests, etc, without necessarily thinking through the social implications of that and what this actually means for people on the ground. Biodiversity loss is a social issue and a development issue as much as an environmental issue.""

Roe has not explored how it could be implemented, including if nature loss could be incorporated into existing climate funding for loss and damage because of the links between them. The piece does not explore how, or where compensation should be given, or how much would be appropriate.

Dr Sarah Dalrymple, a conservation ecologist from Liverpool John Moores University, who was not involved in the paper, agreed with the premise. She said: ""Nature conservation isn't just about preserving ecosystems and species, but also needs to embed social justice at its core - that's why I would support the incorporation of the principle of loss and damage into global agreements addressing biodiversity loss.""

Powder produced by ice sheets could be used to help tackle climate crisis when spread on farm fields

Rock ""flour"" produced by the grinding under Greenland's glaciers can trap climate-heating carbon dioxide when spread on farm fields, research has shown for the first time.

Natural chemical reactions break down the rock powder and lead to CO2 from the air being fixed in new carbonate minerals. Scientists believe measures to speed up the process, called enhanced rock weathering (ERW), have global potential and could remove billions of tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere, helping to prevent extreme global heating.

Soil fertility naturally depends on rock weathering to provide essential nutrients, so enhancing the process delivers an extra benefit. Spreading the Greenland rock flour on fields in Denmark, including those growing barley for the Carlsberg brewery, significantly increased yields.

Greenland's giant ice sheet produces 1bn tonnes a year of rock flour, which flows as mud from under the glaciers. This means the potential supply of rock flour is essentially unlimited, the researchers said, and removing some would have very little effect on the local environment.

The weathering process is relatively slow, taking decades to complete, but the researchers said ERW could make a meaningful difference in meeting the key target of net zero emissions by 2050. Phasing out the burning of fossil fuels remains the most critical climate action, but most scientists agree that ways of removing CO2 from the atmosphere will also be needed to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis.

""If you want something to have a global impact, it has to be very simple,"" said Prof Minik Rosing at the University of Copenhagen, who was part of the research team. ""You can't have very sophisticated things with all kinds of hi-tech components. So the simpler the better, and nothing is simpler than mud.""

He added: ""Above all this is a scalable solution. Rock flour has been piling up in Greenland for the past 8,000 years or so. The whole Earth's agricultural areas could be covered with this, if you wished.""

Other researchers are investigating the use of mechanically ground rock for ERW. ""But unlike other sources, glacial rock flour does not need any processing,"" said Dr Christiana Dietzen, also at the University of Copenhagen. The rock flour weathers extremely slowly in the cold conditions in Greenland, but the process speeds up when it is spread in warmer places.

The research on the CO2 uptake of Greenland rock flour, published in the International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control, estimated that 250kg of CO2 can be trapped per tonne of rock flour. After three years in soil in Denmark, the researchers found about 8% of this had been achieved. The scientists also calculated that 27m tonnes of CO2 could be captured if all farmland in Denmark was spread with the rock flour, an amount similar to the country's total annual CO2 emissions.

Another study by the same team, published in the journal Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems, showed increases in yields of maize and potatoes of 24% and 19% respectively after rock flour was spread in Denmark. Dietzen hopes the first commercial applications will be spread within three years.

The team is also running experiments in less fertile soils, in Ghana, where even greater increases in maize yield have been seen. ""In environments like Ghana, the fertiliser benefit alone may be enough reason to import glacial rock flour,"" Dietzen said, though the impact of transporting the rock flour long distances from Greenland would have to be weighed up.

Other ERW research has used mechanically ground basalt and a 2020 study estimated that treating about half of global farmland with this could capture 2bn tonnes of CO2 each year, equivalent to the combined emissions of Germany and Japan.

Prof David Beerling at the University of Sheffield, who led the 2020 work, said basalt had significant advantages. Its chemical composition absorbs CO2 faster than glacial rock flour, may increase crop yields by more and it is widely available close to many farming areas. ""We need all the weapons we can muster in the fight against climate change and my sense is that glacial rock flour could be a useful one,"" he said. ""But it is not a gamechanger.""

However, the rock flour is much finer than the ground basalt and so exposes more surface area to weathering. The advantages and disadvantages of both types of rock dust are still being studied. The Danish group is planning trials in Australia and assessing the energy requirements of shipping. Beerling's team expects to publish results of yield gains in corn following basalt application in the US in the near future. ""I don't think it has to be one or the other. I think there's probably room for both,"" said Rosing.

Other proposed ways of pulling CO2 from the atmosphere include using technology to capture it directly from the air, or growing energy crops, burning them to produce electricity and then burying the CO2 emissions. The 2020 study suggested ERW would be less expensive than either and, unlike energy crops, does not compete with food for land.

Greenland is usually in the news because of the huge and accelerating melting of its ice cap, which is driving up sea level. Rosing, who is originally from Greenland, said: ""It would be much nicer for the nation to be part of the [climate] solution, rather than just a symptom of the problem.""

Exporting churpi, herders' smoked yak cheese, has transformed lives in remote Himalayan villages

On a cold, wet August morning in the windswept high pastures of the Nepalese Himalayas, a stream of herders bring fresh milk to a makeshift tent at an altitude of 4,200 metres. The bells of grazing yaks and chauris (a cross between male yaks and female cattle) echo across the silent valleys as men work under a tarpaulin measuring, boiling and separating milk into curds and whey.

The curds are strained in cloth bags and pressed under weights to remove as much whey as possible before being sent to the village below to be made into churpi (or chhurpi), a dried snack that has found an unlikely new lease of life, transforming pastoralists' lives in Nepal in the process.

A staple among Himalayan people in Nepal, Bhutan, Tibet and eastern India, churpi is fermented and smoked for months, sometimes years, to form a tasteless hard cheese that is very high in protein and nutrients.

For centuries, herders living in these resource-scarce barren highlands have depended upon their livestock to eke out a livelihood. As well as being one of the best ways to use excess milk, churpi sustains them during harsh winters in the mountains.

Churpi was once used to barter for essentials such as grains, oil, vegetables and salt. When it lost its currency value, it remained a favoured snack among the people living in mountainous regions. It would have continued as an obscure cottage industry were it not for an accidental discovery by three Nepalis living in the United States.

In the early 2000s, Nishes Shrestha brought some churpi back to the US after visiting family in Nepal. When his friend Suman Shrestha noticed Nishes' dog chomping down on a stick of churpi it was a eureka moment. The pair began to test the snack out on friends' dogs. Soon they had roped in Suman's brother, Sujan, and in 2007 they launched Himalayan Pet Supply, the first company to sell Himalayan yak churpi as an organic dog chew.

While dairy farming is an important source of income for millions in Nepal, milk and dairy products are primarily bought by the state-owned Dairy Development Corporation, which operates in 45 of Nepal's 77 districts, along with a few private firms.

Selling churpi as a dog chew created a profitable new market that has also solved the problem of excess milk going to waste as demand fluctuates.

Today churpi is a major export from Nepal, with at least 30 cheese dog-chew companies generating $22m (£18m) in 2021-22. By comparison, tea exports are worth $29m and carpets $81m. Over the last five years, Nepal's churpi export has grown by nearly 250%, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development.

Starting with 200kg (440lb) of churpi in 2007, Himalayan Pet Supply now imports 600 tonnes a year to the US, sourcing churpi from 300 dairies and supporting nearly 12,000 farmers. It has 400 employees in the country.

However, most of the production takes place in the US where it produces another 2,000 tonnes of churpi a year from cow's milk in Washington state. The company was bought by Prairie Dog Pet Products in 2021.

""In Nepal, we started this campaign among farmers that if they only had nine cows, then their annual income would be six times the per capita income,"" says Sujan, who stepped down as chief executive in 2018. ""Our farmers were making about $5-6,000 per year, just by selling us the chews."" Nepal's annual per capita income was $1,027 in 2021.

Melamchi Tamang, 42, of Gatlang village, is one of many herders in Rasuwa, northern Nepal, to have benefited from the growing demand for churpi. She has been herding chauri for the past six years after previously rearing sheep.

""There was not much income from the sheep but chauris have been profitable,"" says Tamang. ""My daily household expenses are all covered, and I have also been able to send my children out of the village for better opportunities.""

Duga Tamang, 50, who is also from Gatlang, makes $2,300 to $3,000 a year from his 16 chauris. ""We have been herding chauris from the age of our grandparents. We have no other means of livelihood here except this,"" he says.

While the income has not changed significantly since he went from making churpi for people to supplying milk to the dog-chew company two years ago, it is much easier than making churpi himself and selling it in markets nearby.

The idea of turning a Nepali food of cultural importance into dog food was not universally accepted at first, though. The founders received letters and phone calls from Nepalis who were appalled at what they had done. ""I've been told that I'm not a Nepali. We faced a lot of slander in the beginning,"" says Sujan.

But after appearing on Shark Tank, a Dragon's Den-style reality-TV show in 2015, where the founders explained how the product was helping families in Nepal, the criticism turned to praise.

According to one recent study, most of the dairy producers were earning up to $3,800 a year from churpi, and more educated young people in the country are being drawn to the growing industry. Rohit Marwadi, 29, founded Agroculture Nepal in 2016 soon after graduating from university. Today his company works with 1,500 dairy farmers and exports nearly 10 tonnes of churpi a month to the US, Europe and some Asian countries.

Income from churpi has also transformed 50-year-old Raju Rai's economic situation. Financial pressures forced Rai to look for work outside Nepal, but after six years in Saudi Arabia, he decided to return home. ""I was earning about 40,000 Nepalese rupee [£245] a month when I was in Saudi. But after coming back to Nepal, I was able to double my income through the churpi business,"" he says.

Rai, from Khamnuwa in eastern Nepal, has supplied dog chews for 14 years. Five years ago he started his own dairy farm. ""I probably wouldn't have been able to send my son to Bangalore or Australia [to study] if not for this business,"" he says.

""And it hasn't helped just me,"" he adds. ""Many people in the village have been able to improve their livelihood because of this business. There was no source of income, and now people can earn £123 a month from one cow. Life has become easier for people in my village these days.""

Sharmila Rai, 35, from nearby Chulachuli, has been making churpi for nearly 16 years. But it was only eight years ago that she started supplying it for export. ""Since I've been running this business, I have been able to eat much better food, and pay for salt and oil without worry,"" says the mother of three.

""Before this, I was mainly rearing cattle at home and working in the fields. I had no other means of income. I later decided to open my own dairy in the village. Now there are dairies like mine in every village in our area.""

But the security that churpi has brought to the village is also a source of anxiety. ""During Covid, there was a drop in demand. Since then, I worry about what will happen if the churpi business declines in the future. It has been immensely helpful for our livelihood and children's education but this is our only means of survival for now. If demand drops again, we will be in a terrible position.""

But Rai's fears may be unfounded. With the global pet-food industry projected to grow strongly, it looks like churpi could be the herders' best friend for a long time to come.

Report finds that almost 14m kgs of edible fruit and vegetables are rejected in Australia each year on appearances alone

Demand for ""perfect"" fruit and vegetables from commercial buyers is leading to huge food waste, and diminished financial returns for farmers, a new report has found.

The appearance of fruit and vegetables is the most common reason commercial buyers reject produce, outweighing other factors such as ripeness or evidence of pest infestation, according to farmers.

According to the report, commissioned by odd-but-edible food merchant Good and Fugly, growers also say that some rejected produce is given to supermarkets for free.

""We can see through these answers that, simply put, there's a lot of produce that is being rejected by supermarkets purely for the way it looks and it's dramatically impacting farmers' profits,"" said Richard Tourino, co-founder of Good and Fugly.

Tourino said there was a need to change consumers' minds over what good produce looks like.

""The reason people choose that perfectly round tomato is because they're walking around with that prototype in their head because of all the advertising of perfect produce,"" he said.

""We're trying to work out how we encourage people to change that prototype.""

The ugly - or imperfect - food movement is gathering momentum around the world, as food merchants seek to change our perceptions of what constitutes edible produce.

According to the report's findings, almost 14m kgs of fruit and vegetables are lost annually in Australia due to rejected produce, some of which rots on farms as there are limited options for sale.

About 2,600 gigalitres of water is used to grow food that isn't consumed, according to government figures, and there is significant land used along with emissions generated - for no benefit.

The report, based on a survey of 57 farmers by research house Fifth Quadrant, also found that one-in-five farmers say rejected produce is given to supermarkets for free.

One in 10 farmers reported an annual loss of $50,000 or more as a result of rejected produce.

Australia's dominant supermarkets, Coles and Woolworths, have imperfect ranges, although they represent a small fraction of overall sales. Harris Farm also has an extensive offering.

A Woolworths spokesperson said produce requirements were adaptable and that they respond to the quantity and availability of fruit and vegetables in the market.

""This allows us to work with growers to meet customer demand, while also reducing food waste from unsold fruit and veg in our stores - and avoiding unnecessary food miles and emissions associated with transporting it,"" the spokesperson said.

""If produce doesn't meet our expectations, the supplier will maintain ownership of it and may elect to collect it so they can sell it in other markets, or to have it donated to food rescue.""

Coles was contacted for comment.

The report included reports from farmers that whole pallets were rejected because of ""one bad apple"".

Supermarkets argue that they have no incentive to unnecessarily reject produce after delivery, due to its impact on supply volumes.

There is a debate in the industry over who is to blame for a customer's desire for perfectly shaped and unblemished produce that has created such waste.

Food retailers point out that consumers will reach for good-looking produce over something that has an impurity, even if it is solely cosmetic, while others believe major retailers have conditioned shoppers.

The report, which investigates the relationship between Australian farmers and supermarkets, found that half of the farmers surveyed screen out ""good"" produce because they don't think it will be accepted by commercial buyers due to aesthetics.

This is in addition to rejected produce, defined as produce that is ordered but not accepted.

Good and Fugly co-founder Jonathan Englert said he'd heard delightful stories of attitudes changing, with shoppers on the look-out for the most outrageous looking produce.

""We hear back from parents who tell us their kids are looking for a really crazy cucumber or strawberry to show friends at school,"" Englert said.

""Our goal is for supermarkets to just get rid of the aesthetic and size standards.

""It would be a huge victory.""

Advocates of cultivated meat say it's better for animal welfare and the environment, but the jury is out on whether the industry is headed for greener pastures

The liability waiver does not inspire confidence. I am not a natural thrill seeker, but in my limited experience, sitting down in an empty Melbourne cafe to eat a snack is not a typical activity that ""may cause serious or grievous injuries, including bodily injury, and/or death"".

I am here to taste a product that is much hyped but not yet commercially available in Australia (and most other jurisdictions): meat that has been grown in a lab.

The meat in question is a soupÃ§on of pork, which has been cultivated from the cells of a pig's ear. The pig, I have been assured by Paul Bevan, the chief executive of cultivated meat startup Magic Valley, is still alive and well, continuing to live ""its happy, healthy, normal life"".

Lab-grown meat - or cultivated meat, as it is known in the industry - is purported by its proponents to be better for animal welfare and the environment. It exited the realm of science fiction in 2013, when a research team at Maastricht University presented the first prototype, a lab-grown beef burger patty.

Since then, the cellular agriculture industry has yielded just a single commercially available product - cell-based chicken launched in Singapore in 2020 by the American firm Eat Just. A cultivated chicken product from Eat Just subsidiary Good Meat is now making its way through US regulatory approval.

Magic Valley is hoping to apply for regulatory approval in Australia by the end of the year, and to sell their cultivated meat products - lamb and pork, so far - by the end of 2024.

I am a meat eater and don't consider myself particularly squeamish, but as I wait to taste Magic Valley's pork I try to suppress a mental image of muscle fibres growing in a Petri dish, Ã la science experiments from university biology class.

The morsel of lab-grown meat is served in a silky wonton skin, doused with chilli oil, spring onion and black vinegar. The recipe has been cooked up by Wendy Chua, a Magic Valley scientist and their in-house gourmet.

The pork is, in a word, delicious. But then again, what generously seasoned dumpling isn't?

The texture of the meat is perhaps slightly softer and more gelatinous than regular mince. Any differences in taste would have been easier to parse with a more sizeable portion, but I suspect the meagre serving is a deliberate logistical (and economic) choice.

Magic Valley is not yet operating at industrial scale, so all their meat is still cultivated in a lab, rather than in 20,000-litre bioreactors that they hope to eventually use. A facility with two bioreactors of such size would eventually be able to produce 300,000kg of meat annually, Bevan says. (It is unclear whether bioreactors this large are commonly used in the industry, but in 2022 Eat Just announced it was building 250,000-litre vats, set to be operational in 2024.)

How is it made?

The process of making the pork begins with reprogramming cells taken from a pig's ear to create induced pluripotent stem cells. These stem cells, which are not yet specialised, have an essentially unlimited ability to generate other cell types. ""From there, we're able to direct the cells to become muscle, fat, connective tissue, bone - whatever we choose,"" Bevan says.

Cells are brewed in nutrient media - a liquid of glucose and amino acids - that enables the cells to grow. Currently, muscle and fat are grown separately and combined at the end to form the final product. The process takes about three weeks, Bevan says.

Magic Valley describes its meat as slaughter-free, but other cellular agriculture companies use foetal bovine serum - a byproduct of the meatpacking industry which is harvested from the blood of cow foetuses - as a growth medium.

""In terms of input costs at the moment, for us it costs around $50 a kilo to produce,"" Bevan says. His hope is that once production is scaled up, the costs may drop to $5 per kilogram.

While the current price tag is steep, it is far cheaper than it once was - the first lab-grown patty cost US$330,000 to create. But some critics are sceptical that cultivated meat can achieve cost parity with traditional agriculture.

""If your interest is maximising profitability in the early years, you should never start a cultivated meat company,"" Eat Just's chief executive, Josh Tetrick, told the Financial Times in June last year. The article highlighted that despite Eat Just's 2020 commercial milestone in Singapore, ""the lossmaking company's products are not in shops"".

Though lab-grown meat has high energy requirements, analyses suggest the production process involves less carbon emissions and a smaller land-use footprint per kg of meat than traditional agriculture.

""From a greenhouse gas perspective, and from a water use and a land use perspective, we're looking at between a 70% and 90% reduction compared to conventional meat,"" Bevan says.

Nutritionally, ""our cultivated pork products are identical,"" Bevan says.

Independent studies are unclear on whether cultivated meat provides the same essential minerals, such as iron and vitamin B12, as regular meat. One 2020 review found that ""vitamins are necessary in the [growth] media for optimal cell proliferation, but it is not clear whether the uptake from media results in levels of vitamins in cultured meat comparable to traditional meat"".

But unlike a pork cutlet, which is what it is, Bevan says with cultivated meat ""we can remove things like saturated fat, add additional protein content, vitamins, minerals, etcetera"".

Critics of alternative proteins such as lab-grown meat have suggested the industry could jeopardise the livelihoods of food producers globally, ""rather than supporting transformational changes in the way we eat"". Nonetheless, the demand for meat is rising worldwide, and cultured meat companies have proliferated accordingly.

In March, another Australian startup, Vow, unveiled a meatball engineered from the tissue of the long-extinct woolly mammoth, which nobody has yet tasted. In addition to traditional livestock animals, the company is making meat from the stem cells of at least 13 other animal species, such as alpaca and water buffalo.

As the technology advances, Bevan says the ultimate goal for Magic Valley is to create ""structured"" meat products such as steaks and chops. Last year, one Israeli firm used 3D printing techniques to create a 110g steak, but while the technology is impressive, the end product hardly resembles the real thing.

Replacing the chicken in a nugget or the pork filling in a wonton with cultivated meat is beginning to seem like a real possibility. But whether lab-grown chops won't smack of the uncanny valley's pastures is a question that's yet to be answered.

Despite it being taboo and illegal to kill critically endangered primate, 30% of villages have evidence of killing in ""˜last five to 10 years'

Orangutans on the island of Borneo continue to be illegally killed, likely in large numbers, even when there are nearby projects to save the critically endangered primate, according to new research.

Despite the taboo and illegal nature of killing orangutans, researchers heard evidence of a direct killing from at least one person in 30% of 79 villages surveyed in Indonesia's Kalimantan region.

The research - which involved interviews with more than 400 villagers - comes more than a decade after a study claimed between 2,000 and 3,000 orangutans were likely being directly killed every year.

Studies have estimated there are less than 100,000 Bornean orangutans left in the wild. Females produce only one offspring every six to eight years.

The island of Borneo is divided between Malaysia, the state of Brunei and Indonesia, which controls three-quarters of the island.

Staff from a community development organisation carried out the interviews in 2020 and 2021 and asked villagers questions about orangutan killing, such as ""When was the last time someone in your village killed an orangutan?""

Researcher Emily Massingham of the University of Queensland, who led the study, said the reasons for direct killing were varied and ""socially complex"".

She said: ""We found that killing does seem to still be happening and a lot of it had happened in the previous five years. I was shocked to see 30% of villages had evidence of killing in the last five to 10 years.""

Experts said orangutans are killed for several reasons. People may kill out of fear or because the animals are invading gardens or crops.

Mothers may also be killed so that babies can be caught and sold for the pet trade or to be trained as performers. Orangutans are sometimes killed if they enter plantations, and also for their meat and body parts.

Habitat clearing, including to produce palm oil, has also pushed orangutans closer to human settlements.

The study, published in the journal Conservation Science and Practice, also found a village's proximity to a conservation project had no effect on the likelihood of killings being reported.

""We were interested to know if having a project nearby might make killing less likely, or if it had an impact on people's attitudes,"" Massingham said.

""Any killing of orangutans is likely to have a huge impact on their populations because they're slow-breeding and long-lived animals.""

To gauge social norms, villagers were also asked to comment on what actions they thought others would take in hypothetical scenarios.

Massingham said the only legally sound reply to the scenarios would be to leave the animal alone, but only 40% of people interviewed gave that response.

One study last year found US$1bn had been invested to try to protect orangutans between 2000 and 2019 on Borneo and the Indonesian island of Sarawak - the species' only homes.

Massingham and her colleagues suggest conservation projects should work with communities to design approaches to tackle the problem of direct killing, which could be being ignored or downplayed.

""There's a lot of funding going into helping orangutans but maybe not enough going in to communities,"" she said. ""A lot of these villages are subsistence based, so there is a tension there.""

Dr Anne Russon, an orangutan expert at York University in Toronto, said the research findings were ""disturbing and sad, but absolutely credible"" and it was clear that direct killing remained a substantial threat.

Prof Andrew Marshall of the University of Michigan, who was not involved in the new research, has been studying orangutans in Borneo for 27 years. He said he was ""saddened, but not surprised"" by the research findings.

""Studying hunting of legally protected, endangered species is difficult. Folks are often reticent to report killings, fearing that they will either be reported to authorities or viewed negatively by outsiders. For these reasons, the results of the paper are almost certainly underestimates of the true magnitude of the threat hunting poses to orangutans,"" he said.

There was little evidence, he said, of an improvement in fortunes for the species and ""without new and effective conservation interventions face extinction within our lifetimes"".

This article was amended on 10 October 2023. An earlier version said that orangutans only lived on Borneo and ""the Indonesian island of Sarawak"". This should have said Sumatra; Sarawak is a Malaysian state.

Dutch territory in Caribbean says plan to cull entire population of vervet monkeys ""˜painful and controversial' but necessary

Seventy-five animal welfare organisations and experts have called on the government of Sint Maarten in the Caribbean to immediately stop its attempt to cull the territory's entire population of vervet monkeys.

The international protest comes after the Guardian revealed in January that the Dutch territory is funding a non-profit organisation to eradicate the ""nuisance"" species over the next three years.

The animal advocacy non-profit Born Free USA, which coordinated the protest, says experts are ready and willing to support the government with a more humane sterilisation programme. But they say they have not received a reply to their offer.

A public petition asking for non-lethal measures for controlling the invasive primate population on the island - which is shared with French St Martin - has also amassed 3,742 signatures.

However, the Nature Foundation Sint Maarten, which is carrying out the cull, has said that while the project is ""painful and controversial"", it remains a necessity.

""Given the current significant but manageable size of the vervet monkey population, there is a window of opportunity to ensure that the issue does not worsen in coming decades,"" it said in a statement.

Vervet monkeys were introduced to the region from Africa sometime around the 17th century and the first sightings on Sint Maarten date back to the early 1970s.

Research carried out by the Nature Foundation St Maarten found in 2020 that about 450 were living on the Dutch side of the island. By 2022, that number had increased to about 2,000.

""Given the current significant but manageable size of the vervet monkey population, there is a window of opportunity to ensure that the issue does not worsen in coming decades,"" it said.

The monkeys have been blamed for eating crops, destroying gardens, entering schools and acting aggressively.

Last December, the territory's ministry of tourism, economic affairs, transportation and telecommunication approved 100,000 Netherlands Antillean guilders (US$55,000) funding to control the species.

The foundation said this was enough to pay for a single full-time ranger to carry out the cull along with equipment, but not for a sterilisation programme.

Born Free USA says the information on which the cull is based is ""fundamentally flawed"".

The group offered its ""expertise, including voluntary veterinary services"" for alternative humane species management, and said it will also provide training to neighbouring territories.

""In this way, Sint Maarten could lead the way on humane primate population management in the Caribbean region,"" the group wrote in a letter to the Sint Maarten government.

""We would be grateful if you would consider postponing plans to cull the animals and working with us to explore truly humane alternatives.""

Born Free USA has also launched a public petition which has so far amassed more than 3,700 signatures asking for non-lethal measures to control the invasive primate population.

In its statement, Nature Foundation Sint Maarten said local law prevents anyone from releasing non-native species - so setting monkeys free after sterilisation would be a violation of the law.

It added: ""In the face of substantial monkey overpopulation, neighbouring islands have turned to more desperate means of population control.""

The foundation said that among those are consumption, poisoning, hunting and shipping monkeys away for biomedical research.

""These are all invasive species management strategies that St Maarten would like to avoid by preventing the situation here from reaching that point at all,"" it concluded.

The cull is projected to end in 2026, at which point the foundation says it plans to thoroughly assess its impact and review alternative, long-term management options within local law.

This article was amended on 6 October 2023. An earlier version said that the government of Sint Maarten approved 100,000 Netherlands Antillean guilders (US$55,000) funding per year to control the species. In fact this was not a yearly figure but a one-off payment.

â‚¬1.4bn deal to protect DoÃ±ana national park will diversify local economy and stop farmers using aquifers to irrigate fruit crops

A landmark agreement to safeguard one of Europe's most important wetlands underscores the importance of harnessing public opinion to drive the green transition and help mitigate the effects of the climate emergency, the country's environment minister has said.

The DoÃ±ana in western AndalucÃ­a - whose marshes, forests and dunes extend across almost 130,000 hectares (320,000 acres) and include a Unesco-listed national park - has been at the centre of a furious national and international row over recent years.

Water supplies to the park have declined drastically over the past three decades because of climate breakdown, mining pollution, marsh drainage - and the boom in soft fruit cultivation.

A deal reached in November by Spain's environment minister, Teresa Ribera, for â‚¬1.4bn (£1.2bn) of investment to help protect the area and diversify the local economy away from its reliance on soft fruit however provided a ray of hope. It had been a year in which a plan from the AndalucÃ­an regional government for an amnesty for the farmers who have been illegally tapping its aquifer to irrigate strawberry farms in the area around the park had led to dire warnings from environmental groups, the European Union and supermarket chains.

Speaking to the Guardian, Ribera said the deal had been the result of internal and external pressure, a change in public opinion, and a concerted effort to engage with people in the region to explain the need for urgent action.

""There's more of a future than strawberries and raspberries,"" said Ribera. ""And anyway, if you don't look after the water, there will be no more strawberries or raspberries. I think that this change of mentality needs a very clear understanding.""

A report earlier this year from Spain's national research council noted that 59% of DoÃ±ana's large lakes had not been full since at least 2013, and that the area was in a ""critical condition"". For the past two summers, DoÃ±ana's largest permanent lake dried up completely and the park was recently removed from the International Union for Conservation of Nature's green list for failing to meet the necessary standards.

The proposed increase in irrigable land had also led a group of leading UK supermarkets - including Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Waitrose, Lidl, Aldi and Morrisons - to write to the AndalucÃ­an regional president warning him that the move risked damaging ""the reputation and the long-term development of the region"".

Ribera said persuading people of the need to integrate environmental action into social and economic policy was essential to global efforts to deal with the climate emergency.

""It's very important that we learn to combine strictly environmental measures with measures to reduce economic and social pressures in the area when it comes to green infrastructure and recovering natural spaces,"" said Ribera. ""You have to turn that relationship into a virtuous relationship in which the people there have alternatives that will allow them to be proud of where they live and not see those alternatives as a limitation or a threat.""

She said getting that message across was the ""the great challenge for Europe in the very short term - and for the world as a whole"", adding that ""decades-old perceptions"" about the importance of integrated environmental policy were no longer valid.

""That's very complicated and needs more than just engineering logic or economic projections,"" she said. ""It needs really important social participation and a cultural and emotional change when it comes to behaviours. If we don't manage this change in collective psychology and social values properly, we'll end up with gilets jaunes and with farmers in the Netherlands opposing soil protection rules. We'll end up with complicated situations because people don't know what it'll mean to their lives in the very short term.""

The minister said the 2024 European elections would be decisive in keeping up the momentum and ensuring that hard-won environmental gains were not lost.

""This change for all of us is going to be so intense that none of us can miss the boat of the June elections,"" she said. ""It's much harder to do this in a hostile environment.""

Ribera also took aim at political parties that engage in ""very dangerous demagoguery"" and attempt to dismiss the realities of the climate emergency for cynical, electoral gain.

""There are very anti-systemic forces that seek to break or question this agenda,"" she said. ""I think there's some very hypocritical behaviour: I don't believe this environmental or climate scepticism or denialism is because they doubt the analytic abilities of academics; I have absolutely no doubt that's not the case ""¦ [But it] really worries me. We need to consolidate, explain and provide alternatives - and that can only be done with a very important social conviction and commitment.""

The minister also said politicians who failed to heed shifting public opinion on environmental matters would pay the price. She described Madrid city council's decision to fell hundreds of trees in two popular parks to make way for an extension of the capital's metro system as ""an absolute disgrace"".

Although she has no powers to block the move as the decision was taken at a municipal and regional level, Ribera said she would be writing to regional ministers to propose a set of common directives to protect mature urban trees.

""Planting two six-month-old saplings isn't the same as having trees that are 60 or 80 years old,"" she said. ""I can't explain it: it's like the anti-cycling lanes mania of some new mayors. It's a scandal and I think it'll have a far higher social and political cost than they thought - they'll go through what Moreno Bonilla went through with DoÃ±ana.""

Which? and other groups call for intervention as food industry figures gather for summit with Rishi Sunak

Some meat and vegetable lines at supermarkets have almost doubled in price over the past year, research has found, prompting fresh calls for the government to intervene as food industry figures gather for summit in Downing Street.

Annual inflation on supermarket own-label budget items stepped up to 25% in April, according to the data from consumer group Which?, while the rate of price increases on branded goods remained steady at just under 14%.

However, some individual items rose at a far faster pace. The price of a pack of Morliny frankfurters at Asda shot up from an average of £1.25 to £2.42, an increase of nearly 94% in a year, while a four-pack of brown onions at Morrisons went from 65p to £1.24 - a 91% rise.

The highest rate of inflation by category last month was on cheese and milk - both over 20% - while inflation eased slightly on both premium and regular supermarket own-brand items.

Sue Davies, the head of food policy at Which?, urged Rishi Sunak to ask grocery bosses gathering at No 10 on Tuesday to commit to doing more to hold prices down, ""including stocking budget lines in convenience stores to ensure easy access to basic, affordable food ranges that support a healthy diet"".

The call comes after supermarkets in France agreed to cap prices on key food stuffs and the government gave support to producers amid hefty inflation over the Channel.

Supermarkets, farmers and food industry leaders are meeting the prime minister to discuss how to tackle food price inflation, which rose to 19% in March, according to official government figures.

Before the summit, agriculture and food lobby groups called for more access to overseas workers to help pick crops and better regulation of suppliers' relations with supermarkets as well as help to adapt to cope with an anticipated rise in extreme weather conditions prompted by climate change.

The UK's competition watchdog announced on Monday that it would look at whether a poorly functioning market was contributing to food price inflation, alongside a similar investigation into fuel prices.

Anna Taylor of the sustainable food lobby group the Food Foundation called on the government to reinstate its horticulture strategy, which was abandoned earlier this month, in order to secure supplies of fresh fruit and vegetables from the UK, as farmers both here and overseas face difficulties in growing crops in increasingly volatile conditions.

She also said the government should expand the Healthy Start voucher scheme, which ensured that low-income households could afford fresh produce.

""Climate shocks are going to be worsening as we go into the future, and we should be expecting food price inflation to be normal state of affairs. We need to be thinking seriously about how we cope with inflation better than we are now,"" Taylor said.

Vicki Hird, head of farming at the Sustain alliance of farming, environmental and community groups, said the government was ""failing to support farmers properly"" amid a crisis in horticultural production caused by rising costs and lack of labour availability.

She said the government should extend the powers of the independent Groceries Code Adjudicator so that rules such as no automatic delisting of suppliers' products could be legally enforced.

Fears about the UK's food supplies have increased after supermarkets were forced to ration supplies of tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers in February owing to extreme weather interrupting supplies of salad and vegetable crops from southern Spain and north Africa.

UK supplies of salad crops have also been restricted by a cold, grey spring and a rise in the cost of energy that has prompted greenhouse growers to cut back on production.

Despite problems with supplies, the government ditched plans for a horticulture strategy, one the few recommendations it had agreed to take forward from a government-commissioned report by the founder of Leon restaurants, Henry Dimbleby.

Fears have arisen that large companies have used the cover of inflation to boost profits, with those on lowest income suffering the most.

703,"A precious resource: how Israel uses water to control the West Bank","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/17/how-israel-uses-water-to-control-west-bank-palestine","A precious resource: how Israel uses water to control the West Bank

In occupied West Bank villages, Israeli-owned farms are flourishing, while Palestinians often do not have enough water to drink

Mahmoud Haj Mohammed stands on the roof of his family's home in the occupied West Bank village of Jalud and points towards a clump of cypress trees on the opposite side of the valley.

He has just got back from his job at a concrete factory in the nearby city of Nablus, hot and tired in the last week of Ramadan, jeans covered in grey flecks of cement. The 32-year-old began working there two years ago, after the seizure of a key part of his family's land by Israeli settlers eventually made it unviable to farm it any more.

""It's easy to see where the settlers are. Look at the olive grove below the cypress,"" Haj Mohammed said, as a herd of goats passed by. ""That is our land, but we are not farming it. See how close together the trees are? That's because the settlers have access to the water supply and proper irrigation. Compare it to our trees, the ones that are spaced out more, and not in neat rows.""

Water is one of the most precious resources in Israel and the Palestinian territories. This beautiful landscape - the historic fertile crescent - can be harsh and unforgiving. But with enough water, as the Book of Isaiah says, ""The desert and the parched land will be glad; the wilderness will rejoice and blossom.""

Israel is the world leader in water management and technology: last year, a first-of-its-kind project began pumping desalinated seawater from the Mediterranean northwards, to replenish the shrinking Sea of Galilee.

Yet rights groups contend that these successes are to the detriment of Palestinians; Israel controls about 80% of water reserves in the West Bank, but both the West Bank and Gaza Strip face severe water stress and drought.

In theory, no one living or working in Area C, the 60% of the West Bank fully controlled by Israel, can get connected to pipelines belonging to Israel's national water company without proving ownership of the land or otherwise gaining a permit from the Israeli civil administration in the territories, known as Cogat. But in practice, access to water resources is a potent state-controlled weapon for the settlement movement, allowing Israeli-owned vineyards, olive groves, livestock farms and date plantations to flourish.

Israelis, including those living in settlements, use three times as much water a day as West Bank Palestinians do, according to a new report from the Israeli human rights NGO B'Tselem. In many places, it is difficult for Palestinian farmers to cultivate even low yields of crops such as wheat, lentils and chickpeas. Decreasing access to land and water thanks to settlement expansion means farming contributes just 2.6% of the territory's GDP today.

About 450,000 Israelis have settled in what is now Area C since the occupation began in 1967 and are motivated for different reasons: some see reclaiming the biblical land of Israel as a religious or nationalistic mission, while others are drawn by the cheaper cost of living or business opportunities. Overall, their presence is viewed by the international community as illegal, and a leading obstacle to peace: the phenomenon of settler violence against Palestinians is growing.

A handful have become rich by cultivating thousands of acres of disputed land, establishing lucrative boutique wineries and high-grade medjool dates and olive oil brands for export. One of the biggest settlement agricultural businesses today is Meshek Achiya, founded in 2003 near the biblically significant settlement of Shilo, an area particularly notorious for land grabs and settler violence.

Local families say Meshek Achiya grew after seizing swathes of their land during the second intifada (Palestinian uprising) of the 2000s, when access for Palestinians in the area, including the Haj Mohammeds, was blocked by army checkpoints.

The Guardian's attempts to reach several owners and directors at the company went unanswered. Meshek Achiya has claimed in legal filings that the land it farms was bought from other settlers.

""If we had more water, the village would grow more than beans and za'atar. But sometimes in the summer we don't even have drinking water,"" said Jamal Deeb, a resident of Qaryut, the next village to Jalud, where land claimed by several local families has also been taken over by Meshek Achiya.

""My family is in a good position because we have deeds and can prove we own it, but we are still fighting for decades. Dragging out the court battles is part of the strategy,"" the 55-year-old said. ""I don't think I will ever see our trees on that side of the valley again.""

Meshek Achiya's success - and that of many other Israeli settlement enterprises - would be impossible without access to increasingly large amounts of water that farmers need in the drought-prone area. Yet even though there are five eviction orders pending on some of the land controlled by the company, upheld by Israel's supreme court, the entire operation still appears to be connected to the Israeli water agency's supply.

In 2017, the last year before the water authority stopped publishing detailed data on agricultural water allocations in the West Bank, Meshek Achiya received about 100,000 cubic metres of water, or 274 cubic metres a day (one cubic metre = 1,000 litres). Palestinians living in Area C use about 20 litres of water a day, as little as a fifth of the 50-100 litres a day minimum set by the World Health Organization.

The story repeated itself across the West Bank, said Dror Etkes, an expert on Israeli settlement construction and infrastructure and the founder of the NGO Kerem Navot.

Its research shows that the same year, the Water Authority allocated 17,000 cubic metres to the family that runs the popular Psagot Winery, near Ramallah, where there is a demolition order against the chief executive's villa and swimming pool. Psagot denied any illegal activity in an emailed response. Another 12,000 cubic metres went to a Meshek Achiya employee who has started his own vineyard.

A large sheep herding outpost - considered illegal under Israeli as well as international law - received 9,000 cubic metres. The wife of the owner of the Giv'ot Olam organic egg farm, another outpost renowned for violence, was the registered name for 111,000 cubic metres.

Meanwhile, the UN says that more than 270 water and sewage facilities used by Palestinians in Area C have been demolished in the past five years on the grounds that the infrastructure is illegal.

Cogat, the arm of the Israeli military responsible for civilian affairs in the Palestinian territories, said in emailed comments that ""allocation of water to Israeli agriculture in [the West Bank] is performed only after a thorough examination of the various aspects touching on land rights. When water is illegally diverted, the authorities take action in the area as they are legally entitled to do.""

The Israeli water authority directed requests for information to Cogat.

Etkes said: ""It is easy to get rich when you don't have to pay for the land and you're hooked up to a water supply your neighbours don't get.""

After 15 years of litigation, the Haj Mohammed family managed to win back 7 hectares (17 acres) - about a fifth of the land they claim - in a high court ruling in 2021. In February this year, Meshek Achiya's olive trees were uprooted and moved, and Mahmoud and his brothers planted wheat for the first time in decades, in honour of their father. Haj Mohammed senior died in 2017; he never saw any of the family's land returned.

""The settlers still come down from their homes on the hill. Last week they threatened to kill me,"" he said, standing amid the freshly ploughed earth. On the tump above the field, three settlers sat and watched, a blue and white Israeli flag fluttering overhead.

""A lot of people in our village decided to leave. I am doing this for my father, but also for my children,"" he said.

This article was amended on 24 May 2023 to clarify that the World Health Organization recommends a minimum 50-100 litres of water a day to ensure a person's basic needs are met (although it says some people may require more according to their circumstances). An earlier version expressed the minimum as 100 litres.

The last of the world's Asiatic lions live in Gujarat state, but as the apex predators outgrow their forest reserve, they are moving to the seaside

It was one morning, while walking on the beach in Gujarat, that wildlife expert Meena Venkataraman spotted a pair of paw prints. But this was no dog or fox that had visited. The footprints belonged to an Asiatic lion, the king of the jungle - and, increasingly, the beach.

Once found throughout Mesopotamia, Persia and the Indian subcontinent, the Asiatic lion was almost driven to extinction by the early 1900s due to hunting and habitat loss, before a nawab in the western Indian state of Gujarat intervened. Today, the state is the only home of the Asiatic lion.

While most of the nearly 700 animals counted in 2020 are found in the dry, deciduous terrain of the Gir forest and its surrounding protected areas, many have been moving to seaside locales.

Between 2010 and 2020, the number of lions living along Gujarat's coast rose from 20 to 104, and forest officials in Gujarat say coastal habitats are now the most significant of all satellite habitats that the lions occupy.

Finding lions in coastal areas is not unprecedented - in Namibia, lions have adapted to the beach, where they hunt seals - but in India it is unusual, says Venkataraman, principal consultant at Carnivore Conservation and Research.

""Lions using the sandy beach and walking at the edge of the sea is an incredible sight. I have had the good luck to see that a few times,"" she says.

In November 2022, researchers from Gujarat's forest department released findings from the first study of coastal Asiatic lions. Between 2019 and 2021, they monitored 10 lions fitted with GPS radio collars. One question they set out to answer was what kind of habitats the coastal lions were using, says Mohan Ram, deputy conservator of forests in Gir, and lead author of the study.

The answers were surprising, says Venkataraman, who was also part of the study. ""They shelter in the prosopis plantations in the western coasts [of Gujarat]. These are very thick and very thorny habitats,"" she says, adding that it's unusual because the lion is believed to be a more ""open area"" animal. Meanwhile, ""in the eastern coasts, lions are actually making use of salt pan areas and mangroves"".

The researchers also compared the characteristics of the dispersing lions to those in Gir. ""Interestingly, we found the home ranges to be different,"" says Venkataraman. Lions living in coastal habitats had larger home ranges - the area where an animal usually roams - than those living in the Gir protected areas. Those living between the forest and coastal areas - the ""link lions"" - were found to have even larger home ranges, she says.

Unlike Namibia's coastal lions, those in Gujarat do not prey on marine animals but, says Venkataraman: ""With time, they may develop a taste for scavenging dead fish.""

They mostly feed on wild boar, nilgai (a type of antelope) and stray cattle, but in 2020 there were reports of a lion preying on a turtle. Ram says forest officials are studying the coastal lions' food habits and hunting patterns.

The movement of lions to Gujarat's coast is not new but more of a ""recolonisation of their lost territories"", says Kausik Banerjee, a wildlife researcher who was not part of the study. But the predators' presence on the beach is also indicative of a larger problem of limited space as their numbers grow. ""The protected area of Gir [approximately 1,880 sq km] reached its biological carrying capacity for lions long ago,"" Banerjee says.

Gujarat officials recently announced plans for a second home for Asiatic lions in the state's Barda wildlife sanctuary, about 60 miles (100km) from Gir. The Indian government is also reassessing a proposal to relocate some of the lions to the neighbouring state of Madhya Pradesh. In 2013, India's supreme court ordered the relocation but it never happened, some experts say, because of Gujarat's reluctance to part with the lions it is so proud of.

However, as lions move outside protected areas, there is growing concern about human-lion conflict, says Banerjee, amid sporadic reports of lions attacking humans. They also sometimes kill livestock, but farmers receive compensation when that happens.

Local communities revere the lions, and that has made coexistence possible, says Banerjee. But, Venkataraman says, ""as populations increase, [conflict with humans] is definitely a problem, not just with lions but with all wild animals the world over"".

Developers need to be increasingly mindful of the coastal lions' migration routes, say the researchers. ""Development is necessary for humans, but there needs to be proactive mitigation measures,"" says Ram. ""For example, if a new highway is being constructed, there should be an underpass so as to not disrupt the movement of wildlife.""

While lions may not be going to the beach for the view, it doesn't mean they don't enjoy it. Ram has often observed them sitting on the shore in the evenings, enjoying the sea breeze. It is a sight that may become increasingly common in years to come.

Country's health and economy ruined as Islamic charity says rich nations must compensate those suffering worst of climate crisis

A year after Pakistan's worst floods in living memory, a report by Islamic Relief Worldwide has revealed the devastating long-term impact on people, especially children, and argued that rich nations must compensate those countries most affected by the climate emergency.

Researchers from Islamic Relief who talked to people in the flood-affected areas found 40% of the children they surveyed had stunted growth and 25% were underweight as families struggle to access food and healthcare. About 80% of mothers reported sickness among children, with outbreaks of diarrhoea, malaria and dengue fever increasing.

Women and girls reported being particularly affected, with pregnant women still struggling to access health services and girls most likely to be underweight. Many of the women displaced by the flooding do not have the privacy to breastfeed, meaning poorer health for their babies.

The flooding in Pakistan in August and September 2022 - described by UN secretary general AntÃ³nio Guterres as a ""monsoon on steroids"" - led to the deaths of more than 1,700 people and 33 million losing their homes, land or jobs. About 800,000 cattle and other livestock perished and 28,000 schools and health clinics were damaged.

Speaking at the launch of the report in Islamabad, Waseem Ahmad, chief executive of Islamic Relief Worldwide, stated: ""No amount of financial aid can compensate those who have lost loved ones and seen their homes and everything they own destroyed. But we need to see climate justice, where the biggest polluters pay for the damage and destruction caused by climate change.

""As climate-related catastrophes increase, it is the poorest and most vulnerable people who bear the brunt of the suffering. They are the ones most likely to live in fragile homes and least likely to have savings to fall back on, or assets to sell, or any kind of ""˜Plan B' when floods hit and crops and livestock are wiped out.""

Pakistan is one of the countries most vulnerable to changes in the climate with its farming sector particularly exposed to extreme weather conditions. The world's sixth most populous country was responsible for just 0.88% of global emissions in 2020 - less than one-eighth of the US's per capita emissions and one-third those of the UK. The report called for Pakistan to be a priority for increased climate financing.

A team of 26 researchers from 20 institutions who studied last year's floods concluded that the 60-day rainfall across the region was about 50% more intense than it would have been under unchanged climatic conditions.

Islamic Relief's report, Towards a Resilient Pakistan: Moving from Rhetoric to Reality, said agricultural output had declined significantly this year due to the loss of cotton, date, sugarcane and rice crops. Growing numbers of rural people are forced to migrate to towns and cities in search of work. The country's economy is in tatters with external debt soaring to $125bn (£98bn), inflation reaching a record 38% and a further 6 million people pushed into poverty.

713,"Veganism didn't agree with me. What's the most ethical alternative?","https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/feb/27/my-body-resists-veganism-whats-the-most-ethical-alternative","Veganism didn't agree with me. What's the most ethical alternative?

A vegan diet can be hard to adopt, even if you're convinced it's the right thing to do. An investigation of three options

Suppose a person is very concerned about the ethical issues around food and farming, especially animal welfare, but for whatever reason finds that a wholly plant-based diet does not work for them. What is the most defensible step away from veganism - the best compromise to make, if it is a compromise at all?

About a year ago, this question became vivid to me soon after I set out on an experiment: a near-vegan diet for a month. For some time, I have tried to eat in a way mindful of ethical issues, avoiding, albeit imperfectly, the products of inhumane factory farming. But I have eaten animal products, including meat and fish, regularly. After I spent a lot of time in recent years working on questions about animal minds (initially trying to understand octopuses and other cephalopods, and then moving on from there), the ethical questions around food began to feel quite pressing. So I wanted to find out how I felt on a diet with almost no animal products.

My plan was near vegan, as I allowed myself two eggs each day, and some minor deviations (I didn't worry if I was given butter for my toast, didn't query the details of Thai sauces and stayed with my usual fish oil tablets). The eggs were included because, ever since another series of dietary experiments a few decades earlier, I have found that a high-protein and fairly high-fat diet is best for my general wellbeing. So, I thought, two eggs would help smooth the transition, along with protein supplements. Free-range eggs I see as the most ethical of all widely available animal products. Some vegans hold that eating eggs of any kind is unethical, while others at least see this choice as more defensible than other animal foods. (Peter Singer, in his book Animal Liberation, regards free-range egg production as acceptable.)

The aim of the experiment was to look at the possibility of heading towards veganism, and to do this primarily for animal welfare reasons. I accept some of the arguments against meat made on environmental grounds, but the issues around animal suffering are primary for me.

To my surprise, the experiment quickly became an illuminating failure. The regimen was, after just a few days or so, much harder than I had expected. I felt unsettled, tired and much of the time quite cold, surprisingly (in February in Australia). Heartburn, headaches, inattention ""¦ it did not go well. On day 10, I decided to change plans and add some dairy products to the diet for the middle third of the month. This transition was just as surprising as the previous one. Immediately I felt fine, with all those problems out of the picture. I felt better than fine, in fact - very sharp. Ten days after that, I resumed the near-vegan regime. The results were as discouraging as before, and I switched back. By the end of the month, I'd spent half of it mostly vegan and half as a vegetarian.

Perhaps I should have stuck with the first, mostly vegan diet, and waited to get used to it. (My understanding is that one's microbiome, one's gut ecology, has to make a shift.) But I was reluctant to do this, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. With that unsettled feeling, day after day, I suspected I was more vulnerable to pathogens than usual. I expected to catch Covid-19 at some stage (as I did, a month or so later), and wanted to be physically well-equipped to fight it off.

I realise that this was a very short experiment. But the moments of transition between the various diets posed some choices in a clear way. Suppose one decides that a wholly plant-based or near-vegan diet is not going to work, and something must be added. If one is looking for one step away, thinking primarily about animal welfare questions, then three options appear that have completely different kinds of justification:

Humanely farmed meat (especially beef)

Wild-caught fish

Dairy products (conventionally farmed)

These aren't really the only three options (I will look at others below), but they are some obvious and available ones, within a developed-world urban or suburban setting. Let's say, initially, that the goal is to choose one of these as the step away. Which should it be?

I said above that they have different kinds of justifications and, when one looks closely, something like an incommensurability appears in the situation. This term from philosophy means that you can't measure or compare alternatives using a common standard that is fair to all of them. No suitable ""common currency"" or measuring stick is available. These three possible ways of going shopping bring on board quite different ways of looking at the moral issues.

Let's clarify each option before looking at the ethical side. When I talk about humanely farmed beef, in option 1, I have in mind beef produced so humanely that it makes sense to think that the cows have a good life overall, and a life that is better, most likely, than the life that nearly all nonhuman mammals might have. This is not just supermarket meat labelled ""free range"", but a smaller fraction of what is produced. This meat tends to come from specialist butchers who work with individual farms. In many cities, this is obtainable now. It tends to be expensive when compared with less humanely produced meat, and that means it won't be a feasible choice for everyone. But where it is a live option, it's certainly worth considering. (What about humanely farmed chickens, pigs, and so on? Yes, they are included, but each case is a bit different and I am going to focus a bit on beef.) These animals have a good life overall. On the other hand, killing is an inevitable part of this kind of farming, and perhaps there is something intractably bad in the practice of raising sentient animals to be killed.

One might instead opt for wild-caught fish (and some other wild-caught seafood) - option 2. In that case, killing is also part of the picture, but our relationship to the animals' lives is very different from what we saw in the first option. Our role here is to cut short a life that would end anyway; we do not raise the animals to kill them. (If an animal is raised to be fished or hunted, I don't include it here.) I think that the deaths involved in commercial fishing are probably not especially awful, compared with the deaths that would follow in the wild. But death is death, taking place at our hands, and the numbers involved are huge.

The third option is dairy. I could become one of those epicurean vegetarians who don't eat meat but have an impressive knowledge of the endless international subtleties of cheese. Here the problems are different. I think that the lives of dairy cows within conventional farming are bad. They are probably nowhere near as bad as those of factory-farmed pigs, but worse than those of cows on humane farms who are being raised to be eaten, perhaps often worse than those of conventionally farmed beef cattle (though I am not sure, and this will depend on the details of the lives in both cases).

Why do I assume, in this option, that the dairy products are conventionally farmed? Why not assume that this choice involves special, humane farming, as seen in the beef option? When I was thinking about the choices during my experiment, dairy produced in a very humane way was not available where I live, though beef was. This is no accident. It appears to be quite difficult to bring dairy farming close to the welfare level seen in the best humane farming of beef cattle, while remaining economically feasible. I do know of one dairy farm in Australia that is exemplary in this way - How Now Dairy. This farm keeps cows and calves together, sharing the milk; there is no early separation. Some cheese is made using that milk, though it is not easy to obtain where I live. (Disclosure: I own a small number of shares in this dairy.)

It may be that this kind of humane dairy can survive and expand, in which case a dairy option might be clearly best. But, at the moment, much of the milk, cheese and butter eaten by vegetarians is produced in a way that is quite cruel. Does it make a difference to choose ""organic"" dairy? The rules for ""organic"" status vary from place to place (as dairy farm conditions do more generally). In some settings it probably does make a significant difference, in others less so. In addition, much cheese has traditionally contained rennet, an enzyme taken from the stomach lining of calves that have been killed, and this has made cheese a more problematic choice for vegetarians. A lot of cheese can now be made with rennet substitutes, though.

Suppose, again, that the dairy products being considered are conventionally farmed, or something close to it. When one eats this food, one is not eating the body of an animal that was killed to be eaten (as in options 1 and 2). One is instead eating something made as food by an animal that remains alive. And a cow often produces 40,000 litres of milk, or more, during its life within modern farming - that is a lot of food (for example, 4,000kg, which is more than four tons, of cheddar). If we ignore waste and the like, then even if one ate half a pound of cheese every day for 50 years, one would eat the output of roughly one cow.

However, that cow's life is usually far from a good one. Cows must be pregnant, or have recently given birth, in order to produce milk, and the result is an endless cycle of pregnancies through the cow's rather short life, with the calves removed almost immediately. In some countries, many or most dairy cows are kept indoors for their entire lives. If reincarnated after my own death, I would rather come back as a beef cow on a humane farm than a dairy cow in nearly any modern dairy. Humane dairy with cow and calves together might be best of all, but I am assuming, again, that this is harder to achieve economically than humane beef farming.

As I thought about this, I had an initial sense that there ought to be a best choice between the three. I'd be willing to choose any of them if I thought it was clearly the best. When I say that, I don't mean that I'd never lapse from such a choice, but I don't see that as the relevant standard. It would be good to have a sense of the best goal to pursue, even if it's pursued with some flexibility or at least unreliability. But when we look more closely at the arguments, through different avenues of reasoning any of the three might be put on top.

In support of conventional dairy: killing a sentient animal might be a unique harm, and the dairy option minimises it. Far fewer animals are involved, in comparison with the other two options. In the count of lives lost, we should also include a bit over half of the calves that a cow produces. All the males and some of the females will be killed fairly quickly. Their bodies will be put to some use, but they are seen as low-value animals. The body count for dairy will still be much lower than the other options, though.

This argument in favour of the dairy option is, in a way, a pessimistic argument. The practice is agreed to be bad, but there's not too much of it. In contrast, the humane-beef option has a kind of positive defence. From several ethical viewpoints, this practice may be a positive good. It is familiar to note that a utilitarian might mount a defence like this, where a utilitarian is someone who counts up the totality of good and bad consequences from an action, and assesses the action purely in those terms. But it's not just utilitarians who might be on board with this kind of beef farming. Utilitarians, controversially, do not worry about the distribution of good and bad consequences over different individuals; one person's enjoyment, if sufficiently great, can compensate for others' pain. In the case of humane beef farming, the defence given can be one that counts the good and bad consequences of the practice for each animal individually. Animal X does well overall, over the course of its life, and the costs and benefits to animal Y, or human consumers, need not be in the picture.

In the case of sustainable fishing, I don't think an argument could be made that this is a positive good for the fish (unless a later death would be a lot more unpleasant). But this practice might be defended by arguing that humans, in this case, are just resuming their historic position in natural food webs. We are not, as with dairy and humane beef, instituting a new and different set of relationships between our lives and the animals'. All of the fish we kill will die one day anyway, and we did not organise, curate, or confine their lives.

The eating of farmed fish would not be included in a defence of seafood of this kind. The animal welfare problems associated with fish farming, at least in many forms, appear to be serious. Fish farming would not receive a defence via any of the avenues discussed in this essay. What about the farming of marine animals for which questions about suffering are either out of the picture or at least much less concerning? Cases of this do probably exist - oysters, clams, mussels - but this is a shorter list than once seemed likely. The list will probably not include shrimp, for example. On the other hand, my defence of eating wild-caught fish would also apply to wild game - (wild) venison and wild boar, for example. Some people might think those cases raise special problems, as mammals are being hunted. The numbers are also much smaller, though.

Would all wild-caught seafood have the same arguments applicable to them as apply to wild-caught fish? Not necessarily, as the handling of wild-caught marine animals can be unusually cruel in some cases, as seen in the boiling alive of lobsters and other crustaceans.

I do feel the incongruity in the claim that humane farming of any kind that includes death might be a positive good. But many views get themselves into awkward places in this area. In the picture below, I have a couple of frames from a short video that was posted on Twitter by an organisation called Animals Australia. My admiration for this organisation, I want to say at the outset, is just about boundless. For many years, they have opposed the extraordinarily cruel live export of sheep and cattle from Australia to the Middle East, and have done many other impressive things, as well. My questioning of this social media message should be read with that as background.

The suggestion in the video is that, by choosing plant-based foods, we can give cows ""the life they dream of"" - a happy, low-stress life. But if plant-based foods come to dominate human diets, the result will not be a ""happy cow"" scenario, but something closer to a ""no more cows"" scenario. There will be no reason to give cows any sort of life at all, except perhaps for a few in zoos and the like (and zoos, of course, raise another set of ethical questions). If we want there to be happy cows, in any numbers, that entails a continuation of farming of some kind. This makes vivid the idea that humane beef farming might be justified as a positive good, rather than something that's not as bad as what happens at present.

I've not written this essay as a dialectical exercise in which a particular conclusion is picked out in advance and I want to entice or cajole the reader into getting to the same place as me. I don't know where the discussion leaves me. Looking at it dispassionately, the arguments for humanely farmed beef seem good, but I do share some of the unease that vegetarians have about this option. Both the other options have their advantages, and I don't see any of them as inherently unreasonable.

One response to this situation might be: choose all of them! Spread the choices around. If one did this, everything one ate would be defensible on some line of thinking. I sympathise, though, with the rejoinder that says: make up your mind!

A recent line of thought in moral philosophy becomes relevant here. Some hold that if one is working out what to do in a situation of uncertainty about various moral arguments, one should do a kind of ""expected value"" calculation, choosing the action that comes out best when all the moral theories that might be right are taken into account. If one is torn 50/50 between utilitarianism and a Kantian view based on rights and duties, for example, one can try to find choices that look OK on both. If one is more of a utilitarian but has some Kantian doubts, one can weight utilitarian reasons higher, but still look for something that makes some sense if the Kantian view is right. This talk of a moral theory turning out to be right, in roughly the way that the weather tomorrow will turn out one way or another, seems philosophically off base to me, but I can also see the practical appeal of this move. What would it mean in this case? Might it mean that one can indeed mix or combine the three, or does that ignore that fact that, according to some of the moral outlooks that would figure in the accounting, killing sentient beings is an enormous harm?

Finally, I realise that at least some of the options I am considering here do not ""scale up"" to yield a solution to questions about diet for humanity as a whole, especially in the long term. These reflections are intended for people right now, in situations where all three of the options discussed are feasible everyday choices, given a person's economic situation and what is available to them. The future will probably be different, including not just advances in plant-based foods but, if the technology works out, a lot of cultured or lab-grown meat. The fact that, at some time in the future, our food choices will look very different does not change the fact that we do have these choices now. And at least for people whose constitution resists veganism, the choice is vivid. I am not left, at the end of all this, with a definite conclusion.

What do you think?

A new documentary airing on ABC explores the toll Dark Emu took on its author as it sought to challenge the way Australia once understood Indigenous people

In the decade since Bruce Pascoe's book Dark Emu was published, it has become a bestseller, a seminal historical text and a launchpad for controversy. The book reframed the colonial lens through which Australia understood its Indigenous history, which had reduced Aboriginal people to simple hunter-gatherers prior to European settlement.

In Dark Emu, Pascoe set out to prove ancient Aboriginal practices of agriculture and construction, which showed a sophisticated use of land that had predated colonisers.

Dark Emu has sold more than 360,000 copies - making it one of the highest-selling books of its kind. But it has not come without a culture war. The literary awards and critical acclaim were followed by backlash: a challenge to Pascoe's Aboriginality, and another to the validity of his research.

In a new documentary, the Dark Emu Story, set to screen on the ABC on Tuesday, Pascoe stares down the barrel of the camera. ""We are going through great change at the moment ""¦ I just got caught up in the fight,"" he says. ""I'm now captive to The Dark Emu.""

Pascoe's Dark Emu journey began in a dim, secondhand bookstore, where he discovered first-hand accounts from European explorers of ancient Aboriginal practices. These journal entries detailed Aboriginal women picking yams from vast fields, their longstanding hut structures and stores of grain they would raid. His book presented this as evidence that flipped the narrative that Aboriginal people lived nomadic lives with no permanent settlements, agriculture, tools or technology. Framing Aboriginal people as hunter-gatherers implied they only had a loose connection to land - a convenient position for those who wished to colonise it.

The Dark Emu Story, directed by Allan Clarke for Blackfella Films, revisits Pascoe's research. It steps through archeological findings on Mithaka country in south-west Queensland, where grinding stones - used for turning grain into flour - and levers have been held up as evidence of mining operations, tool creation and trade between communities.

It also reckons with the legacy of Pascoe's research: as Stan Grant puts it, Dark Emu was an ""entry point"" for white Australians, which ""looks into the dark heart and soul of the nation that we know as blackfellas all too well ""¦ that Australians turn away from."" Anthropologist Marcia Langton credits the book for having shifted the perception that Indigenous people were ""savage"" before colonisation to ""fully fledged human beings.""

Anchored by case studies, the film shows us past and present practices of Indigenous farming, animal trapping and baking. We learn how fish were caught using rock formations in lakes, and how crops were winnowed into seeds, then flour, then paste and cooked over fire to make bread. Acknowledgement of these practices ""makes me proud of who I am and where I am from"", says Gomeroi bush tucker expert Kerrie Saunders.

The film doesn't shy away from the controversy and culture wars that followed Dark Emu's publication and success. As Pascoe's book scored him government grants and literary prizes, including categories reserved for Indigenous writers, his heritage was called into question.

In 2020, Aboriginal lawyer Josephine Cashman made a complaint to the then-home affairs minister Peter Dutton, who requested the Australian federal police investigate Pascoe's Indigenous ancestry on the grounds that he was potentially benefiting financially from falsely claiming the identity. The request was rejected by the AFP. But the move called Pascoe, and in turn his research, into question. Criticism and suspicion replaced the celebration of a groundbreaking book. It also greatly impacted Pascoe's personal life: in 2017 he and his wife, the author Lyn Harwood, separated.

""I just feel very tired in my spirit,"" he says in the documentary. ""It'd be nice if someone else had written it. But I did write it, and I did become the seeker of a debate, and it did cost my family ""¦ I'm not as happy as I was.""

In 2021, an academic rebuttal to Dark Emu was published: Farmers or Hunter-Gatherers? The Dark Emu Debate by anthropologist Peter Sutton and archeologist Keryn Walshe. Both authors appear in the documentary, arguing Pascoe ignored evidence that did not fit his case while over-emphasising evidence that did. Pascoe and Sutton come head-to-head in the film, debating definitions such as of the word ""sophistication"".

""What's wrong with being unsophisticated?"" Sutton asks. ""Why do you hold up a battle of sophistication as a kind of a solution to people, filling their racism?""

Pascoe challenges this relentlessly. ""What Aboriginal people were doing was very unusual in the world,"" he says. ""I want Aboriginal kids to know these things, so they have more pride in their ancestors. The more we learn about our country, the better they will look after it.""

In a Q&A following the documentary's launch at the Sydney film festival in June, Pascoe admitted these were moments he hadn't been keen to revisit. ""All of that is peripheral. It's unnecessary,"" he said. ""From my point of view, I want to talk about Mithaka ""¦ and the positives in our culture, but also the positives as a nation of people, a diverse community.""

Though Dark Emu took its toll on its author, the documentary positions Pascoe's work as a successful challenge to the way Australia once understood Indigenous people and cultures.

""We are still standing here. That's the important thing,"" Grant says in the documentary. ""I think what Bruce did is he spoke into that void. Closed his eyes, stood in the silence, in the land, and said, ""˜Close your eyes, imagine this country again and then open.' Magic.""

The Dark Emu Story screens on the ABC at 8.30pm 18 July, and will stream on iView

Decline worse in Britain than other countries, as conservationists blame agriculture and global heating

Butterfly populations that live on grasslands across Europe have declined by more than a third in the past decade, according to a study.

Seventeen species that were once commonly found in pastures and meadows across 22 countries, including the small copper, common blue and meadow brown, declined by 36% on average between 2011 and 2020.

The population drop is more severe in Britain than in other countries. But the large blue (Phengaris arion) - the species that has been worst affected across Europe, where numbers are down 82% since 1990- is actually thriving in Britain due to a reintroduction programme and ongoing targeted conservation management.

Other species showing significant declines across Europe include the wall (Lasiommata megera), down 68%, the adonis blue (Lysandra bellargus), falling by 64%, and the small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus), down 61%.

Conservation scientists attribute the ongoing declines to agricultural intensification. This includes the ploughing of traditional grasslands and the heavy use of fertilisers and herbicides, which destroy the wildflowers and grasses that butterfly caterpillars feed on.

Nitrogen deposition from vehicle emissions and agriculture is also a factor, alongside global heating.

Nigel Bourn, chief scientist at Butterfly Conservation, said: ""These really horrific large-scale declines are driven by major changes across Europe, although it's very difficult to tease apart the relative contribution of all these major changes we're seeing.

""It's pretty depressing. These are widespread species and we should be really worried about them and what they tell us about the state of the general countryside. We have to find a new more wildlife-friendly way of growing food and we've still got quite a long way to go.""

The figures are based on data from the European grassland butterfly indicator, a key measure of the health of European grasslands, which has been compiled by Butterfly Conservation Europe.

European conservationists hope the EU's proposed nature restoration law, which sets out binding targets to reverse the decline in wild insect pollinators and return nature to ecosystems, will help to halt the losses.

Member states will be given two years after the regulation has been introduced to submit plans on how they intend to meet the targets. They are also obliged to record whether their measures work, with the European grassland butterfly indicator being one of the key markers of success.

Dr Martin Warren, head of development at Butterfly Conservation Europe, said: ""The rapid decline of Europe's grassland butterflies is a clear warning sign of the plight of wildlife across Europe. The new EU restoration law is a massively important piece of legislation to tackle these declines and we hope that member states will rise to the challenge to help solve the biodiversity crisis we are facing.""

Like ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey said, we should all learn to ""˜cherish' this overlooked winter root, but obsess? Maybe not

I've been in the grip of something of a turnip obsession for a while now, a fixation sparked - I can hardly believe I'm writing this - by the former agriculture secretary, ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey, who responded to salad shortages in our supermarkets earlier this year with the instruction that rather than pining for off-season tomatoes, we should all learn to ""cherish"" the turnip instead. I know: as edicts go, this was laughable, even before we learned that the UK's biggest turnip-grower, which also happened to be in Coffey's Suffolk constituency, had recently given up on the crop, disheartened by the refusal of supermarkets to pay more for the vegetable in the face of rising costs. But still, I must admit it worked for me. Ever since, I've thought about turnips more than is either natural or entirely sane.

Such an obsession obviously involves finding good new things to do with turnips, a quest that has sent me back to books I've owned seemingly forever (I heartily recommend Colin Spencer's Vegetable Pleasures, published the year I graduated from college, which includes a dashing - and delicious - recipe for turnips with walnuts, orange and parmesan). But mostly it has had me worrying away at the baffling question of demand. Even as supermarkets report an uplift in sales of less expensive meats, such as ox cheek and chicken liver, the poor old turnip continues to be denied a comeback. In farmers' markets, many greengrocers and most restaurants, it is the Wally (as in Where's Wally?) of vegetables. Spot one if you can.

Why so unfashionable? In France, le navet really is cherished. But at last, I've a proper answer to this question. In Stuffed, her fantastically well-researched, and extremely interesting, new history of feast and famine in Britain, Pen Vogler attributes the turnip's slow demise to (and here, for reasons of space, I must simplify a bit) radical improvements in farming techniques. Once landowners grasped, some time in the early 18th century, that turnips could both be grown at scale, even on sandy land, and stored over the winter (which meant they could be fed to animals that would otherwise have to be slaughtered), the game was up: the old connection between the growing, cooking and eating of turnips by humans was severed, if not lost entirely. In the long term, they would henceforth be thought of as fodder rather than food; a thing for the barn, not the dinner table.

What a loss this was, and not only because such a fall from grace only further increased the British devotion to meat. Vogler writes captivatingly of a Tudor priest called Andrew Boorde, in whose 1542 book, A Compendyous Regyment or a Dyetary of Healthe, the turnip is held up as a quasi medicine, good both for the appetite and for the, er, augmentation of ""the seede of man"".

Later writers, including the famous diarist and gardener John Evelyn, vouched for the delectable sweetness of the many garden varieties of turnip (some of which were eaten raw) and provided myriad recipes for them, including the classic French dish, duck with turnips, and a bread made with mashed and squeezed turnips. The favourite ""sallet"" of Charles I was turnip tops, boiled like asparagus, while another popular early 18th-century cookbook recommended cutting fried turnips into shapes like dice or cockscombs, the better to prettify the rims of soup plates.

All this was revelatory to me; henceforth, I fully intend to bore people with my newfound knowledge of Enlightenment crop rotation and its mournful consequences. But alas, I can't say it has done much to alleviate my weird preoccupation. The opposite, in fact. In a minute, I'll go down to the kitchen, where five pristine turnips - fat and purple and white, like miniature members of the House of Lords - await my attention (yes, I'm cheating: these are small, ""spring"" turnips, imported from Portugal, not big British winter ones). In Stuffed, Vogler notes a Victorian recipe for swede with ginger, a combination that chimes with Spencer, who believes the same spice to be a good match for the slight radish-like pepperiness of turnip - so maybe I'll try that. The vegetables are steamed, and served with a sauce made from butter, grated ginger, honey, and the juice and zest of a lemon. How lovely: hardly turnip-like at all.

Andrew Mitchell wants next week's food security conference to find ways to tackle waste and pests - and to show that aid works

The UK development minister, Andrew Mitchell, is staring down a test tube in a Surrey laboratory. He is looking at a specimen of the fall armyworm, a pest with a voracious appetite that can munch its way through an African maize crop at astonishing speed.

The moth arrived on the African continent from the Americas in 2016, and has spread to 28 countries, gorging its way through maize, wheat and cotton at an alarming rate. Only the desert locust and the brown marmorated stink bug have been more destructive to arable farming.

Mitchell's visit to the Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (Cabi) comes ahead of a global food security summit in London next week, hosted by the UK government. ""It is going to come up with some very practical proposals,"" Mitchell believes.

The aim of the summit is ""to demonstrate and interrogate the huge contribution that science, research and British academic institutions are making to the global problem of starvation and malnutrition"", he says.

The lab, which is partly funded by the UK, combines research with practical advice, holding online clinics in locations including Kenya and Pakistan. It claims to have reached 60 million smallholder farmers since 2011.

About 40% of food production worldwide is lost to pests and diseases, and one of Cabi's strengths is its ability to spot trends in plant diseases. Its scientists say they are engaged in looking for nature-based solutions.

If a local clinic cannot identify a disease, the plant is sent as a sample to Cabi headquarters for identification against its catalogue of 38,000 organisms.

Mitchell says that, ""for the global good"", the world needs to get away from pesticides and find ways to cut the cost of natural solutions and make them more user-friendly. ""If we tackle food disease naturally, it is better for the environment, the soil, people.""

Cabi is an unassuming piece of British soft power, says Mitchell, who was international development secretary under David Cameron and returned to lead the UK's development brief in October 2022.

He is determined to restore Britain's reputation as a development superpower, and the food summit, combined with publication of a white paper, is the culmination of his work to reduce the mess left by Boris Johnson's cuts to spending on aid and closure of the Department for International Development. Mitchell wants the summit to show the public that aid works.

It is his ill fortune that the summit comes as the siege in Gaza, supported by the UK government, is taking a terrible toll on a civilian population. UN agencies have estimated that more than 1.6 million people in Gaza are in critical need of aid.

Mitchell is determined to compartmentalise the issues, but if the Gaza crisis continues, it may be hard to do so at the summit.

While sympathetic to Israel, Mitchell has a record that suggests he might not be supporting its methods if not for cabinet collective responsibility. In 2014, during a smaller outburst of violence in Gaza, he called for an arms embargo to be imposed on Israel.

""There are very strict rules governing the conduct of international warfare, and the UN and the schools, which are places of sanctuary in Gaza, clearly should not be attacked,"" he said then.

For now, he promises the food security summit will try to answer the broader question of ""how to stop the obscenity of children starving to death from malnutrition in a world where there is plenty of food"", and how to tackle the problem of food waste, pointing to the fact that 40% of all food grown is never eaten.

This is not a conference at which donors will be asked to pledge funds, Mitchell says, but a chance to highlight the scientific work being undertaken to fight hunger and malnutrition.

He has long been a fan of Plumpy'Nut, marvelling that ""you can give this peanut-based paste to a malnourished child, and within half an hour they will be running around playing football"". Trialled in Niger 17 years ago, the vitamin- and protein-loaded paste has been given to millions of severely malnourished children. It does not need to be cooked or refrigerated, and stays fresh after opening.

Mitchell has been on this beat for long enough to have seen some grim sights, and is especially haunted by hospital wards in Yemen. ""It is often the same combination: a deeply malnourished child with a wide-eyed terrified mother by her side on the bed.

""And sometimes, what has stood between them and death is British taxpayers' money,"" he says.

But he has also seen food rotting by the side of the road in central Africa because farmers cannot transport their product to market or had no cold storage. As the climate crisis grips, he fears this waste will worsen.

He wants his white paper to take British development policy to 2030 in a way that Labour, if elected, could also broadly adopt, and that would get the UN sustainable development goals back on track.

It will also look at how to develop the Bridgetown Initiative proposed by the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, and the reform of the global financial system.

Mitchell hopes the summit will have an impact beyond development professionals. He has used previous summits, including ones on vaccination and family planning, to persuade sceptics that aid works.

""You can take taxpayers with you,"" he says, ""but only if you keep making the argument.""

The gardening pioneer Joy Larkhom changed how we grow veg and championed rocket, salad bags and pak choi. What is she growing now?

Joy Larkcom is singing the praises of sugarloaf chicory. ""It's got deep roots, its leaves form a dense, crisp heart, and it withstands drought better than lettuce,"" she says. ""Sadly, these rarely find their way into the seed catalogues for amateur gardeners."" Her love for this unsung salad leaf sums up Larkcom's lifelong passion: to bring more variety to our kitchen tables and preserve genetic diversity.

Larkcom, 87, is a vegetable grower and writer famous for her influential books from The Organic Salad Garden to Grow Your Own Vegetables. Drawing from direct experience - for 30 years as an experimental market gardener in Suffolk; latterly in her garden in West Cork - her writing reads just as she speaks: authoritative yet lighthearted, combining practical, scientifically sound advice with an enthusiasm for continued learning.

As a younger woman, Larkcom travelled the world in search of diverse vegetables and cultivation knowledge, from multicultural allotments in the US to vegetable growers in Taiwan and Japan.

In 1975, with her late husband, Don Pollard, and their two children (then aged seven and five), she set off on a year's road trip through Europe by caravan. Don homeschooled the children and cooked while Larkcom provided income by writing for UK gardening magazines. In every country, she found something of interest: in Italy they learned how to prepare wild chicory and thistle, and how to suck honey from borage flowers, while in Belgium she encountered the ""cut-and-come-again"" techniques she became known for advocating whereby certain salad leaves are snipped and subsequently regrow, providing a further harvest.

She brought home more than 150 varieties of seed, along with memories of beautiful places, plants and the generosity of strangers. In her archive, I found Larkcom's notebook of ""useful phrases"" jotted down along the way: the French for mulch, Portuguese for seedbed, Hungarian for sorrel and radish.

Following her ""grand vegetable tour"", Larkcom introduced unusual varieties, such as red, curly-leaved Lollo Rosso lettuce, Chioggia beetroot (with its theatrical pink and white rings) and red chicory to the UK, trialling them in her garden and encouraging seed companies to take them on. Inspired by traditional Italian and French salad mixtures they had seen in Europe, she and Don began selling mixed bags of salad leaves, dubbed ""saladini"", to an early organic food shop in London. These included unusual elements such as edible flowers and sprouted seeds. In her writing, she featured other vegetables common on the continent but long vanished from British cultivation - salsify, scorzonera and purslane, for example.

For a three-week trip to China in 1985 - to research Chinese vegetables suitable for the UK - Larkcom learned the language, combed phrasebooks for gardening terms and wrote countless letters to the authorities. The trip acquainted her with the pak chois, hardy mustards, leafy brassicas and Chinese chives she would later champion back home.

Widening the range of what we grow, however, holds a greater importance than the purely culinary - something Larkcom remains every bit as resolute about today. To help mitigate the effects of climate change, ""we need to keep as much genetic material available as possible,"" she says, ""in order to develop drought and disease-resistant varieties and to find resistance in older varieties. Here [in West Cork], blight does seem to be worse with milder temperatures - I can't grow summer raspberries at all. New diseases are occurring and you just hope the research can keep up with them.

""It's totally unpredictable now. I was writing about climate change fairly frivolously about 25 years ago. Back then you just thought: ""˜Well, this means we're going to be able to grow oranges.' I don't think anyone had any concept of the devastating implications we're now aware of: wide-scale drought and water shortages, extreme storms.""

As for growing crops at home, Larkcom advises: ""Be as diverse as possible; be adventurous with what you grow - you may get away with things you couldn't in the past. It could become much easier to grow Mediterranean crops such as tomatoes, peppers and melons in the open, or semi-tropical squashes, okra, soya and yardlong beans.""

She also suggests that we, as consumers, change our ways. ""People won't eat anything with a blemish on it - so many people don't have contact with freshly grown vegetables and don't realise how you can eat a scabby apple, for example. This thing about bringing stuff across the world, such as bananas or avocados, is so ludicrous. We've got to cut down on transport and appreciate there's plenty that can be grown on our own shores.""

Joy Larkcom's top five homegrown vegetables

Salad mixes

For a small space, salad mixes offer really good value. ""Almost all seed companies do salad mixes, and because they're a mixture, something in them is going to work. Last year I sowed a ""˜spicy' salad mix in an old fish crate that washed up on the beach here, and they've grown quite big - I just snip the leaves with scissors.""

Chilli peppersChillis grow as well on a sunny windowsill as in a cold greenhouse. ""I always grow Hungarian Hot Wax chilli peppers. I find them much easier than ordinary peppers and they have a lovely mild flavour.""

Tomatoes

Larkcom favours blight-resistant tomato varieties such as the heavy-cropping Ferline and the newer Mountain Magic. ""Another really good tomato I always grow is San Marzano. On the whole it's a very good cropper - it makes these solid-fleshed tomatoes that I pick and bung straight in the freezer; they're much better than the normal plum-shaped ones.""

Perpetual spinach
""If people haven't got much space, perpetual spinach is a very good, reliable plant. It doesn't taste quite as good as spinachy-spinach, but it's much less likely to run to seed and nothing much seems to attack it.""

Komatsuna

Larkcom considers this crunchy brassica leaf underrated, useful and very hardy. ""If you're sick to death of the normal kales and cabbages, it's a lovely winter crop. You can grow it close together to cut as small leaves or space it further apart for a larger mature plant.""

Humanity faces ""˜devastating domino effects' including mass displacement and financial ruin as planet warms

Many of the gravest threats to humanity are drawing closer, as carbon pollution heats the planet to ever more dangerous levels, scientists have warned.

Five important natural thresholds already risk being crossed, according to the Global Tipping Points report, and three more may be reached in the 2030s if the world heats 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial temperatures.

Triggering these planetary shifts will not cause temperatures to spiral out of control in the coming centuries but will unleash dangerous and sweeping damage to people and nature that cannot be undone.

""Tipping points in the Earth system pose threats of a magnitude never faced by humanity,"" said Tim Lenton, from the University of Exeter's Global Systems Institute. ""They can trigger devastating domino effects, including the loss of whole ecosystems and capacity to grow staple crops, with societal impacts including mass displacement, political instability and financial collapse.""

The tipping points at risk include the collapse of big ice sheets in Greenland and the West Antarctic, the widespread thawing of permafrost, the death of coral reefs in warm waters, and the collapse of one oceanic current in the North Atlantic.

Unlike other changes to the climate such as hotter heatwaves and heavier rainfall, these systems do not slowly shift in line with greenhouse gas emissions but can instead flip from one state to an entirely different one. When a climatic system tips - sometimes with a sudden shock - it may permanently alter the way the planet works.

Scientists warn that there are large uncertainties around when such systems will shift but the report found that three more may soon join the list. These include mangroves and seagrass meadows, which are expected to die off in some regions if the temperatures rise between 1.5C and 2C, and boreal forests, which may tip as early as 1.4C of heating or as late as 5C.

The warning comes as world leaders meet for the Cop28 climate summit in Dubai. On Tuesday, Climate Action Tracker estimated that their emissions targets for 2030 put the planet on track to heat 2.5C by the end of the century, despite promises from countries at a previous summit to try to limit it to 1.5C.

The tipping point report, produced by an international team of 200 researchers and funded by Bezos Earth Fund, is the latest in a series of warnings about the most extreme effects of climate change.

Scientists have warned that some of the shifts can create feedback loops that heat the planet further or alter weather patterns in a way that triggers other tipping points.

The researchers said the systems were so tightly linked they could not rule out ""tipping cascades"". If the Greenland ice sheet disintegrates, for instance, it could lead to an abrupt shift in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, an important current that delivers most of the heat to the gulf stream. That, in turn, can intensify the El NiÃ±o southern oscillation, one of the most powerful weather patterns on the planet.

The co-author Sina Loriani, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said tipping-point risks could be disastrous and should be taken very seriously, despite the remaining uncertainties.

""Crossing these thresholds may trigger fundamental and sometimes abrupt changes that could irreversibly determine the fate of essential parts of our Earth system for the coming hundreds or thousands of years,"" he said.

In its latest review of climate change science, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that tipping thresholds were unclear but the dangers would grow more likely as the planet heats up.

It said: ""Risks associated with large-scale singular events or tipping points, such as ice-sheet instability or ecosystem loss from tropical forests, transition to high risk between 1.5C to 2.5C and to very high risk between 2.5C to 4C.""

The tipping point report also looked at what it called ""positive tipping points"", such as the plummeting price of renewable energy and the growth in sales of electric vehicles. It found that such shifts do not happen by themselves but need to be enabled by stimulating innovation, shaping markets, regulating business, and educating and mobilising the public.

A study from the report's co-author Manjana Milkoreit last year warned against overusing the label of social tipping points by promising solutions that did not exist at scale or could not be controlled.

""While scholarship benefits from hope, we need to exercise caution when offering social tipping points as potential solutions to the temporal squeeze of climate change,"" she wrote.

This article was amended on 6 December 2023. An earlier version incorrectly referred to ""atmospheric circulation"", rather than oceanic current, in the North Atlantic.

The party has a hostile stance on attempts to cut carbon emissions but got more votes than any other in general election

The shocking success of Geert Wilders' far-right PVV party in Dutch elections has left climate activists fearful of a drastic shift to fossil fuels and a rollback of climate policies if it manages to form a government.

Best known abroad for its rhetoric against Muslims, the PVV, which came first in Wednesday's election but may struggle to find coalition partners, has taken a hard line on policies to stop the planet getting hotter.

The party wants to extract more oil and gas from the North Sea and stop building wind turbines and solar farms. It also wants to abolish the Dutch climate law and leave the Paris agreement on climate change.

""If these elections make one thing clear, it's that politics will not save us,"" said Yolande Schuur from the Dutch branch of activist group Extinction Rebellion.

The PVV, whose success with voters was praised by far-right leaders across Europe on Thursday, has said it is not going to waste billions on ""pointless climate hobbies"".

Its manifesto says that the climate has always changed and that the Netherlands - 26% of which lies below sea level - can adapt to further changes. ""We will stop the hysterical reduction of CO2 , with which we, as a small country, mistakenly think we can save the climate.""

The Dutch are among the biggest polluters in the world, and also in Europe. Per person, the Netherlands pumped more planet-heating gas into the atmosphere in 2021 than all other EU member states bar Estonia, the Czech Republic, Ireland and Luxembourg.

""PVV is close to climate denialism,"" said Heleen de Coninck, professor of climate policy at Eindhoven University of Technology. ""It's not quite denying that climate change is happening and human-made any more, but this is a recent turn.""

Despite this, said De Coninck, who also serves as the vice-chair of the Netherlands Scientific Climate Council, the party's most extreme views may be tempered even if it is part of a ruling coalition.

""For many of its proposals, the party will not find a majority at all in parliament,"" she said. ""There was an easy majority for the climate law in parliament and that has not changed.""

Kees van der Leun, managing director of energy consultancy Common Futures, agreed that most Dutch lawmakers favoured ""staying the course"".

The country's climate policies, he said, are guided by EU commitments, recent efforts to kick its dependence on Russian gas and growing interest from businesses. ""In my view, the election outcome isn't likely to significantly slow down our climate policies.""

The EU has committed to cutting emissions by 55% by the end of the decade from 1990 levels before reaching net zero by 2050. The Netherlands is a vocal force in EU climate debates and its former deputy prime minister Wopke Hoekstra is the bloc's top climate envoy.

Dick van Dam, a researcher at the Netherlands environment agency, said the influence of the election on the climate ""may be felt more in Brussels than in The Hague"".

But the prospect of a so-called ""Nexit"" could change this. PVV wants a referendum on taking the Netherlands out of the EU, though Wilders told Dutch media on Thursday that cutting immigration was his priority.

Two other centre-right parties from which Wilders may seek support - the VVD of the outgoing prime minister Mark Rutte and the NSC of Pieter Omtzigt - have committed to remaining in the EU and supporting the Paris agreement.

""Wilders will need at least two other parties to form a coalition,"" said Silke Mooldijk, an analyst at the environmental thinktank NewClimate Institute. ""While climate mitigation is not a top priority of either the VVD or the NSC, we don't expect these parties to agree to a complete standstill of national climate policies.""

Climate activists are more fearful. Activists from Greenpeace protested against his success in The Hague on Thursday afternoon, waving banners that said: ""No climate denier as our prime minister.""

Andy Palmen, director of the Dutch branch of Greenpeace, said: ""The climate, our oceans, healthy nature and sustainable agriculture are all at stake.""

He added that the Netherlands does not need a leader who denies climate change but someone who knows how to unite people with honesty, hope and respect. ""Wilders has shown that he is not the right person for that.""

Schuur from Extinction Rebellion said the climate policy of the previous government was already inadequate and that the PVV has enough seats to align with delayers and deniers in other parties to block needed policies.

""Even if the PVV is not part of the new government, they can frustrate necessary climate action with 37 seats [out of 150] in the House of Representatives.""

Although small, the Netherlands is an outsize polluter and hub for European industry and agriculture. Its efforts to cut nitrogen pollution after a court ruled levels of the pollutant too high led to widespread protests from farmers and support for the Farmer Citizen Movement, which won the most seats in the Dutch senate earlier this year.

A poll from Ipsos before the election found nitrogen is one of the most polarising issues for Dutch voters - 30% think livestock herds should be limited to cut nitrogen emissions, while 40% disagree.

Still, said De Coninck, voters may have been more concerned with trust in government than the environment, particularly on the right.

""Even though this is a black page in Dutch election history - with a populist extreme-right party becoming so big - I don't think this was a climate election.""

The Argentinian writer on her new short-story collection and how her dystopian novel about a human meat industry became a TikTok sensation

Every day, upon leaving her Catholic high school, Agustina Bazterrica and her friends were followed by the same predatory man who would aim ""the most terrible words"" in their direction. A different man once masturbated in front of her on a packed train. ""No one did anything,"" she recalls. Coupled with the epidemic of violence against women in her native Argentina - where 212 femicides were reported in 2022 - these early experiences nurtured the feeling that ""because you are a woman, anything can happen to you at any time"".

This sense of ever-present threat permeates the author's new short story collection, 19 Claws and a Black Bird, translated by Sarah Moses, which serves up a smÃ¶rgÃ¥sbord of assault, murder and suicide. It follows Bazterrica's second novel, Tender Is the Flesh, set in a world where cannibalism has been legalised after a virus renders animal meat unfit for human consumption. That novel laid bare the violence in everyday experiences of womanhood through visceral, often shocking prose: for example, a female ""head"" (the euphemistic word for human livestock) has her vocal cords removed to prevent her from screaming.

First published in 2017, Tender Is the Flesh won the Premio ClarÃ­n de Novela award for Spanish literature. Upon its English-language release in 2020, the New York Times described it as Soylent Green meets The Wanting Seed, only ""more powerful"", and it went on to become a viral sensation on TikTok, where users collectively gagged at Bazterrica's 23-page description of a human factory farm.

Tender Is the Flesh, also translated by Moses, preempted the recent wave of cannibal-themed culture, which Bazterrica says reflects a natural obsession with taboo subjects. But - much like Mimi Cave's film Fresh, Claire Kohda's vampire novel Woman, Eating and the TV series Yellowjackets - the Argentine writer turns a feminist lens on flesh-eating.

""Tender Is the Flesh is a meditation on what capitalism is - it teaches us to naturalise cruelty,"" she says, speaking over Zoom from the home she shares with her husband and two cats in Buenos Aires. ""Capitalism is a system into which we are all born, we have it inside of us, and patriarchy is part of that system. I tried to work with this idea that we eat each other in a symbolic way. With women it's so obvious, because you can talk about human trafficking, war and the way women are made invisible in different spheres. Here in Argentina, they kill women every day. Capitalism and cannibalism are almost the same, you know?""

Bazterrica grew up in Buenos Aires in a family of voracious readers. As a young adult, she briefly entertained the prospect of becoming an opera singer before going on to study fine art. For 22 years, she balanced creative writing with secretarial work, publishing a novel (Matar a la NiÃ±a, or Kill the Girl) in 2013, followed by a collection of short stories in 2016, many of which are being republished as part of 19 Claws. Written over a 30-year period, an even earlier version of the collection won the Buenos Aires Municipal prize for literature, a major literary award in Argentina that provides winners with a lifetime allowance to support the pursuit of their craft. But it was only in 2021, after the English-language publication of Tender Is the Flesh, that Bazterrica quit her job to focus on writing.

In 19 Claws, Bazterrica resumes the study of the macabre that characterised Tender Is the Flesh. This time, however, the brutality of the female experience is cut through with a dark wit and a heavy dose of the fantastic. Candy Pink is a deranged self-help manual, guiding readers through the increasingly erratic stages of a break-up. In The Continuous Equality of the Circumference, a woman goes to extreme lengths in her quest to become a circle. The story highlights the absurdity of modern beauty standards while inverting the notion of thinness as aspirational.

""When I started writing the story, I didn't have the knowledge of what we now call ""˜fatphobia', but I did live it every day of my life in Argentina, which is one of the most fatphobic countries in the world,"" says Bazterrica. ""Here, if you want to get clothes, there are only three sizes - small, medium and large - and even the large is really small.""

Another short story, Roberto, tackles child sexual abuse over an unsettling two pages. It gave Bazterrica her second brush with internet stardom; a reading of the text, posted by TikTok user @lulegallo, has been viewed nearly 4m times. At 49, Bazterrica says she is ""too old"" for the app but is grateful for the role it has played in her success. She is wary, too, of the anti-BookTok discourse that has arisen in recent months (a viral GQ article published in February said the corner of the app where people post reading recommendations was overrun with ""an uncanny falseness"" and ""a showy nothingness that only approximates bibliophilia"").

""Every platform or social network has its contradictions. However, I believe that it has a lot to do with how one uses them and what one decides to consume,"" she says. ""Anything which disseminates literature is highly positive to me.""

Bazterrica recently completed a third novel, another ""violent dystopia"" featuring the secret diary of a woman living in a post-apocalypse world. She is planning on turning one of the stories from 19 Claws - A Light, Swift and Monstrous Sound - into a full-length novel, too. Of the collection, she says: ""I want the short stories to be like claws that take the reader and scrape them a little bit. If you're indifferent to a text, the text doesn't work.""

Declaration signed by more than 20 Indigenous groups says dingoes are a ""˜cultural icon' and killing them is ""˜killing family'

First Nations people around the country have called for the immediate end of lethal dingo control, following an inaugural national dingo forum held in Cairns on Friday and Saturday.

A national dingo declaration signed by representatives from more than 20 First Nations groups says ""lethal control should never be an option"".

""We do not, and have never, approved the killing of dingoes. Killing dingoes is killing family. We demand an immediate stop to this ""˜management' across Australia,"" the statement reads.

""Dingoes are genetically, physically, and behaviourally different to domestic dogs, and must not be treated as such.""

The consensus statement comes after dozens of scientists wrote to the New South Wales, Victorian and South Australian governments last month pushing for changes to dingo policies in light of new scientific research revealing most dingoes as genetically pure.

""The dingo is a cultural icon representing a vital connection to Country whose significance cannot be put into words,"" the statement reads.

""Dingoes remain deeply embedded in the daily lives of First Nations peoples as companions, hunting partners, protectors, and family members. They share our same experience of atrocities and journey of survival.""

Dingoes are classified as native species in all jurisdictions on the Australian mainland, but are subject to lethal control activities in some national parks, including trapping and aerial and ground shooting.

""The legislation doesn't value our perspectives or our cultural values and rights,"" said Sonya Takau, communications officer at Girringun Aboriginal Corporation.

Sign up for Guardian Australia's free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup

Girringun Aboriginal Corporation, which organised the national First Nations dingo forum, represents the interests of nine traditional owner groups across far north Queensland.

""History was made over the weekend,"" Takau said. ""We've made a very serious declaration to government, and we hope that they will commence communication with us and bring us to the table with other stakeholders to have a say.""

""We understand that farmers, particularly sheep and goat farmers, will be concerned about protecting their livestock from predation by dingoes. But we want to work alongside landholders to adopt readily available non-lethal solutions,"" Takau added.

""There are landholders in Australia and overseas that have had great success protecting their livestock from predators using guardian animals in paddocks, such as maremmas.""

The national statement advocates for a ""caring for dingoes on country model"", combining evidence-based practice with traditional knowledge.

""We demand our rights to have our voice, and capacity to apply culture in all matters relating to the dingo. We have the right as Traditional Custodians to be directly involved in decision-making in all legislation and management actions that impact dingoes, across all levels of government,"" it declares.

Prof Euan Ritchie, an ecologist at Deakin University and a member of the Biodiversity Council, described the national declaration as ""a watershed moment for dingoes"".

""The perspectives and concerns of First Nations peoples have been sidelined for far too long. This powerful declaration makes very clear that we as a country must change management and policy to better recognise the cultural importance of dingoes,"" said Ritchie, who attended the conference.

""Dingoes, as Australia's largest land-based predator aside from people, are critical for maintaining healthy Country. But as the declaration shows they are also fundamental to the health and wellbeing of First Nations peoples.""

Prime minister under fire as government backtracks on plan for more onshore turbines to keep voters on side

Rishi Sunak is facing mounting criticism for putting politics above the fight against climate change, amid clear signs that ministers are backtracking on plans to allow more onshore windfarms in England before a general election.

The Observer understands that a much-vaunted government consultation on ending what has in effect been a ban on new onshore wind projects will lead to a minimal relaxation of planning rules - because ministers do not want to anger potential Tory voters who oppose huge wind turbines in their neighbourhoods.

On Saturday night - as the Conservative party threatened to split over green policy - the former Tory environment secretary and outgoing chair of the climate change committee, Lord Deben, said it was simply unacceptable that the government was still discussing whether it was in favour of onshore wind or not when it was widely recognised as one of the cheapest forms of energy generation. The danger was also that UK industry would lose out in the resulting green industrial revolution for renewable energy to the US, China and the EU.

Deben, who is retiring this weekend after 11 years as chair of the committee that officially advises government, told the Observer: ""It is unacceptable to have spent so much time discussing something which should be immediate for government. Why we need to go through all this palaver [of consulting] I am not sure.

""In effect we have stopped onshore wind. Having a basic opposition to it is just not a sensible thing.""

On Friday, Sunak was rocked by the resignation from the government of Tory peer and green enthusiast Zac Goldsmith, who said the prime minister was ""simply uninterested"" in the environment and the climate emergency.

Goldsmith said in his resignation letter that the Tories would be punished by voters for the party's ""apathy in the face of the greatest challenge we have faced"" and said his position had become untenable because of Sunak's lack of commitment.

Sunak countered shortly afterwards in a letter suggesting Goldsmith's departure had in fact been linked to No 10 asking him to apologise for having undermined the House of Commons privileges committee's inquiry into Boris Johnson and Partygate.

The former prime minister Theresa May also broke ranks against Sunak on climate policy last week, saying the UK was falling behind other countries and had been too slow to act in response to subsidies for green industries introduced by the US and the EU.

Without a clear response the UK was ""putting at risk its reputation as a leader in climate policy"", May said.

Instead of taking a lead on climate matters, Sunak and his ministers are, critics say, crudely trying to create a ""wedge issue"" with Labour over net zero policy in a general election, including attacking the opposition for its decision to oppose new oil and gas exploration in the North Sea.

Two weeks ago energy secretary Grant Shapps accused Labour of becoming ""the political wing of Just Stop Oil - and other eco-extremists who use ordinary people's lives as their weapon"".

While such comments will have pleased green sceptics on the Tory benches, they also angered Conservatives who believe their party is sacrificing responsible green policy to address a global emergency for what it believes will be short-term political gain. They fear they will suffer in blue wall seats unless their party is seen to have a credible and serious approach to tackling the climate crisis.

At a meeting last week of RenewableUK, a not-for-profit trade association representing the green industry, the Tory MP and former energy minister Chris Skidmore, who wrote a widely acclaimed report for the government on net zero strategy, made clear he disagreed fundamentally with Shapps's attack on Labour.

""When it comes to the narrative of net zero, when it comes to the rhetoric we need to deploy, no one is in the pocket of Just Stop Oil. Nobody wants to see disruption on our streets. It simply is not an extreme opinion to believe that one day we are going to have to end our use of fossil fuels,"" Skidmore said.

Sam Hall, director of the Conservative Environment Network, which includes many dozens of Tory MPs, said it would be a mistake for the Conservatives to make oil and gas a dividing line, as if it did then oil and gas rather than green energy would become the main subject of debate. He added: ""The Conservatives should focus on their positive message around renewable energy ahead of the election, which has been one of their greatest achievements in government.""

James Robottom, head of onshore wind at RenewableUK, said there was now no expectation that ministers would make any significant changes to planning rules to allow more onshore wind projects in England as a result of its consultation.

He said his organisation was ""bitterly disappointed"" by the evident lack of movement that was clear from suggestions made in the process, and the fact that there had been no response from government to the industry's views over the past three months. The result would be the loss of huge numbers of jobs and billions of pounds of domestic and overseas investment.

Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary of state for net zero, said: ""Mainstream Conservatives are right to be alarmed by the climate failure and lurch towards a culture war on the part of Rishi Sunak and Grant Shapps.

""The Tory leadership is way out of line with the British people, who do not want to see the consensus for climate and environmental action broken.""

Robottom said obstacles to new onshore wind development would ""severely hinder investment in the onshore wind industry and its supply chain due to the high level of risk and uncertainty they create. We are being denied the opportunity for thousands of new jobs and billions in private investment in England.""

He added: ""Even if a few new projects will be able to get planning permission, it will be extremely difficult for them to source wind turbines, with markets in Germany, Scotland and elsewhere being far more attractive, and crucially with clear government backing and deployment targets.""

The Department for Levelling Up said it had no statement to make on the planning rules consultation other than that it was ongoing and that it would take time to consider responses.

No 10 promised last year to dismantle the effective ban on onshore windfarms in England, which was put in place in 2015 by tightening planning restrictions in the national planning policy framework. However, after pressure from rightwing Tory MPs, the most that is now expected are modest changes that will do little to boost the number of English windfarms.

The former prime minister David Cameron brought in the de facto onshore wind ban in 2015 after coming under pressure from more than 100 Tory MPs. As a result just 16 new turbines were granted planning permission in England between 2016 and 2020 - a 96% drop on the previous five years.

Recently the Guardian revealed that Ukraine had built more onshore wind turbines than England since it was occupied by Russian soldiers.

Only two onshore wind turbines have been installed in England since February last year, generating 1 megawatt (MW) of electricity in the Staffordshire village of Keele.

Ukraine's Tyligulska wind power plant, meanwhile - the first to be built in a conflict zone - has begun generating enough clean electricity to power about 200,000 homes just 60 miles from the frontline in the southern region of Mykolaiv, with 19 turbines providing an installed capacity of 114MW.

In-depth

As part of our Ten years of Guardian Australia series, investigative reporter Anne Davies spills all about Angus Taylor and the doctored document mystery. The then federal energy minister wrote to Sydney lord mayor Clover Moore in 2019, accusing her of driving up emissions by spending $15m on travel in a year. But it all quickly unravelled when questions were raised about the legitimacy of the document at the heart of his claims.

Not the news

The Clearing, a new eight-part series on Disney+, is based on the true story of a cult that operated in the shadows of regional Victoria from the 60s to the 80s. Members joined for the promise of spiritual fulfilment but were made to take dangerous amounts of LSD and had every aspect of their lives controlled. Actor Guy Pearce and co-director Jeffrey Walker speak about the chilling inspiration behind the series - and protecting the show's young actors from traumatic moments.

750,"A food revolution: campaigners in LiÃ¨ge want all the region's produce to be grown locally. Can they do it?","https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jul/16/the-good-life-in-liege-the-start-of-a-food-revolution","A food revolution: campaigners in LiÃ¨ge want all the region's produce to be grown locally. Can they do it?

In the Belgian city, a group of tireless activists have one life-changing aim: to ensure most of their food is local and organic. What can we learn?

This is not a Hollywood story: it's a Belgian story, for a start. It's not even certain to end well; that's a bit up in the air right now. But it's a story about how things - important things - could be different. How they could, perhaps, be better. It's a story about LiÃ¨ge, a city whose 19th-century heyday as a coal and steel powerhouse is long gone. Like many ex-coal and steel towns, LiÃ¨ge is poor, with increasing numbers of households living in poverty, but it also has a strong solidarity culture, a diverse population - and the best waffles.

So far, so Belgian. But why are we talking about LiÃ¨ge? Because in 2013, a group of activists who wanted to make food and city life better, greener and fairer, brought 600 people - all with an interest in food production - together. It asked them to imagine what could be different in LiÃ¨ge, within one generation. It's an interesting question, the fundamental one really: what change can we concretely effect within our lifetimes? What they arrived at was this: ""That in 35 years, one generation, the majority of food consumed in the LiÃ¨ge region would be grown locally in the best ecological and social conditions."" That's a nice, if wordy, aspiration. But the thing is, they've tried to make it happen and even - to a degree - have succeeded.

That moment spawned a movement that is now coordinated by a non-profit called the LiÃ¨ge Food Belt: six employees, funded by a hand-to-mouth combination of local, regional and European money.

""People say it's a revolution,"" says Christian Jonet. ""It's not a revolution yet, but it has the potential: we're at the start of the story."" Along with his colleague, Elisabeth Gruie, this energetic, but exhausted-looking man is generously squeezing my visit into his packed calendar. Gruie used to be a banker and Jonet's story is similarly unexpected: he spent eight years selling aeroplane engine repairs, gradually, he says, becoming aware ""that I was taking part in the problem, not the solution"". Increasingly conscious of the challenges presented by the climate crisis, he started to get involved in sustainability initiatives as a volunteer, rapidly realising food was one of the crucial challenges for the new millennium. Today he's the coordinator for the Food Belt.

Under the Food Belt umbrella, there are 28 food co-ops and about 300 individual producers. Those co-ops include retailers, a brewery, bakeries and a vineyard. The shops are supplied by a range of hyper-local producers.

There's the weekly Court-Circuit market in the city centre, which sells the network's produce. The Food Belt also holds a 10-day annual food festival, Nourrir LiÃ¨ge, which has spawned emulators in Brussels, Strasbourg and soon QuÃ©bec. There's a newly opened House of Sustainable Food that tries to touch the parts of the population that sustainable, organic food initiatives often miss, with cookery classes, nature walks and communal meals.

But the most impressive part might be the schools. The Food Belt worked for several years with schools and crÃ¨ches to help source food sustainably. Since 2021, about 100 schools are now under a new regime: meat, bread, dairy and fruit are organic, local and, as far as possible, from within the Food Belt network. The city is aiming for 100% organic and local by 2024.

Then there's the breaktime soup initiative. Thanks to the Food Belt, 5,000 pupils in local schools in vulnerable socioeconomic areas have been getting free, organic, locally produced soup for a morning snack. That's already a dramatic social good, but the soup is also made by a small non-profit, Echafaudage, that assists the long-term unemployed back into work, then it's delivered by the Food Belt co-op Rayon9 using cargo bikes. It's been so successful that the region, which financed the project, has increased its budget fivefold.

It all sounds idyllic, extraordinary, a revolution. Rob Hopkins, sustainability pioneer and co-founder of the Transition Network, agrees: ""It's pretty unique really. It's by far the most ambitious project like it. They've pulled it together with a brilliant can-do spirit.""

But what does that look and feel like on the ground? I went to find out and, over two days, I see what it takes to coordinate better ways of feeding a city: networking, sharing ideas, communicating, lobbying, meetings - lots of meetings. Jonet and Gruie show me around.

We start in the ordinary-looking suburb of Sainte-Walburge where, in the mud and mist, David Wagemans, a bearded guy in combats and a fleece, is boxing up the last tomatoes for the food co-op shop to collect. This is Les Pousses Poussent, the market garden run on land gifted by the city.

Wagemans used to be a chef; he and partner FÃ©licie took over the plot in 2019. ""We enclosed it, put it to green fertiliser, dug it, put greenhouses in, a fruit hedge, and then we started in April 2020,"" he tells me, as I admire the chard and the beans. ""We've doubled the surface area. We started with 75 pickers; now we've got more than 135."" It's an inviting place that lures passersby in. As we chat, a couple come and ask how to sign up (there's a waiting list); another man wanders over to offer Wagemans his excess white raspberry plants.

There are four staff now, they added bees this year and diversified planting. The plan is, if they can, to take over a neighbouring field, also owned by the city, sign up more pickers, maybe get a ploughing horse and train people to use it. ""Little by little, we're trying to go further."" For now, though, Wagemans looks cold - it's raining - so I ask him quickly how things are going. ""Profitability isn't wild,"" he says. ""The problem is time and money."" But he's happy. ""I wouldn't go back for anything in the world.""

Those tomatoes are heading for Les Petits Producteurs shops. In the Sainte-Walburge branch FrÃ©dÃ©ric - a proud resident of this area with ""many different cultures"" - shows me around. ""It's not too expensive and it's accessible to as many as possible."" It's also no-frills, the focus is on fresh, local, organic fruit and vegetables, with photos of the producers and an explanation of what they do and where. Beyond the fresh stuff, there are loose grains and flours in crates, and a small range of products on simple shelves. Shop policy is, FrÃ©dÃ©ric explains, ""one need, one product. There's only one kind of mayonnaise - we could have had 10, but it's simpler and it reduces costs.""

It's a far cry from Whole Foods, but that's the point: this is a co-op and their business model is based on a fair deal for producers. Producers set the price - no haggling - and the shops commit to take a certain quantity annually, in advance. There's total transparency: 70% of the sale price goes to the producers. Talking to shoppers is a big part of the job: persuading, explaining, describing who grew what, or how to prepare celeriac. ""It's a place where you can meet people; where people take their time.""

Pascal Hennen, the mastermind behind Les Petits Producteurs (""but I'm an employee, just like the others"") arrives on his bike. I ask him how this whole thing started. ""I became conscious that supermarkets and mass distribution are really harmful both on a human level and for the farming sector. I tried being a grower, but I wasn't made for farming, pulling leeks in wet snow. I always had cold hands."" He didn't like the ethics of the large-scale organic shop where he worked either: ""I tried to influence them, but it didn't work."" Les Petits Producteurs launched in 2017 - now there are four shops, with 25 employees.

Spared the logistical issues that dogged supermarket distribution, Les Petits Producteurs became a lifeline for locals during Covid. ""Sometimes we were the only person a customer saw in a day,"" says FrÃ©dÃ©ric. Now, though, pandemic shoppers have gone back to their ""bad habits"" and the cost-of-living crisis has started to bite in earnest. An ebbing customer base, hard on the heels of excess demand during the pandemic, is creating chaos with that guaranteed volume policy. ""I don't know whether madame will buy potatoes,"" Hennen says, gesturing at a browsing customer. ""But I have to ""˜know' a year in advance."" That's much harder now. When there's too much of something, the shop adds an ""SOS"" label to encourage customers to buy or offers recipe cards; they're contemplating launching all-in meal packages. Still, times are tough. ""We have customers who tell us, I'm going to have to choose between eating and heating: what should I do?"" FrÃ©dÃ©ric says. ""We're a bit trapped by economic realities.""

There's a more celebratory atmosphere the next day at the ""EU organic shop of the year"", La Ferme Ã L'Arbre. In the orchards, cows and chickens are cohabiting peaceably and inside the vast shop is buzzing following the recently awarded prize. While I'm talking to owner-manager Michel PÃ¢que, he is regularly interrupted by customer congratulations. The ceremony in the EU's Berlaymont building was a far cry from his daily routine. ""You have to send your ID card, they send you a QR code, then it's like an airport, you have to take everything off! It's huge, a labyrinth, you end up in this room with microphones and interpreters""¦ It was a beautiful experience, though.""

You can see why they won: this is a hell of a place. There are 40 employees, the vast majority of vegetables are produced on site (they grow 60 varieties), they butcher their own organic beef and pork, those happy hens outside produce the eggs and there's a cheese counter, deli, bakery and even a restaurant. It's also the oldest organic farm in the region, founded by PÃ¢que's father in 1978. The permacrisis is taking its toll here, too, but PÃ¢que is sanguine. ""We tell ourselves what we produce is fair and real and local - in principle, that should last.""

La Ferme was threatened with compulsory purchase because a nearby prison needed a new site, but the LiÃ¨ge network sprung into action, lobbying local government, which in turn lobbied the region. Shop and farm are now safe. It is also the birthplace of another Food Belt success story: the LiÃ¨ge Co-operative Brewery. The hops are still grown at La Ferme, but the brewery has a new home, a few minutes' drive away. When we pop in, Stany Herman is tidying up as the fermenter gurgles. He's one of a team of six behind the range of four Badjawe beers, LiÃ¨ge dialect for ""chatty"". Herman, a former web designer who ""tripped"" into brewing, is certainly chatty, explaining that the classic blonde is ""more treacherous"" (6.5%) than the festive (at 4.5%, a ""good drinking beer""). All their ingredients are ""hyperlocal"" - their furthest supplier is 32km away - as is their distribution network. Business is decent - the co-op has 500 members - but here, too, the cost-of-living and energy crises are taking their toll. ""Honestly, it's worse than during Covid. Maybe because tiredness is setting in, but you have to adapt all the time, it's complicated.""

A food revolution is complicated, and it's slow. There are setbacks and compromises, but gradually a painstaking knitting together of tiny links to build an alternative system, working out what's missing and somehow supplying it, can drive change. Hopkins agrees: ""It's really understated. They're just quietly building these relationships and connections."" Currently, LiÃ¨ge has lots of ""small things that offer a real alternative"", as Jonet says. That could lead to big things. But can they scale up? And how, especially right now, when the cost-of-living crisis is squeezing the whole network?

We talk about this a lot, Jonet, Gruie and I, in the car. We talk, too, at the Food Belt office in the brand-new ""logistics hub"". It's an impressive spot, where the Food Belt team works and trains entrepreneurs with sustainable food ideas. The plan is for a second building next door to create another of the ""missing links"" in their network: a plant to wash, store, prepare and possibly bottle the network's produce. That would help secure supply over leaner months and ensure school canteens can also get their veg through the network.

The hub is important because it demonstrates what happens when you can get public authorities involved, a key strategy for scaling up this experiment. They were initially reactive, not proactive. Now, though, the city and region are a potentially powerful catalyst for change (current anxieties around food security and food sovereignty have doubtless helped). Certainly, without them the school projects would not have happened, or the hub, and funding the Food Belt's continued existence has become easier with official support. That increased public sector buy-in gives Jonet hope for the future: ""Those alliances between co-operatives, citizens and public authorities will help us get through this difficult stage. But there's still a lot of uncertainty.""

I have only seen a fraction of the network - to see it all would take days, weeks even (the Vin de LiÃ¨ge vineyard co-op raising â‚¬2m would make a business school case study all by itself). But the picture is clear - these are vocations not jobs, and they're hard work, undertaken with conviction and considerable joy, but in 2023, they are harder than ever. For now, Jonet has another meeting. ""I do a lot of networking,"" he says, with characteristic understatement. ""We know everyone in the ecosystem. Our job is to connect people, to transmit good ideas; sometimes just talking about an idea in the network can mean someone else takes hold of it and it happens.""

It's been nearly 10 years since the ""big bang"" as Jonet calls that ambitious, if rather drily worded, statement of intent. Where are they now? ""We're always being asked, ""˜So, are you on the right path?'"" he says. ""And the answer is ""˜no'. I reckon we're at about 5%."" That's no Hollywood ending, but I warned you it wouldn't be: this is real life, this is 2023, this is LiÃ¨ge. ""It feels like this is a make-or-break moment,"" Jonet adds later. I really hope they make it. I think they will: a structure you build slowly and carefully, with love and conviction, has a good chance of surviving a storm, surely. But even if they don't, they've shown us what's possible.

758,"Scientists pour cold water on UK aviation's net zero ambitions","https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/28/scientists-uk-aviation-net-zero-ambitions-half-farmland-double-renewable-electricity","Scientists pour cold water on UK aviation's net zero ambitions

Country would need to devote half its farmland or more than double its renewable electricity supply, says study

The UK would have to devote half its farmland or more than double its total renewable electricity supply to make enough aviation fuel to meet its ambitions for ""jet zero"", or net zero flying, scientists have said.

A report published on Tuesday by the Royal Society argues there is no single, clear, sustainable alternative to jet fuel that could support the current level of flying.

The scientists say that while the government and aviation industry have set a target of 2050 to balance out emissions, huge challenges remain around the availability, costs and impacts of alternative fuels, as well as the need for new types of planes and airport infrastructure around the world to allow the most probable long-term solutions.

Significant further research and investment would be needed, the scientists say, to address questions across four fuel types - green hydrogen (made from water using renewable energy), biofuels (energy crops and waste), ammonia and synthetic fuels or e-fuels.

Producing enough biofuels would require about half of UK agricultural land, while other feedstocks such as municipal waste could only contribute ""a very small fraction"" of the jet fuel requirements, they report.

Making sufficient green hydrogen or ammonia to power future planes would require well over double today's entire UK renewable electricity generation capacity. E-fuels or synthetic fuels - which are made by capturing and converting carbon dioxide from the air - would require five to eight times today's UK capacity.

The Royal Society said the findings underscored the challenges of decarbonising aviation, and much work remained to be done in how such fuels were stored and handled - as well as their actual environmental impacts in production and when used in flight.

Aviation's CO2 accounted for 2.4% of global emissions in 2019. UK aviation (both international and domestic) caused 8% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions.

Graham Hutchings, the regius professor of chemistry at Cardiff University and chair of the report working group, said: ""We need to be very clear about the strengths, limitations, and challenges that must be addressed and overcome if we are to scale up the required new technologies in a few short decades.""

The report said more research was needed to understand how alternative fuels would impact contrails, which contributes significantly to aviation's heating effect.

Sustainability would depend on how fuel alternatives were produced, said Prof Marcelle McManus, a director of the Institute for Sustainability at University of Bath. ""We need consistency, and we need to apply this globally, because adopting any of these new technologies will create demands and pressures for land, renewable energy or other products that may have knock on environmental or economic effects.""

While airlines are looking to sustainable fuels to reduce CO2 emissions by 70-80%, McManus said that for a number of different fuels types labelled as sustainable that was ""definitely not the case"" that would result from a switch.

Dr Guy Gratton, the associate professor of aviation and the environment at Cranfield University, said: ""The term SAF [sustainable aviation fuel] is quite nebulous ""¦ they don't all have the same environmental footprint.""

after newsletter promotion

The government has said it will mandate airlines to use SAFs for at least 10% of their fuel needs by 2030. Gratton said that while that target could be met, what the overall environmental benefits were would be ""a more complex question"".

He said creating new fleets of radically different planes to run on hydrogen airliners would be hugely expensive but achievable, adding: ""It does seem reasonable to say if we do get the investment in research and infrastructure we could get close to a massive reduction in emissions by the 2050 target.""

A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""The UK's sustainable aviation fuels programme is one of the most comprehensive in the world.

""Our Jet Zero strategy sets out how we can achieve net zero emissions from UK aviation by 2050, without directly limiting demand for aviation. Sustainable aviation fuels and hydrogen are key elements of this, and we will ensure that there is no impact on food crops.""

A spokesperson for the industry body Airlines UK said the sector was committed to achieving net zero by 2050. They said: ""There is no magic bullet, but by modernising airspace to make flying more efficient, by introducing new zero emission technology like hydrogen aircraft and by upscaling the use of sustainable aviation fuels this decade, it can be achieved.""

The spokesperson said the sector was working closely with government to ""maximise both the environmental and huge economic opportunities from leading the jet zero transition"".

A Virgin Atlantic Boeing 787 will fly from London to New York later this year powered entirely by fuel made primarily from waste oils and fats, in what is being billed as the first ever net zero transatlantic flight.

759,"The Tories have created a new poverty - one so deep and vicious it requires Victorian vocabulary","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/24/tories-poverty-destitute-history-politics","The Tories have created a new poverty - one so deep and vicious it requires Victorian vocabulary

""˜Destitute' means a living standard so sparse, it should be consigned to history. It now applies to 4 million in the UK

It starts slowly at first. A food bank crops up inside your local mosque. You notice more sleeping bags on the walk to work. Over time, the signs seem to grow. A donation bin appears in Tesco for families who can't afford soap or toothpaste. Terms such as ""bed poverty"" emerge in the news because we now need vocabulary to describe children who are so poor that they have to sleep on the floor.

Then one day you read a statistic that somehow feels both shocking and wearily unsurprising: about 3.8 million people experienced destitution in the UK last year. That's the equivalent of almost half the population of London being unable to meet their most basic needs to stay warm, dry, clean and fed.

The research - released on Tuesday by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) - lays out starkly not simply the scale of destitution in this country, but how potently it has spread. The number of people experiencing destitution in the UK has more than doubled in the last five years - up from 1.55 million in 2017. One million children are now living in destitute homes - a staggering increase of 186% in half a decade. The research, part of a project that has been monitoring the scale of destitution since 2015, found almost two-thirds of adults who are in severe poverty have a disability or long-term health condition; cancer patients going to chemotherapy and coming home to wear a coat in their freezing homes.

""Destitute"" is a term that conjures up the Victorian era - a living standard so sparse, so removed from modern civilisation, that by all rights it should be consigned to the history books. You only have to read through the aching interviews in the JRF study to see what destitution in modern Britain looks like: children wearing their parents' clothes because that's all there is in the wardrobe; eating a banana as a single daytime meal; taking the one permitted toilet roll a week from the local church donation. Gone are the workhouses. Nowadays, we send the poor to sift through charity bins.

It would be natural to call this a social emergency, but that would suggest a sense of urgency that our political class has rarely demonstrated. Poverty has long been the background noise in Westminster while ""real issues"" such as small boats and woke elites define the national conversation. Rishi Sunak is reportedly now lining up a tax cut for the wealthiest earners and inheritors, to win back upper-middle-class voters. Meanwhile, food banks have become such an established fixture in Britain that they have been left to breed ever more horrifying iterations like ""warm banks"" and ""baby banks"" with barely a whisper. Almost every library in England, Wales and Northern Ireland plans to provide a free warm space for people who can't afford the heating this winter, while there are thought to be 200 hubs nationwide distributing donations for deprived infants. New mothers queuing up in a community hall for donated nappies is ""the new normal"" and it has been normal for a while.

Over the last decade, billionaire-backed press and wealthy ministers have worked to propagate the myth that this deprivation has nothing to do with Conservative policies, blaming structural inequality on the working class's apparent idleness and overspending. Or, as Andrew Cooper, the Tory candidate in last week's Tamworth byelection, put it: jobless parents who are struggling to feed their children while paying for a phone should ""fuck off"".

In reality, a decade of austerity and squeezed wages and benefits has ripped the social fabric, making large swathes of the population poorer, sicker and more insecure. At the same time, multiple crises - Brexit, the pandemic, soaring inflation - have exposed the gaping holes in the safety net once intended to catch us.

It is telling that nearly three-quarters of destitute households actually receive support from the benefits system, according to the JRF study. Or to put it another way: after a decade of benefits freezes, cuts and sanctions, social security rates are now so meagre that many of those who are ""lucky"" enough to qualify often still can't afford to eat, wash or pay the rent. It is not as if this is an accident. Keeping benefits as low as possible has always been deliberate, a so-called legitimate means for ministers to divide the undeserving sick and poor from ""hardworking families"". In this context, severe poverty is less a problem to fix than an accepted part of the status quo. It is destitution by design, where governments know which public policy will push the already struggling into dire conditions, and they implement it anyway.

If that sounds bleak, there is hope in it, too: when poverty is a political choice, politicians can choose to lift people out of hardship instead. As a society, we can take steps to invest in the poorest lives. We can increase social security rates to reflect the real cost of living and scrap sanctions on the unemployed and sick; we can tackle debt by, for example, reducing the amount of money the government can take from people's benefits for repayments; we can introduce a real living wage to end poverty wages; we can build more social housing to free tenants from extortionate private rents.

Providing this economic security would improve not simply people's material conditions, but their physical and mental wellbeing, too. After all, destitution isn't simply about skipping meals. It is a psychological assault: lying awake at night anxious about the bailiffs knocking, or counting the slices of bread in the cupboard, wondering which day your children won't get breakfast this week. Protecting people from destitution won't just give them more cash in their pocket - it can give them part of themselves back.

Established wisdom says now is not the time for any of this, that a struggling economy means we cannot afford to do better. I would suggest we cannot afford not to. When Keir Starmer recently ruled out scrapping the two-child benefit limit (a move that would lift about 270,000 households with children out of poverty) he cited the need for ""tough decisions"" in order to be fiscally responsible. And yet true responsibility - fiscal as well as moral - comes from tackling the vast cost of social and economic hardship. In many ways, this is a matter of simple maths: child poverty alone is estimated to be now costing the economy £39bn a year due to the extra strain on public services and future unemployment. In the long run, doing the right thing is reassuringly cost-effective.

But it is also surely about a collective lowering of expectations: the nagging fatigue that says that, in one of the richest nations on Earth, millions of people going without the basics for sustaining life is ""just the way it is"". Infants sleep on the floor. Mothers eat a piece of fruit for lunch. It starts slowly, yes, but we should all fear where it ends.

Researchers identify 88 nests of destructive invasive non-native species near Syracuse in Sicily

An invasive non-native ant species has become established in Italy and could rapidly spread through Europe to the UK with global heating, a study warns.

The red fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, has a powerful sting, damages crops and can infest electrical equipment including cars and computers.

The ant, considered one of the most destructive invasive species, can rapidly form ""super colonies"" with multiple queens. The colonies prey on invertebrates, larger vertebrates and plants, destroying native plants and out-competing native ants, insects and herbivores for food.

The red fire ant is the fifth most costly invasive species in the world, spreading via human trade from its native South America into Mexico, the Caribbean, Australia and the US, where it causes an estimated damage of $6bn (£4.8bn) each year.

Researchers have identified 88 red fire ant nests across 5 hectares (12 acres) near the city of Syracuse, in Sicily, Italy. According to genetic analyses in a study published in Current Biology, the invasive colonies could have come from China or the US.

Roger Vila, the principal investigator at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology's Butterfly Diversity and Evolution Lab, who led the study, said: ""Coordinated efforts for early detection and rapid response in the region are essential to successfully manage this new threat, before it spreads uncontrollably.""

The charity Buglife said invasive ant species were easily spread when plants in soil are imported into Britain and called on the government to ban the import of soil.

The EU has banned the export of soil from the UK but the UK has not taken reciprocal measures to stop imports , mostly via the horticultural trade.

David Smith, of Buglife, said: ""It's an open door for non-native species that are soil-dwellers. There's widespread concern about these non-native invasive ant species of which this is one of a handful which are on the cusp of making it into Europe.

""We can do something to stop these arriving but once an invasive ant species is here it's going to be very hard to eradicate. Ants are notorious for being able to spread quickly.""

In Europe, the ant has previously been found in imported products in Spain, Finland and the Netherlands but its establishment in the wild on the continent has never before been confirmed.

While the EU has updated its ""species of concern"" list to include the red fire ant, the British government has not updated its list since Brexit despite calls from experts concerned about new invasive species.

Smith added: ""We're getting increasingly frustrated at government delays over biosecurity measures.""

Australia is spending A$400m (£205m) on the ant's eradication but its government has been criticised for failing to act decisively enough to remove the species. New Zealand is the only country to have successfully eradicated the red fire ant after it appeared the country in 2001.

The red fire ant is a heat-loving species but the researchers concluded that it could establish itself in approximately 7% of Europe.

In today's climate, half of the urban areas in Europe would be climatically suitable for it, including large cities such as London, Paris, Rome and Barcelona. With global heating, the continent will become much more suitable for the species and help its spread across Europe.

Mediterranean coastal cities are the most suitable to the ant, and their seaports could facilitate its spread.

Mattia Menchetti, the lead author of the study, said: ""The public could play a key role in the detection of S invicta, considering that it is frequently found in urban and adjacent areas. It is possible to detect this ant due to its painful stings and the characteristic mounds of their nests, although confirmation of an expert is required.""

The Sicilian colonies are located in an estuary and natural park in the suburbs of Syracuse. Researchers believe wind-assisted flying queen ants arrived there from the port of Syracuse to the north-west. The team has recommended further monitoring of the port.

""˜It's not just the lions that are under pressure, it's biodiversity in general,' warn conservationists, amid a rapidly expanding human population

Standing in a patch of damp forest, a clump of moss in one hand, Siraj Hussein applies the last touches to a camera trap. He explains why his chosen tree is in an ideal spot: it is in a clearing, which gives the sensors a good view, and lion droppings have been found nearby. ""So far, I haven't captured a lion on my camera, but I'm optimistic,"" he says.

Siraj is gathering data on the behaviour of the lions in the Kafa biosphere reserve, in south-west Ethiopia - one of the country's last few tracts of natural forest - as part of a new project by the Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union (Nabu), a German environmental group.

Researchers believe there are about 25 lions in this area, but little is known about them. It is not clear if they are resident year-round or just migrate through. One thing, however, is certain: their numbers are declining. ""Twenty years ago, you would always see lions lying in the road,"" says Asaye Alemayehu, who runs the Nabu project. ""Now that is almost unheard of.""

Ethiopia's lions are known for their distinctive black manes. They occupy a prominent position in national culture: their image adorns the currency, while Haile Selassie, Ethiopia's last emperor, called himself the ""lion of Judah"".

However, like Ethiopia's other wildlife, they have been pushed to the brink by decades of neglect and habitat destruction, much of it driven by a rapidly expanding human population - the second biggest in Africa (after Nigeria) at more than 120 million. Forest once covered 40% of Ethiopia. Today it covers only about 15%, according to the World Bank.

""It's not just the lions that are under pressure, it's biodiversity in general,"" says Asaye.

There are about 1,100 lions clinging on in Ethiopia's last remaining pockets of wilderness, according to a study published in 2021. They often encounter farmers, whose livestock they prey on. Human-wildlife conflict is the main factor driving their decline, says Hans Bauer, a zoologist at the University of Oxford and a co-author of the study.

Conservation is hamstrung by a lack of funding. Ethiopia was among the first countries in Africa to establish national parks, but most are in a poor state, without good roads or other infrastructure. Lacking the vehicles and fuel needed for regular patrols, government-employed rangers struggle to prevent well armed herders from grazing their cattle in protected areas.

Bauer contrasts the precarious existence of Ethiopia's lions to that of the thriving population in neighbouring Kenya, where lions play a starring role in the lucrative wildlife tourism sector and where numbers grew from about 2,000 lions in 2010 to nearly 2,500 in 2021. Recognising their economic value, Kenya has invested heavily in its national parks.

In Kenya, ""lions have space, they are protected and live in high densities with ecological potential"", says Bauer. ""That doesn't exist in Ethiopia - there are humans everywhere and there are no habitats that are fully protected or where prey is present at high levels.""

The Kafa biosphere is better managed than most of Ethiopia's national parks, largely thanks to backing from Nabu, which runs reforestation and other schemes. But even here, the natural habitat is under threat. Farms rub up against protected areas of forest and in recent years large tracts have been cleared to make way for commercial tea and coffee plantations.

On a hillside in Kafa, a group of farmers complain that lions regularly take their livestock. Each cow can cost a year's salary, but the government does not compensate them. One man shows scars on his back from a lion attack several years ago. Another recalls how a lion once broke down the door of his hut and grabbed a goat while he was sleeping inside.

Many farmers want the lions to be relocated away from their farms. ""If there were no lions, it would be better,"" says Busho Woldesaki, who has lost three cattle to lion attacks in the past two years. ""Our animals can't graze freely because we fear the lions.""

It is rare for people to kill lions in Kafa, where they are respected. In other parts of Ethiopia, however, herders often hunt lions down in retaliation for livestock attacks.

Fikirte Gebresenbet, a lion expert at the University of New Hampshire, highlights the need for more research before attacks such as these can be curbed. ""Lions are under serious threat, but we don't really have data on their distribution, and if you don't have that baseline data, you can't do any conservation work. We have to determine where we have viable populations, otherwise you are just throwing resources down the drain ""¦ In Kenya there are a lot of ecologists studying lions. They know them by name, by their whiskers. That's the level of detail they are working with. In Ethiopia, we don't have that.""

For now, Nabu's project in Kafa is focused on building a clearer picture of the local lions. Siraj and other rangers gather information on lion sightings from farmers, but these days he sets up his camera traps in secret - he only has one left after two were stolen.

Despite talk from the government of developing tourism, Kenyan-style wildlife conservation ""is not a serious option"" in Ethiopia, says Bauer. ""The pressures on the land are too high."" But other steps could be taken to minimise conflict with humans, such as restocking prey populations and providing compensation.

""There's a whole toolbox of activities to draw upon, but first we need more research,"" says Bauer.

Budget constraints mean the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority (EWCA) prioritises endemic species such as the Ethiopian wolf and the walia ibex, says Fekede Regassa, its head of research. If these species were lost, it would mean extinction, whereas lions would persist elsewhere.

Fekede says more funding would make protecting Ethiopia's lions possible, but ""if things continue as they are, with deforestation and other human factors, we will lose the lions. No question.""

Summary

Cop28 is getting back up to speed after its enforced - but much needed - rest day yesterday, with attention focusing on debate about whether to agree to phase out or phase down fossil fuels.

So far today we have had:

Christiana Figueres, the UN's climate chief when the landmark Paris agreement was reached in 2015, come out unequivocally behind a phase out of fossil fuels. ""If we want a step forward in this Cop, then we cannot compromise on phase out. It sends a political signal that has ramifications for companies that need to decide where they're going to put their [investment].""

Research from the Food and Agricultural Organisation that reveals the huge impact of livestock emissions on the climate. It found that livestock agrifood systems - which include cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, pigs and chickens - are responsible for 6.2 gigatonnesof carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, approximately 12% of all emissions in 2015.

One hundred global Native groups and allies have published an open letter calling for Cop28 negotiators to protect of Indigenous rights during the clean energy transition.

More than 250 organisations from across the world have released a letter calling on the US to abandon its support for liquefied natural gas ,which is due to grow massively in the next few years.

Australia's climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has pledged of AUS$150m (US$100m) in climate finance, mainly targeted at Pacific countries

Azerbaijan appears to be emerging as a favourite to hold next year's Cop

I am now going to hand over to my colleague Helena Horton (helena.horton@theguardian.com), who will be seeing the blog through to the end of the day.

Research published on Friday by the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) at Cop28 reveals the huge impact of livestock emissions on the climate. Livestock produce methane, a greenhouse gas 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide, so are a key contributor to the climate crisis.

The FAO found that livestock agrifood systems - which include cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, pigs and chickens - are responsible for 6.2 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) emissions.

This accounts for approximately 12% of all emissions in 2015, the baseline year chosen for the study.

It also found:

Of all the six animal species considered, cattle contribute to more than 60% of global livestock emissions.

Of the edible animal products - meat, milk and eggs - two-thirds of the emissions are linked to meat production across all species.

A further one-third of emissions comes from the production, processing and transport of feed inputs.

By 2050, demand for animal products is likely to grow by a fifth from 2020 levels

Without intervention, this upward trend could result in increased emissions from livestock systems, potentially undermining efforts to reduce GHG emissions and exacerbating global temperature rises.

The FAO concludes that more sustainable practices are needed, including breeding livestock for lower emissions and changing their feed, as well as changing human diets.

The report included some data that will trouble campaigners. Cattle in sub-Saharan Africa produce relatively far more emissions than North American cattle, according to the study, although most conservationists would regard subsistence herding as more acceptable environmentally than the mega farms of the US midwest.

The report notes that the absolute emissions of US intensive livestock farming are far greater than those of African herds, but said there was scope for interventions in Africa that would reduce emissions.

Campaigners will not want to see the US given a clean sheet and subsistence farmers taking the blame - that would be the wrong conclusion to draw from their data.

FAO will also present, separately, on Sunday a road map for the world food systems for staying within 1.5C .

Ivo Vlaev, a professor of behavioural science at Warwick Business School at the University of Warwick, said: ""Shifting public dietary habits, especially in affluent countries where meat consumption is high, is a complex challenge. People's food choices are deeply ingrained and influenced by cultural, social, and personal factors.

""Interventions to change these behaviours must account for these influences, potentially employing strategies like social norming (highlighting the growing popularity of plant-based diets), framing (emphasising the personal health benefits of reduced meat consumption), and facilitating ease of access to alternative protein sources.""

As mentioned earlier, today's focus at Cop is officially on youth and children and there have been several protests calling for more progress on adaptation and financial to support poorer countries on the frontline of the climate crisis.

Mystery of Sultan Al Jaber's ""˜identical' words

In Monday's combative press conference, in which the Cop28 president, Sultan Al Jaber, responded to the Guardian revelation that he had said there was ""no science out there that says that the phase-out of fossil fuel is what's going to achieve 1.5C"", a journalist raised the issue of a powerful, and apparently contradictory, statement made by the UN secretary general, AntÃ³nio Guterres, a few days before.

""The secretary general has said just, here a few days ago, don't even talk abated,"" the reporter from Associated Press said. Guterres had said: ""The science is clear: The 1.5C limit is only possible if we ultimately stop burning all fossil fuels. Not reduce, not abate. Phase out, with a clear timeframe.""

Al Jaber responded: ""I'm glad you mentioned what [secretary general'] said. He's right. But guess what? I said it a day before he did - it wasn't picked up, not even mentioned.""

Al Jaber said he had confronted the oil and gas industry, brought them around the table and got them to sign up to commitments, apparently referring to the oil and gas decarbonisation charter announced at Cop28.

""Actually, let me just be simple. I said the same thing. I was identical. Same thing, no pick up whatsoever. The [secretary general] gets maximum coverage,"" he said.

Immediately after the press conference, the Guardian asked the Cop28 press office what the ""identical"" comments were and when Al Jaber had made them. Despite repeating the request since, no answer has been received.

With calls for a phase out instead of a phase down of fossil fuels shaping up to be the critical fight in the second week of Cop28, Christiana Figueres, the UN's climate chief when the landmark Paris agreement was reached in 2015, is unequivocally behind a phase-out.

""If we want a step forward in this Cop, then we cannot compromise on phase out,"" said Figueres, the founder of the Global Optimism group. ""It sends a political signal that has ramifications for companies that need to decide where they are going to put their [investment].""

She said including further language around phase-out would take into consideration other concerns. ""Language around equity is important, because industrialised countries can and should phase out much quicker than developing countries who are exporters [and] language around a just transition is critical."" Figueres said at a Guardian Live event on Wednesday.

Tessa Khan, a lawyer and founder of the Uplift campaign group in the UK, said: ""The signal that softer language - phase down - sends is suggesting a longer lifetime for fossil fuel demand and production.

""That's a dangerous signal to send national governments, to investors, to companies that are right now really at a crossroads in terms of whether or not they do invest in new fossil fuel supply, or how quickly they transition their economies away from fossil fuels.""

The vexed question of where Cop will be held next year may be a step closer to resolution.

As has been previously reported, it is eastern Europe's turn to host Cop29 but Russia has vetoed the 27 EU countries and, until recently, Armenia and Azerbaijan have been vetoing each other. That left only seven, mostly small states, as possible hosts under the UN consensus model. And organising a Cop is highly expensive.

The picture changed on Thursday night after the governments of Armenia and Azerbaijan, which have been at odds for decades, issued a joint statement saying they were taking steps to ""normalise"" their relationship. They included releasing captured soldiers and Armenia dropping its Cop bid and throwing its support behind Azerbaijan.

""The Republic of Armenia and the Republic of Azerbaijan do hope that the other countries within the eastern European group will also support Azerbaijan's bid to host,"" the statement said.

This is not guaranteed. Moldova has also put itself forward as a candidate, and Reuters reports that Serbia is considering a bid.

It remains possible that Bonn, the home of the UN climate secretariat, or a larger German city could become the default location if agreement is not reached.

Australia's climate change minister, Chris Bowen, does not have a say in the decision but has been watching from a distance, as the delay over next year has held up discussion of where Cop31 will be held in 2026. Australia had made a bid to co-host with Pacific countries.

Asked about the Azerbaijan-Armenia statement, Bowen said ""there does appear to have been a breakthrough"" on where Cop29 would be held and that was ""welcome"".

Asked if he was surprised, he said: ""Yeah, well, a little. But the fact that Azerbaijan and Armenia, through the purposes of a Cop ""¦ strike a reached agreement does give you some reminder that there's cause for a little bit of hope in the world.""

Mary Robinson has arrived at Cop28 just days after her exchange with the Cop28 president, Sultan Al Jaber, over the role of fossil fuels in limiting global heating to 1.5C caused controversy at the climate summit.

In a picture near the Blue Zone entrance, the former president of Ireland reiterated the need to phase out fossil fuels to meet the target.

""Countries must do more than offer superficial pledges. We need radical collaboration to ensure an ambitious response plan to the Global Stocktake. To protect the 1.5°C warming limit this requires a phase out of all fossil fuels,"" she said on X.

Earlier this week, Al Jaber was forced into a fierce defence of his views on climate science, after the Guardian revealed his comment that there was ""no science out there, or no scenario out there, that says that the phase-out of fossil fuel is what's going to achieve 1.5C"".

100 global Native groups call for negotiatiors to protect Indigenous rights during clean energy transition

One hundred global Native groups and allies published an open letter on Thursday calling for Cop28 negotiators to protect Indigenous rights during the clean energy transition.

The letter, signed by dozens of Indigenous-led organisations as well as environmental advocacy groups such as Earthjustice and anti-poverty groups including Oxfam, urged delegates to fight for policies that would require the consent of Indigenous communities before their ancestral lands could be mined.

""We have ancestral, cultural, and spiritual ties to our lands that not only require our participation in climate advocacy but also call us to commit to the proper stewardship practices of nature that are deeply rooted in our ways of life,"" it says.

Native people, the letter asserts, are among the global leaders in demanding the phase-out of fossil fuels, but without proper safeguards, that transition could put those communities at risk.

Clean energy products such as solar panels, wind turbines and batteries for energy storage and electric vehicles require far more minerals to produce than their fossil fuel-powered counterparts. A 2022 study found that 54% of deposits of minerals needed in the global energy transition - including lithium, copper, nickel, and others - are on or near the land of Indigenous people.

The letter demands that officials recognise the rights of Native communities to have input on decisions about mining projects on those lands, including by protecting the right to free, prior, and informed consent as outlined in previous UN agreements.

Oil, gas and mining companies have long exploited Indigenous people and land, the letter says, but at Cop28, officials have an opportunity to ""define a better and more inclusive world that serves all communities and all peoples"".

Cop28 president to give press conference about ministerial pairings as negotiations enter new stage

The Cop28 president Sultan Al Jaber will soon give a press conference here in Dubai about the ministerial pairings at Cop28, a sign that negotiations are entering an important new stage.

Every climate summit, an environment minister from the Global North and Global South are paired together to oversee talks on key subjects to help reach consensus for the final text.

This process beings when talks with government official have gone as far as they can and ministers need to begin making compromises to reach a final political agreement. The UAE presidency, led by Sultan Al Jaber, will then be responsible for bringing it all together.

At Cop28, language on phasing out fossil fuels is likely to be a key point of division, as will the text climate change adaption which is seen as a crucial issue in the developing world.

Interesting bit from COP28 presdiency:

""For the first time, the COP28 Presidency started the Ministerial Pair engagement early; and over the past six months they have worked closely with the Presidency and Parties.""

Separately, an informal group of ministers is also being consulted by the presidency on the role of fossil fuels in the final agreement which includes the Canadian environment minister. Others are understood to have been asked for input.

More from my colleague Patrick Greenfield on Canada's role over the coming days.

The Cop28 president, Sultan Al Jaber, has congratulated Canada on the country's plans to require its fossil fuel industry to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which have inspired a must-have fashion accessory at Cop28.

Earlier this week, the oil and gas chief was forced into a fierce defence of his views on climate science, after the Guardian revealed his comment that there was ""no science out there, or no scenario out there, that says that the phase-out of fossil fuel is what's going to achieve 1.5C"".

On Thursday, Al Jaber praised Canada's decision to force its fossil industry into cuts of between 35-38% below 2019 levels, starting in 2030, and said the decarbonisation of all heavy emitting industries was a top priority.

""[Thursday]'s news that Canada plans to cap pollution from the oil and gas industry is an important step on their decarbonisation journey, and I applaud Canada for their decision,"" Al Jaber said.

""Cop28 is focused on raising ambition and delivering practical action that will help reduce emissions by 43% by 2030, to keep 1.5C within reach. We have made the decarbonisation of all heavy-emitting industries a top priority and are engaging with countries and companies to triple renewables, double energy efficiency, reduce methane, and scale hydrogen.

""We continue to call on all oil and gas companies to sign onto the Cop28 oil and gas decarbonisation charter, which requires companies to end routine flaring and methane emissions by 2030 and align on a path to net zero at or before 2050. And we will continue to push for more.""

Canada's emission cap policy has also become a must-have fashion accessory in Dubai.

Nine countries sign declaration to turn North Sea into ""˜Europe's biggest green power plant'

Nine European countries have pledged to multiply the capacity of offshore wind farms in the North Sea by eight times current levels before 2050, turning it into what Belgium's energy minister called ""Europe's biggest green power plant"".

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, announced the plan with the prime ministers of Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland, Denmark and Luxembourg.

Norway's prime minister and Britain's energy security minister, Grant Shapps, also committed at the summit in Ostend, Belgium, on Monday to build more wind farms, develop ""energy islands"" - connected renewable generation sites at sea - and work on carbon capture projects.

""We are unlocking our offshore energy ambitions,"" the Belgian energy minister, Tinne van der Straeten, said. ""Coordination is absolutely essential. If each of the nine countries acts alone, we'll collectively fail. Planning is at the core of everything.""

Aiming to both curb reliance on Russian gas and radically reduce the use of CO2-emitting fossil fuels, the nine countries aim to boost their combined North Sea offshore wind capacity to 120GW by 2030 and 300GW by 2050.

All the leaders recognised the scale of the task, which will require massive investment. Macron also said it was also important that the infrastructure was produced in Europe and the jobs created were European jobs.

""We don't want to repeat the errors we've committed in the past, deploying equipment made on the other side of the world,"" he said. Scholz described the summit as ""very important"" and Von der Leyen said the North Sea would soon be ""the powerhouse of Europe"".

Several leaders also stressed the need to protect Europe's offshore wind farms and their interconnectors from sabotage and espionage following reports of Russian spy ships in the North Sea and last year's sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines.

The capacity targets represent a further doubling of goals announced at a similar four-country summit in Esbjerg, Denmark, in May 2022, three months after European energy markets were plunged into turmoil by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Belgium's prime minister, Alexander de Croo, said developments since then meant energy was ""more than ever a geopolitical topic"" and the countries would standardise infrastructure to ensure North Sea wind farms could be built faster and cheaper.

The Netherlands and Britain announced plans for Europe's biggest cross-border electricity link connected to an offshore wind farm, while the EU and Norway pledged to develop infrastructure to capture and store CO2 from depleted North Sea gas fields.

Britain has 45 offshore wind farms producing 14GW, with plans to expand capacity to 50GW by 2030. Germany has 30 producing 8GW, followed by the Netherlands with 2.8GW and Denmark and Belgium, both with 2.3GW.

France aims to expand massively to 40GW by 2050, an official said. They added: ""Offshore wind energy will probably be the main source of renewable energy production between 2030 and 2050, far ahead of solar energy and land wind farms.""

The investment required to ensure the North Sea wind energy targets are met is huge - the EU recently calculated â‚¬800bn would be needed to reach 300GW by 2050 - and wind energy companies have said significant state funding will be essential.

Industry association WindEurope said Europe should be building the offshore infrastructure to add 20GW in output a year, but is creating capacity for only 7GW annually because of supply problems with key turbine parts.

Urine found to contain ""˜significantly' increased concentrations of glyphosate, which is associated with fetal problems

Pregnant women living near farm fields show ""significantly"" increased concentrations of glyphosate weedkiller in their urine during periods when farmers are spraying their fields with the herbicide, according to a new scientific paper published on Wednesday.

The research team said the findings were concerning, given recent studies that have found gestational exposure to glyphosate is associated with reduced fetal growth and other fetal problems. Glyphosate separately has been linked to cancer and other health problems.

""If the developing fetus is especially vulnerable to glyphosate, it is critical to understand the magnitude and sources of exposure during this critical developmental period,"" the new paper states.

The authors include researchers from the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Washington; Boise State University; and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Glyphosate is the world's most widely used herbicide and is the active ingredient in products sold around the world, including the widely used Roundup brand developed by Monsanto and now owned by Bayer after Bayer's 2018 acquisition of Monsanto.

The results of the study were considered somewhat surprising because none of the women studied worked with glyphosate or other herbicides or had a household member who worked with weedkillers, said Cynthia Curl, associate professor at Boise State and lead author on the paper.

""What is going on? Is it drifting more than we think? Is it adhering to soil particles which then blow around and end up in people's house dust? Is it drinking water? Until we figure that out we can't suggest the right interventions,"" Curl said.

Curl said follow-up research will collect household dust and water samples to try to determine routes of exposure.

To evaluate the exposure, the research team collected 453 urine samples biweekly from 40 pregnant women in southern Idaho from February through December 2021. Women were considered to be living near a farm field if they resided less than 0.5km, or roughly 0.3 of a mile, from an actively cultivated field.

In those living near the fields, glyphosate was detected both more frequently and at much higher concentrations during the months when farmers were spraying glyphosate than during the periods when they were not spraying. Those participants living farther away still showed glyphosate in their urine, but the frequency and concentrations stayed relatively unchanged throughout the year.

""Sadly, I am not surprised that pregnant women who live near fields sprayed with glyphosate have elevated levels of glyphosate in their bodies during the spraying season,"" said Philip Landrigan, director of the Program for Global Public Health and the Common Good at Boston College. ""This situation is analogous to the elevated exposures to benzene, 1,3-butadiene and other toxic plastics chemicals that have been documented in women who live in ""˜fenceline' communities.""

Though glyphosate has been on the market for more than 50 years, it is only within the last few years that researchers have started to document the extent of human exposure.

In 2022, a unit of the CDC reported that out of 2,310 urine samples collected, more than 80% were laced with detectable traces of glyphosate. And in a recent population-based survey in France, glyphosate was found in 99% of urine samples collected from close to 7,000 participants.

MEPs back law to place recovery measures on 20% of EU's land and sea by 2030 by dozen votes

The EU has narrowly passed a key law to protect nature - a core pillar of the Commission president Ursula von der Leyen's European Green Deal - after months of fiery debate and an opposition campaign scientists criticised as misleading.

The nature restoration law will place recovery measures on 20% of the EU's land and sea by 2030, rising to cover all degraded ecosystems by 2050.

Lawmakers decided against ""killing the bill"" by only a dozen votes in Strasbourg on Wednesday but watered it down on several points. They will send the proposal back to an environment committee before thrashing out details with member states.

""It's a huge social victory,"" CÃ©sar Luena, a centre-left MEP from Spain in charge of the proposal, told reporters. ""This is a law on behalf of nature. It's not a law against any person whatsoever.""

Nature is dying faster than humans have ever known, a landmark scientific assessment found in 2019, driven by climate change, pollution and the way people exploit the land and sea. The restoration law aims to reverse this trend and help the bloc hit biodiversity targets it has previously failed to meet.

Opposition from the European People's party (EPP), the centre-right group to which Von der Leyen belongs, nearly sank the proposal outright. Together with the rightwing European Conservatives and Reformists, the far-right Identity and Democracy group and parts of the market-liberal Renew group, the EPP argued the law would hurt food security and punish producers reeling from the pandemic and energy crisis.

""Less land for farmers, less sea for fishermen, less activity for businesses, and fewer European products and jobs for our citizens,"" said Rosanna Conte, an Italian MEP from the Identity and Democracy group, during a heated debate on Tuesday. ""These are the heavy repercussions of the proposals contained in a regulation permeated with ideology and counterproductive for nature itself.""

Scientists have rejected the claim that restoring nature is bad for food and the economy.

An open letter signed by 6,000 scientists said opponents of the law ""not only lack scientific evidence, but even contradict it"". They highlighted studies showing that restoring nature would improve food security, help fisheries, create jobs and save money.

""We are systematically hearing misinformation,"" said Guy Pe'er, a conservation biologist at the Helmholtz-Centre for Environmental Research, who was first author of the letter. ""Lobby organisations can generate as much misinformation as they want. But when policymakers are going against the science, we need to step in.""

Europe's nature is in bad health. More than 60% of its soils are unhealthy and 81% of habitats in poor condition. A recent study found the abundance of farmland birds has halved in the past 40 years.

Pe'er said it was unclear if even the dinosaurs died out that fast. He added: ""Forty years is an extremely short time. In evolutionary terms, it's the speed of a meteorite falling on us"".

The day before the vote, farmers drove tractors to the European parliament and told MEPs to vote against the bill, while climate protesters including the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg urged them to support it.

Green groups criticised changes in the approved text that cut a proposal to restore agricultural ecosystems and added a line to delay implementation of the law until after a formal assessment of Europe's food security.

Peter Liese, an EPP lawmaker from Germany, said: ""It is astonishing that even the Greens are celebrating this weakened version of the nature restoration law as a victory.""

The law had previously been rejected by the European parliament's fisheries and agriculture committees. A third committee, in charge of environmental issues, found no majority in favour of it after a tied vote.

Farmers and fishers said the law demanded too much and did not clarify who would pay.

The EU wants fishers decarbonise the fleet and protect the environment using existing funding, said Daniel Voces de OnaÃ­ndi, the managing director of the fishing lobby group EuropÃªche. ""We want to implement this in a fair manner in the EU - and not with an environmental hammer.""

Copa Cogeca, the farming lobby, praised last-minute changes to the agricultural side of the proposal but said the law remained ""fundamentally ill-prepared, lacks a budget and will remain unimplementable for farmers and forest owners"".

Shortly before the vote, a handful of conservative lawmakers said they would break with their party line in favour of an amended version of the law.

""I cannot in good conscience, good faith, vote against this law,"" said Frances Fitzgerald, an Irish MEP and the vice-chair of the EPP, in a video posted to Twitter shortly before the vote. ""We should have a constructive approach.""

The EPP ran a provocative campaign against the law on social media. In the weeks leading up to the vote, the EPP tweeted that the proposed law would turn the Finnish city of Rovaniemi, which claims to be the official home of Santa Claus, into a forest.

In another tweet, it said the law would shut down two windfarms in the Netherlands. The industry lobby group WindEurope said it had spoken to experts and did not see why this would be the case.

Michael Bloss, a German MEP with the Greens, said: ""The louder you scream and the more false information you spread - that is sometimes a winning strategy. But the loser, in the end, is democratic debate.""

779,"Wales votes to ban ""˜cruel' animal snares","https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/17/wales-votes-to-ban-cruel-animal-snares","Wales votes to ban ""˜cruel' animal snares

Critics say traps regularly catch non-target species and animals can suffer for days

Wales is on track to become the first UK nation to ban snares, after a vote in the Senedd backed criminalising what campaigners say is a cruel and indiscriminate way to trap wild animals.

The wire traps are used by gamekeepers and farmers across the country in efforts to catch foxes, which would otherwise hunt lambs and gamebirds. But critics say the traps cause animals immense suffering, and that non-target species are regularly caught.

The Welsh government's agriculture (Wales) bill, which looks likely to pass in the next few weeks, will make the use of snares in Wales an offence carrying a potential six-month jail sentence or an unlimited fine.

Late on Tuesday, members of the Senedd voted down Conservative amendments to the bill that opponents said would have have been a back door for continued use of snares.

Will Morton, the League Against Cruel Sports' head of public affairs, said: ""Wales is leading the way in animal welfare by being the first country to ban these cruel and indiscriminate traps. We thank the thousands of campaigners who are backing the ban in Wales and the MSs who gave cross party support to make it become a reality.""

According to 2012 research by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), up to 250,000 snares lie hidden in undergrowth of England and Wales. The wire nooses catch animals around the neck, pinning them in place.

According to existing regulations, snare operators must return to check on them at least once a day, while voluntary codes of best practice recommend twice a day, particularly at dawn as most animals are caught at night.

But opponents say that in practice trapped animals can suffer for hours or days, vulnerable to other animals, before they are shot or slowly die. The traps themselves can be lethal, with wire nooses that tighten the more an animal struggles to free itself.

Snare operators predominantly use them to catch foxes, with a smaller number used for hunting rabbits. But Defra's research found badgers, hares, otters, deer and even domestic dogs and cats were also often caught.

Polling carried out by YouGov in January 2021 showed 78% of the Welsh public wanted snares to be made illegal.

Amendments to the agriculture bill tabled by Sam Kurtz, the Conservative MS for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, would have allowed for the continued ""licensed use of humane cable restraints"". All four were defeated by 38 votes to 14.

Morton added: ""The ban on the use of snares will protect wild, farmed and domestic animals from falling victim to these brutal devices, a move that will be welcomed by the vast majority of the Welsh people.

""The next step is to lobby the UK and Scottish governments to follow the precedents set in Wales and to ban these barbaric devices.""

California immigrant farm workers bore the brunt of this winter's extreme weather - yet have scant resources to put their lives back together

Theresa Barajas hadn't been able to bring herself to the police barricade at the edge of Pajaro, or look at the devastation that lay beyond. Even if the flood waters had spared her apartment, the life she and her family had built there would be gone.

""It will not be like before,"" she said.

In the early hours of 11 March, pummeling rains wore down a levee on the Pajaro River, unleashing a torrent. Barajas, 50, had escaped with her daughter and grandson under the blare of sirens. But the floods swallowed the town - and perhaps their future here.

The same mucky runoff that wrecked homes and businesses and stores submerged the flowering strawberry fields where she and most of the community work.

""What are we going to do?"" she said. ""All we can count on now is God.""

Most of the US's summer strawberries are grown in the Pajaro valley and nearby Salinas, as are a number of other berries and greens. But without urgent government intervention and investment, the immigrant farm workers who pick them could become climate migrants. Many lack legal status, and are therefore ineligible for federal disaster relief funds or unemployment insurance. Even those who do are struggling to feed themselves and their families in one of the most expensive and under-resourced agricultural communities in the US.

The more than 2,000 people evacuated from Pajaro after the flood have been sleeping on their friends' and relatives' couches, in hotel rooms or in their cars, and at packed emergency shelters in nearby Watsonville. Some are already travelling hours away to seek odd jobs.

An intensifying climate crisis has thrust thousands of agricultural workers across the state into similar circumstances, unemployed or toiling in dangerous conditions, amid atmospheric river storms, extreme heatwaves and wildfires.

""This could be the beginning of a great climate displacement,"" said Michael MÃ©ndez, assistant professor of environmental planning and policy at the University of California, Irvine. ""Will there be enough resources to rebuild? Will people have enough resources to come back? That's the greatest question right now.""

Returning home and assessing the future

On Thursday, Pajaro residents and business owners were allowed back into town for the first time since they were evacuated. Families shovelled mud from their floors and collected all the mementoes and documents they could salvage. The town remains without potable water, and crews are still working to repair a ruptured sewage line. More than 900 homes and businesses were damaged, and some were red-tagged as unsafe to occupy.

Officials are still assessing the extent of damage to the region's agricultural land, but estimate 30%-50% yield losses. That's on top of thousands of acres already destroyed by floods in January. Because flood waters can carry contaminants and sewage, flooded farmlands will have to be fallowed for up to two months per federal regulations, and undergo testing before they can be replanted.

A few days after the storms passed, more than 500 people lined up for a food and clothing distribution, hosted out of Ernestina Solorio's back yard in Watsonville. The long-running monthly event organised by Solorio, a farm worker herself, regularly draws hundreds who come to stock up on pantry staples, diapers and other supplies. But the queue this time was especially long.

""The need has always been here,"" said Eloy Ortiz, a board member and volunteer with the Center for Farmworker Families. ""But now there's even more of a need.""

Many have already missed weeks of work and don't know when they can start earning a living again. Since berry season runs from April through November, workers often subsist on savings during the winter. Others, like Antonio Diaz, 35, make money preparing and planting the fields. But due to the barrage of storms this winter, he hadn't been able to work since January.

As he and his wife collected bags of produce, beans and a few toiletries in a foldable grocery cart, he explained that he had already lost more than $4,000 in wages. He hadn't heard from any of his supervisors - but he didn't think he would be able to return to work anytime soon. ""There is nothing left,"" he said. ""When the waters recede, everything will have rotted, everything spoiled. No more strawberries.""

A dozen consecutive atmospheric river storms have hit the state since late December, wrecking spring harvests and leaving workers like Diaz with dwindling opportunities. ""We don't know when we will work again,"" he said. ""And if I don't work, we don't know when we will eat.""

Esperanza Esquibel, 34, had no idea how long she would be homeless. A few days after she and her three daughters fled Pajaro, she was horrified to see drone images of her rented house all over the news. Milky brown waters had inched up to her windows. Her neighbour's cars out front were nearly submerged.

Her four-year-old keeps asking her when they can go back. ""But I have no answers for my baby,"" she said.

Little help from the government

California's governor, Gavin Newsom, has promised relief, telling residents that ""no other state does more for farm workers"" while visiting Pajaro last week. He touted a Covid relief program that residents could apply for to receive $600 checks.

But that wouldn't even cover a family's groceries for a month.

""I mean, come on - I can't even get my tires changed for that much,"" said Ray Cancino, the CEO of the non-profit Community Bridges, who has been advocating for the state to create a disaster relief fund for workers affected by the storms. ""In this country we have exploited farm workers enough, and we need to pay back our debt to them.""

Legislators from Los Angeles have introduced a bill to create an ""excluded workers program"" that would pay undocumented, unemployed workers $300 a week, for up to 20 weeks. The scheme is backed by research from the University of California, Merced, which found that more than 1 million workers ""‹""‹in California lack eligibility for the most basic safety net provisions. But Newsom vetoed a similar bill last year, and axed a $20m pilot program to provide $1,000 monthly payments for farm workers affected by the drought, citing budget constraints.

In the aftermath of the storms, Luis Alejo, president of the Monterey county board of supervisors, wrote to Newsom asking for emergency aid for undocumented residents, and resources to set up a housing taskforce. The governor's office did not respond to the Guardian's questions about when or whether such resources might be available.

""Our state has a fundamental responsibility to create a disaster aid fund for workers that are continually being displaced and harmed during disasters [and] extreme weather events,"" said MÃ©ndez of the University of California.

MÃ©ndez's research has found that undocumented Latino and Indigenous immigrants have been systemically left out of disaster planning in California. And when tragedy does strike, his research has shown, those who live in under-resourced communities have little recourse.

Pajaro is a clear example of such dynamics, he said.

Engineers had discussed the need to reinforce the levee on the Pajaro River since the 1960s, but due to low property values in the area the project wasn't prioritised in the government's cost-to-benefit calculations.

It could take two or more weeks to restore utilities, officials said, but it could take years to rebuild the town. Without government aid, housing or work, it's unclear for how long people in the community can hold out, MÃ©ndez said. ""People will essentially be left with little choice but to move,"" he argued.

Crises multiply and deepen

Rising rents in recent years have added to the strain for many. A 2018 report by local agencies found that over two-thirds of farm worker residences in the Salinas and Pajaro valleys were severely overcrowded, with multiple families sharing bedrooms, living rooms and garages.

The flooding in Pajaro will deepen the housing crisis, said Cancino of Community Bridges. ""We could be looking at gentrification, relocation and displacement,"" he said. ""Some people may end up returning to their home countries. And they might not come back.""

As global heating brings more intense and frequent storms, fires and other climate catastrophes, the state's agricultural model is overdue for a reckoning, said Ana Padilla, executive director of the Community and Labor Center at the University of California, Merced. ""These emergencies are going to keep happening,"" she said. ""And right now, farm workers have no pathway for wage replacement or relief. How are they going to provide for their families?""

That question consumed many of those waiting at the food distribution center and at the emergency shelter, where more than 500 people are still sleeping.

Barajas, her 36-year-old daughter and her 13-year-old grandson did return to Pajaro on Thursday. Their apartment wasn't as damaged as many of their neighbours' homes, but it still wasn't habitable, and there was no running water.

Last week they brought themselves to a resource centre run by Community Bridges, which expects to distribute grants up to $2,400 for families affected by the storms. Still, for families like Barajas, that will barely cover rent and expenses for a month - let alone the property damage.

Barajas had thought of returning to Mexico, where most of her family lives, but she doesn't want to interrupt her grandson's education. Worst case, she said, she would consider moving to Oxnard in southern California, another farming region that grows berries as well as vegetables. But heavy rains have damaged fields there as well.

""We never imagined this would be such a big disaster,"" Barajas said. ""Now any illusions we had have left us.""

784,"Climate crisis: carbon emissions budget is now tiny, scientists say","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/30/climate-crisis-carbon-emissions-budget","Climate crisis: carbon emissions budget is now tiny, scientists say

Having good chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C is gone, sending ""˜dire' message about the adequacy of climate action

The carbon budget remaining to limit the climate crisis to 1.5C of global heating is now ""tiny"", according to an analysis, sending a ""dire"" message about the adequacy of climate action.

The carbon budget is the maximum amount of carbon emissions that can be released while restricting global temperature rise to the limits of the Paris agreement. The new figure is half the size of the budget estimated in 2020 and would be exhausted in six years at current levels of emissions.

Temperature records have been obliterated in 2023, with extreme weather supercharged by global heating hitting lives and livelihoods across the world. At the imminent UN Cop28 climate summit in the United Arab Emirates there are likely to be disputes over calls for a phaseout of fossil fuels.

The analysis found the carbon budget remaining for a 50% chance of keeping global temperature rise below 1.5C is about 250bn tonnes. Global emissions are expected to reach a record high this year of about 40bn tonnes. To retain the 50% chance of a 1.5C limit, emissions would have to plunge to net zero by 2034, far faster than even the most radical scenarios.

The current UN ambition is to cut emissions by half by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050, although existing policies are far from delivering this ambition. If it was achieved, however, it would mean only about a 40% chance of staying below 1.5C, the scientists said, so breaking the limit would be more likely than not.

But, they warned, every 10th of a degree of extra heat caused more human suffering and therefore keeping as close as possible to 1.5C was crucial.

The new carbon budget estimate is the most recent and comprehensive analysis to date. The main reasons the budget has shrunk so markedly since 2020 are the continued high emissions from human activities and a better understanding of how reducing air pollution increases heating by blocking less sunlight.

Prof Joeri Rogelj, at Imperial College London, UK, and one the study's authors, said: ""The budget is so small, and the urgency of meaningful action for limiting warming is so high, [that] the message from [the carbon budget] is dire.

""Having a 50% or higher likelihood that we limit warming to 1.5C is out of the window, irrespective of how much political action and policy action there is."" He said it was ""remarkable"" how much risk humanity appeared willing to take with global heating.

Dr Chris Smith, at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria, who was also part of the study, said: ""Governments can control the emissions but, at the moment, they have not done so. This is why we have an ever-shrinking carbon budget. We are not saying we only have six years to solve climate change - absolutely not. If we are able to limit warming to 1.6C or 1.7C, that's a lot better than 2C. We still need to fight for every 10th of a degree.""

The study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, used updated data and improved climate modelling compared with other recent estimates. It also used the latest figures showing that aerosol air pollution and the clouds it was helping to seed were better at blocking sunlight and limiting heating than previously thought. As a result, lower pollution in future would mean more global heating and therefore a smaller carbon emissions budget to remain under 1.5C.

The analysis also looked at the 2C upper limit in the Paris agreement, which even if met would still mean a sharp increase in climate impacts from heatwaves to floods to crop losses.

For a 90% chance of keeping below 2C, emissions would have to hit net zero in about 2035, the study found. Achieving net zero in 2050 would give a 66% chance of meeting the 2C target.

Ben Sanderson, at the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research in Norway, and not part of the study, said the remaining budget for 1.5C was tiny. ""The [analysis] makes for uncomfortable reading for policymakers. The budget is consistent with net zero CO2 emissions being achieved in 2034. This is vastly more ambitious than current implemented global climate policies.""

Dr Gabriel AbrahÃ£o, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, said: ""There is a very real possibility that we will overshoot the 1.5C target in this decade. Thus, the public debate and the international climate negotiations should already be discussing how to return to 1.5C after an overshoot, so that [it] doesn't end up being permanent.""

The calculation of carbon budget involved significant uncertainties, the researchers said. Sanderson added: ""This [updated carbon budget] illustrates that any calculation, no matter how rigorous, is subject to change with revised data and understanding.""

Dr Robin Lamboll, at Imperial College London, said future revisions that increased the carbon budget were ""not very likely now"".

Global carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning could peak as early as this year, according to data from the International Energy Agency, meaning they could begin to fall in 2024.

Lamboll said the researchers hoped to produce annual updates on the remaining carbon budgets.

Asda introduces a limit on tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, lettuce, salad bags, broccoli, cauliflower and raspberries, after bad harvest hits supplies



Live feed

Closing summary

Time for a recap""¦

Asda and Morrisons are bringing in rationing of salad items including tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers amid shortages caused by poor weather in southern Europe and north Africa.

Asda is limiting shoppers to three items each on eight fresh produce lines - including broccoli, cauliflower, raspberries and lettuces - to ensure all customers can get what they need.

Morrisons is putting limits of two per item on tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce and peppers from Wednesday. A spokesperson said:

""Like other supermarkets, we are experiencing sourcing challenges on some products that are grown in southern Spain and north Africa.

The British Retail Consortium, which represents all the big grocers, expects the supply disruption to last a few weeks.

Here's the full story:

The National Farmers Union has warned that ""Volatility, uncertainty and instability"" are endangering UK farm businesses, and called for more help on energy bills.

On the economic front, the UK recorded a surprise budget surplus of over £5bn in January, helped by a surge in tax takings. This has spurred calls for chancellor Jeremy Hunt to address public sector pay disputes.

But Downing Street has played down suggestions that there could be tax cuts in next month's budget.

The prime minister's spokesman warned:

Borrowing remains at record highs and there is significant uncertainty and volatility which poses clear risks to the fiscal position.""

The UK's private sector has returned to growth, boosting hopes that Britain may avoid a recession in the near term. The news pushed the pound to its highest in around a week.

In the cost of living crisis, campaigners have called for private housing landlords to be held to new standards set out after the death of Awaab Ishak.

Research from Citizens Advice found that 1.6 million children live in privately rented homes with damp, mould or excessive cold.

The energy crisis stemming from the war in Ukraine had cost the equivalent of £1,000 for every UK adult, research shows.

Royal Mail has restarted international parcel and letter deliveries through Post Office branches almost six weeks after it revealed it had been affected by a ransomware cyber-attack that hit its international services.

Ofgem has told energy suppliers to uninstall prepayment meters that have been wrongly force-fitted and pay compensation now, rather than wait for the outcome of a review.

HSBC has increased bonus payouts for its chief executive after fourth-quarter profits more than doubled on the back of a jump in mortgage and loan costs for its borrowers.

Several factors are behind the shortage of foods in UK supermarkets, explains Abhi Ghadge, Associate Professor of Supply Chain Management at Cranfield School of Management

""Frequent shortages of food items in the UK's supermarkets have raised questions regarding the long-term availability of food in the UK.

""However, this broader issue links several aspects, from changing climatic conditions to Brexit to soaring energy and labour costs. For example, British and European farmers have scaled back on producing certain foods, such as tomatoes, due to the rising cost of heating greenhouses and labour.

""The shortages of food items in the UK are expected to continue with fresh salad (including cucumbers), cabbages and cauliflowers in the next few days. However, some of these food items are grown outside the EU; thus, purely blaming Brexit for the shortages is inappropriate.

Supermarkets need to think of innovative solutions rather than just blaming suppliers, Ghadge adds:

Local sourcing and alternate suppliers are some of the commonly used supply chain strategies to manage such issues. The UK government needs to build resilience around these recurring issues associated with food shortages. Investing in in-house greenhouse projects and looking for availability beyond Europe may provide some solutions.""

NFU president: salad production expected to be lowest since 1985

The head of the National Farmers Union has warned that soaring costs and energy bills are hitting the sector, hurting domestic food production.

NFU president Minette Batters told the union's conference today that agricultural inputs having risen almost 50% since 2019, with a knock-on impact on production.

Batters warned that salad production could hit the lowest in decades:

UK egg production has fallen to its lowest level in nine years. Which means there were nearly a billion less eggs produced in 2022 compared to 2019.

Production of salad ingredients like tomatoes and cucumbers are expected to fall to the lowest levels since records began in 1985

She also called on the government for dedicated support for the energy intensive sectors of agriculture and horticulture, saying:

The situation seems ridiculous. The Royal Botanical Gardens , as important as they are, qualify for the scheme. But the protected crop sector - those growing tomatoes, cucumbers, aubergines and peppers to feed British families - don't.

How to get your five a day.... not as Asda or Morrisons after the supermarkets impose customer buying limits on fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, peppers in shortage. (2 items per customer at Mozzas, three at Asda)
This is NOT the loo roll rationing of 2020 - Veg goes off.

Morrisons is also introducing restrictios - limits of two items per customer across tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, peppers from Wednesday.

Asda: temporary limit means customers can get products they want

Asda says its three bag limit for purchases of tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, lettuce, salad bags, broccoli, cauliflower and raspberries will mean customers can buy the products they want.

An Asda spokesperson says:

""We have introduced a temporary limit of three of each product on a very small number of fruit and vegetable lines, so customers can pick up the products they are looking for,""

Waitrose executive director, James Bailey, has blamed an ""extraordinary weather event"" in Spain and North Africa on the shortages at fruit and vegetable racks, rather than Brexit.

Bailey told LBC that high energy costs are a contributory factor -- many growers in the UK and Holland have either not turned their heated greenhouses on, or have run them for less time than usual.

Here's the clip:

My colleague Sarah Butler reported last night that unseasonable weather, storms in the Mediterranean and a cut in crops planted in heated glasshouse was leading to shortages in supermarkets.

She wrote:

Two big importers said they were managing to fulfil contracts to their main supermarket clients but had been forced to lower quality specifications, find alternative sources of supply or offer a limited range of options since the chilly weather started in January.

Industry insiders said availability of produce is down by between 30% and 40% on some crops. Wholesale prices have also shot up, adding to inflation in stores as well as empty shelves.

The harvest of peppers was down 70% in Spain and cucumbers by up to 50% in the country's AlmerÃ­a region, according to the catering supplier Reynolds' latest crop report.

The high cost of energy has also hit fruit and vegetable production in Europe, making it more expensive to heat greenhouses.

Nigel Jenney, chief executive of the Fresh Produce Consortium, has told the BBC ""There's been a myriad of individual factors"", such as:

""Weather, fuel costs, packaging and distribution costs, energy costs.""

Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, which represents UK supermarkets, says:

""Difficult weather conditions in the south of Europe and northern Africa have disrupted harvest for some fruit and vegetables including tomatoes.

""However, supermarkets are adept at managing supply chain issues and are working with farmers to ensure that customers are able to access a wide range of fresh produce.""

Tomato shortage hits UK after bad weather

Bad weather in Europe and Africa is leading to shortages of tomatoes and some other popular vegetables.

Sky News points out:

The UK relies on countries such as Morocco and Spain for tomatoes during the winter.

But in Morocco, growers have struggled with cold weather, heavy rain and floods.

Suppliers have been hit by ferry cancellations, which have affected lorry transport.

Spanish crops have also been affected by bad weather in the past three or four weeks.

Asda rationing some fruit and vegetable sales after widespread shortages

Grocery chain Asda is rationing sales of some fruit and vegetables after a bad harvest in southern Spain and north Africa led to gaps on supermarket shelves.

Asda, the UK's third-largest grocer, has begun limiting purchases to three of each product across tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, lettuce, salad bags, broccoli, cauliflower and raspberries.

Bloomberg has more details:

Other retailers may follow suit after cold weather in key agricultural locations disrupted harvests, with the impact expected to last for weeks.

Shoppers in the UK have been posting pictures on social media of empty shelves in vegetable aisles across multiple supermarkets.

Grocers become more reliant on imports around this time of year, particularly from sunnier places such as Spain. British horticultural production normally only starts in late March or April and domestic supplies have already been hit by labor shortages and the higher cost of energy and fertilizer.

The National Farmers' Union has warned that farmers have been hit by rising costs, labour shortages, bird flu and post-Brexit changes to support payments, creating ""volatility, uncertainty and instability"" across the industry.

NFU President Minette Batters warned today that:

""The fact remains, volatility, uncertainty and instability are the greatest risks to farm businesses in England and Wales today.

Critically, those consequences will be felt far beyond farming; they will be felt across the natural environment, and in struggling households across the country,""

Downing Street has played down the prospect of tax cuts in the Budget following the surprise monthly surplus recorded in January, warning that there was still ""significant uncertainty and volatility"".

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said that the government's ""overall focus on reducing the debt remains"", telling reporters:

""It's important to understand the context. You would expect to see a surplus in January because of the timing of self-assessment receipts.

""The only January deficit since 2015 was in 2021 during the height of the pandemic.

""So we shouldn't place too much emphasis on a single month's data.

""Borrowing remains at record highs and there is significant uncertainty and volatility which poses clear risks to the fiscal position.""

Many feel the Ethiopia's slave-owning traditions, which lasted into the last century, do not align with the country's modern image of itself

Nothing hints at the dark past of the marketplace at Dalbo, a town in southern Ethiopia. Today, it is a thriving hub that draws farmers from the surrounding countryside each week, and doubles as a sports pitch on non-trading days.

There are no plaques, monuments or inscriptions revealing that enslaved people were once sold here alongside livestock and cereals. Local people will often shut down the conversation when the subject is raised.

""They are hiding the story because they feel ashamed,"" says Zerfe Argaw, who lives on a farmstead a few miles outside Dalbo. ""It is seen as a closed subject; people don't want to talk about it.""

Zerfeis in her 50s, too young to have seen people being sold in the market, but she was told about the trade by older relatives. ""I heard different stories,"" she says. ""Slave owners owned [entire] households as slaves and would sell whole families to buyers, including the children.""

Eight decades after slavery was abolished by imperial decree by Emperor Haile Selassie in 1942, this is how the memory of slavery is preserved in Ethiopia: as fragments passed down by grandparents.

Histories of the country gloss over slavery and the subject rarely surfaces in public discourse. At the National Museum of Ethiopia in the capital, Addis Ababa, none of the exhibits deal with domestic slavery, while in Dalbo the chains once used to bind slaves have been melted down to make knives and farm implements. Little has been preserved.

""Slavery is a controversial issue,"" says Nigussu Mekonnen, a guide at the museum. ""There is limited evidence and information about it.""

Most history is hotly contested in Ethiopia, a patchwork of 90 ethnic groups prone to outbreaks of inter-communal violence. The nation was forged through violent conquest in the late 19th century by Emperor Menelik II - whose empire was based on the culture of the northern highlands - and resentments from that era still smoulder.

Later came famine, revolution and civil war. Today, the country is grappling with the fallout of a bloody civil war between the northern Tigray region and the federal government that has killed hundreds of thousands of people, and a simmering insurgency marked by ethnic killings in Oromia, Ethiopia's largest state.

""We tend to ignore certain kinds of history that would shape the negative image of the country,"" says Kiya Gezahegne, an assistant professor in the social anthropology department at Addis Ababa University. Instead, official narratives focus on Ethiopia's ancient Christian civilisation and its reputation as the only African country to have successfully resisted European colonisation.

""We are taught to be proud of our identity, and bringing in this narrative of slavery would be a challenge to that discourse,"" says Kiya.

Yet slavery was once widespread in Ethiopia. Stretching back centuries, slaves served as soldiers, domestic servants and labourers, who were put to work at royal courts, in churches and fields.

Many were born into servitude. Others were captured in raids and during wars, or sold into slavery after they failed to pay debts. Much of the trade was domestic, although Ethiopian slaves were also sold across the Red Sea to Arabia and Turkey, where they were prized as concubines and servants.

Historical data on the slave trade is patchy. Ahmed Hassen, a professor of history at Addis Ababa University, says the number of enslaved people ebbed and flowed, especially during times of war, but estimates that up to one-third of Ethiopians were enslaved at different points in history.

In some districts, the proportion was likely even higher. The sociologist Remo Chiatti calculates that 50 to 80% of people were slaves in parts of Wolaita, a southern kingdom centred on Dalbo that was absorbed into the Ethiopian empire in the 1890s.

""Slavery was everywhere,"" says Ahmed. ""It was the backbone of labour; it was the source of everything. It was not only landlords and the court of the emperor keeping slaves, but also rich peasants. If you had money, you had them.""

Abolition came slowly, the result of ""external and internal realities"", says Ahmed. The first big step came in 1923 when Haile Selassie signed an accord promising to end slavery to gain admittance to the League of Nations, although the practice was not stamped out entirely. In the 1930s, Benito Mussolini used the issue to justify his invasion of Ethiopia, which Italian fascist propaganda cast as a ""civilising mission"".

In 1942, after Ethiopia's liberation from Italian occupation, Haile Selassie issued the decree abolishing slavery. Even then, the practice lingered in some pockets and the influence of the former slave-owning aristocracy would not be smashed until 1974, when revolution swept to power the Provisional Military Administrative Council, also known as the Derg, a Marxist-Leninist military junta that introduced land reforms.

Today, the impact of slavery is keenly felt. After abolition, many slaves became part of the families of their former masters, but in some areas the descendants of enslaved people are seen as impure and are marginalised, barred from participating in ceremonies such as funerals or marrying into other clans. In Addis Ababa, it is common to hear light-skinned highlanders refer to darker-skinned people from southern Ethiopia as ""bariya"" (slave).

""Slavery in Ethiopia is not a historical phenomenon,"" says an Ethiopian researcher, who did not want to be named. ""Its legacy still affects people's lives today.""

A teacher in Addis Ababa, who also did not want to be named, recalls a conversation with his mother. ""She's the type of person who, if she saw someone hungry on the street, she would bring them to our house to eat with us,"" he says. ""But when I asked her if I could ever marry someone from slave descent, she said, ""˜No.' For her, it's like a curse.'""

Little has been done to heal these rifts. In 2019, a year after Abiy Ahmed became prime minister on a tide of mass protests and promising reform, Ethiopia's federal parliament set up a reconciliation commission to address past political repression and historical injustices, including the slave trade.

""It is one of the injustices that Ethiopian society inflicted on its members,"" says Cardinal Berhaneyesus Demerew Souraphiel, the head of Ethiopia's Roman Catholic church, who participated in the commission. ""We felt slavery should not be put under the table. It should be studied and addressed if there is to be real reconciliation.""

But the commission's work was never published and it has now been subsumed into a broader national dialogue commission, which opposition parties claim is government-controlled. Critics of the government say political repression has crept back in after the outbreak of the war in Tigray in November 2020.

The polarised environment has made it harder to discuss issues such as slavery. A teacher in Addis Ababa, who did not want to be named, says he grew up with ""zero knowledge"" that slavery was once so widespread.""People are too preoccupied with ethnic-based politics,"" he says. ""If you talk about slavery, you are accused of trying to divide your group.""

He says: ""I see a lot of posts online about George Floyd, talking about how racist America is, and of course that's an issue. But we also need to talk about inequality here. There are still ethnic groups looking down on others.""

A new generation of historians are starting to piece together the history of Ethiopia's slave trade, but discussions remain confined to academic journals and seminar rooms. Last year, there were no public events to commemorate the 80th anniversary of abolition, and most local oral histories are still hidden.

This saddens Zerfe in Dalbo, who says she has passed the stories she heard about slavery on to her children and grandchildren. ""As a history, it has to be told to the next generation,"" she says. ""What they think of it, that is up to them. But they should learn it to help them see injustice.""

793,"Drought caused 43,000 ""˜excess deaths' in Somalia last year, half of them young children","https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/mar/21/drought-caused-43000-excess-deaths-in-somalia-last-year-half-of-them-young-children","Drought caused 43,000 ""˜excess deaths' in Somalia last year, half of them young children

New report uncovers tragic scale of climate-led crisis and warns of up to 34,000 more deaths so far this year

A new report released by the Somalian government suggests that far more children died in the country last year due to the ongoing drought than previously realised.

The study estimates that there were 43,000 excess deaths in 2022 in Somalia due to the deepening drought compared with similar droughts in 2017 and 2018.

Half of the deaths are likely to have been children under five. Up to 34,000 further deaths have been forecast for the first six months of this year.

Released on Monday by Somalia's federal health ministry together with Unicef and the World Health Organization, the report was compiled by researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Imperial College London, who looked at retrospective estimates of mortality across Somalia from January to December 2022.

Accurate statistics are difficult to compile from a population spread across remote areas, and with about three million people displaced from their homes. The highest death rates are thought to be in the regions of south-central Somalia, including Bay, Bakool and Banadir, that are the worst hit by drought.

Somalia's health minister, Dr Ali Hadji Adam Abubakar, found cause for optimism that famine had so far been averted.

""We continue to be concerned about the level and scale of the public health impact of this deepening and protracted food crisis in Somalia,"" he said.

""At the same time, we are optimistic that if we can sustain our ongoing and scaled-up health and nutrition actions, and humanitarian response to save lives and protect the health of our vulnerable, we can push back the risk of famine for ever.""

If this did not happen, he said, ""the vulnerable and marginalised will pay the price of this crisis with their lives"".

""We therefore urge all our partners and donors to continue to support the health sector in building a resilient health system that works for everyone and not for the few,"" said Abubakar.

For the first time, a prediction model was developed from the study. A forecast from January to June 2023 estimates that 135 people a day might also die due to the crisis, with total deaths projected at being between 18,100 and 34,200 during this period.

The estimates suggest the crisis in Somalia is far from over and is already more severe than the 2017-18 drought.

Wafaa Saeed, Unicef's representative in Somalia, said he was saddened by the grim picture of the drought's impact on families, but added: ""We know there could have been many more deaths had humanitarian assistance not been scaled up to reach affected communities.

""We must continue to save lives by preventing and treating malnutrition, providing safe and clean water, improving access to lifesaving health services, immunising children against deadly diseases such as measles, and providing critical protection services.""

There have now been six consecutive failed rainy seasons in the climate crisis-induced drought, which coincides with global food price rises, intensified insecurity in some regions, and the aftermath of the pandemic.

The study is the first in a planned series and was funded by the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.

Everything you need to know about ""˜forever chemicals' detected in air, water, soils, sediments and rain

What are PFAS ""˜forever chemicals'?

You may not realise it but you have an intimate relationship with PFAS. The human-made chemicals are in your blood, your clothes, your cosmetics. They have been detected in air, water, soils, sediments, and in rain at levels that would be considered unsafe in drinking water in some countries.

PFAS stands for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, it's an umbrella term for a family of thousands of chemicals - about 12,000 at the last count - that are prized for their indestructible and non-stick properties.

They are used in a huge range of consumer products, including waterproof clothing, furniture, cookware, electronics, food packaging and firefighting foams and are employed in a wide array of industrial processes.

Most PFAS are so well designed and robust that they won't break down in the environment for tens of thousands of years, earning them the moniker ""forever chemicals"". This persistence means the PFAS burden is ever growing, so much so that a group of scientists have concluded that the global spread of just four PFAS in the atmosphere has led to the ""planetary boundary for chemical pollution being exceeded, raising risks to the stability of the Earth system"".

The substances' grease and water repellent properties enable them to be very mobile, which means that once the chemicals have departed their original products they can slide their way out of old landfills for example, and migrate into the environment.

That's bad news because many PFAS also tend to bioaccumulate, which means they are absorbed by organisms faster than they can be excreted and will build up over time. PFAS biomagnify up food chains too, supplying apex predators such as orcas with hefty doses at mealtimes.

What about PFOS and PFOA?

Little is known about most PFAS because, as The Environment Agency's former chief scientist put it, ""few PFAS have been subject to extensive testing so information about their hazardous properties is ""¦ sparse"".

However, two widely used problematic substances - perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) - have been scrutinised following a number of major pollution incidents in the US, Australia and Europe, linked to chemicals manufacturing plants and contamination from PFAS-laden firefighting foams.

Both were eventually banned or had their uses restricted under various European and international laws, but being forever chemicals, they have not gone away.

In the UK today, of the thousands of PFAS in use, only PFOS and PFOA are subject to regulation.

Are they toxic to health?

There's a hint in the shorthand for the properties of some PFAS, which is PBT: persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic.

So far toxicity can only be applied to PFOS and PFOA, but PFOS has also earned itself an additional letter: uPBT, with the u standing for ubiquitous - a clue as to how widespread the contamination has become.

It was DuPont that introduced PFAS to the world in the 1940s as Teflon and it was DuPont that revealed how harmful they could be. It emitted PFOA from its US plant in south-west Parkersburg into the air and Ohio River from the 1950s until the early 2000s, and it eventually reached drinking water supplies. The ensuing lawsuit, which led to DuPont settling 3,500 personal injury cases for $670.1m (£555m), was made famous by the Mark Ruffalo film Dark Waters.

A US study that ran between 2005 and 2013, involving the collection of blood samples from about 69,000 people living near the DuPont plant, concluded that there was a ""probable link"" between exposure to PFOA and six diseases: high cholesterol, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, testicular cancer, kidney cancer and pregnancy-induced hypertension.

Other studies have reported that PFOS and PFOA can affect the immune system and that by depressing immune response, they can make vaccines less effective. They have also been linked to low birthweight, birth defects, delayed development and newborn deaths in laboratory animals.

Ian Ross, PFAS practice lead at engineering company CDM Smith, said: ""It was known that PFAS are extremely persistent in the environment since at least 1950 but they have been widely used in highly dispersive applications such as in firefighting foams since 1962.""

Public interest science has only just begun to wrap its head around PFOS and PFOA, decades after they were first produced, and so there is little chance it will ever catch up with manufacturers, who can tweak an existing molecule, rename it, and have it on the market in a fraction of the time it takes to establish a body of evidence to demonstrate whether or not it needs regulating.

It's a high stakes, slow motion game of whack-a-mole.

How do you become exposed?

It's estimated that, given the widespread use of PFAS and the ubiquitous presence of some of them in the environment, almost everyone on the planet has PFAS in their blood at some level.

For the general public, the main sources of PFAS exposure are from drinking water and food, such as eating fish, eggs, or milk, or livestock that has fed on contaminated land. Direct exposure can also come via cosmetics, sprays or dust from consumer products, but little is known of the impacts through these pathways.

But to fall foul of the worst effects of PFOS or PFOA, you would need to be exposed for a sustained period of time to pretty high concentrations of the substances. That's why most PFAS health scandals in the US and Europe have been related to contaminated drinking water supplies.

There are lots of potential sources of PFAS pollution. Aside from chemicals manufacturing plants, any site that has regularly used PFOS-laden aqueous film-forming firefighting foams, such as airfields, military bases and firefighting training grounds, could in theory contaminate soils, air and water in the vicinity.

Other sources include landfills, paper mills, wastewater treatment works, land spread with sewage sludge, runoff from urban areas, industries that involve textile waterproofing, metal finishing and plating, carpet and furniture production, paint, refrigerators and cleaning products.

PFAS ""behave like surfactants, like soaps"", says Prof Crispin Halsall, an environmental chemist at Lancaster University. ""They sit at the interfaces between water and particles, water and biota, they can transfer to the atmosphere and they're so abundant they cycle around the wider environment, and that's the problem we've got.""

Add to this the minefield of consumer products laden with PFAS, the existing load in the environment, while at the same time more PFAS are being manufactured and created, and it is hard to imagine how at least low-level exposure could be avoided.

What do PFAS do to the wildlife and the environment?

PFAS have been detected in even the remotest parts of the globe, from the Arctic to Antarctica.

In England many rivers fail to meet standards for chemical health due to the presence of PFAS, and this widespread pollution could be affecting the wildlife that live in them. Cardiff University analysed the livers of otters across England and Wales and found PFAS in all 50 otters sampled, with 12 different types of PFAS found in 80% of the animals. At sea, PFAS have been found in killer whales near Norway and in bottlenose dolphins stranded along the northern Adriatic coast.

In Flanders, the government has advised people living in the neighbourhood of a 3M PFAS factory to stop eating eggs and vegetables from their hens and gardens, and a study by the Technical University of Denmark National Food Institute and the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration found that organic eggs in Denmark are contaminated with high levels of PFAS.

Linda Birnbaum, toxicologist and former director of the US National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, said: ""There's an increasing amount of data showing PFAS are associated with a wide variety of health effects, not only in people but in animals.

""I like to remind us all that we are a kind of animal ""¦ there are now hundreds of epidemiology studies showing associations with a wide variety of effects, including cancer, liver effects, kidney effects, effects on development and reproduction, growing evidence for effects on neurodevelopment, growing evidence for effects on type 2 diabetes ""¦ It's kind of like the more you look, the more you begin to find associations with this very broad class of chemicals.""

801,"Labour plans to allow local authorities to buy land cheaply for development","https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/29/labour-allow-local-authorities-buy-land-cheaply-for-development","Labour plans to allow local authorities to buy land cheaply for development

Exclusive: If elected next year, party would allow officials to buy up land at fraction of potential cost as part of ""˜pro-building' agenda

Labour is planning to give local officials sweeping new powers to buy land cheaply and develop on it, as part of the party's new ""pro-building"" agenda.

Party sources say that if elected next year, they will pass a law to allow local development authorities in England the power to buy up land at a fraction of its potential cost if they want to build on it.

The new law will allow officials to buy land under compulsory purchase orders without having to factor in the ""hope value"" - a massive price premium granted to any land on which developers hope to secure planning permission.

Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, is already under fire for his promise to make it easier to build on the green belt. But the details of the party's latest pro-development policy show he is willing to risk the wrath of existing land and property owners in his attempt to jump-start new building across the country.

One party source said: ""We want to rebalance the power between landowners and local communities. We want local areas to capture a lot more of the value that is created when you build on land nearby. The principal is to tilt the balance of power, which right now is tilted towards landowners and not communities.""

Homeownership in England has been falling for years, as prices have risen and banks have asked for increasingly large deposits. In 2003, 71% of all homes were owned by the people who live there, but by 2021-22, that had fallen to 64%.

The Conservatives have attempted to tackle this by offering financial help for new buyers, but the impact of those schemes have been limited by falling supply.

Michael Gove, the housing secretary, has promised a series of planning reforms, but has been hampered by a set of powerful Conservative backbenchers who believe their seats are under threat because of building schemes in their constituencies.

Last year Gove bowed to pressure from those Tory MPs to drop a mandatory target to build 300,000 new homes every year, making it voluntary instead.

Since then, several local authorities have delayed or scaled back their building plans, causing analysts to slash their projections of new housebuilding over the coming years. A study earlier this year by the Home Builders Federation suggested housebuilding in England was set to fall to 120,000 a year - the lowest level since the second world war.

Labour is promising to be ""the builders, not the blockers"", launching a series of pro-building policies, including a return to the mandatory 300,000 target.

As part of that, sources say the party would pass a law soon after entering government to allow local development authorities to buy up land under compulsory purchase orders without factoring in the hope value.

Hope value is the price premium attached to land on which planning permission has either been granted or on which developers hope it will be granted. An analysis by the Centre for Progressive Policy in 2018 found that planning permission inflated the price of agricultural land by 275 times, pushing it up from £22,520 per hectare to £6.2m per hectare.

Politicians from the two main parties have argued for years that hope value should be stripped out of compulsory purchase valuations. In 2018 the Tory MP Neil O'Brien called the practice of paying it ""highly questionable"", in a report for the centre-right think tank Onward.

O'Brien, who is now a health minister, said: ""This has made it prohibitively expensive and complex for the old ""˜new towns' model to be viable. And even where government spends taxpayers' money on major infrastructure projects, the value of this investment is often not discounted when government buys the land for the infrastructure. The system has become unbalanced.""

Gove has taken up a version of O'Brien's reforms, but intends to leave it up to the housing secretary at the time to decide whether to eliminate hope value from CPOs on a case-by-case basis. The reforms are part of the levelling up and regeneration bill, currently passing through the House of Lords.

A spokesperson for Gove's department said: ""It will ultimately be for the secretary of state to decide whether a compulsory purchase order can be approved and if the removal of hope value is appropriate.""

Labour argues, however, that this would leave local planning officials relatively powerless to buy up the land they believe is needed for local development schemes, and would also leave the secretary of state vulnerable to sustained lobbying from landowners.

Labour officials are still deciding on the scope of the reforms, and whether they should be passed in the ""take back control"" bill, which Starmer has promised will be part of his first king's speech, or whether they should be part of a separate planning bill. They are also deciding on how best the value added by planning permission should be dispersed to local communities themselves.

A 10-year project to name all of South Africa's birds in the evocative isiZulu language is finally giving a voice to Indigenous communities

Until recently, a Zulu speaker who spotted an iCape gannet would have no choice but to refer to the majestic seabird by its unedifying ""zulufied"" name. But now the gannet, which can plunge into the ocean at speeds of up to 120km/h when hunting sardines, finally has a Zulu name that does it justice: isicibamanzi (the spear into the water).

After years of research and work with Indigenous communities, a list of isiZulu vernacular names for all 878 birds found in South Africa has recently been put together.

""In South Africa, birding has always had a bit of a stigma as a white people's thing,"" says Nandi Thobela of BirdLife South Africa, the organisation behind the isiZulu bird names project. While there are many reasons for this, the fact that bird names (and field guides) were all in English or Afrikaans certainly didn't help. ""When you have to translate a word, you lose people,"" says Thobela.

Birding may be a predominantly white pursuit, but the birds themselves have always been important to the Indigenous people of South Africa. ""The Nguni languages were developed from people observing nature,"" says Thobela. ""Before people had clocks and calendars, it was the birds that told farmers when to reap and when to sow.""

A case in point is the phezukomkhono, the recently ratified Zulu name for the red-chested cuckoo. Sakhamuzi Mhlongo, one of the bird guides who has been involved in the project since its inception, explains that the name has been in use for centuries: ""This bird has always been used by ladies to know when to plant their crops. Every spring they wait and wait and wait for the phezukomkhono to come back from migration. Phezukomkhono means ""˜roll up your sleeves' and grab your hand hoe and plant the crops. It's got a good meaning for Zulu-speaking people.""

""Language and culture encode and express our meaningful engagement with the world,"" says the Cambridge University linguist Karen Park. ""For a language like isiZulu, spoken by people who have inhabited the region of South Africa for millennia, words can hold both a deep knowledge of place and a powerful connection to ancestry and cultural identity.""

While English bird names often follow conservative conventions (like relying on chest markings or naming them after old white explorers), Zulu names are far more varied and original. The black cuckoo is an undodosibona (man who sees us), a reference to the bird calling from dense vegetation where people can't see it; the African emerald cuckoo is ubantwanyana, a verbalisation of the bird's call - it supposedly sings: ""Little children don't get married!""; and Klaas's cuckoo is an umazalashiye (the bird that lays eggs and then leaves them behind).

The standardised list of isiZulu bird names has been more than a decade in the making. In 2012, Noleen Turner and Adrian Koopman - both isiZulu professors at the University of Kwa-Zulu Natal - led an effort to compile a complete list of Zulu names for birds found in the Kwa-Zulu Natal province (where most ethnic Zulu speakers live). They first canvassed communities to ascertain which of the province's 500 bird species already had names. It turned out that some species had many names, some had one name, and some had none.

They then brought together 30 Zulu-speaking bird guides from around the province for a series of naming workshops. If there was already a Zulu name this always took precedence. When several names existed, the guides would debate and settle on one name that best represented the bird. When no name existed, they would work together to come up with a name. ""You want a name that makes people remember the bird,"" says Mhlongo.

Ornithology experts were on hand to tell of the identifying features and habits of each species, but the final say always went to the ethnic Zulus. ""It feels really good to know that there is a complete list of bird names in my language,"" says Mhlongo. ""The fact that the list was made by Zulu speakers and for Zulu speakers is the cherry on the top.""

Park echoes this view: ""The systematic, comprehensive and community-led approach sets an important standard of multidisciplinary collaboration and local empowerment, ownership and engagement that I hope to see emulated.""

She believes that global engagement with our natural world ""too often overlooks the rich cultural and linguistic context of the people who inhabit the places that compel our interest. I find this has especially been the case with global biodiversity conservation organisations, which tend to impose a western science framework on the practice of protecting, maintaining and restoring biological diversity.""

By 2018, Koopman and Turner's team had finalised Zulu names for all the birds found in Kwa-Zulu Natal. Then came the publication, in 2020, of a glossy, full-colour book: Birds of KwaZulu-Natal and Their Zulu Names. ""For so many years, we've been having this problem of getting black people into birding,"" says Mhlongo. ""It's always easier to learn something when you are still young. Now we have a book that is written in black and white. The kids can take it home and read about the birds, and the parents can read it too.""

Inspired by all this groundbreaking work, BirdLife South Africa decided to extend the project to include all birds found in South Africa. The recently completed nationwide bird list is currently out for public comment. ""We wanted to give Zulu speakers a chance to challenge or improve the list,"" says Thobela. ""But so far we have only received praise and encouragement.""

They have already been contacted by Sepedi and Setswana linguists who are keen to create bird lists in their languages. And BirdLife South Africa is on the verge of agreeing a deal with a large international app developer to create a free isiZulu bird app.

""Ultimately, we want to have bird names in all 11 languages,"" says Thobela. ""We started with isiZulu because of the pioneering work done by the profs and because Zulu is so widely spoken. But we want all South Africans to feel a connection with the birds that live around them.""

While Thobela hopes it won't be another 10 years until the next list is completed, she and the rest of the team won't be rushing it either. ""Involving the local bird guides, and giving them the final say on every bird name, is what made this project so special.""

Research shows birds with small alterations to one gene are highly resistant to avian flu

Scientists have created the world's first flu-resistant chickens in an advance that could pave the way for gene-edited poultry on UK farms.

The birds, which had small alterations to one gene, were highly resistant to avian flu, with nine in 10 birds showing no signs of infection when exposed to a typical dose of the virus.

However, infections were not completely blocked, and scientists say this would have to be achieved before genetically engineered chickens could be introduced to farms, due to the risk of the virus evolving to become more dangerous to humans.

Prof Wendy Barclay, of Imperial College London, a co-author of the study, which is published in Nature Communications, said: ""Under natural doses our gene-edited chickens really seemed to be resistant, but when we took a very high dose, we did see in half of the chickens a breakthrough infection.

""This showed us a proof of concept that we can move towards making chickens resistant to the virus but we're not there yet.""

Preliminary results suggest editing three genes, rather than just one, could prevent breakthrough infections, raising the prospect of introduction in the UK, where gene editing of crops and animals is permitted.

There is concern about the spread of avian flu, which has led to the deaths of hundreds of millions of birds worldwide in the past two years. The virus has also spilled over into mammal populations, including seals, sea lions and mink, and caused several human deaths.

The principle investigator Dr Mike McGrew, of the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute, said: ""Highly pathogenic bird flu is widespread in Asia, Europe, Africa, North America and has now spread to South America and is feared to move to Antarctica.

""This is causing unprecedented deaths in wild birds and devastating impacts on farmed poultry ""¦ and there is a growing fear that bird flu could jump to humans and lead to another pandemic.""

Vaccinating birds is expensive and of limited effectiveness due to the rapid evolution of the flu virus. Tighter biosecurity measures, such as keeping chickens indoors, affect animal welfare.

McGrew said: ""Gene-editing offers a promising route towards permanent disease resistance, which could be passed down through generations, protecting poultry and reducing the risks to humans and wild birds.""

The research focused on a gene, ANP32, that makes a protein the flu virus hijacks to replicate itself. Barclay said: ""It occurred to us if you could disrupt that interaction and prevent the protein from being used, the virus would not be able to replicate.""

The team bred chickens using Crispr gene editing to make small changes to the ANP32A gene. When the gene-edited chickens were inoculated with 1,000 infectious units of the virus - equivalent to real-world exposure - only one in 10 birds were infected and shed a very low amount of virus over a few days. All of the control birds were infected.

When exposed to an extremely high dose of 1m infectious units, five of the 10 birds became infected, though with a viral load far lower than seen in the control chickens.

Any breakthrough infection poses a risk because of the potential of the virus to evolve. And, when tested, the virus in the gene-edited chickens had acquired mutations that helped it use two related proteins (ANP32B and ANP32E) to replicate. Some of these mutations also enabled the virus to use the human version of ANP32.

""The fact that we're taking a step in the direction of making the virus more able to infect other species is not something we'd want to be doing at all,"" Barclay said. ""We were not alarmed by the mutations that we saw, but the fact we got breakthrough means we need more rigorous edits going forward.""

When the genes for all three proteins were targeted, virus replication was completely blocked inside lab-grown chicken cells, and the team plan to test this in live chickens.

Prof Derek Smith, the director of the Centre for Pathogen Evolution at the University of Cambridge, said: ""This is an excellently done study and an important step on the way to avian flu-resistant chickens. As the authors say, there is more work to be done, and it is now clear the direction in which that work should go.""

Gene editing differs from genetic modification, an older technique in which an entire gene from one species is inserted into another. Gene editing is less contentious because the limited DNA changes that are introduced could, in theory, crop up naturally in a population given enough time.

Prof Massimo Palmarini, of the University of Glasgow, who was not involved in the latest work, said: ""I am not worried at all about the safety of gene-edited products for the consumer. They will be as safe as those that we have now - after all we could consider breeding of all our domestic animals in the last 10,000 years as a kind of slow gene-editing process.

""The key risk to consider is whether a gene-edited animal could favour the emergence of viruses with different characteristics.""

In 2021, Japan's government approved the sale of red sea bream lacking a myostatin gene, which suppresses muscle growth, and a tiger pufferfish with its genes that control appetite removed, both of which grow faster and have higher yields than conventional fish.

AquAdvantage salmon have a genetic modification that makes them grow bigger faster, and were the first genetically engineered animals approved for human consumption in the US and Canada in 2015.

GalSafe pigs were approved in the US in 2020 for human consumption. They are genetically altered so they do not produce alpha-gal sugars, which means they can be eaten by people with alpha-gal syndrome, which can cause mild to severe allergic reactions.

In 2020, the US also approved ""slick-haired cattle"" (PRLR-Slick) as food. They are gene-edited to have coats that increase the animals' resilience to higher temperatures.

810,"I was a champion of fake meat: but I'm not surprised people are losing their taste for it","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/10/fake-meat-sales-nutrition-environment","I was a champion of fake meat: but I'm not surprised people are losing their taste for it

Sales are falling due to nutritional and environmental concerns - but also because it just doesn't taste that good

Faux meat is failing. Once championed as a way to fight the climate emergency, protein alternatives are now struggling, with plant-based pioneers Beyond Meat reporting net revenue losses of nearly 31% in the second quarter of this year.

I could say I'm surprised, but the truth is I'm only amazed that our collective love affair with fake meat lasted as long as it did. I was once a fan, but standing in front of a towering wall of hyper-processed meat alternatives in my local supermarket last year, I couldn't help but think: are vegan burgers that bleed really the answer to our meat consumption woes?

Climate scientists have been sounding the alarm over how food production systems are contributing to global heating for decades. Eating less beef, pork and chicken is a vital element of the fightback, creating a gap in the market for meat alternatives. But, according to US charity the Center for Food Safety, ""replacing conventional animal products with ultra-processed, poorly studied and under-regulated genetically engineered products is not the solution to our factory farm and climate crisis"". And I'm inclined to agree.

Not long ago we were enamoured of everything that vegan alternatives promised, as a way to ""do our bit"" without sacrificing our carnivorous instincts. But the nutritional and environmental pitfalls of processed protein have slowly made themselves apparent. Swapping meat with Beyond Meat resulted in some impressive health findings, according to one study, including reduced LDL (or ""bad"") cholesterol and body weight. But while these plant-based products don't appear to be inherently damaging to our health, they are undeniably ultra-processed. In the long term, the implications of consuming industrially produced vegan products on a mass scale are unclear.

It's not just Beyond Meat that has seen sales plummet; in June, UK vegan producer Meatless Farm ceased trading before it was rescued from administration, while sausage company Heck reduced its vegan range, citing a lack of consumer demand. In the US, vegan chicken nugget startup Nowadays recently folded ""due to an inability to raise venture funds in this market"", an ominous forecast for the industry.

The cost of living crisis has been cited as one significant reason for tanking sales of vegan meat products. And it's true these alternatives can be expensive. A pack of two Beyond Meat burgers costs £4 at Tesco, while a pack of four Finest beef steak burgers is also priced at £4 - the same price for double the quantity. Beyond Meat is now reducing its price points and cutting jobs in a bid to save what some are calling a ""sinking ship"". But I wonder if waning sales aren't more likely to be linked to a shift in our collective feeling towards these products.

The reality is that many of these foods don't taste terribly good. As a chef who has spent my career designing vegan recipes, I've become something of an expert in the flavour profiles of meat alternatives. Beyond Meat remains the fiercest competitor to real meat when it comes to taste and texture but most other brands are seriously lacking. At this stage, nobody can convince me meatless protein crumbles are tastier or more appealing than beluga lentils. And if they aren't tastier, then why are we bothering?

Perhaps another reason for the decline in sales of these products is that the general public are arriving at a more nuanced position on our current meat production processes, and indeed their plant-based alternatives. In 2022, a summit on the societal role of meat was held in Dublin, with 1,000 scientists coming together to sign the Dublin Declaration, which states that ""livestock systems ""¦ are too precious to society to become the victim of simplification, reductionism or zealotry. These systems must continue to be embedded in and have broad approval of society.""

Vegan media was quick to dismiss the declaration, claiming it was ""riddled with animal industry bias"". But the fact that the summit even took place speaks volumes. Professor Michael Lee, a leading expert in sustainable livestock and one of the signatories of the declaration, insists it isn't ""anti-vegan"" or ""anti-ecology"" but instead about ""being pro sustainable agriculture to feed a global population and protect our planet and all its inhabitants"".

Personally, my own rules for eating healthily are inspired by the American author and journalist Michael Pollan's motto: ""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants"", which remains the simplest strategy we can apply to our food consumption habits that is good for our bodies and the planet alike.

Whether you view fake meat companies as innovative or otherwise, for those wanting to eliminate meat from their diets, these products can be a stepping stone towards a more plant-dominated lifestyle. I believe we are unquestionably drawn to items that replicate the taste and texture of conventional animal foods. Just look at the burgeoning cultivated meat industry, where animal meat cells are grown in a lab to replicate the real deal.

The future for fake meat looks uncertain but that's not to say with advances in food technology it will be gone for ever. But my faux-nugget-shunning five-year-old would rather see the back of it.

Vast releases of gas, along with future ""˜methane bombs', represent huge threat - but curbing emissions would rapidly reduce global heating

More than 1,000 ""super-emitter"" sites gushed the potent greenhouse gas methane into the global atmosphere in 2022, the Guardian can reveal, mostly from oil and gas facilities. The worst single leak spewed the pollution at a rate equivalent to 67m running cars.

Separate data also reveals 55 ""methane bombs"" around the world - fossil fuel extraction sites where gas leaks alone from future production would release levels of methane equivalent to 30 years of all US greenhouse gas emissions.

Methane emissions cause 25% of global heating today and there has been a ""scary"" surge since 2007, according to scientists. This acceleration may be the biggest threat to keeping below 1.5C of global heating and seriously risks triggering catastrophic climate tipping points, researchers say.

The two new datasets identify the sites most critical to preventing methane-driven disaster, as tackling leaks from fossil fuel sites is the fastest and cheapest way to slash methane emissions. Some leaks are deliberate, venting the unwanted gas released from underground while drilling for oil into the air, and some are accidental, from badly maintained or poorly regulated equipment.

Fast action would dramatically slow global heating as methane is short-lived in the atmosphere. An emissions cut of 45% by 2030, which the UN says is possible, would prevent 0.3C of temperature rise. Methane emissions therefore present both a grave threat to humanity, but also a golden opportunity to decisively act on the climate crisis.

""The current rise in methane looks very scary indeed,"" said Prof Euan Nisbet, at Royal Holloway, University of London in the UK. ""Methane acceleration is perhaps the largest factor challenging our Paris agreement goals. So removing the super-emitters is a no-brainer to slow the rise - you get a lot of bang for your buck.""

""Methane emissions are still far too high, especially as methane cuts are among the cheapest options to limit near-term global warming,"" said Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency. ""There is just no excuse.""

The methane super-emitter sites were detected by analysis of satellite data, with the US, Russia and Turkmenistan responsible for the largest number from fossil fuel facilities. The biggest event was a leak of 427 tonnes an hour in August, near Turkmenistan's Caspian coast and a major pipeline. That single leak was equivalent to the rate of emissions from 67m cars, or the hourly national emissions of France.

Future methane emissions from fossil fuel sites - the methane bombs - are also forecast to be huge, threatening the entire global ""carbon budget"" limit required to keep heating below 1.5C. More than half of these fields are already in production, including the three biggest methane bombs, which are all in North America.

""Methane's short lifetime means reduction of its emissions is one of the few options we still have to stay below 1.5C,"" said Dr Lena HÃ¶glund-Isaksson, at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria. ""If you exceed that level, even temporarily, you might trigger irreversible effects [from climate tipping points]."" The climate is already on the brink of multiple tipping points that could drive runaway climate change, scientists warned recently.

""Methane is the worst thing in the struggle to hold back the [climate] domino pieces, because it's pushing them over very quickly,"" said Kjell KÃ¼hne at the Leave it in the Ground Initiative. ""Having so many methane bombs out there is really worrisome.""

Double-edged sword

As a greenhouse gas, methane is a double-edged sword: it traps 80 times more heat than carbon dioxide, but it fades from the atmosphere in about a decade, far faster than the century or more taken by CO2.

In 2021, the last year for which full data is available, methane reached 1,908 parts per billion, 2.6 times higher than before human activity started transforming the atmosphere. Its role in global heating is often overlooked, but human-caused methane emissions are responsible for about a third of the rise in global temperatures seen over the last century. Today, the impact remains large, with the methane in the atmosphere responsible for about 25% of the heat trapped by all greenhouse gases.

Recent rises in annual methane emissions are accelerating. ""The highest growth rates we've ever seen have been just in the last few years, since 2020,"" said Nisbet.

About 40% of human-caused methane emissions come from leaks from fossil fuel exploration, production and transportation. These rose by almost 50% between 2000 and 2019. Another 40% comes from agriculture, dominated by burping cattle, and 20% from rotting waste sites. All are forecast to rise.

The recent surge in methane is largely being driven by increased activity by microbes that decompose organic matter, such as those in wetlands and the stomachs of livestock. It looks like rising global temperatures enable microbes to produce more methane, which then causes more global heating, creating a vicious circle.

""It's very much like a feedback effect and it's scary in lots of ways,"" said Nisbet. ""We really have to get methane under control.""

For fossil fuel leaks at least, that goal is within reach. At 80% of oil and gas sites and 98% of coalmines, the measures to plug leaks and end deliberate venting would pay for themselves, by selling the extra gas captured, or could be implemented at low net cost, according to the UN.

The super emitters

Satellite data analysed by the company Kayrros has identified 1,005 super-emitter events in 2022, of which 559 were from oil and gas fields, 105 from coalmines, and 340 from waste sites, such as landfills. The events can last between a few hours and several months.

""Before the satellite technology, we didn't have a clue where these big events were happening but now, the good thing is at least we have some monitoring,"" said HÃ¶glund-Isaksson.

Turkmenistan had the highest number of super-emitting events - 184. ""They vent like crazy,"" said Christian Lelong at Kayrros.

Little is known about fossil fuel production under Turkmenistan's repressive dictatorship. But the colossal leaks may be the result of ageing Soviet-era equipment, experts said, or attempts to avoid scrutiny over flaring, when vented gas is ignited to form less damaging CO2 but produces easily visible flames. Turkmenistan dominated the top 100 largest super-emitter events from fossil fuels, with 70 events.

The US had 154 super-emitter events from fossil fuel sites. The biggest was in March last year, near San Antonio in Texas, releasing 147 tonnes an hour, while the second biggest was in a fracking field in rural Pennsylvania, and lasted for 13 days.

Russia had 120 super-emitting events in 2022. Other nations in the top 15 include Algeria, China, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Iran and Iraq. The second largest fossil fuel leak of the year - 356 tonnes an hour - was in Iraq, apparently from an oil refinery near Basra. Most of Australia's super-emitting leaks were from coalmines in the Bowen Basin in Queensland.

Overall, the Kayrros data shows no decline of super-emitter events between 2021 and 2022, nor any decline in the company's wider datasets going back to 2019. ""The annual rate of change is very close to zero,"" said Lelong.

Super-emitter events from other human sources were also evident in the satellite data, including large waste dumps, illegal tapping of gas pipes, and rice paddies, in countries including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Argentina.

There will be even more super-emitter events not detected by current satellites. Water interferes with the infrared signals used to detect the methane, meaning leaks from offshore facilities, in very humid regions, or when there are clouds or snow, are much harder to spot. But forthcoming satellites are expected to have sharper eyes.

The methane bombs

In May 2022, the Guardian revealed that the world's biggest fossil fuel firms were quietly planning scores of ""carbon bomb"" oil and gas projects that would drive the planet to climate catastrophe.

Now, new research from the same scientists has identified 55 ""methane bombs"": gas fields where leakage alone from the full exploitation of the resources would result in emissions equivalent to at least a billion tonnes of CO2.

Gas fields also produce methane, which is sold to customers and burned, pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. When these emissions are combined with the leaked methane, the list of bombs that would result in global heating equivalent to 1bn tonnes of CO2 swells to 112.

In the scientists' central estimate, the total emissions from these 112 methane bombs would be equivalent to 463bn tonnes of CO2 - more than a decade of current global emissions from all fossil fuels. The methane bomb emissions are also significantly higher than the emissions limit of 380bn tonnes of CO2 from all sources needed to keep global heating below 1.5C, according to the Global Carbon Budget's recent estimate.

""I'm amazed how long this list is, and how many of these giant projects are still being pushed forward,"" said KÃ¼hne, who did the analysis. He warned: ""The impacts of methane are front loaded - they happen very soon after its emission. Last year's gas leaks are killing people this year,"" via the climate impacts they cause.

""At the same time, methane is a huge opportunity to reduce global heating,"" KÃ¼hne said. ""That is the unrealised potential in defusing methane bombs, to stop runaway climate change. I think it might be the last opportunity, because we're already seeing some of these tipping elements tip over. We're in a climate emergency and [stopping fossil fuel methane leaks] is top of the list.""

The heavily fracked Marcellus Shale, centred on Pennsylvania and West Virginia, in the US is the biggest methane bomb. Its estimated future emissions from methane leakage alone are equivalent to 17bn tonnes of CO2, more than three times the total annual emissions of the US.

The Haynesville/Bossier Shale, in Texas and Louisiana, is the second biggest methane bomb, with estimated emissions from leakage equivalent to 9.7bn tonnes of CO2 emissions. The Montney Play in western Canada is another fracking field and the third-biggest methane bomb. In the rest of the top 10, three methane bombs are in Russia, two more in the US, and one each in Turkmenistan and Qatar.

The scientists also made a conservative estimate of the impact of the 112 methane bombs, but these emissions still represent more that 80% of the remaining global carbon budget for 1.5C of global heating. A worst-case estimate indicated emissions equivalent to 729 Gt CO2 from the methane bombs, almost double the planet's remaining 1.5C carbon budget.

""˜Achievable target'

The looming methane-driven climate catastrophe is clear, but the growing role of the satellite detectives and rising political momentum for action on the potent gas give reason for cautious hope.

A global methane pledge, to cut human-caused emissions by 30% by 2030, was announced at the UN's Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in 2021. The number of nations backing the pledge has now reached 150, although some key countries have not signed up, including Russia, China, Turkmenistan, Iran and India.

What is methane?

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, trapping far more heat than its better known cousin carbon dioxide. But how the impact of the two is compared depends on the timescale. That is because most methane is degraded and disappears from the atmosphere in about a decade, whereas it takes a century or more for the same to happen to CO2.

Over a century, methane traps 29.8 times more heat than the same amount of CO2 by weight. This factor is called the global warming potential. Over 20 years, the GWP of methane is 82.5, while the immediate impact of methane is 120 times that of CO2.

Most climate studies are focused on CO2 and so to include the impact of methane emissions, the latter is usually converted into the equivalent amount of CO2, using the GWPs.

The 30% cut would avoid 0.2C of global heating by around 2050, and the subsequent reduction in air pollution would also prevent about 6m premature deaths and 580m tonnes of crop losses.

""It's a great step forward, seeing so many countries start moving in that direction,"" said KÃ¼hne. ""But it's a pledge - we want to see it implemented.""

Lelong, from Kayrros, is optimistic: ""Now that we have the technology and the [global methane pledge] in place, our expectation is that the map [of fossil fuel supermitters] should be completely dark in three years' time.""

""That's an achievable target,"" he said. ""We now know where these big sources are coming from, we know they're avoidable, so there's really no reason not to address them.""

Kayrros has signed a deal to provide leak data to the UN Environment Programme's new methane alert and response project. Unep is expected to use the near-real-time satellite data to identify super-emitting polluters and press them to stem the leaks. Then, after about three months, the information would be published, with the first public data expected in the second half of 2023.

The scrutiny is necessary: the International Energy Agency said last year that methane emissions from the fossil fuel sector were about 70% greater than those actually declared by governments. The IEA estimates that, to have an even chance of keeping below 1.5C of global heating, these methane leaks must fall by 75% by 2030.

A 50% methane cut from fossil fuel sites could be achieved essentially for free, according to a study. The sale of the captured gas would offset the cost of plugging the leaks, which often simply involves replacing defective parts. Billions of dollars of gas is either leaked or deliberately wasted each year, and high gas prices due to Russia's war in Ukraine has made the economic case even stronger.

In contrast, cutting methane from other human sources is significantly harder. Options that incur no net cost represent just 16% of emissions from waste sites and 30% of those from cattle. Draining wetlands is unthinkable for most scientists, as that could produce large CO2 emissions and destroy precious habitat for wildlife.

""Oil and gas is really the easiest and cheapest way,"" said HÃ¶glund-Isaksson. However, she said: ""The profit margins in that sector are so high from simply increasing gas production, but the profit margins from reducing methane emissions are relatively small. You need regulations that force them to do it.""

Regulations are coming. In the US, for example, companies will be charged $900 a tonne for leaks of methane from 2024, rising to $1,500 a tonne in 2026. The big leak in Pennsylvania would have incurred a cost of $220,000 an hour at the higher rate. The European Union has proposed regulations requiring companies to plug leaks and to ban routine venting and flaring, and Nigeria recently announced new methane regulations.

A spokesperson for the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers said: ""Since 2015, average oil production has increased by about 0.5% a year through to 2021 to meet global energy demand. Despite this increase, methane emissions [from the fossil fuel sector] have remained stable, while quantification and estimation techniques have advanced rapidly. The global oil and gas industry is focused on building on that improved measurement to deliver significant reductions in the coming years.""

Jonathan Banks, global director for methane pollution prevention at the NGO Clean Air Task Force, said: ""There's no solution to climate change without addressing methane emissions. Fast action will have an immediate impact on warming, helping to finally bend the curve on climate change.""

""I'm very happy that, finally, methane is actually on the policy agenda, because this has not been the case - it's been drowned out by the CO2 issue,"" said HÃ¶glund-Isaksson. ""But we are also clearly running out of time and I would really like to see much, much more happening, because there's so much that could be done, particularly on oil and gas.""

Note on methane bomb methodology: The analysis is based on 2020 information on gas-rich fields from industry data provider Rystad Energy and builds on the research published in the journal Energy Policy on carbon bombs by KÃ¼hne and colleagues. This was combined with data on methane leak rates from fossil fuel operations and the heating impact of methane. The central estimates for the methane bombs used a leak rate of 2.3%, based on a US study, and the heating impact over 20 years, which is 82.5 times that of CO2. The conservative estimate used a leak rate of 1.7% from the International Energy Agency, and the heating impact over 100 years, which is 30 times that of CO2. The worst-case estimate used a leak rate of 3.7%, based on analysis of the Permian basin in the US, and the immediate heating impact of methane, which is 120 times that of CO2. The full list of methane bombs and more information on the methodology is here.

British PM to tell UN summit of plans for rainforests and new national park - but green groups remain sceptical

Rishi Sunak is to announce a new package of green measures as the Cop28 UN climate summit begins in Dubai, including a search for a national park, a strategy on British rainforests and landscape recovery projects with farmers.

But green groups have told the Guardian the package is greenwashing and an attempt by the UK prime minister to ""reset"" his reputation after previously opposing environmental measures.

Craig Bennett, the chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, said: ""There is very little indication that voters responded well to his anti-green spasm a few months ago.""

The measures to be announced on Wednesday will include a countrywide search for the location for a national park in England. The government said it would be in one of England's ""most beautiful"" nature spots, and chosen with accessibility for everyone in mind.

It is unlikely, however, that the government can begin to fulfil that pledge before the next general election.

Sunak will also propose a £15m boost in funding for existing parks and nationally important nature spaces, and a rainforest strategy with £750,000 for research. There will also be £2.5m to improve access to nature for children, though there was no detail on how this would be achieved.

There is scepticism among environmental groups about the motivations for the announcement. Some news outlets reported that Sunak's popularity had dived after he revealed a rollback of net zero measures in September, a strategy he thought would boost the party after the Uxbridge byelection, in which a supposed backlash against the Ulez emissions scheme was credited with playing a critical role.

Sunak is due to attend Cop28 this week with the foreign secretary, David Cameron, and King Charles III. The prime minister made a firm commitment to attend the summit early this year after a last-minute U-turn on Cop27 in Egypt last year. No 10 had previously said he was too focused on the domestic economy to attend the 2022 conference and banned the king from going.

Bennett said there was ""good reason to believe Sunak is trying to reset his image"".

He added: ""Polls show climate and nature feature very high in voters' concerns - above immigration, according to some polling - so it's not a surprise that Rishi Sunak will be trying to tack back to those voters. It is also worth noting that there are many environmental promises the government has not delivered, such as releasing beavers, banning peat sales and the deposit return scheme.""

Kevin Bishop, the chief executive of Dartmoor National Park Authority, said before the government announces a new park, it should be properly funding existing ones.

Since the Conservative party came to power in 2010, national parks had experienced budget cuts that led to the closure of visitor centres, he said. Many were in a poor state for nature as they were overgrazed by livestock and otherwise poorly maintained.

Bishop added: ""The priority should be about funding the existing national parks. During the age of austerity, which for us has not ended, our core funding in real terms has been cut by 50%. The announcement does include additional money for existing national parks, which will not cover what has been cut but is welcome. However we do not know the detail.

""We are struggling to retain staff because they can earn more money in other jobs, we haven't enough staff to do practical work or to deliver the landscapes review proposals about welcoming everyone to our national parks.""

Bennett welcomed parts of the package, including the expansion of payments to land managers who would club together to create large landscape recovery projects for England's rarest habitats.

He said: ""It's really good to see the expansion of landscape recovery. This is the area of the environment land management schemes that has been oversubscribed and has such potential for nature that to roll this out further will make a difference. The rainforest strategy also will be welcome, depending on what it contains.""

The prime minister said he shared in the country's ""profound sense of anger"" over the felling of the world-famous Sycamore Gap tree, near Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland, in September ""but the public's outrage fundamentally demonstrated just how much love the British people have for the natural world"".

He added: ""From Yorkshire's historic rolling moors to ancient rainforest on the Cornish coast, we are home to many globally significant landscapes. We must do all it takes to protect these much-loved spaces and ensure that love for the natural world continues into the next generations.

""As I head to Cop28, we are reasserting the UK's leading role in promoting our iconic landscapes and keeping nature at the centre of our action to tackle climate change.""

Electricity is involved in every aspect of life. But could the new science of bioelectricity help cure diseases and ""˜upgrade' humans?

I was back at the checkpoint. The traffic moved as normal. Bored-looking soldiers waved through civilians on foot, dusty cars and rickety trucks full of livestock and produce.

Then the Humvee in front of the gate blew up. Out of the eye-searing blast, I made out the figure of a man running at me, full-speed. He was wearing an explosive vest. I shot him.

A flash of movement to my left revealed a sniper who had just begun to raise his gun. I got him, too. Now a mass of people - maybe seven - breached the checkpoint. Bang-bang-bang.

There weren't any more after that, only the quiet whistle of the desert wind. The lights came up and the tech walked in.

""How many did I get?"" I asked, as I surrendered my rifle and headgear, cutting off the flow of electricity that had been coursing through my brain.

She shrugged. ""All of them.""

I was in a grey office park in Southern California, nowhere near any checkpoint in any conflict. In my hands was an M4 close-combat rifle modified to fire harmless cartridges. The people I was firing at had been dreamed up by the programmers of a wall-sized army-training simulation. What was real was the electrical stimulation device on my head. I had signed up to have a few milliamps from a 9V battery sent through my skull to test if it would make me a better shot.

The scientists' hypothesis was that the electrical current would recalibrate a different kind of electricity in my brain: the naturally occurring bioelectric signals that the nervous system relies on to communicate. By overpowering these delicate natural streams with an artificial shock to the executive part of my brain, they hoped to wrench my mind into a state of alertness and concentration - enough to turn this desk-slumping journalist into a battle-ready assassin.

I was obsessed from the moment I first caught wind of this military brain-stimulation experiment. I had seen this technique - known as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) - bubbling around the science press for a few years. Among other intriguing results, it seemed to improve everything from treatment-resistant depression to poor maths skills.

This flow of electricity, according to the scientists who wired me up, might alter the strength of connections between the neurons in my brain, making them more likely to fire in concert. That natural synchronisation is the basis of all learning and speeding it up with an electrical field would theoretically accelerate the rate at which I could learn a new skill.

When I caught my first glimpse of this strange new use for electricity in 2009, it was the stuff of obscure medical trials and secret military projects. Today, the notion of wearing an electrical stimulator on your head is certainly the kind of thing you can imagine someone in Silicon Valley doing for a little extra mental edge, alongside intermittent fasting or microdosing psilocybin.

But it's not just about boosting your brainpower with a volt jolt - there are many other ways electricity is being used to treat the ailments of body and mind. Take deep-brain stimulation, a treatment of last resort for Parkinson's disease, in which two electrodes the size and shape of a strand of spaghetti are slid into the deepest parts of your brain to quieten the disease's destructive symptoms.

In the wake of its fantastic success, scientists are testing the treatment on epilepsy, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and obesity. Then there's the rise of ""electroceuticals"": these rice-grain-sized electrical implants, clamped around nerves in the body, supposedly interrupt their signals and, in rat and pig trials, appeared to reverse diabetes, hypertension and asthma.

In 2016, outstanding early results in human trials, in which they seemed to reverse rheumatoid arthritis, convinced Google's parent company, Alphabet, to team up with a pharmaceutical multinational on a £540m venture to tap into the body's electrical signals, to try to treat diseases such as Crohn's and diabetes.

So when I saw the opportunity to be a guinea pig in a US Department of Defense project, of course I jumped at it, and I wasn't disappointed: my own experience with tDCS was transformative. Getting my neurons slapped around by an electric field instantly sharpened my ability to focus and, by the transitive property, my sharpshooting skills.

It also felt incredible - like someone had finally hit the off switch on all the distracting negative self-talk that had, until that moment, been the main provider of my mind's elevator music. I had a tendency to get distracted from tasks by my own self-recriminations; this constant background chatter was such a ubiquitous feature of my mind that I had stopped noticing it, but it certainly got in the way of stressful tasks - including these shooting drills. My first taste of electricity felt as if someone had popped a bell jar over all those inner voices. Their sudden silence made me aware of the power they'd had.

When my story detailing the experience was published in New Scientist, it went viral. It was tapping into something zeitgeisty. Since the early 2000s, thousands of studies had pointed to tDCS as a way to improve the mind. The data and the headlines had been accumulating for years, but my gonzo experience took it out of dry, clinical stuff.

Seeing dollar signs in the combination of intriguing lab results and growing public interest, enterprising start-ups quickly began to hawk their own commercial versions of the brain-enhancing headgear I had road-tested. These cute wearables, which would set you back a few hundred dollars, had little in common with the £10,000 gear in the Department of Defense's arsenal.

Nonetheless, they were soon adopted by people looking for any bit of extra mental edge, including high-level athletes. Before every game, the Golden State Warriors - a team so unbeatable they were accused of ""ruining basketball"" - wore them in practice sessions to zap their brains into the zone. The US Olympic ski team used headsets in training drills, raising accusations of ""brain doping"".

And then came the inevitable backlash. Sceptics started to wonder if this was all a bit too good to be true. Soon a wave of studies began to debunk the previous glut of hopeful findings: one group electrically stimulated a cadaver and concluded that it was pseudoscientific bullshit; a meta-analysis followed - and concluded that if you averaged out all the effects, you'd end up with nothing.

But if electric medicine was quackery, why did it still seem to work across such a wide swathe of ailments? I couldn't get the question out of my system: what was the relationship between electricity and biology? If this technology worked, I had no idea how. So I decided to work it out. I've spent the last 10 years of my life being electrified by these questions and their answers.

A natural electric current courses through all living things, underpinning their every move and intention. It predates nervous systems and even humanity itself; it animated the bodies of our ancestors long before the first fishy mutants even squelched on to dry land. It is the most ancient thing about us. It is among the most ancient things about life itself. We are fundamentally electrical creatures, but the full extent of our electrification would shock you. This is not the electricity that comes from a battery or the kind that turns on the lights and powers the dishwasher. That kind of electricity is made of electrons, which are
negatively charged particles flowing in a current.

The human body runs on a very different version: bioelectricity. Instead of electrons, these currents are created by the movements of mostly positively charged ions, such as potassium, sodium and calcium.

Every one of the 40 trillion cells in your body is its own little battery with its own little voltage. When a nerve impulse comes roaring down a nerve fibre, channels open in the neuron and millions of ions get instantly sucked through them, taking all their charge with them. The electrical field generated by this mass migration of charge works out to about 1m volts per metre, which at that scale would feel like passing an entire bolt of lightning from one of your outstretched hands to the other.

That's what it feels like to be every neuron in your body. This is how all signals travel within the brain and between it and every organ in the body via the nervous system. It's fundamental to our ability to think and talk and walk and why our knee hurts after a fall, and why the scraped skin heals. It's what makes gummy bears taste sour. It's how we knew we were thirsty.

But bioelectricity isn't confined to the nervous system. Over the past couple of decades it has become clear that these signals are pressed into service by every cell in your body, not just those that govern your perception and motion. Each of your skin cells has its own voltage, which it combines with neighbouring cells to generate an electrical field. That tingling when you bite your tongue or the inside of your cheek? It's the wound current, calling to the surrounding tissue to send help. Similarly, the cells in your bones are electric. Your teeth are electric. Your organs are electric - and so is the coat of epithelial tissue that hugs each one. Blood cells, too.

Recently it has been discovered that electrical signals also send out beacons as we grow in the womb to guide us into the eventual shape we will take. And what it gives us at birth, it can take away to cause our death: cancer cells have their own unusual voltage, and recent evidence indicates that it marks a sharp departure from the kind that healthy cells use to form the co-operating society of the body. Disrupting these errant signals could keep cancer cells from metastasising.

Nor is this natural electricity confined to us animals - the same signals have been detected in everything from algae to E coli, from fungi to bacteria. Every living thing is literally electric. When our cellular battery runs out, we all die. So what if we learned how to control the switch?

If you still can't quite get your head around this, you are not alone. The entire history of bioelectricity has been marked - and in some ways defined - by the scepticism levelled at the researchers from both the physics and biology establishment.

Even today, many biologists probably don't know the whole story of bioelectricity. In 1995, when Mustafa Djamgoz, a cancer researcher at Imperial College London, first proposed his theory that electrical signals were involved in cancer, his colleagues openly dismissed his ideas. Though cancer bioelectricity it now the subject of growing international attention, Djamgoz still finds himself re-explaining his research.

This reflects a set of calcified notions embedded in the framework of science: biologists stick to biology, leaving the study of electricity to the physicists and engineers. They just don't speak the same language. ""If you major in biology, you get maybe half a semester of physics, if that,"" says physicist and biologist Richard Nuccitelli. ""You don't even touch electrical engineering.""

This tacit assumption that each field should ""stay in their lane"" has been putting limitations both on biology and scientific advancement for decades. What we need is a new framework to bring the body's different electrical parameters under one roof and study them coherently, together.

Call it the ""electrome"". The identification of the genome and microbiome proved crucial steps to understanding the full complexity of biology, but some scientists think it's now time to plot the outlines of the electrome: the electrical dimensions and properties of cells, the tissues they collaborate to form, and the electrical forces that are turning out to be involved in every aspect of life.

Just as decoding the genome led us to the rules by which information like eye colour is encoded in our DNA, bioelectricity researchers predict that decoding the electrome will help us to decipher our body's multilayered communications systems and give us a way to control them. Researchers are looking for precise ways to flip the circuits inside our cells that are responsible for everything from healing to regeneration to memory.

Restoring cancer cells' electrical signatures to their healthy state has reversed tumours in tadpole experiments. Other investigations indicate that certain patterns of electrical activity in the brain form specific sensory experiences, and that these may be recorded and overwritten - raising the possibility of advanced prosthetics that
a person can feel as fully as they can feel the skin they were born with.

If we are truly electric, then we should all be programmable at the level of the cell. But what will happen when we begin to use our knowledge of the electrome to get better grades instead of treat cancer? The gene-editing technology Crispr ushered in a flurry of worries about designer babies, and our ability to edit the bioelectric code may raise similar fears. In one study, a simple tweak to the electrome caused functional eyes to grow on a frog's butt, and in another prompted a worm to grow two heads.

There is a clear relationship between our electrome and the shape our bodies take - from frogs to worms to humans - so we need to do much more research before someone figures out how to grow themselves a third eye as a social media stunt. More worryingly, bioelectricity research could all too easily be misappropriated by that vague but undeniable urge to see humans as occupiers of inferior bodies that could only be improved by the addition and substitution of hardware and software.

So what limitations should we place on upgrading or altering humans? Who will govern the rules on remapping the body's electrical wiring? What if every country's department of defence put their soldiers through the same training I had done in California?

If we are going to try to manipulate the human body, the least we can do is manipulate it on its own terms - terms that were honed by millions of years of evolution. A glut of new observational tools has brought us to a new understanding of bioelectricity. ""With bioelectricity, we are now at the point where astronomy was when Galileo invented the telescope,"" says Djamgoz.

The 19th century was often referred to as the ""electric century""; the 21st century could be bioelectric.

Hylton Murray-Philipson says he contributed to gathering in Brazil because of growing climate threat

A last-minute personal donation from a climate-concerned British farmer enabled the meeting of hundreds of Brazil's Indigenous people to go ahead in the Amazon rainforest last week.

Hylton Murray-Philipson, an Eton-educated landowner from Leicestershire, covered a gap in funding of more than £100,000 after another sponsor pulled out of the gathering, which was called by the Kayapo chief Raoni Metuktire.

Murray-Philipson said the amount was 10 times more than he had ever given in a single charitable donation before, but he felt this was necessary to respond to the growing threat of climate breakdown.

""We're in an emergency and we need to act appropriately,"" he told the Guardian during the meeting of hundreds of forest guardians in PiaraÃ§u village. ""People with money need to react to the level of concern we have now globally.""

His decision was shaped by worsening signs of climate instability, he said: the world's hottest month in recorded history, evacuations caused by forest fires in southern Europe, devastating droughts in Uruguay, shockingly low records of Antarctic ice and growing fears for harvests in many countries.

He compared the threat to that of Nazi Germany at the start of the second world war, when his family accepted that the railings outside their home could be ripped up and melted into bullets. Today, he said, sacrifices and support needed to be focused on the fight against carbon emissions and destruction of the environment.

""The world needs Indigenous people as never before,"" he said. ""We should be grateful to them. They teach us that the Amazon is not just a store of carbon, it is one of the great rainfall-making machines in the world. Without that, there will be more drought and worse soil. I am a farmer. I know what that means.""

Murray-Philipson is the grandson of a Conservative MP and a former investment banker who opened the Brazil office for Morgan Grenfell. More recently, he worked for King Charles's Rainforest Project, and introduced Raoni to the then prince at Clarence House. He is chair of the trustees of the environmental group Global Canopy, which also contributed to the event along with the British embassy.

He has stepped up his environmental work since the pandemic, when he spent several days on a respirator and nearly died of Covid. Combined with his Christian faith and awareness of the climate risks, this experience had changed his priorities, he said. ""My fund manager tells me that his job is to take me out of a mini and to put me into a Rolls-Royce. I tell him: ""˜What is the point of that if it is just to drive off a cliff?'""

His private contribution helped pay for three meals a day and logistical support for hundreds of participants at the meeting, which aims to amplify the voice of forest people who have the best proven record of maintaining forests and protecting biodiversity.

""What needs to happen urgently is for Indigenous people to be given a seat at the top table,"" he said. ""This decade is absolutely crucial.""

821,"""˜Brands to avoid': Mars and Cadbury among chocolate firms criticised in ethics report","https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/dec/02/brands-to-avoid-mars-cadbury-chocolate-firms-criticised-ethics-report","""˜Brands to avoid': Mars and Cadbury among chocolate firms criticised in ethics report

Only 17 out of 82 companies investigated were found to use suppliers that paid cocoa farmers enough to live on.

Leading chocolate brands have been criticised for having ""inadequate"" ethical standards in their cocoa supply chain in a report from Ethical Consumer. Only 17 out of 82 brands investigated by the consumer organisation were judged to be using chocolate from suppliers that ensured farmers were paid enough to live on.

As a result, there is a risk that Advent calendars, chocolate Santas and other Christmas treats will have been produced with child labour. About 60% of the world's cocoa comes from west Africa, and about six in 10 cocoa-growing households in Ghana are estimated to use child labour, with four in 10 in Ivory Coast.

Ethical Consumer recommended Tony's Chocolonely, Divine and Chocolat Madagascar among the brands which paid Fairtrade International or Rainforest Alliance rates or higher, and use chocolate made in the country of origin rather than from imported beans. That helps the economies of cocoa-producing countries rather than European manufacturers.

It rated Mars, NestlÃ© and MondelÄ“z, which owns Cadbury, as poor and ""brands to avoid"", while Ferrero was rated poor.

Each has a sustainability scheme, but the researchers said that these schemes ""tend to cover just a proportion of the company's cocoa suppliers"", which means that some farmers do not benefit.

Last year, Channel 4's Dispatches found that 10-year-old children were using machetes to harvest cocoa destined for MondelÄ“z's supply chain.

The 82 brands were also measured on tax conduct, use of palm oil, deforestation and plastic and packaging.

Jasmine Owens at Ethical Consumer said: ""The chocolate industry is incredibly unequal, with many cocoa farmers living in poverty while international chocolate companies are raking in billions of pounds.

""Most of the world's chocolate is grown in west Africa, and the conditions for farmers are in general really appalling. But it's European and UK consumers who eat most of it. So we really do have a huge amount of power and responsibility over conditions for farmers in west Africa because we're the reason why they're harvesting the cocoa.""

Owens said that buying chocolate from brands such as Fairafric, '57 Chocolate and Chocolat Madagascar was expensive and could be hard to get hold of but they were good ""as a treat or a present"", while Tony's Chocolonely was widely available in supermarkets and ""really trying to change the chocolate industry"".

Joke Aerts, of Tony's Open Chain, the company's supply chain platform, said it was trying ""to put human rights at the core of purchasing practices"" by using traceable cocoa beans, paying the living income reference price (the amount a typical farmer needs to make to be able to live), helping farming co-ops to become more professional, working with them for at least five-year periods, and helping farmers improve crop yields so they had less incentive to clear land to plant more cacao trees.

A report by the National Opinion Research Centre at the University of Chicago in 2020 found that 43% of children living in cocoa-growing areas in Ghana and Ivory Coast were engaged in hazardous child labour, amounting to about 1.56 million children.

Often these children are taken out of school to work on the farm by their parents, according to Katie Bird of the International Cocoa Initiative, a nonprofit working to end child labour and forced labour in cocoa. ""Farmer poverty is a significant contributing factor,"" she said. ""There is a role for the cocoa industry, quite clearly, but also for governments in cocoa-producing countries, civil society organisations, producers themselves and a role for cocoa-consuming countries as well."" That means also ensuring access to good quality schooling, healthcare and helping farmers diversify.

Ghana and Ivory Coast have laws against child labour, and police patrol some plantations. Yet the size of the cocoa-growing areas makes them hard to police, according to Mike Rogerson, a lecturer in operations management at Sussex University and an expert on modern slavery in supply chains.

""Cocoa prices are set globally, annually, and they always disappoint everyone that follows these negotiations except the four largest companies using cocoa,"" said Rogerson. ""Companies not paying a proper price effectively means that parents can't afford to make a living and look after the family on their own.""

He said it was hard for companies to track where their cocoa had come from because farmers sometimes sell beans to each other, since cocoa is typically traded in 50kg bags, and beans are often mixed in different processing centres. It would cost the industry about £4m a year to trace cocoa beans using their DNA, he said, but so far there has been little interest in the technology from any chocolate company.

MondelÄ“z did not respond directly but referred to its sustainability report which said it aims to source all of its chocolate through its Cocoa Life programme by 2025 and increase the number of farmers in the programme to 300,000 by 2030.

A NestlÃ© spokesperson said: ""We believe that Ethical Consumer's assessment of our approach does not reflect the comprehensive detail we provided about our work, and therefore does not represent the extent of our efforts to sustainability source cocoa for our products.

""At NestlÃ©, we have pioneered industry-leading projects and initiatives to further improve the sustainable sourcing of cocoa for our products and to help improve farmers' livelihoods.""

NestlÃ© runs an ""income accelerator programme"" with 10,000 farm families in Ivory Coast, allowing them to earn up to â‚¬500 extra a year for two years, and aims to reach 160,000 families by 2030.

A Ferrero spokesperson said: ""Our cocoa is 100% sourced through independently managed standards such as Rainforest Alliance, Fairtrade Foundation and Cocoa Horizons.""

Ferrero said it worked with farmer groups on improving livelihoods by increasing cocoa productivity and diversifying, and supporting the wellbeing of women and children and the environment.

""We committed to paying the Living Income Differential, which we support, and we also pay all farmers a cash premium on top of the commercial price,"" the company said.

""Ferrero remains committed to its cocoa sustainability programme to achieve a positive and lasting impact on the cocoa value chain.""

A spokesperson for Mars said: ""Our ambition is that 100% of our cocoa is responsibly sourced globally and is traceable by 2025 - going beyond the current level of certification standards and practices and committing us to action across three focus areas that puts farmers, communities and the environment at the centre of our efforts.

""We're taking concrete action to make a difference in cocoa growing communities, which is why we launched our Cocoa for Generations strategy in 2018 - a farmer-first initiative, backed by a billion-dollar investment over 10-years, that addresses farmer income and welfare in a multifaceted way because it is proven that pricing alone isn't the answer.""

826,"Climate-resistant grapes? Spanish winemakers revive ancient varieties","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/28/canary-coalmine-spanish-winemakers-climate-threat-grape-varieties","Climate-resistant grapes? Spanish winemakers revive ancient varieties

Forgotten grape varieties offer adaptation hope for an industry particularly sensitive to change

The ads - tucked in the corners of local newspapers and directed at winemakers - began turning up across Catalonia in the 1980s. ""If you know where to find any uncommon grape varieties, please get in touch,"" they read.

Dozens of tips came pouring in, shepherding Miguel A Torres in his search for long-forgotten wine grapes. But it wouldn't be until a decade later, as the climate crisis began wreaking havoc on vines, that the fourth-generation winemaker realised his foray into the past could play a key role in tackling what lies ahead.

""I simply wanted to recover the heritage - the ancient traditions and vines - left to us by our ancestors,"" said Torres, the president of Familia Torres winery. ""And then we realised that some of these varieties take longer to ripen, meaning they might be able to help us in a warming world.""

It was a glimmer of hope as the wine industry grapples with a changing climate. Extreme weather, drought and steadily rising temperatures have laid bare a crop that is extremely sensitive to change. In Spain, rising temperatures have meant grapes ripening more quickly, leaving winemakers rushing to harvest in hopes of protecting the carefully concocted balance between the fruit's sugars and acidity.

""Climate change is the worst threat the sector has ever faced,"" said Torres. ""In the 19th century we had the phylloxera plague that wiped out vineyards across Europe. This is much worse.""

As winemakers across Spain and around the world scramble to cope, they've increasingly looked to the past, resurrecting late-ripening and heat-tolerant varieties they might have shunned decades earlier.

In California, vintners are embracing grapes such as mourtaou, a nearly extinct variety from south-western France, to create peppery reds, while some in France's Cognac region are toppling more than a century of tradition to trial climate-resistant grapes. In Bordeaux, concerns about the climate crisis recently helped to secure the approval of six new grape varieties, including castets, a disease-resistant variety that had been on the brink of disappearing.

The reasons these grapes fell into disuse varies widely, said JosÃ© Miguel MartÃ­nez Zapater, the director of the Institute of Grapevine and Wine Sciences in La Rioja. Some were abandoned in the late 19th century as the phylloxera plague forced European grape growers to chase efficiency, while others were discarded as winemakers sought to comply with strictly defined appellations or consumer preferences for certain grapes.

MartÃ­nez Zapater's publicly funded institute is one of several across Spain that have been peering into the past to bolster wine grape diversity - a years-long process that involves identifying the varieties, testing out their characteristics and seeking official approval for their use.

Their efforts have helped boost the number of commercially registered varieties in Spain by 50% in the past two decades, said MartÃ­nez Zapater. ""In other words, people are finding varieties in different areas that they consider interesting.""

In Spain - home to a â‚¬5bn-a-year wine production industry whose production outpaced all other EU countries in 2021 - much is on the line. Last year, the country experienced its hottest year since record-keeping began; since 2015 the country has sweltered through four of its hottest years on record.

At the Agrarian Technological Institute of Castilla y Leon, known as ITACyL in Spanish, two decades of research have led to the recovery of more than a dozen varieties of grapes. The list includes estaladiÃ±a, a grape whose last recorded reference stretches back to 1914, and cenicienta, a grape close to extinction before it was revived to make fruity reds.

""The wines they make are very distinct and interesting,"" said JosÃ© Antonio Rubio Cano, who heads the viticulture and woody crop department at the institute. ""They're surprising and different from anything else.""

after newsletter promotion

He stressed, however, that the embrace of these long-overlooked varieties is just part of the broader efforts needed as the industry adapts to a changing climate. ""There's no one solution,"" said Rubio Cano. ""It has to be a set of things; we have to pay more attention to the vines, be more aware of how their fruits are ripening and we need to develop a deeper understanding of the vineyard and the different varieties.""

Against the backdrop of north-western Spain's rolling green hills, the CaserÃ­o de DueÃ±as vineyard is taking the institute's research to the next level, planting hectares of eight of the recovered varieties to test out how the grapes behave in a real-world scenario.

""I find it super-interesting,"" said Almudena Alberca, the technical director for Entrecanales Domecq, the vineyard's owner. ""The possibilities are endless.""

Alberca, who in 2018 became Spain's first female master of wine, waved off concerns that the new varieties could challenge the characteristics that have come to define Spanish wine regions. ""I think these varieties are going to provide support, as something we can blend into our wines,"" she said. ""Right now, a whole world of possibilities is opening up and we'll see down the road where we need to go.""

Four decades after Torres placed his first ad seeking forgotten grapes, Familia Torres has begun releasing small quantities of wines made from the fruits of his quest, such as forcada and pirene. The wines tell a story that is both steeped in the past and nods at the enormous challenge that lies ahead as the climate crisis tightens its grip, said Torres.

""I've always said that the wine sector is the canary in the coalmine,"" he added. ""The consequences that vineyards are living through right now should make everyone take notice.""

While the world becomes drier, profit and pollution are draining our resources. We have to change our approach

During the summer months in the Oxfordshire town where I live, I go swimming in the nearby 50-metre lido. With my inelegantly slow breaststroke, from time to time I accidentally gulp some of the pool's opulent, chlorine-clean 5.9m litres of water. Sometimes, I swim while it's raining, when fewer people brave it, alone in my lane with the strangely comforting feeling of having water above and below me. I stand a bottle of water at the end of the lane, to drink from halfway through my swim. I normally have a shower afterwards, even if I've showered that morning. I live a wet, drenched, quenched existence. But, as I discovered, this won't last. I am living on borrowed time and borrowed water.

Water stolen from nature, drained from rivers and lakes and returned polluted, allows me to live this way. It will have to stop - not through some altruistic hand-wringing desire to do better, but because even in England this amount of water will soon be unavailable. Like many parts of the world, we are now using more water than we can sustainably supply. As surface water and groundwater levels dwindle year by year, a crisis awaits. It's simple maths. Demand is outstripping supply.

Little old England manages to encompass many global water problems - scarcity, overabstraction, pollution, underinvestment, government and regulatory failings, environmental degradation and corporate misconduct - all within the confines of one small country in the far west of Europe.

The UK's average annual rainfall is about 1,100mm, compared with less than 300mm in Pakistan or double figures in Egypt. However, despite our winter storms, significant parts of the UK are staring down the barrel of empty water butts. Much of that four-figure rainfall average is propped up by the rainy Highlands of Scotland, Wales and northern England. In south-east England, where I live, the average annual rainfall lingers about 600 mm - comparable with Lebanon or Kenya, and drier than Sydney, Australia. This also happens to be the UK's most populated area, with about 18 million inhabitants packed into just 19,000 sq km, including London's 1,500 sq km. And it's drying up, fast. Government figures show that, in England, 28% of groundwater aquifers, the layers of porous sand and rock that hold water underground, and up to 18% of rivers and reservoirs, have more water taken out than is put back in. This is clearly unsustainable.

Not a single one of England's rivers is classified as being in good ecological health - this includes chalk streams, a delicate habitat almost entirely unique to England. However, much of the public remains oblivious to a problem that we are all, at least in part, responsible for causing. More than half of the freshwater abstracted in the UK is for household use. The average British resident happily uses 153l of water a day, through showers, toilets, dishwashers, washing machines and garden hoses. Yet climate-change projections show that dry summers in England will increase by up to 50%, with the amount of water available reduced by at least 10-15%.

Freshwater shortages, once considered a local issue, are increasingly a global risk. In every annual risk report since 2012, the World Economic Forum has included water crisis as one of the top-five risks to the global economy. Half of the global population - almost 4 billion people - live in areas with severe water scarcity for at least one month of the year, while half a billion people face severe water scarcity all year round.

There's only ever the same, finite amount of water churning around in our water cycle. Every drop of water on Earth has been here since the beginning of time, constantly recycled. Up to 60% of the adult human body is water (even bone is a surprisingly splashy 31%). When you die and are cremated or buried, that water will be released again, to the atmosphere or the earth. We are as intimately connected to the water cycle as rivers and lakes are.

Yet, from the Yellow River in China to the Colorado River in the United States, many rivers no longer reach the sea. Often artificially straightened and dammed, water is sucked out and channelled off to supply farms, industries and households. Great lakes, from the Aral Sea in central Asia to Lake Urmia in Iran, have nearly disappeared. Groundwater aquifers, from the Ogallala and Central Valley in the US to India's Upper Ganges and Pakistan's Lower Indus, are being depleted faster than they can refill. The remaining freshwater is increasingly polluted with sewage and fertilisers, causing algal blooms that smother and choke ecosystems.

According to Torgny Holmgren, executive director at the Stockholm International Water Institute, ""If these trends continue, we will need 50% more water in 2050 compared with 20 years ago. And, of course, that is impossible, because water is a finite resource ""¦ This will impact all of us.""

Covid brought water issues into sharper focus. ""It's not like Covid woke us up to the need for water for hygiene; we already knew that,"" Gary White, CEO of Water.org, told me. ""But I certainly think we hadn't seen the lack of access to water and sanitation as a global crisis before. When somebody [being unable to] wash their hands in one country becomes the critical link to the spread of disease, then suddenly water and hygiene becomes a global risk."" In June 2021, Mami Mizutori, the UN secretary general's special representative for disaster risk reduction, said: ""Drought is on the verge of becoming the next pandemic, and there is no vaccine to cure it.""

The good and bad news is that water crises are usually caused by human mismanagement, not climate. But, as climate breakdown bites, precipitation patterns change and climate refugees are forced to move, the timeframe to get our act together is becoming ever shorter. We are currently using up the water sources on which our very existence relies. We can continue doing that until the very last drop. Or we can decide to change our approach before it's too late. The world isn't running out of water - people are.

The UK's Waterwise annual conference in 2019 was a niche water efficiency conference in London, attended by a small cadre of water industry types. But it made national news. Sir James Bevan, then chief executive of the Environment Agency, had heavily altered the prepared speech he had been given. An expected tame welcoming address instead became known as the ""Jaws of Death"" speech. As his audience shifted uncomfortably in their seats and a handful of trade journalists suddenly woke up, he said: ""The jaws of death is the point at which, unless we take action to change things, we will not have enough water to supply our needs ""¦ many parts of our country will face significant water deficits by 2050.""

The water-abstraction system his agency oversees was ""designed more than 50 years ago, for a world with less environmental protection, less demand for water and no awareness of climate change"". Just as important as new infrastructure was changing human behaviour: ""We need water wastage to be as socially unacceptable as blowing smoke in the face of a baby."" The industry audience didn't know whether to whoop or weep.

On 9 July 2020, the public accounts committee countered that all the bodies responsible for the UK's water supply - the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the Water Services Regulation Authority (Ofwat) and Bevan's Environment Agency (EA) - had ""taken their eye off the ball"" and must take urgent action to ensure a reliable water supply. The committee's chair, Meg Hillier MP, said: ""It is very hard to imagine, in this country, turning on the tap and not having enough clean, drinkable water come out - but that is exactly what we now face ""¦ Defra has failed to lead and water companies have failed to act.""

Without significant action, the National Audit Office (NAO) forecasts that the total water demand will start to exceed supply in England no later than 2034. However, water companies have already been abstracting (extracting) too much water, leading to environmental degradation and the disappearance of rivers, including the internationally unique chalk streams of the south-east. A reduction of 480m litres a day is needed by 2045 just to lower existing groundwater abstraction to sustainable levels. Something, or someone, has to give, or the UK's water supply will run out within a decade.

Part of England's problem goes back to its unique system of private water companies being handed state monopolies. Prior to 1989, water supply was publicly owned, like it is everywhere else in the world. But Margaret Thatcher put a stop to that. In 1989, the 10 water authorities spanning England and Wales had their assets and personnel transferred into limited companies and floated on the London Stock Exchange. Today, almost everyone in England and Wales receives their water and sewerage services from the same 11 water and sewerage companies and six water-only companies (with some specific areas served by small limited companies). Each has its own fiefdom on the map, with no competition, run for private profit; you are obliged to sign up to your regional supplier.

The Water Act 1989 also removed previous restrictions on the statutory financial amounts water companies could borrow or pay as dividends. To protect the interests of customers and the environment, however, privatisation was coupled with regulatory oversight, most notably from the EA, the Drinking Water Inspectorate and Ofwat. Because of the lack of competition, Ofwat sets limits on the price water companies in England and Wales can charge. And, to ensure that those companies don't just snaffle the cash and let the infrastructure they inherited fall to ruin, every five years the water companies must also submit statutory water-resources management plans setting out their intended investment approach for the next 25 years. Despite this, a fair amount of cash-snaffling still goes on. A 2017 study by the University of Greenwich found that water-company shareholders had received a total of £56bn since privatisation, with some water CEOs on £2m annual salaries.

By 2018, the then leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, was calling for the water companies to be renationalised. Even the incumbent secretary of state for Defra, Conservative MP Michael Gove, attacked the water companies for ""playing the system for the benefit of wealthy managers and owners, at the expense of consumers and the environment"", and suggested that they had ""shielded themselves from scrutiny, hidden behind complex financial structures, avoided paying taxes, have rewarded the already well-off, kept charges higher than they needed to be and allowed leaks, pollution and other failures to persist for far too long"". In cash terms, more than £18.1bn was paid out to shareholders of the nine largest water companies between 2007 and 2016, accounting for 95% of profits.

Australian infrastructure firm Macquarie owned Thames Water between 2007 and 2017, leaving it with £2bn of debt, while paying its investors, according to one analysis, on average between 15.5% and 19% in dividends a year. Instead of making changes to a system that was supporting such poor levels of investment, in August 2021, Ofwat approved a new £1bn equity takeover of Southern Water. The new owner was Macquarie.

Unlike the relatively high rainfall of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, England's water situation is surprisingly perilous. London only has 90 days of water storage at any one time. A water industry insider told me that in 2012, shortly before the Olympics, the capital came within days of exceeding that tally. If it had, Thames Water would have been forced to cut supply to households and install public standpipes. That situation - dubbed ""Day Zero"" when Cape Town, South Africa, faced the same predicament in 2018 - remains a serious possibility.

Andrew Tucker, water efficiency manager at Thames Water, tells me bluntly that, in London and the south-east, ""we basically don't have enough product, going forward. Ultimately, we will need to bring new water supply into the system ""¦ All water companies in the UK rely on winter rainfall to recharge these systems ""¦ If we don't get that winter recharge, it just drops and keeps on dropping, because our raw water storage [reservoirs] is actually quite small.""

Tucker is Australian and says mates back home find it funny that England can have a water problem, given its wet reputation. ""We do get a lot of grey days. But grey doesn't mean rain. Even drizzle doesn't mean rain."" He gives me a quiz question: ""Which Australian state capital city gets more rain on average every year than London?"" I guess Sydney. ""They all do.""

There are several reasons for England's comparative lack of water storage, Tucker says. First, ""every square inch of land has been used pretty intensively for the last thousand years and there's not much room to play with"". Second, the south-east is relatively flat, with no valleys to dam. Third, we have a population poorly educated in the need for water saving or living with drought. And water is too cheap - or at least not valued. When we speak, Thames Water's combined water supply and wastewater charge is about £2.20 per 1,000l. ""You pay the same for one litre of water at WH Smith at the train station,"" he says.

Tucker argues that education and cultural awareness are even greater drivers of water efficiency than price, though. He says they are trying to advocate the introduction of water-use restrictions, like in Australia, so ""it becomes a cultural thing"". He notes that, in England, companies are ""crucified in the media"" for suggesting ways the public can reduce seasonal demand. When I suggest that, after months of heavy winter rain, the public perception is, ""Well, why wasn't that banked somewhere?"", he quickly interjects: ""There is no bank. We want a bank. We've been prevented from getting a bank for 20 years.""

Thames Water estimates that by 2045, it will need to find an extra 350m litres of water supply a day. The ""bank"" that they've wanted for 20 years is the long-planned but never built Abingdon reservoir. First proposed by Thames Water in 2006, it would be the largest major reservoir built in southern England since Rutland Water in 1976, and capable of supplying their entire shortfall with one big project.

The problem is, as Tucker identified, the region has no valleys to flood. The site near Abingdon, Oxfordshire, is perfectly flat, fertile farmland. The only way to build is up - what's known as a ""bunded reservoir"" - and Thames Water wants a 150bn-litre capacity, which could take nine years to build, according to local campaigners, covering more than 6sq km of land, with built-up banks 30 metres high - making it the largest bunded reservoir in the world. This wouldn't just be a blot on the landscape, it would be the landscape.

A public inquiry in 2010 produced a 326-page report concluding that the Abingdon reservoir proposal did not meet the statutory requirements and that a reservoir of that size was not justified by the evidence. That didn't stop Thames Water from putting it - with minor tweaks and changes - into every five-year management plan since. Now rebranded the South East Strategic Reservoir Option, as a joint proposal between Thames Water and Affinity Water (supplier of drinking water to the south-east, owned by various fund managers), it looks likely to finally go ahead.

England does need more water storage - and London's 90-day supply is clearly untenable with dry summers set to increase. But does it need a giant sledge-hammer solution to land in rural Oxfordshire? Or, as local campaigners the Group Against Reservoir Development argue, are there myriad other, less damaging, options on the table? One of which is the storage beneath our feet.

Regenerative agriculture, a system that works without ploughing, has begun to attract attention in places as far-flung as the US, Australia and the UK. The idea of the ""no-till"" method is to prevent soil disturbance at all costs. Tilling (another term for ploughing) is ""like a tornado coming through an ecosystem"", explains Evan Wiig, a former rancher who now promotes regenerative farming for the Community Alliance With Family Farmers. The plough destroys the connections between ""the fungi, the nematodes, the earthworms, all of that subterranean ecosystem. The more you can keep that intact, the better water-holding capacity you have."" Healthy soil is a sponge of crisscrossing roots, wormholes and mycorrhizal fungi, all of which retains moisture, maintains nutrients and captures carbon. You also find healthy, recharged aquifers beneath.

Unlike in the western US, where artificial irrigation is necessary, farming in the UK is almost entirely rainfed. But the rains are becoming less and less reliable. James Alexander's family has been farming in Oxfordshire for generations. ""There's no seasons any more,"" he said. ""For the last three years, we've just had wet and dry. It does get a little colder in the winter, but not like it used to ""¦ the last two winters have been two of the wettest on record, but actually that rain's only fallen in about six weeks.""

It was May when I visited in 2021, and he asked, rhetorically: ""Remember April showers? We only had 2mm of rain last month."" That's why he now prefers no-till farming. He described conventionally ploughed fields as containing ""sad soil"", simply a dead growing medium to hold the plants upright; many litres of pesticide and fertiliser need to be sprayed to grow anything in it. The topsoil also compacts under the constant heavy machinery, forming a hard cap layer, causing nearby roads to turn into muddy streams with each significant rainfall.

Out on the no-till field, meanwhile, his boots never get muddy. The soil forms an intricate sponge that soaks up water, both delivering it down to the groundwater and maintaining moisture for the crops. The undisturbed mycelial fungal network has been found to supply 80% of a crop's nitrogen requirements and up to 100% of its phosphorus requirements, and to provide water to crops in times of drought.

We gain underground water storage too. And not just a marginal gain. Water supply, and water storage, all comes down to capturing rainfall - and there is no greater surface area in England than farmland. Jake Rigg, then director of corporate affairs and communities at Affinity Water, in the east of England, told me he had asked an agricultural research institute to establish how much more water can go to the natural underground aquifer using no-till techniques. ""And they said, ""˜You're talking about having an Abingdon reservoir-sized amount of extra water in the aquifer'."" Such a volume would, in effect, solve England's water-scarcity problem. Without, by the way, having to build the Abingdon reservoir.

On England's south coast, Southern Water are now paying farmers to leave crops on their fields over winter, rather than bare, tilled earth - financially incentivising no-till farming. This is not only for the groundwater-recharge benefits, but also to reduce nitrates from conventional farming leaching into the groundwater and rivers. Robin Kelly, catchment risk management officer at Southern Water, told me that ""nitrate concentrations in many of our groundwater sources are high and rising, and it is this trend we are focusing on and trying to reverse. The results clearly show a benefit of having continuous green cover over the winter."" In the first year of the scheme, farmers near Brighton were offered £35 per hectare of overwinter cover crops. In some regions, this has since increased to £109/ha. The simple calculation is that it's more expensive for water companies to treat the water than it is to pay the farmers not to pollute it in the first place.

We can all do our bit to capture the rain. While the average Briton uses more than 150l a day, performance artist Chloe Whipple spent a year living on just 15l of mains water a day. Key to her success - which began via a project matching local artists with scientists, and paired her with Exeter University's water expert Dr Peter Melville-Shreeve - was rainwater. A small grant helped her to get a 200l rainwater butt plumbed into her toilet. Collected rainwater was counted as free to use. And it changed her relationship with the rain for ever.

Despite living on the relatively dry south coast, ""there is so much rainfall,"" Whipple says. ""I mean, obviously, there's more and more dry periods now. But there's so much that we could be harvesting and storing."" You might think, then, that Whipple's message would be that everyone should do more to reduce their personal water use. It is partly that. But her main message is quite different. ""I feel like, a lot of the time, the onus is on us as individuals to completely change our behaviour, and buy all the stuff we need to be self-sufficient - that it's our sole responsibility ""¦ When really it's a much bigger picture.""

Melville-Shreeve has tried to engage housing developers and water companies with large-scale rollouts of domestic rainwater capture, only to be frustrated; Whipple, too, sees a lack of engagement from the very authorities tasked with averting the coming water crisis. ""There's just literally no one making decisions for the long term, it's so shortsighted,"" she says.

The waste that happens in our water systems, the pollution of our rivers, the leakages in the underground pipes, the building codes that allow developers to build water- inefficient houses: all that happens before we even turn a tap on. The wastage, the 150l a day, is built into the system. There is a lot we can do as individuals, but those things almost all boil down to water-efficient appliances, rainwater capture and greywater recycling, all of which could and should be integral to water company practices and building regulations. In Belgium, for example, you don't consider installing a rainwater-capture tank in a newbuild home - you have to.

Should we all be showering with buckets by our feet to capture the water and reuse? It's not a bad idea. In parts of the world that have experienced water rationing, such as Cape Town, and mining towns in Australia, it remains a common practice - once you've lived it, the lessons tend to stick. But the bigger wins are to be found in changing water company practices through regulation, and incentivising new farming practices through education and compensation: Defra's environmental land-management services payments can incentivise regenerative and cover-crop farming methods, and compensate for the restoration of floodplains. This should include beaver reintroductions, which have been found to regenerate and restore rivers and wetlands.

We canalised our rivers, drained our land, overpumped our groundwater, dried our wetlands, burned our peat, killed off our keystone species, all in the belief that modern engineering had decoupled us from our dependence on the natural system. It was always hubris. The climate crisis hasn't caused the water crisis we now face, it has simply shone a punishing, unyielding light on it. The answers, from Abingdon to Accra to Amman, lie in holding on to the rain that falls on the land. And nature does this best of all. Now our engineered systems must work with nature, not against it.

Some rural women could find a way through the challenges brought by climate crisis, inequality and conflict by cultivating fungi in the former Marxist state

At the forest's edge, a scientist is giving a lesson on the mushrooms that grow here in the damp ground around the trees of Toui-Kilibo reserve in Benin. Olyvia Fadeyi is a mycologist - she studies fungi - and is teaching the women from the village of Yaoui how best to harness the economic value of this strangest of crops. Mushrooms can be cultivated year round, in back gardens, on vertically stacked shelves, rather than waiting for the naturally abundant ones in the rainy season.

""There are 40 species, of which only 2% are currently harvested,"" says Fadeyi. ""I want to empower these women and help them break free from the pressures of society.""

The mushroom could be important if it can bring in money to rural communities where the pressures are many: from climate crisis and gender inequalities to the potential spread of the jihadist attacks in the far north. Since late 2021 there have been 28 attacks in Benin by extremist Islamist groups involved in the conflict across the borders with Burkina Faso and Niger. Most have occurred in Pendjari national park, known for its lions and hippos but now patrolled by Benin's military and a no-go area for civilians.

The spread of conflict in the Sahel region depends on the recruitment of disaffected men who have few economic options. Women having livelihoods and income is an important alternative for husbands or male family members who might be otherwise be drawn to groups such as the al-Qaida-affiliated Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen.

Benin is a country developing in real-time. President Patrice Talon is using investment from raised taxes and international development organisations to build roads, put in place street lighting and create a cultural tourism project with new museums and galleries celebrating Benin's history.

But opportunities for women in areas away from the urban hubs are few. Just 13% of women in Benin own land and 30% marry before the age of 18, according to a UN report. Fadeyi is offering an intriguing alternative. Grown indoors, in high concentration, mushrooms can mitigate a little of the damage done by slash-and-burn deforestation, which farmers carry out to clear plantations for crops such as cashews.

""Women are expected to work and earn money,"" says Fadeyi. ""But what they earn from farming is not enough, and the money they do earn they are expected to give to their husbands.""

Albertine Doussoumon and her mother, Rosaline Chabi, are two of 180 women from three villages taking part in Fadeyi's pilot project, overseen by the University of Parakou.

""We women make money from gathering firewood and collecting sand for the construction companies,"" says Doussoumon, in Nago, a dialect similar to the Yoruba spoken on the Nigerian side of the forest. ""We use that to buy clothes for the children.""

Doussoumon's daily routine is working the plot of land owned by her husband where they grow maize, cassava, yams and rice. In the rainy season she picks mushrooms to eat with pounded yam and sell at the market.

""It rained a lot in the past, but not so much now,"" she says. ""And the intensity of the harmattan has reduced.""

The harmattan is the dry wind that blows from the Sahara across the Sahel, cooling coastal west Africa in the winter. The climate crisis has increased desertification and temperatures are rising 1.5 times faster than the global average.

On the road to Yaoui's nearest city, Parakou, where the university academics monitor mushroom plots, trucks carry loads of cotton south to the port of Cotonou. Most of Benin's cotton gets exported, but recently textile manufacturing has started in newly built industrial parks.

Talon made his money in cotton and he has plans for the economy. While taking a hard line on political dissent, he has also made efforts to tackle corruption by doubling the salaries of politicians and civil servants. He hopes to encourage the kind of technocracy lacking in Benin's ruling classes, but which has facilitated progress in countries such as Nigeria and Ivory Coast.

Benin - a Marxist state from 1975 until 1990 - is still remote from global capitalism: no multinationals operate here and there is an informal economy. Petrol, for example, which is extracted across west Africa by corporations such as Shell and Total, is mostly bought and sold in glass bottles at roadsides, and illegally shipped in from Nigeria.

Agriculture is a big part of Benin's development plan - and makes up 30% of GDP - but cotton and cashews have few sustainable benefits for the largely female workforce. There is space for a mushroom industry and women's development could be pivotal in the fight against jihadism.

While military reinforcement is critical - Talon is negotiating weapons and personnel deals with Rwanda, Turkey and China - it is at community level that militancy must be tackled. In border villages, the recruitment strategy of the jihadist groups relies on economic coercion, not religious radicalisation.

""The extremist gangs come and give bags of rice or farming tools to struggling families,"" says a former official, who asked not to be named.

""Later, they come back and give them a gun and say, ""˜Remember that rice we gave you, now we need you to do this for us.'""

""We are aware of the situation in Burkina, and we pray it does not come to our doorstep,"" says Doussoumon.

Fadeyi, who recently received â‚¬10,000 to fund her mushroom-growing initiative from a science-funding foundation and is asking for additional support from the Beninese authorities, is focused more on empowering rural women than tackling the security issues.

""Business mentoring will help them assert themselves in a commercial, entrepreneurial way,"" she says. ""Next, we will check the quality of fresh mushroom production and give refresher courses.

After that the women will be left to their own devices, as they will have the necessary skills and will no longer need us. They will be completely autonomous.""

830,"Pesticide firms withheld brain toxicity studies from EU regulators, study finds","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/01/pesticide-firms-withheld-brain-toxicity-studies-from-eu-regulators-study-finds","Pesticide firms withheld brain toxicity studies from EU regulators, study finds

Exclusive: The same studies were submitted to US regulators and some are relevant to safety levels, the researchers say

Pesticide companies failed to disclose a series of studies assessing brain toxicity to European regulators, according to new research, despite the same studies having been submitted to US regulators.

When the EU authorities were made aware of the studies, between 14 and 21 years after they were conducted, new safety limits were applied in some cases and evaluation is still under way in other cases.

The researchers described the omissions as ""outrageous"", concluding that ""apparently non-disclosure is a problem that is not rare"" and that there could be ""no reliable safety evaluation of pesticides by EU authorities without full access to all performed toxicity studies"".

The new research is the first systematic assessment of non-disclosure and focused only on developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) studies. The researchers found 35 DNT studies submitted to the US Environmental Protection Agency as part of the pesticide approval process but found that nine of these had not been included in dossiers sent to the EU authorities for the same pesticides.

Among the findings in the undisclosed studies were changes in brain size, delayed sexual maturation and reduced weight gain in the offspring of laboratory rats exposed to a pesticide when pregnant. The pesticides identified in the new study include the insecticides abamectin, ethoprophos and pyridaben and the fungicide fluazinam. These are, or have been, used on a range of crops including tomatoes, strawberries, potatoes and aubergines.

""Brains are unbelievably complex and so central for us being humans, and damage to brain development is immensely costly to societies,"" said Dr Axel Mie, at Stockholm University, Sweden, who led the new study. ""So it's really important for us to make sure that the chemical products we use are not damaging the brains of our kids and grandchildren.""

Prof Christina RudÃ©n, study co-author and also at Stockholm University, said: ""Most important to me is the principle to have to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. It is outrageous, what they're doing.""

Sarah Wiener, a Green party MEP from Austria and the European parliament rapporteur for new EU pesticide regulation proposals, said: ""The analysis shows that the pesticide industry is fooling EU authorities. In the end, it is EU citizens who pay the price. Their health is jeopardised when relevant studies are withheld.""

""The EU therefore needs to make sure that there are harsh consequences for the withholding of data,"" she said. ""This could mean that corporations would have to pay considerable fines.""

EU regulations state that pesticide dossiers should ""include a full and unbiased report of the studies conducted [unless] it is not necessary owing to the nature of the product or its proposed uses, or it is not scientifically necessary. In such a case a justification shall be provided.""

A spokesperson for the European Commission said: ""There is a clear obligation to submit all available adverse data as part of applications since 2013, and there is an obligation to notify adverse data when they become available since 1991.""

The power to penalise companies if they unlawfully fail to disclose toxicity studies in Europe lies with national regulators. But no known penalty has been imposed on any pesticide company to date. The UK pesticides regulator, the Health and Safety Executive, did not answer a request for comment.

In correspondence seen by the Guardian, a senior official in the European Commission's directorate for health and food safety expressed ""serious concern"" in September 2022 after being made aware of two of the undisclosed studies: ""The fact that certain applicants have apparently not provided studies with an unfavourable outcome for certain active substances as part of the application dossiers is a serious concern.""

The chemical companies said they had complied with the EU regulations, in some cases arguing they were not legally obliged to submit the studies. They also disagreed with the researchers' conclusions that some of the studies had led to tighter regulation when the EU authorities had become aware of the studies' existence, or that they could do so in the future.

Previous work estimated that exposure in the EU to organophosphate insecticides, which are now banned and were not part of the new study, caused brain damage costing â‚¬146bn a year in lost productivity. The new report said: ""For some compounds, it has taken decades from the initial evidence of DNT effects in humans until such hazards became widely recognised.""

The study is published in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Health. It found nine undisclosed DNT studies produced between 2001 and 2007, up to 20 years before the submission of the most recent EU regulatory dossiers. The EU authorities became aware of the studies between 2017 and 2022, the researchers said.

Standard DNT tests expose pregnant female rats to a pesticide and assess their offspring for neuropathological and behavioural changes. The tests have been shown to identify chemicals known to cause DNT damage in humans, though in some cases humans are substantially more sensitive than the rodents.

Three of the undisclosed DNT studies have already led to regulatory changes, after subsequent evaluation by EU regulatory authorities, according to Mie and RudÃ©n. For the pesticide abamectin, for example, new health-based safety levels for people were set, they said.

For ethoprophos, Mie and RudÃ©n said the DNT study ""contributed to"" it being banned by EU authorities in 2019. Bayer, the company that commissioned a DNT study on ethoprophos in 2004, denied this. The EU ruling that banned the pesticide said ""the risk assessment could not be finalised"" for DNT or other areas of concern and also noted a ""high acute risk"" to birds and soil organisms. Bayer sold ethoprophos to another company in 2010.

Another four undisclosed DNT studies could have ""a potential effect on toxicological reference values or hazard classification"", based on Mie and RudÃ©n's assessment of the US EPA's evaluation of the studies. One DNT did not have any regulatory impact and insufficient information was available to assess the potential regulatory impact of the ninth study. Some of the pesticides have been banned for other reasons since 2018 and overall five of the nine chemicals retain EU approval today.

A spokesperson for Syngenta, which commissioned two DNT studies on abamectin in 2005 and 2007, as well as studies on two other pesticides, said: ""Syngenta has complied with all EU data requests and provided relevant study data in accordance with regulatory requirements.""

The spokesperson said the abamectin DNT studies were not submitted to EU authorities in an application for approval that was completed successfully in 2008 because the studies had been conducted for its US regulatory application and were not a requirement in the EU at the time. He said these studies were not considered to provide any new toxicological information.

However, the Efsa spokesperson said: ""The [DNT] studies were used to derive health-based safety levels for consumer and operator exposure.""

A spokesperson for Bayer said: ""At all times, we submitted the necessary studies required by the regulations at the time. For all three active ingredients [cited in the new research], the studies would not have changed the authorities' risk assessment.""

Nissan Chemical Corporation said it had submitted the DNT study for its pesticide pyridaben, completed in 2007, to EU regulatory authorities in February 2023. Mie and RudÃ©n said the study has the potential to impact the regulation of the chemical, which is still approved in the EU.

Japanese company ISK said it had submitted a 2005 DNT study on their pesticide fluazinam to EU authorities in 2020 and said it had not been required to do so beforehand. Efsa said the study was now being evaluated as part of the assessment of whether to renew the pesticide's approval.

None of the companies said they had submitted justifications for exemption from the need to submit existing studies, though some said other DNT studies had been submitted.

Reforms proposed by Mie and RudÃ©n to ensure all toxicity studies are submitted to EU regulatory authorities include cross-checking datasets with counterparts in other countries, such as the US EPA. ""The rules should also be revised to ensure that non-disclosure of toxicity studies carries a significant legal risk for pesticide companies,"" they said.

Apolline Roger, a lawyer at ClientEarth, contrasted the lack of penalties for non-disclosure of toxicity studies with those imposed for breaches of EU data protection and competition laws, which can lead to fines of significant percentages of a company's annual turnover.

""You don't have [penalties] like that for this process, even though what is at stake is the dispersion of potentially very harmful substances in the environment, and therefore in our food, water and bodies,"" she said. ""What does it say about us when we place a higher value on digital data and consumer protection than on health and the environment?""

Currently, pesticide safety studies are commissioned and paid for by the companies. Mie and RudÃ©n suggested the studies should be commissioned by regulatory authorities, to prevent conflicts of interest, with the costs being recovered from the companies.

""[Mie and RudÃ©n] are really finding the root of the issue when they say studies should not be made by the companies,"" said Roger. ""It's the elephant in the room.""

The Efsa spokesperson said: ""In the EU regulatory system for pesticides, the burden of proof of safety lies with the company that seeks to place their product on the market."" Tougher EU rules on the notification of safety studies became applicable from March 2021, meaning companies now have to notify the authorities of all studies commissioned and cannot withhold studies even if they are considered to have found no adverse findings.

However, Angeliki Lysimachou, head of science and policy at Pesticide Action Network Europe, said: ""That means that all the pesticides already in the market won't be examined until their reapproval comes up, which could take 10 or 15 years, sometimes more."" In the meantime, the pesticides remain approved for use, she said.

RudÃ©n said: ""There's no reason we are aware of to believe that withholding evidence is limited to DNT studies, or limited to pesticides."" She said the cases of tobacco and PFAS - ""forever chemicals"" - were previous examples of where companies withheld knowledge about toxicity from the public.

The #pesticidesecrets story was reported in collaboration with Bayerischer Rundfunk/ARD and Der Spiegel in Germany, SRF in Switzerland, and Le Monde in France.

Hidden camera at slaughterhouse appears to show ""˜utterly inhumane' use of CO2 to stun pigs before slaughter

New undercover footage showing British pigs being gassed prior to slaughter has led to renewed calls to investigate the use of CO2.

Campaigners say the pictures - the first of their kind to be obtained in a UK abattoir - show the ""utterly inhumane"" nature of using CO2 to stun pigs before being killed. But the pork industry says its use is recognised as the most welfare-friendly method available, and says alternatives are being sought.

The images published today were obtained, say campaigners, using hidden cameras at Pilgrim's Pride abattoir in Ashton-under-Lyne in north-west England in February 2021. They show pigs in groups of five or six being mechanically herded into a cage and then lowered into a Butina gas chamber in a ferris wheel-like system.

The pigs appear to be in distress as the gas concentration increases, with one still kicking after more than three minutes.

""The pigs in the video react to the first inhalation of carbon dioxide with fear and obvious discomfort,"" said Donald Broom, an animal welfare professor at the University of Cambridge. ""They try to escape but cannot. The gasping can be seen in all pigs where the mouth is visible. Gasping indicates poor welfare. The period of poor welfare continues until the pig loses consciousness.""

Paul Roger, a vet and founder member of the Animal Welfare Science, Ethics and Law Veterinary Association, said some pigs appeared to start waking from the gas prior to slaughter. ""If this is the way animals are treated in this plant, they're not being handled humanely. It's an unacceptable way to treat any animal, and that really concerns me.""

Animal activist Joey Carbstrong, who captured the footage for the film Pignorant, said that the continued use of CO2 arises from the favouring of corporate profit over the interests of the animals. ""We urgently need to stop using animals as resources because this kind of horror show is the result.""

Pilgrim's UK, formerly known as Tulip, is a division of Pilgrim's Pride Corporation, which is owned by JBS, the Brazilian-owned meat producer. Its animal welfare policy states: ""At Pilgrim's UK it is essential that all pigs are treated humanely throughout their lives and that the pig's welfare is always at the forefront of everything we do."" It confirms that all Pilgrim's pigs are stunned using CO2.

A Pilgrim's Pride spokesperson said: ""There is nothing to identify that this is our site, and it would be inappropriate for us to comment on that basis. Furthermore, the Food Standards Agency is legally required to be present at all sites and would routinely review any footage taken from an abattoir to ensure animals are treated humanely, and we have had no issues raised in the timeframe you have provided.""

In 2003, a government advisory body, the Farm Animal Welfare Council, said that CO2 stunning/killing ""is not acceptable and we wish to see it phased out in five years"". However, its use has instead increased to 88% of all pigs in 2022.

A new scientific opinion by the European Food Safety Authority published in June 2020 stated: ""Exposure to CO2 at high concentrations is considered a serious welfare concern by the panel because it is highly aversive and causes pain, fear and respiratory distress.""

Defra recently funded research into low atmospheric pressure stunning (Laps) as a potential alternative. The results showed it does not offer a humane alternative, and a 2021 Defra report into the welfare of animals at slaughter stated: ""There has been no willingness on the part of abattoirs to explore inert gas mixture stunning commercially because of extended dwell time and therefore reduced throughput.""

Lizzie Wilson, CEO of the National Pig Association (NPA), said: ""While we acknowledge gas stunning isn't perfect, it is the best, most humane and efficacious commercially available option, and often the most reliable slaughter method for ensuring consistency.

after newsletter promotion

""In addition, CO2 gas stunning of pigs does provide some welfare benefits; there is reduced risk of potential human error, animals remain in groups, and modern gas systems enable improved handling of pigs through use of automatic gates, which reduces the need for staff intervention and stress.""

The NPA said it organised a summit last year along with the National Farmers' Union and British Meat Processors Association to discuss alternative gas mixtures, but concluded that there was no other viable system available. Dr Alice Brough said: ""Non-aversive gases like argon or helium do offer potential alternatives, but they're more expensive, and there's no financial incentive for the meat industry to change their systems.""

Veterinary manager Prof Jill Thompson said: ""Every effort should be made to progress towards using less aversive gasses that do not generate such reactions. This would involve changes to infrastructure in slaughter plants and would be more costly, but I believe that society would support a slight increase in the cost of products if it enabled a more peaceful stunning process for pigs.""

Peter Stevenson, head of policy at Compassion in World Farming, said: ""I call on the government to ban the use of high levels of CO2 from 2026, thereby forcing the industry to belatedly invest in developing a slaughter method that is genuinely humane.""

A government spokesperson said: ""The government is committed to the highest standards of animal welfare, including when animals are slaughtered or killed. We recognise there are concerns over the use of high-concentration carbon-dioxide to stun pigs, and will continue to look for viable alternatives based on the latest evidence on this issue.""

Water surplus has opened up short-term opportunities for a struggling community in the Cordillera Blanca - but what happens when it runs out?

Fresh Andean water flows abundantly in HualcayÃ¡n, a picturesque hilltop settlement studded with archaeological gems in the Cordillera Blanca mountain range in Peru.

A network of artificial stone canals channel those glacial waters to the community's vast expanse of farmlands, feeding into fields of ruby-red strawberries, succulent sugar-snap peas, and the ever-growing number of reservoirs that dot the land.

""It's easy work,"" says Hugo Adriano Echeverria Paulino, a 48-year-old farmer who cultivates sugar-snap peas on seven hectares (17 acres) of land amid a breathtaking scene of snow-capped mountains and soaring valleys. ""But it requires a lot of water.""

A decade ago, HualcayÃ¡n looked very different in the world's most densely concentrated cluster of tropical glaciers. Before, modest fields of corn, wheat and potatoes - crops cultivated here for centuries - covered the landscape. But now, nearly all of them have been turned into ordered monocultures of sugar-snap peas.

The Cordillera Blanca, which extends for more than 100 miles and includes several Andean peaks that are more than 6,000 metres above sea level, is considered a ""ground zero"" of climate breakdown as communities within it contend with a fearsome range of threats, from unprecedented, chaotic weather to surges in crop-destroying pests, blows to tourism reliant on fast-disappearing glaciers, and escalating conflicts over water.

Peru has lost more than half of its glaciers as a result of melting over the past 50 years, according to research by the National Water Authority, and it is projected that all of the snow on the top of the mountain range could disappear by 2111.

The sight of scarred, black rockfaces on the towering peaks surrounding HualcayÃ¡n has become increasingly common, according to Paulino, and is a stark reminder of where the mountain range's fast-melting glaciers used to be.

""When I used to go on walks through the mountains as a child, they were completely covered in snow,"" says Paulino. ""Not any more.""

In HualcayÃ¡n, the impact of climate breakdown has also taken on a complex new dynamic. As glaciers in the Cordillera Blanca have melted over the years, the lakes below them have swelled with the resulting water. In some areas, it has heightened the risk of outbursts with deadly consequences, but in HualcayÃ¡n, the unusual surplus of water - a stark contrast to the bitter drought faced by other Andean communities and regions across Peru - has allowed local farmers to benefit in some ways.

About a decade ago, the Belgium-based company Fair Fruit offered to make a deal with the residents of HualcayÃ¡n, including Paulino. It would pay the farmers to grow sugar-snap peas for international export, initially offering to pay 5 soles (£1) a kilo. Later, according to farmers, Fair Fruit increased the price paid to 7 or 8 soles a kilo.

Many like Paulino were quick to sign up, eager to establish a guaranteed income stream amid the volatile market for potatoes and corn, which have become more challenging to cultivate because of hotter conditions.

""There aren't other job opportunities for us here, so the whole community wanted to start working with the company,"" says Lucia Huaman Perez, a 52-year-old farmer with three hectares of land in HualcayÃ¡n. ""We don't have a choice.""

Sugar-snap pea plots with distinctive rows of eucalyptus branches now dominate HualcayÃ¡n. Much of the community has benefited as the farmland has sprawled, and more reservoirs have been built to stockpile water to meet international demand.

Leoncio Huiza Cerillo, a 77-year-old farmer and former president of the community, says the cost of cultivating the sugar-snap peas, which require daily picking and irrigation every three days, is as much as 80-90% of the payment he receives. Still, it's the best alternative he has found.

""It's expensive to produce,"" says Cerillo, who estimates that more than half of what he produces goes to international markets. ""But we need to work to earn money, pay for our kids to go to school and for medical treatment.""

Yet, while this rare boom in water supply has brought short-term benefits, boosting incomes in the poor rural community, the developments in HualcayÃ¡n symbolise the paradoxical impact of the climate crisis across the region, creating a tension between short-term gain for those wanting to improve their meagre livelihoods and potential long-term catastrophe. The Guardian contacted Fair Fruit and its parent company on three occasions but received no comment.

Across the Cordillera Blanca, international and domestic companies are exploiting increased water flows by building hydroelectric dams that divert water away from community lands and by funding the cultivation of water-intensive, non-native crops such as sugar-snap peas, strawberries and blueberries as well as flowers to export internationally.

Conflicts have broken out over water in the past. The nearby Cruz de Mayo community has for years organised protests over the CaÃ±Ã³n del Pato hydroelectric plant. The site, previously run by the American company Duke Energy, draws water from the community's water source, Laguna ParÃ³n, a glacial lake and popular tourist destination at an altitude of more than 4,000 metres.

Some residents fear that the rush of agribusiness is unsustainable and could amplify the crisis if the water does dry up. ""I'm afraid for the future,"" says Paulino. ""We will all be without a way to feed ourselves.""

The struggle over water in the Cordillera Blanca represents an unprecedented threat because its glaciated mountain peaks form one of the world's ""water towers"" - a mountain system that supplies a significant amount of water to a large population.

""I've been staggered to see how horticulture has expanded in the Cordillera Blanca,"" says Nicholas Branch, a professor at the University of Reading who specialises in climate resilience and food production in the Andes. ""These rural populations have dealt with changes for millennia. But these types of [new] crops require a lot of water. It's a whole new challenge.""

Branch, who has researched the Cordillera Blanca and the neighbouring Cordillera Negra, which does not contain glaciers and whose communities have been suffering significant droughts, warns that lessons must be heeded.

""In the future, the Blanca will experience droughts already acutely felt in the Negra,"" he adds. ""But we are seeing very little large-scale effort in terms of adaptation.""

""It's very concerning; it's short-term thinking,"" says Vidal RondÃ¡n, the strategic planning director at the Mountain Institute, a not-for-profit organisation that works with communities in the Andes. ""The community was having its water supply cut off. As the water runs out, farming areas will be abandoned, and people will move to other areas, ignoring the agreed land rights and doing whatever they can to survive.""

According to Rebecca Bria, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio, those changes are ""creating dependencies between people, land and water that can't be sustained long-term"" as the glaciers providing the water are vanishing.

Last year Bria, an anthropologist who has worked with the community in HualcayÃ¡n since 2009, surveyed 80 residents about their experience of the climate crisis and their ability to adapt to the more extreme, unpredictable conditions. ""They are very aware of climate change,"" Bria says. ""Many feel hopeless.""

Even in the Cordillera Blanca, not all communities have access to plentiful water stocks as they do in HualcayÃ¡n. About a dozen miles to the south, the farmers in Tzactza can only irrigate their fields with lake water once a month under historical rights negotiated by villages. Owing to its geographical location, Tzactza doesn't have access to other natural water sources, such as rivers, yet the farmers are still suffering the ill effects of climate breakdown, with unpredictable, unseasonal rains.

""It's a critical situation,"" says Federico Chavez Salvador, the president of Tzactza's water committee, which was set up in response to the dire situation. His team attempts to improve water network infrastructure to reduce erosion and evaporation.

""Industrial cultivation of strawberries and sugar-snap peas means our predicament is worse than ever,"" Salvador adds.

On the outskirts of Tzactza, where parched fields and bone-dry water channels loom large on the landscape, the grim realities of those water shortages are being endured by some of the world's poorest but most essential food producers. Juan Salvador Cruz, a 77-year-old farmer working with his son under the beating midday heat, is attempting to irrigate a field of potatoes using only buckets of water collected by hand from a small, murky brown pool.

""There's no water, no water,"" he says.

853,"""˜The Robert de Niros of Metehara': Joey L's best photographs","https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/01/robert-de-niros-of-metehara-joey-ls-best-photographs-ethiopian-camel-trader","""˜The Robert de Niros of Metehara': Joey L's best photographs

""˜These Ethiopian camel-traders are wearing their hair in a way that shows they are traditional ""deep countryside"" men. It's a beautiful style, hand-groomed with clarified butter, but it's disappearing'

Everyone in Ethiopia knows this hairstyle because it's very specific to the Karrayyu people. They style their hair to invoke the shape of the sycamore tree, which is a sacred meeting place for the community. On market day, when they're trading camels and get the opportunity to interact with women, all the guys pay very special attention to the hairstyle, spending a lot of time styling it.

The Karrayyu are a clan within the Oromo tribe, which is the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia. They live in the Awash Valley area of central Ethiopia. Almost every single person in Ethiopia recognises the Karrayyu. But the reality is that this hairstyle is disappearing in the countryside. It's something the older generations do; it's especially hard to find younger men with it.

These three Karrayyu gentlemen - Boru, Woday and Fentale - are deep, deep countryside guys. The hair shows that they are traditional men who are connected to their community. A woman from the deep countryside community wants a man from the same. Imagine if you're a father with a daughter from this community - you don't want her to disappear and move to the city, so the hair is a signal: it's kind of saying ""traditional man"". And it looks really beautiful. They use kibbeh, which is clarified butter, to style it. The shape looks really nice. It's hand-groomed and shows a high level of self-care.

I first met these men at the market trading camels. The men were friendly, but incredibly busy - they're businessmen. They have a very good life and are very rich. We measure our wealth in money - they measure theirs in livestock. They won't tell you how many camels they have, but it's a lot.

We - our Ethiopian photography team, which comprises my fixer Nibret and my wife Kiya - asked if we could go to their village and photograph them there. It's just outside a place called Metehara. We went the next day. There's a road from Metehara, then it stops and you have to walk. We made an agreement with the men and elders from the community, and built our campsite near where their camels are kept. I took those photos the next morning around sunrise, near where they're looking after their animals. One thing that makes it work is the eye contact.

We also built a tent studio there for more formal portraits. I've got some cool video of the people helping us build it, trying to get in through the door with their huge afros.

Ethiopia is a modern nation but it's also an ancient kingdom. It has many colourful places that are frequently photographed, especially in the south, where the tribes have jewellery, scarification and amazing designs. The Karrayyu are highlander people, so they look very different.

There used to be a great divide in my photography between my commercial work and my personal shots, but over time, the line blurred. With the commercial work, clients usually want me to shoot in my own personal style. I've photographed celebrities from western culture, including Robert de Niro, David Beckham, Jessica Chastain, Jennifer Lawrence. Michael K Williams was a very cool one. I also did the first Twilight movie poster. The guys in this photo are celebrities, too, local celebrities - the Robert de Niros of Metehara!

An Ethiopian photographer told me that when you google Ethiopia, you only see how foreigners have depicted the country. So much of the visuals we know are from the 1970s and 1980s famines - that's not really what the country is about for locals and it shouldn't be what the country is about for foreign photographers like myself.

Much of my life has become intertwined with Ethiopia - I married an Ethiopian woman and we live there. You have to take a deep dive when you're working on a big project about a country. I hope my work helps correct how it is perceived.

857,"We are being poisoned every day, so why do we keep voting for more pollution? Ask a lobbyist","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/sep/22/air-pollution-lobbying-politics-ulez","We are being poisoned every day, so why do we keep voting for more pollution? Ask a lobbyist

The dirty industries that dominate politics deceive us into accepting dangerous pollutants such as ammonia as part of life

There are some things we rightly find intolerable, such as the possession of poorly trained, aggressive dogs. There are other things, whose impacts are many thousands of times worse, that we decide just to live with. What makes the difference? Visibility is one reason: a photo of a large dog with bared teeth triggers primal fear. Ubiquity is another: the more widespread the problem, the more we normalise it. Split incentives is another: what if we are simultaneously both perpetrators and victims? But I think the most important factor is lobbying power.

There is no corporate lobby behind the sale, let alone poor training, of American XL bullies. But there are powerful corporate lobbies behind the air pollution devastating many people's health. Oil corporations don't want to lose their market. Car firms want to sell existing designs for as long as possible. Even the manufacturers of wood-burning stoves run a small, but surprisingly effective, persuasion operation.

Thanks to the Pollution Paradox - the dirtiest industries have the greatest incentive to invest in politics, so politics comes to be dominated by the dirtiest industries - such lobbies exert a vast impact on political choice. If people were asked to vote on whether they want their hearts and lungs damaged, their children's cognitive development impaired, extra cancers, more stillbirths, a higher risk of dementia and earlier death, they'd be likely to reject these options. But, thanks to decades of spin, the stark nature of the choice has been obscured.

The interests of some of the most powerful industries on Earth are represented as the interests of the working man and woman, trying to go about their business while greens and bureaucrats impede them. In reality, those who drive for their living - such as taxi drivers, couriers and rubbish collectors - have the greatest exposure to toxic diesel fumes. We could achieve cheaper, more effective mobility with a fraction of the pollution. With the right incentives, we could also heat our homes without poisoning our neighbours.

If you don't have the evidence required to win an argument, there's a ready alternative: set people against each other by stoking a culture war. Low emission zones and low-traffic neighbourhoods have been the subjects of grotesque falsehoods in the media, lurid conspiracy theories and dark money lobbying. As the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, pointed out this week, hundreds of thousands of pounds have been spent on troll farms on social media attacking London's ultra-low emission zone (Ulez). We don't know where this money came from, but it may have been decisive in securing a Conservative win in the Uxbridge byelection.

Emboldened by the apparent success of such lobbying, the government is waging war on public health, announcing a ""review"" of low-traffic neighbourhoods and scrapping the commitment to stop the sale of polluting private vehicles by 2030. Across both the billionaire press and social media, those who seek cleaner air are demonised. Tory MPs who have called for severe penalties against environmental protesters are noticeably more relaxed about the the vandalism of Ulez cameras. It scarcely gets more perverse.

The Guardian's mapping of air pollution in Europe (including the UK) tells a shocking story. Only 2% of people live in places where the pollution caused by PM2.5s - tiny particles that cause a wide range of diseases - is within the limits recommended by the World Health Organization. Most people, including millions in the UK, are exposed to toxic particles at concentrations of at least twice this level. You would have to move to northern Scotland to escape the daily assault on your health.

Many rural people will be surprised to see how polluted their air is, but that's because the media seldom mention the major source of these particles: ammonia from farms. A study by researchers at University College London found that even in cities, ammonia from farms produces more particulate pollution than the cities themselves do. Farm ammonia contributes 25% of the PM2.5s in London, 32% in Birmingham and 38% in Leicester, while these cities generate from 13-24% of their own PM2.5 pollution (the rest blows in from mainland Europe or comes from construction and road traffic outside the city, shipping emissions and dust from distant deserts).

Where there is public silence, lobbyists rule. The ammonia comes from livestock farms and the manure and fertiliser spread on fields. There are several ways of greatly reducing its release: storing manure in sealed tanks rather than open lagoons, injecting it into soil instead of spreading it, banning the use of urea as a fertiliser, reducing the animal products we eat. According to a paper in the journal Science, cutting ammonia pollution is 10 times more cost-effective than cutting pollution from nitrogen oxides, another major cause of airborne particulates. Halving ammonia emissions, another analysis suggests, could save 3,000 lives in the UK every year. Reducing ammonia, according to Andrea Pozzer of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, is the ""most effective way to reduce mortality linked to air pollution"".

But the government, lobbied by the National Farmers' Union, has thwarted all such efforts. In a submission to parliament, the NFU appeared to admit that the purpose of much manure spreading is to dump surplus slurry rather than to fertilise crops: it needs to happen because ""the production or import of manures far outstrips the immediate need of accessible soil and crops"". This is the issue that blights our rivers as well as our air: livestock farms produce far more manure than the land can absorb. The lobby group went on to argue against a ban on autumn spreading, which causes the worst pollution, and against a ban on the use of urea, a potent source of ammonia. The government gave it everything it wanted.

The European parliament has now voted to bring EU legislation in line with the science, setting the WHO's recommended level as the legal limit for PM2.5 pollution, but, thanks to the lobbyists and their stooges, not until 2035. There are, however, no such plans in the UK. As one of the great benefits of Brexit, the government merely aims to change the current ""guidance"" level of PM2.5 pollution from four times the WHO recommendation to twice the recommended level by 2040. The dates 2040 and 2050 are used by this government as synonyms for ""never"".

The idea that some people may freely poison others is one of the most astonishing but least contested aspects of modern life. It's time we saw past the lies and the culture wars. It's time to stop accepting our daily poisoning on behalf of corporate profits.

This article was amended on 9 October 2023. An earlier version made reference to ""nitrous oxide"" pollution, when the intended reference was to nitrogen oxides.

Butterhead lettuce leaves make an excellent wrap for cheese, crumbs, herbs and nuts, all poached in a tasty broth

If I had to make a bed from one vegetable, it would be butterhead lettuce. Its soft, velvety leaves and bouncy heart would make a good mattress, I think. And, if I had enough and they'd never seen a fridge, the largest leaves could provide a floppy cover. My green bed would not only be comfortable; it would also be useful: despite modern conclusions that the milky lactucarium that seeps from lettuce stems is not a sedative, I'm with ancient doctors and hopeful that eating my cover would send me to sleep.

The ancient Egyptians - great cultivators of lettuce - saw it as sacred, though for different reasons. In Egyptian mythology, Min, one of the earliest known Egyptian deities of rain, fertility, crops and male potency, and often represented by an ithyphallic figure, was often associated with lettuce. But it was not the butterhead from which I am going to make my bed, but rather a tall variety with a ""straight vertical surge of growth and milky juice"", as Jane Grigson describes it. Yet research in 2015, by Pauline Norris at the University of Manchester about the association of Min with the lettuce plant, concludes that lettuce was offered to Min simply to ensure the fertility and regeneration of agriculture, rather than as an aphrodisiac to increase sexual desire. Even so, buying a cos at the corner shop is now forever changed.

You don't want a cos for today's dish, though: instead, you need two soft butterheads. It is the most beautiful, layered lettuce, which, despite claims by pretty, flecked radicchio, is the vegetable most like a rose. Butterhead is also, I think, the best lettuce for a salad: the crisper, paler heart provides substance and body (with the addition of herbs, maybe, and red leaves, too), while the softer, velvet leaves both catch and mop up the dressing like floor cloths. Known as lattuga cappuccina or a cappuccio in Italy, butterheads are also wonderful cooked, be that on a grill, braised or, as I found over a week spent in Liguria, as a wrapping that's every bit as good as cabbage.

I was doubtful when I first saw stuffed lettuce in broth in a Ligurian cookbook, and later on a menu. But then I remembered my doubts about braised lettuce, until I tried a Simon Hopkinson recipe for little gems. I also recalled my doubts about frying them, until I made escarole in olive oil with garlic and chilli. The tenderness of butterhead does mean it seems even more tender when wilted, but there is strength in wilting, plus it wraps tightly around a filling of breadcrumbs, cheese, herbs and nuts. The cocktail sausage-sized parcels are then poached in broth.

The excess uncooked lettuce can, of course, be used for salad, mixed with other leaves and herbs and dressed how you like (I go for six tablespoons of olive oil, and a tablespoon each of red-wine vinegar and dijon mustard, all shaken together in an old jam jar). Alternatively, leftover leaves, while not a bed, might make a pillow.

Stuffed lettuce in brodo

Serves 4

2 heads soft-leaved butterhead lettuce1½ litres good vegetable broth2 eggs100g soft white breadcrumbs150g parmesan, grated, plus extra to serve
1 garlic clove, peeled and finely minced
50g pine nuts or almonds, finely chopped or pounded
2 heaped tbsp minced parsley1 tsp minced marjoramSalt and black pepper

Separate the leaves from the lettuces, select the 24 nicest and best-looking ones, then wash (save the rest for another use). Bring the broth to a boil, then blanch the leaves for 30 seconds, scoop out and blot dry: they should be soft and floppy, so cut away any hard central ribs.

Lightly beat the eggs, mix with the breadcrumbs and leave to sit for 10 minutes. Add the cheese, garlic, nuts, herbs, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper, and mix well to combine.

Lay out the leaves flat on a work surface, put a teaspoonful of the filling in the middle of each, then swaddle it like a baby: lift up the bottom half of each leaf, bring it in at the sides, roll up into a neat and very tight little parcel. Seal with toothpicks.

Bring the broth to a gentle simmer, lower in the lettuce parcels and poach for 10 minutes.

Serve in shallow bowls, giving everyone six parcels and some broth, and pass round more cheese for those who want it.

869,"I have not been seen in public without a hat for 10 years. Would a Turkish hair transplant change my life?","https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/oct/14/would-a-turkish-hair-transplant-change-my-life","I have not been seen in public without a hat for 10 years. Would a Turkish hair transplant change my life?

Since I lost my hair, I wouldn't leave the house with my head uncovered. Then I heard about the million transplant tourists who head to Istanbul every year. If it worked for them, could it work for me, too?

The breakfast spread at the Crowne Plaza hotel on the outskirts of Istanbul is vast, but I am advised to eat lightly. Everything is gleaming: the marble walls, the polished fruit, the cereal dispensers, the bloody wet crowns of the male guests, fresh from surgery.

I sit at a table in the corner with a dollop of strained yoghurt and have a good ogle. At least half of the guests are post-op guys. Two are with partners who bear longsuffering looks. A group of three have the mid-treatment horseshoe bandage. And one guy is alone, examining his red scalp in selfie mode while he devours his smÃ¶rgÃ¥sbord. A woman pauses at the threshold of the restaurant, agape, and meets my eye. I smile apologetically by way of an explanation, for I, too, am part of this cult. The reborn. The second-chancers. I pat my breast pocket for the umpteenth time. Still there. The biggest wad I've ever carried: £4,800, withdrawn from a cash machine on a bleak December morning in east London three days earlier.

I have not been seen in public without a hat for 10 years, during which time about five people outside my family have seen the top of my head. My hair started disappearing at 18; it was wispy by 28 and today, at 34, it's a horseshoe. I have developed an extensive repertoire of smoke-and-mirror techniques to conceal it. I don't swim. I don't share bedrooms. I avoid strong winds, large fans and head massages. Of course some hat-displacing risks you can't budget for: the beret-swiping stranger at a party or the fedora-toppling hard-braking taxi, which inflict the fatal wound of public exposure. Dating? To summarise: anxiety, fumbles in the dark, awkward revelations. I wear a trucker cap to a fancy dinner with my partner's parents. For my day job I work from home, and as a performing musician, I don an OTT wig and a drawn-on Groucho moustache.

Why, though, is it so fatal that someone should see my head? Obviously my world wouldn't end. But maybe it would. I like hair. And somehow, after a decade of follicle shame, I still have not reconciled myself to being bald. And so it goes, covering the top of my head, sustaining the half-baked illusion that I am as hirsute as my 20-year-old self.

Obviously I've known about hair transplants for years, but I thought the window had long passed for me; I'm too far gone, I can't afford it. I have also avoided Googling all things hair-related because I know how quickly one's algorithm turns into an obstacle course of triggering adverts.

But, six months ago, a good and fellow-afflicted friend encouraged me to have a WhatsApp consultation with an outfit in Istanbul that he visited for a third of the price of UK equivalents. I know Jamie has done boatloads of research; unlike me, he has tackled the problem head-on and now flaunts a resplendent mop. I trust him. I have the consultation and, assured my situation is salvageable, I get a quote and mull it over. It's now or never. Hiding is exhausting. Either embrace what I have or take a punt with the Turks. I book.

That Istanbul is the Eurasian capital of cosmetic surgery is evident as soon as I set foot on the air bridge, where the first adverts I see are not for the Hagia Sophia but for nose jobs, dental crowns and transplants. A combination of low labour costs and a very high number of doctors per capita has helped Turkey forge this industry, enticing one million hair transplant tourists in 2022. Amid the Byzantine treasures, there are bloody heads and nose bandages everywhere. I'm whisked to a luxe waterfront hotel, where a company rep briefs me on the next day's proceedings.

The following morning, filled with first-day-of-school dread, I am on my way to the hospital, clutching the wad (paying cash is the cheapest option). The building has Trump energy - a hulking white cube with three Italianate porticos, crowned with a huge company crest. Gold giraffe sculptures stalk the front lawn.

A man in a black turtleneck and box-fresh Alexander McQueen trainers shepherds me to the reception area. Another in the same uniform takes me to a room that is entirely empty but for a man and a cash-counting machine. I sign a contract I am too nervous to read.

The sequence of events hereafter unfolds with a filmic sense of choreography. As a first-time customer of private healthcare, this smoothness is uncanny. I am seated on a barber's chair and three immaculate turtlenecks stroke their chins and assess my head, iPhones disconcertingly in hand. Are they doctors? Hairdressers? Actors? Pictures are taken, my head is shaved and a suggested hairline is drawn on to my forehead. Shit, is this the hairline I want? Why haven't I considered this? Is it permanent? Obviously. I wonder what was in that contract. Risks, probably. I shrug. Looks about right. Vaguely widow's peak, natural enough.

At this moment a reverential hush descends as another, clearly more senior operator enters the room. I am told he is the company founder, he doesn't speak English, and that he will draw the final line. He silently wipes off the previous one, pinches my temple with some callipers and flashes a laser spirit level in my eyes. He strokes his chin and, with a deft flourish, redraws.

Minutes later I am in the theatre, inside a gown. A friendly, English-speaking turtle asks what music I'd like to listen to as three doctors in scrubs lie me down, needle me in the arm and set up an IV for vital nutrients, an ECG and a blood pressure monitor. ""Goldberg variations,"" I croak. ""Played by Murray Perahia."" I see the first drops of my own blood and feel faint. ""The anaesthetic will hurt a little,"" the turtle says. Fuck me, does it hurt: 50 injections over the course of 15 minutes, each prick sending a searing jolt through my cranium with the sound, audible only to me, of turf being punctured by a spade.

The anaesthetising is over. I am lying face down. The soundtrack has shifted algorithmically to some kind of whale song but I cannot ask the doctors to change it because they are busy extracting follicles from the donor area, around the sides and back of my head where the grass still grows. This is thankfully painless, though it takes me a while to get used to the raking, gouging noises. For two hours, all I can see is two pairs of black Crocs, as the doctors harvest 4,800 follicles with a micro punch tool and place them in a petri dish. Four thousand eight hundred follicles! That's a pound each.

Finally, the actual transplant: taking each extracted follicle and, using jewellers' forceps, inserting it into a hole in the recipient area. For four hours, while my numb head is being seeded with the new crop, I am allowed to watch videos on a screen above the ECG monitor. I recourse to a comforting old favourite: Keith Floyd's Floyd on France, and feel relaxed enough to doze off.

And that's it for the surgery. Eight hours under the knife. I am handed some meds and a travel pillow, told gravely not to touch the top of my head, and turtled back to the hotel. I feel pain, guilt and excitement. Later, when I confess to my mother what I have done, I will say, ""Mum, some people permanently stain their skin with ink, some people apply makeup every day, some people change their gender cos they wanna feel comfortable with the body they live in. I am merely moving a few follicles from the back of my head to the top. It's no biggie."" I know, though, that however I frame it, I won't be able to justify the expense. I sleep for a single hour and dream of a wind blowing off my new grafts.

The following day, I visit the clinic. The interior has a 60s space age feel, with automatic sliding doors, Arne Jacobsen chairs and backlit motivational messages on the walls. My bandage is removed and a masked, aproned figure cleans away volcanic islands of blood which have erupted and dried in various spots overnight. Over a Turkish coffee, I am given detailed instructions on how to wash my hair for the next 10 days - daily disinfecting foam spray on the scalp, shampoo lather dabbed on and kitchen-rolled off - and reminded to let nothing touch the top of my head. Then it's back to base camp for the last time, where I gorge on several meals while I take selfies with my free hand.

The prospect of the flight back has been my biggest fear: two airport securities, crowds, tight spaces. The flight is packed - I spot five other fretting transplantees - and, typical, I am given an aisle seat. Noticing my flinching when people walk past or rummage in overhead bins, the passenger in the middle seat offers to switch. What an angel. I wonder whether the facial recognition at passport control will recognise me. Not only do I have a bloody head but my face has swollen in various places. The turnstiles ping open and I reach the arrivals lounge without being mocked or jostled.

Now, the waiting game. Scabs, weird shampoos, and months to go before I find out what the new landscape really is up there.

Six months later, after several cycles of shedding and regrowth, I have a defined, fairly natural looking hairline. The transplanted hair is pretty dense at the front, but becomes sparser towards the crown, where there is very little. Overall, though, the results are within the realm of expectation. I still wear a hat most of the time, but I do occasionally, gingerly, remove it - an act one friend has affectionately termed ""flashing"". I'm less fearful of strong winds. I'm not a new person, but my confidence has grown, and that's worth something. The other day I went to the shops - a 20-minute round trip on foot, involving direct interactions with both my neighbour and the cashier, as well as an assortment of passersby ""¦ Without. A. Hat. A thrilling concept and probably my first fully unprotected outing since 2013. It felt euphoric. It felt good.

Tom Parker Bowles has spoken out in favour of unpasteurised milk, along with much of TikTok. The only problem is all that bacteria ...

Name: Raw milk.

Age: Ancient.

Status: The hot new milk that everyone has to try!

I'm already confused. How can something be ancient and new at the same time? Oh, that's easy. People used to drink raw milk for centuries. Then they stopped. Now, they're drinking it again.

Interesting. Why did they stop? There's a chance that they died of food poisoning from drinking all that raw milk.

Sorry, what? Anyway, hey! Raw milk is the best drink in the world and you should try it. Even the queen's son says so.

But didn't you just say ""¦ This weekend, Tom Parker Bowles wrote that raw milk has endured ""no pasteurisation, homogenisation or standardisation, meaning it still contains the full complement of vitamins, minerals and natural digestive enzymes, as well as providing the most lusciously creamy mouthful of pure dairy delight; rich, sweet and voluptuously full-bodied.""

Oh, that sounds quite nice. Remember, we're talking about the queen's son here. A litre of raw milk costs about £3.50, compared with £1.35 for the same amount of the usual stuff at a supermarket.

Is it worth the expense? As a food fad, raw milk is growing in popularity. Aside from Parker Bowles, a fleet of TikTok influencers cannot overstate how good it is.

Why do I feel a ""but"" coming on? But, I mean, where to start? Pasteurisation has saved countless lives, because it eliminates bacteria such as E coli, salmonella, listeria and campylobacter; these can cause illnesses that - not to be too delicate - tend to leave you pallid, sweaty and blasting hot liquid jets from both ends at once.

Blimey. Sorry. But raw milk is banned in Scotland. Additionally, in 2016, 65 cases of food poisoning were linked to a vending machine in Cumbria that dispensed raw milk. Reputable vendors claim their raw milk is perfectly safe (as long as it's kept fresh), but one study found that Americans who eat and drink raw dairy products are more than 800 times more likely to contract food poisoning than people who choose pasteurised ones.

I'll stick to semi-skimmed then. No! Don't do that, either. Do you know what enormous emitters of greenhouse gases cows are? Industrial livestock farming is a huge contributor to the climate emergency.

Almond milk? No! While it's better for the environment than cow milk, it takes 74 litres of water just to make one glass of almond milk. It represents a huge strain on the planet's resources, especially in areas where the almonds are grown.

Oat? Soy? Rice? All require water and cause greenhouse emissions.

Aargh! What do I do? Honestly, would it be such a sacrifice to drink your tea black?

Do say: ""Raw milk will make you lean and ripped.""

Don't say: ""Because you'll end up sick and dehydrated.""

Julia QuecaÃ±o Casimiro becomes first worker on post-Brexit scheme to launch claim after flying thousands of miles for short-term employment

When Julia QuecaÃ±o Casimiro left Chile to pick cherries in Herefordshire in June, she hoped she would finally save enough money to study biochemistry. Instead, when she left the farm a month later, she ended up homeless in London with little more than £100.

Casimiro, 23, has become the first person on a seasonal worker visa to take a farm to an employment tribunal. Her claim against Haygrove farm for unlawful deduction of wages, unfair dismissal, discrimination and harassment was filed last week and a preliminary hearing is expected in March.

Haygrove, which supplies cherries and berries to most leading supermarket chains, rejected her allegations and intends ""to defend the claim robustly"". The case has been brought by the United Voices of the World union, which represents some of Britain's most vulnerable low-paid workers.

Casimiro grew up in Bolivia, where she worked from the age of 11, doing jobs to prop up the family's income as small-scale farmers. She was one of 134 Latin American workers who came to the farm but is alone in taking it to tribunal. ""We were all used to working really hard but we wanted to make money,"" she said.

When Casimiro arrived on the farm, terrible weather meant there was initially no work. For 12 days, she sat in a rain-hammered caravan wondering how she would make back the cost of the flight and visas. The farm lent her and the others between £50 and £100 for essentials and did not charge for accommodation during this period but did not pay them.

When work finally began in July, Casimiro said the conditions were not what she expected.

""There was constant shouting at us,"" she claimed, saying that one supervisor in particular would often raise their voice. Haygrove disputed her account and said no grievances had been raised previously about the supervisor.

Casimiro said there was no drinking water available where they picked cherries and that she ended up eating the fruit to quench her thirst, for which she was reprimanded.

Haygrove said water was provided in all picking fields by team leaders and that this was regularly audited. It added that eating fruit was forbidden for hygiene reasons.

Casimiro and other workers living in the caravans had to leave at 4.20am to be bussed 90 minutes away to one of the farm's other West Country sites. They were not paid for this time and Casimiro said she had expected to be living where she worked. Haygrove said she was offered the chance to move to the other site but chose not to, something Casimiro denies.

Casimiro said that on the day she raised concerns about the farm with a senior colleague, she was told she would not have a shift the next day.

""I was very upset,"" she said. ""I felt they were taking the job away not because of my work but because of what I'd dared to say.""

Haygrove denied this. A spokesperson said that higher-performing workers were allocated more shifts so it was ""entirely possible"" that she was not required to work, but that feedback was welcomed and never reflected in work allocation.

Casimiro said that when she was first recruited for the work in Chile back in May, she was told she could make about £500 a week and that she would have to repay no more than $1,000 (£800) for the cost of a flight.

While Casimiro was waiting around in the caravan, she received a flight bill of more than £1,500 to be repaid in six weekly £250 instalments.

Haygrove said workers were given a guide flight cost of between £1,000 and £1,400 but that flights turned out to be more expensive - and the issue became a flashpoint because of a discrepancy in the face value of the tickets and what the travel agent charged.

The farm loaned the flight cost to reduce the risk of modern slavery and paid the discrepancy in price.

After receiving the flight bill, Casimiro and many of her Latin American colleagues went on an unofficial strike. Some negotiated with the farm and returned to work but Casimiro left.

Casimiro believes that Britons would not accept the conditions ""because they have better options"".

She added: ""The only people who will accept it are people like me who are in need and are not really aware of what they are signing up for.""

Haygrove said that when it recruited British workers during the pandemic, they picked at a third of the rate and did not stay on but did not complain about conditions.

Brexit and the war in Ukraine have created a recruitment crisis for farms, who had relied on Ukrainian pickers when the supply of EU workers dried up. The seasonal worker scheme was designed as a solution, allowing farms to bring workers thousands of miles for short-term employment while the workers shouldered the cost of their own flights and visas.

The Guardian revealed last year that Indonesian workers were left with debts of up to £5,000 to third parties after coming to pick fruit in the UK and being given little work to do. Since then, the government changed its policy to make sure seasonal workers are guaranteed 32 hours work a week.

But David Camp, the director of the Association of Labour Providers, said the rules requiring employers to guarantee 32 hours did not specify that workers' contracts have to start when they arrive on farms, allowing them to hold off paying wages until weather improves.

""The 32-hour rule was a step forward but changes to the scheme rules are still required to ensure fairness for all seasonal workers,"" Camp said. ""Where this increases costs for growers, this must be reflected in increases to prices paid to farms.""

When asked if she regretted her decision to come to Britain, Casimiro started to cry. ""I've regretted it 1,000 times because it's been so hard,"" she said.

After leaving the farm, she ended up in London and said: ""I couldn't tell my family what was going on. I had no money, nowhere to go and I didn't know what to do.

""I wanted to kill myself because I felt I was trapped in this situation when I had sometimes £4 or £5 in my pocket and nowhere to go and no one to call. The only thing I could do, because I couldn't work, was to borrow more and more money.""

Casimiro's lawyer, Claire Marcel at the United Voices of the World union, said the scheme had been ""very badly made"" and that it should not be possible ""to just circumvent the labour shortages by recruiting further and further away"".

Haygrove said it always adhered to Home Office rules, that the 32-hour rule applied to the employment start date and that its seasonal workers averaged a 46-hour week this year.

Its director, Angus Davison, said: ""Ms Casimiro's frustration saw her leave Haygrove without notice, and with a free aeroplane ticket home, after working for us for only 11 days.

""However, the vast majority of cherrypickers remained with us in August, September and October and saw their hours of work increase to expectations as the weather regularised.

""We therefore believe that Ms Casimiro's position is born out of her short-lived, atypical, snapshot experience which coincided with extreme harvesting conditions.""

He added: ""This July, an isolated incident of discontent occurred involving a number of South American cherrypickers including Ms Casimiro.

""This discontent was prompted by distrust caused by a discrepancy in the face value of flight tickets and the amount loaned to workers for the tickets, and lower than typical hours of work available in the month of July as a result of not only poor but genuinely extraordinary weather conditions.""

Commenting on the apparent loophole that allows growers to push back start dates once workers arrive on farms, a government spokesperson said: ""The rules are clear that employers cannot withhold wages from workers in this manner."" They said inspectors had not found evidence of this practice on farms this season.

879,"Here's what's missing from the history of rural Britain: the hidden stories of women who shaped it","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/30/rural-britain-women-forestry-farmer-coalminer-communities","Here's what's missing from the history of rural Britain: the hidden stories of women who shaped it

Forestry wives, farmers' wives, coalminers' wives: they were the backbone of communities. But men always write the narratives

My mum is a forester's wife. Growing up, I remember her collecting logs every autumn and stacking them in the log shed, picking out the Sitka spruce needles from inside the drum of the washing machine.

When my brother and I were born in the 80s, prospects for working-class women in rural areas were few and far between. Especially for mothers. We grew up on a country estate in Yorkshire in a tied house, which meant it came with my dad's job. Each morning Dad set off for the woods with his lunchbox and Mum stayed at home to look after us.

We lived four miles from the closest village, which meant four winding miles to the nearest shop and, of course, the school. She kept us entertained by playing in the garden and going for walks, even in the rain. There were no playgrounds, and few friends close by. The isolation my mum must have felt is something I struggle to imagine.

While researching the lives of working-class women in rural Britain, I learned that historically, isolation wasn't seen as an issue for these communities. In the 1940s, the Forestry Commission built settlements for its workers in the far reaches of the UK - from deep forests in Wales to the far-flung woods of the Highlands. The men often worked for the same family or company, from dawn 'til dark, but being a long way from anything was a problem for the hidden pillar of these communities: the women.

In the Forestry Commission villages of the Highlands in the 1950s, it took some women a whole day just to get the shopping. One woman had to cycle two miles, then take a train, a ferry, and then a bus to get to the nearest town. And she could only buy what she could carry back. Others had to make do with lifts in timber wagons. If you forgot something for tea, you went without until the next week.

It is hard to find accounts of the lives of women in rural areas because who would have recorded them? They are the ""wives"" of the workers: the forestry wives, the farmers' wives, the coalminers' wives. The men's jobs brought them to these beautiful but brutal rural areas, but the women made everything work. Cooking, cleaning, fixing, managing the household and caring for the children; they were the backbones of these communities. Not only were some wives expected to fulfil the traditional role, they also helped their husbands with their rural trades. Anyone know a farmer's wife who isn't as much of a farmer as their husband? Lambing, tractor driving, harvesting?

Even coalmining was once a family affair. Women and children worked underground until a government act in 1842 banned them from doing so. Women, however, carried on working above ground, sorting out the coal - they needed to bring in some money somehow. But their contributions have largely been erased from history.

These are patterns that go back many centuries. My great-great-great-grandparents led a transient lifestyle. Charles, my two times great-grandad, worked on big engineering projects, quite often in rural areas. He was involved in the building of the Manchester ship canal and various reservoirs, and worked on the railways. Mary-Ann, his wife, had 13 children, five of whom died.

What strikes me is the regularity with which they moved, only to set up home again in a hut in a field alongside hundreds of others families. Hut 10, Big Field, 38 Canal Huts: their list of addresses reads like a plan for a new estate now abandoned. Not only was their home constantly filled with children, but it was also common practice to take in lodgers. The beds were filled night and day, as the men worked shifts. Can you imagine the washing? The damp clothes hung on the rafters, the coal fire never able to fully dry the garments.

I was five months pregnant with my third baby when I learned about what kind of life Mary-Ann must have led. When the censuswas taken in 1891, she was pregnant with her fifth child - and was housing 11 lodgers. Just five months later, her baby, James, died. Her next child was born 10 months after that.

Reading about her, I wanted to reach back in time and pull her forward. We may know a little about the men who built our canals, railways and reservoirs, but I wish we knew more about the women who lived alongside them, who have been just as important as the men in how the countryside has been shaped.

Coal fires and paraffin lamps, labourers and kids. I want to ask them, how did you keep the floor clean? Was there always something cooking for the next meal? Did you ever get a good night's sleep? The outside will have been brought in all day, the weather seeping in through the cracks in the building. How did they keep anyone alive?

When we think of work in the countryside, we picture the men working the land. Farmers toiling the earth, reservoir builders digging, foresters planting and harvesting. Alongside that image should be women like my mum stacking logs, forestry wives perched in the front cab of a timber lorry with their shopping at their feet, Mary-Ann, a full pregnant stomach, resting for a moment with a broom in her hand. All that silent, unrecorded work.

Rather than making products, Phytome alters the cultivation of the plants themselves in a bid to create new compounds

Elegantly refurbished farm buildings hardly merit a second look near the Cornish coast, but the CCTV cameras on stalks around the Trelonk estate hint at something unusual. This is not a second home, or Airbnb fodder: it's a cannabis business.

The buildings, overlooking a bend in the River Fal amid the peaceful Roseland peninsula, are home to Phytome Life Sciences, and one of the few legal marijuana crops in the UK.

Cannabis legalisation is gaining momentum around the world, with some US states, Canada, Portugal and Uruguay among the places that have decriminalised recreational use to varying extents. Mexico, Germany and Switzerland are among those who could follow soon. But even in stricter countries such as the UK, the door has been open since 2018 for prescribing cannabis-derived medical products.

Walk along the street in any large enough town in Britain and you can usually smell how successful, or otherwise, the UK's ban on cannabis is. However, medicinal cannabis companies still have to follow extremely strict licensing requirements. Phytome's laboratories may be in one of the most picturesque settings in Britain, but they have hefty security. There are 200kg bombproof doors, ram-raid-resistant wire mesh walls, and no recording devices.

Inside the building, racks of cannabis plants appear nearly black under rows of bright lights carefully tuned to different shades of purple, blue and pink and beyond; ultraviolet and far red light, invisible to the human eye, have the potential to stimulate the growth of useful compounds in the plants. Water, fertiliser and even humidity and carbon dioxide levels are controlled in order to find conditions that will stimulate the plant to produce chemicals that may have promising applications.

Phytome wants to ""make the plant programmable"" and ""take the next step in indoor agriculture"", says Sebastian Vaughan, Phytome's chief executive, on a tour of the site on a sunny February morning.

Cannabis-derived medicines are already used for pain relief, to treat some rare forms of epilepsy, and to help people undergoing chemotherapy. Phytome will research new ways of growing the plants, but it will also look beyond the best known substances they produce - THC (tetrahydrocannabinol, the controlled component that causes the cannabis high) and CBD (cannabidiol, which is increasingly available in high street products).

""Cannabis is a major area of opportunity,"" says Vaughan, suggesting there are as many as 500 chemicals in cannabis plants, compared with about 30 in a herb such as basil. ""Most people are focused on THC and CBD. Cannabis produces a heck of a lot of chemicals.""

But plants can be unpredictable - particularly if left exposed to the vagaries of Cornish weather. Vaughan hopes that by controlling every possible variable, the company can turn a ""herbal product into something that can be produced to high grade, high specification"".

For cannabis, the combination of legal recreational use and medicines is creating a large new market. Global sales of CBD, medical and adult-use cannabis reached $44.2bn (£36.6bn) in 2022, and could expand to $100.4bn by 2026, according to Prohibition Partners, a cannabis industry consultancy.

Other companies in the British Isles are also pursuing the medical marijuana market. GW Pharmaceuticals had been going for 20 years when it was bought by US pharma company Jazz in a $7.2bn deal in 2021. It sells a multiple sclerosis drug called Sativex, and another drug called Epidiolex to treat childhood epilepsy. Northern Leaf is growing medicinal cannabis in Jersey. Celadon Pharmaceuticals is aiming to grow as much as 15 tonnes of cannabis a year for pain relief at a plant in the West Midlands.

Phytome is looking at a different niche. Instead of providing plants or developing its own products, it does research and so does not produce cannabis products in big volumes or sell medicines itself. It will test combinations of light and nutrient mix (with an ambition to use artificial intelligence to predict the best recipes) before extracting the chemicals and analysing them the same day, and then feeding the data to partners.

Research contracts alone should allow it to break even within two years, says chairman David Richards, an automotive entrepreneur who was chair of Aston Martin until 2013. However, Phytome will also retain a stake in any intellectual property produced, meaning it could enjoy the benefits if any cannabis-derived medicine takes off.

Richards started building the business in 2019 after discussing business partner Mark Parnall's attempts to grow hemp and other plants with possible health benefits. (Parnall also has a project building an imitation second world war Spitfire fighter plane at the Trelonk estate.) It took two years and £4m in equity investment in the secure facilities to achieve a Home Office licence.

That ended up being a point in favour of the venture. ""There were very high barriers to entry and the UK had not got any facilities like Phytome that were available on a commercial basis,"" says Richards. It also offered the chance to create some high-value jobs in an area dominated by tourism and far from the Oxbridge-London pharma triangle. ""Lots of people said Cornwall was too remote and you wouldn't attract the talent,"" says Richards. ""That didn't deter us."" Twenty employees will expand to 50 if all goes to plan.

For Vaughan, joining the company was a promising opportunity after a career that has taken him through the City and software startups (as well as a stint in the Leicester Tigers rugby squad), but now his ambition is nothing less than ""expanding the medicinal pharmacopoeia"".

""These plants have been known for thousands of years for their properties,"" Vaughan says. ""Over time, the opportunity is to gain access to plants that are demonstrated in the ethnobotanical history of peoples. That opportunity is still, in my opinion, in the foothills.""

897,"High steaks society: who are the 12% of people consuming half of all beef in the US?","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/20/beef-usda-climate-crisis-meat-consumption","High steaks society: who are the 12% of people consuming half of all beef in the US?

Beef production is a huge climate crisis driver, and a new study says only a small percentage of the country does most of the eating

One of the biggest drivers of the climate crisis, accounting for a third of the planet's greenhouse gas emissions, is food production, with meat - particularly beef - at the top of the list.

The US is the biggest consumer of beef in the world, but, according to new research, it's actually a small percentage of people who are doing most of the eating. A recent study shows that on any given day, just 12% of people in the US account for half of all beef consumed in the US.

""It may be that some of those 12% don't realize the impacts that beef has on their health or the environment,"" said study author Diego Rose, professor and director of nutrition at Tulane University. ""The concern is, on a usual basis, are you eating a disproportionate amount?""

Research has shown that beef production, which goes hand in hand with deforestation to create grazing land for cows, is responsible for over 4.2bn metric tons of global carbon emissions. Consuming beef is up to 10 times more impactful than chicken, and over 50 times that of beans. Numerous health studies have shown risks of elevated heart disease from red meat.

So who is this 12% consuming all that beef?

Men and people between the ages of 50 and 65 were more likely to be in what the researchers dubbed as ""disproportionate beef eaters"", defined as those who, based on a recommended daily 2,200 calorie-diet, eat more than four ounces - the rough equivalent of more than one hamburger - daily. The study analyzed one-day dietary snapshots from over 10,000 US adults over a four-year period.

White people were among those more likely to eat more beef, compared with other racial and ethnic groups like Black and Asian Americans. Older adults, college graduates, and those who looked up MyPlate, the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) online nutritional educational campaign, were far less likely to consume a disproportionate amount of beef.

The USDA recommends eating no more than 4oz (113 grams) of all meat, poultry and egg products. On average, teenage boys consume more meat, poultry and eggs than is recommended by these guidelines, and for adult men, the distance from the recommendations is even greater, the study reveals.

Experts say there are deep historical and cultural reasons why beef intake is higher for men and boys.

""There's this connection between meat consumption and masculinity,"" said Joshua Specht, author of the book Red Meat Republic: A Hoof-to-Table History of How Beef Changed America. ""Historically, to be a successful man in America meant eating beef.""

Beef was first introduced in North America as European colonizers cleared Indigenous land and wildlife like bison. It became a core part of the nation's identity in the late 19th century, with the expansion in the United States west.

In the early 20th century, with the arrival of immigrants from Europe, where eating meat was reserved for special occasions, the vast grazing land and industrialization of beef production meant that the rare delicacy was more attainable. Federal subsidies for beef production later made it even cheaper and easier to access.

Now, amid growing public discourse over the dangers of meat consumption, Republicans have politicized meat. There have even been false claims that Joe Biden would ""take away"" hamburgers.

Specht said that meat is now part of ""what it means to be American"". ""Meat, apple pie, football, having a truck, it becomes a marker of identity.""

Making a positive impact on the climate doesn't necessarily mean giving up all meat - even reductions and substitutions can make a difference. A study from last year showed that people who replaced chicken for beef decreased their carbon dioxide emissions from food by 48% each day.

A recent study published in Nature shows that if by 2050, people substitute half of the global beef, chicken, pork and milk consumption for plant-based alternatives, emissions from agriculture and land use to produce these animal products would decline by 31%.

The way to approach such substitution should focus on ""trying to convince people to start with a gradual change"", said Marta Kozicka who authored the substitution study, ""as radical solutions might be a bit difficult to accept for some people"".

Rose says it's critical for educational programs to try to reach disproportionate beef eaters, since changing their diets will have the most impact. But is it possible? Specht is skeptical, given how ingrained our eating habits are, and says that a better strategy is to try to prevent people from becoming disproportionate eaters in the first place.

""There are lots of folks that can cut back,"" said Rose. ""The more people understand the health and environmental implications of beef eating, the more that some of them will eat less.""

He added: ""We may like the cheap price of beef, but we're paying a lot more for it than we realize.""

UK Biobank offers up biggest ever cache of whole-genome sequences for medical research

A new era of medical discoveries, treatments and cures is on the horizon, researchers say, following the announcement that an unprecedented trove of genetic information is to be made available to scientists.

Health researchers from around the world can now apply to study the whole genomes of half a million people enrolled in UK Biobank, a biomedical research project that has compiled detailed health and lifestyle records on individuals since it began 20 years ago.

The move on Thursday amounts to the largest number of whole-genome sequences ever released for medical research. The sequences will be used with UK Biobank's records and other data to delve deeply into the genetics of everything - from people's risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer and other conditions, to individuals' sleep and exercise patterns.

Researchers believe the new data will allow them to calculate people's individual risk scores for a raft of cancers and other diseases, and so work out who could benefit most from early screening.

They should also gain a deeper understanding of serious genetic conditions such as Huntington's and motor neurone disease, which have often been studied in small numbers of severely affected patients.

""This is a veritable treasure trove for approved scientists undertaking health research,"" said Prof Sir Rory Collins, principal investigator at UK Biobank. ""I expect it to have transformative results for diagnoses, treatments and cures around the globe.""

Health experts from academia, the government, industry and charities can apply for access though they have to be approved and study the genomes through a protected database stripped of identifying details such as names, addresses, birth dates, and GP information.

A person's risk of developing disease is typically a complex interplay of genetics, lifestyle and environment. By studying the whole genomes of hundreds of thousands of people, researchers can identify specific variants of genes that are involved in a raft of diseases and explore which are promising drug targets.

Until 2021 scientists could study only about 1% of the DNA of UK Biobank volunteers - the fraction that encodes proteins. Since then, whole genomes have been released for 200,000 participants, but work continued to sequence all of the 500,000 volunteers.

With that number of whole genomes in hand, researchers will be able to find much rarer genes which drive diseases, including those that behave like switches and turn other genes on and off.

Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, said having access to the whole genomes would make it easier for scientists to spot rare genetic variants that only crop up in small numbers of people but which can be crucial for understanding disease.

""Even the identification of one or two people can give you a read on what a gene might do and how it might contribute to disease,"" Bell said. ""That is hugely important for discovering drugs and it's also hugely important in understanding the role of genes generally in biology. Scale is really important.""

Aiden Doherty, professor of biomedical informatics at Oxford, will study the genomes to understand which genes affect people's sleep and levels of physical activity. Some of these genes are expected to have broader health implications since poor sleep and inactivity are strongly linked to ill health.

Doherty said: ""This really will be gamechanging. What are the genetic drivers that predispose some people to be more active than others and some people to sleep better than others?

""I don't have a clue what we'll find, but I'm really excited to find out. Could we find something in this treasure trove of data, perhaps some target that could mimic the effects of exercise? I can't say whether we'll find that or not. But this is our best bet.""

Dr Zahra Raisi-Estabragh, an academic clinical lecturer at Queen Mary, University of London, uses medical scans from the UK Biobank to identify subgroups of obesity.

While some people accumulate fat directly beneath the skin, in others it collects around internal organs. ""We've shown that fat around the heart has a distinct disease-causing potential compared to fat elsewhere,"" she said.

She plans to delve into the UK Biobank genomes to see which genetic variants drive harmful patterns of body fat and so determine who is most at risk. ""There's much more potential for a new scientific discovery,"" she said.

This article was amended on 30 November 2023. The subheading of an earlier version said BioBank, instead of Biobank.

922,"Pass the yogurt: can probiotics help negate the toxicity of plastic in our stomachs?","https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2023/nov/27/probiotics-plastics-fermented-food-bacteria-stomach-benefit","Pass the yogurt: can probiotics help negate the toxicity of plastic in our stomachs?

Research suggests bacteria in fermented foods may ameliorate some inflammation that microplastics promote in our system

The topic of microplastics and our bodies is disconcerting. It seems like there's little we can do about the tiny particles that have found their way into our blood, brains, lungs and beyond.

Encouragingly, a body of research now suggests we have at least one cheap, accessible line of defense against the damage associated with plastics in our digestive systems: probiotics. There is already evidence that these bacteria, found in fermented foods such as yogurt, sauerkraut and kimchi, support our immune systems and offer benefits that can alleviate gastrointestinal issues, inflammation and allergies. Now, it seems they could help us fight some effects of these pervasive petrochemical particles.

How do microplastics affect our stomachs?

Multiple studies have demonstrated that nanoplastics can enter our blood and organs and cross the mucosal barrier into our gastrointestinal tracts.

While more research is needed to determine the relationship between plastic and gastrointestinal disorders, preliminary findings suggest ingesting plastic isn't doing us any favors.

A Tufts University study published this June found that high concentrations of polystyrene particles ""significantly triggered the secretion"" of inflammatory proteins called cytokines in in-vitro gut models. Cytokines are linked to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, which have been rising globally from 3.7m cases in 1990 to more than 6.8m in 2017.

A causal link is not yet clear, because factors such as a diet high in ultra-processed foods, smoking and exposure to air pollution are also linked to IBD. But researchers increasingly believe microplastics, which are filled with various harmful chemicals including additives like bisphenol A (BPA), flame retardants and phthalates, also play a role.

For a January 2023 study published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials, French researchers added microplastics to a modeled gut biome and observed that beneficial bacteria declined, while two strains of bacteria associated with disease increased. A 2021 Chinese study determined that people with inflammatory bowel disease have 50% more microplastics in their feces than those with healthy stomachs.

When gut microbes feed on or adhere to microplastics in the stomach, it can alter their chemical composition, affecting bacterial diversity and causing other ""negative effects, including changes in gut metabolic profiles and inflammation"", wrote the authors of a 2022 Spanish study. In more extreme cases, they said it could contribute to a condition called ""dysbiosis"", in which bad bacteria outnumbers the good in our stomachs. Dysbiosis can increase the likelihood of developing other serious conditions, including diabetes, Crohn's disease and colorectal cancer.

How do probiotics and microplastics interact?

Unfortunately, probiotics can't magically pluck plastic particles out of our bodies. However, some research suggests that the good microbes could help ameliorate some of the toxicity and inflammation plastics promote in our gastrointestinal systems.

This summer, a team of Iranian researchers published a review study exploring how probiotics could protect against the adverse effects of plastics on gut flora. Probiotic micro-organisms may interact with polystyrene particles ""to modify their toxic effects on different tissues"", they wrote.

They cite studies that show probiotics binding to, absorbing and neutralizing toxic heavy metals like cadmium and mercury in animals, as well as two separate studies from 2021 that determined probiotic strains including lactobacillus plantarum, found in fermented dairy and pickles, bound to and degraded BPA and phthalates, both harmful chemicals commonly found in plastic.

""The use of probiotic supplementation for improving the microbiome could be an effective intervention to counter different toxins,"" including those that leach from plastic, the Iranian research team wrote.

For a separate 2023 study, Chinese researchers first observed that mice exposed to microplastics and their endocrine-disrupting chemicals experienced testicular inflammation, decreased sperm health and a depletion of healthy gut bacteria. They then found that supplementing the mice with probiotics increased sperm vitality, providing a solid foundation for further research into ""male reproductive damage caused by environmental pollutants"".

Can probiotics affect microplastics before ingestion?

Not only could certain probiotics help our gut - they could help reduce the chemical additives that leach out of food and beverage packaging before they even make it into our bodies.

There is promising research on the interaction between probiotics and BPA in food containers. BPA, as well as other harmful bisphenols sometimes used in its place, is commonly found in cans and hard polycarbonate plastic bottles used to hold food and drink. These additives are known to leach from containers and into the consumer products we ingest.

A Chinese study from 2019 found that when a preparation of the probiotic lactobacillus reuteri was added to juice and teas packaged in BPA-containing cans, the probiotic reduced the concentration of the chemical in the beverages by at least 90% in one day.

In 2020, Iranian researchers reached a similarly encouraging conclusion by making yogurt out of various probiotic strains of bacteria and milk intentionally contaminated with 100 parts-per-million BPA; after 28 days of storage, yogurt made with lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus acidophilus had detoxified the BPA by 95% and 90% respectively.

Is there any reason to be cautious about probiotic use?

The science behind what plastic does to our bodies and what benefits probiotics may offer is still preliminary. Yet researchers are finding support for the theory that common strains of probiotics, particularly lactic acid bacteria like those found in yogurt, sourdough bread and pickles, could help counteract the effects of the chemicals that microplastics ferry into our bodies when ingested.

It's wise to talk to your doctor before taking probiotic supplements, which aren't always consistent in quality or effect; in the US, they're not evenly regulated. However, probiotics from fermented foods are widely considered safe and generally beneficial for human health, so you can feel good about eating more of them. They're affordable and delicious to boot. Just be sure to stick with recommended serving sizes, as large quantities of probiotics can lead to minor digestive upsets like gas and bloating. Pass the yogurt!

Swanage, Dorset: To the urban dweller, house sparrows are birds of nostalgia. So I can't help but stop and enjoy this crew

I've gone to get fish and chips, and a bush has started chirping at me. Not just one chirp, either. A barrage. I've never met such a chatty bush.

Swanage is hot, sandy, lazy. A seaside minibreak, wringing the last drops of summer from the year. A squabble of herring gulls argue over a chip. Crows loiter with intent to scavenge. A pied wagtail bounces overhead, lands on a patch of sandy grass, and struts its wind-up toy walk, on the lookout for scraps. British seasiders play fast and loose with the foodstuffs, and there are easy pickings to be had. So the chatty bush is no surprise.

They are house sparrows, the ultimate LBJ (little brown job) and as enthusiastic a devourer of our leftovers as you'll find. Thirty of them, give or take, babbling and chattering and falling over each other to say hello. Spadger, spug, squidgie, sparky, sprog - the wealth of folk names is a reflection of their former ubiquity.

This encounter lifts the heart in strange and unfathomable ways. Back in the day they were so commonplace that 30 in a bush would barely have merited a glance. But times change, and now, on the comparatively rare occasions I do see them on my south London patch, I greet them with the exuberance reserved for old friends. The population decline has been sharp - up to 70% between 1977 and 2018, with signs of a slight increase since then. The usual reasons are suspected - habitat loss, lack of suitable food, closing up of the little spaces where they like to nest.

But sparrows are hardy and adaptable, and they like being around us. Recent research shows that the relationship goes back 11,000 years, to the development of agriculture. Their worldwide dispersal only actually came in the last two centuries, coinciding with Victorian expansion of empire, and enabled by genes that allow them to digest starchy grains - an ability lacking in their ancestors.

Further along the beach, a Punch and Judy show - another declining species - blares out a tale of cartoon violence and sausages to an appreciative crowd. The gulls and crows - Jets and Sharks - bicker over a discarded sandwich. A lone sparrow pops up to the fringe of the bush and gives an enquiring chirp. Cocking its head, it clearly realises I'm a dead loss and disappears back into the depths.

After a difficult childhood, three marriages and bereavement, there's no denying 79-year-old Morag Chisholm brings plenty of life experience to her job

Morag Chisholm was 67 when she completed an MA in relationship therapy and began to work as a counsellor. ""The wonderful thing was that at no point did anyone suggest I was too old,"" she says. ""I could use all the knowledge, life experience and wisdom accumulated over the years to benefit others.""

Chisholm, who works for Relationships Scotland in Dumfries and Galloway, will turn 80 in December and still has clients. As well as the degree, her inventory of ""what I have done since 60"" includes a divorce and a marriage, followed by bereavement when her third husband died four years ago of cancer.

Chisholm has spent most of her working life as an accountant, and there is a sense when she speaks that she is mindful of the loss column, of the inputs and outputs of her life. Her father was in the forces, and her early years were spent in Malta. When the family returned to England, Chisholm says that she felt ""most definitely an outsider. I didn't belong. That has been a constant theme.""

Even as a child in her own home, she felt that way. Relations with her mother were strained. ""I was a girl. Therefore, I should like dolls and dressing up. No thank you. I wanted train engines and Meccano. I liked animals."" The words ""What have we done to deserve you?"" became a refrain. ""I spent a lot of energy making sure she didn't control me,"" Chisholm says. ""But it meant that I was quite isolated. I learned to be extremely self-reliant. I'm not saying that's healthy. But it has kept me alive. People talk about crossroads in life. I don't. I talk about T-junctions. Do I just give up and fail? Or do I set myself up to continue?""

Chisholm married for the first time in her mid-20s, and separated at 27, when she was in her first year of a degree in agricultural studies. Knuckling down after failing her first year is one of the T-junctions she has in mind. She met her second husband while still at university, and after they graduated they started a smallholding together in north Wales.

They had a hectare or two, and Chisholm bred goats for dairy and show. ""They were my passion for about 20 years,"" she says, although she bristled recently when someone referred to it as an obsession. At any rate, she had goats, and her husband had cars, and agricultural study gave Chisholm an unsentimental appreciation of life. ""You are responsible for bringing these animals into the world, and you are responsible for taking them out.""

Chisholm was ""never interested in having children"". An only child, she has relatives - ""in the sense of people being related to me"" - but, she says, ""no contact"" with them.

Was she drawn to therapy to help make sense of her own relationships? ""I wasn't conscious of it, but almost certainly,"" she says. Her second marriage was nearing its end. On the day she finished her relationship training, her mother died.

""Thank goodness I did that therapy training. It helped me to be more objective,"" she says. Although Chisholm and her second husband divorced, and she has since self-published a novel based on her experience, she was able to approach the separation with ""an enormous amount of self-knowledge. I appreciated that no one person can take all the blame ""¦ I'm not an easy person to live with, because I'm very self-contained.""

When they divided their assets, Chisholm's second husband kept their car, and she kept their boat; they had enjoyed sailing. On the lookout for crew, she met her third husband, who also sailed. ""I needed an anchor,"" she says. His death, after his cancer diagnosis, ""was quite quick, which was a blessing"".

Chisholm believes that her ""varied life"" helps her counselling. She is calm, compassionate, objective and professional. ""Once you're outside the room, you get emotional,"" she says.

Sometimes, a client tells her that talking has really helped. ""Gradually, it's taught me to realise that I do have a value. I have something to give, and it is appreciated,"" she says. ""But also - I really appreciate people thinking that. It's a two-way process. That has helped to enrich me, and to enrich my life.""
