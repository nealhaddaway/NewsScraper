Higher working capital requirements will put a squeeze on cashflow for many farming businesses this year, so finding ways to generate new income streams or save time and money could be crucial.

Looking at different aspects of a farming business can present opportunities to make marginal gains which can add up to bigger savings.

Farmers Weekly asked three farm business consultants for ideas on some more unusual ways to make extra money, improve business efficiency and raise finance.

Meet the experts

1. Check mobile phone and internet contracts

 Letting phone contracts drift on without reviewing them can be an expensive mistake. We were doing a budget for a farmer and were surprised to find the mobile phone bill was £7,000 a year.

Some digging revealed the business was paying for eight handsets, one of which had not worked for years. The farm was also still picking up the tab for their adult children who were not involved in the business.

2. Rent a room

Renting out a spare room is a good way of making some additional income to cover rises in living expenses and can offer some company.

We know of a couple of farmers who have rented out rooms to graduates on Spareroom.com because the house felt too quiet after their children left home.

If you live within 10 miles of a university, there may be potential to let out a room to a student from a farming background who prefers to live on a farm, rather than in a traditional house share.

The government's Rent a Room Scheme lets you earn up to a threshold of £7,500 a year tax-free from letting out furnished accommodation in your home.

3. Temporary lets

Letting out buildings is a popular form of diversification, but it doesn't necessarily need to be on an all-year-round basis.

Consider whether there are any alternative uses for farm buildings at different times of year to help generate a new income stream.

For example, one client rents out their grain store, once their own grain has been sold, to a business selling firewood and woodchip and uses it to dry out the wood.

4. Sell off spare machinery

Most farmers will have surplus machinery that they are holding onto in case they need it. With demand booming for second-hand kit over recent years, it may be more sensible to sell it on.

Hauling machines to a collective sale can take time and cost, so consider a national online sale which allows farmers to sell odd bits of kit.

Paul Waberski, Brown & Co

5. Pension scheme options

In 2015, the government introduced changes that give greater flexibility to how a pension pot can be used. It is now possible to draw down a proportion of a pension to invest in commercial property.

This means farmers can be more inventive about how they use their retirement money and generate a new income stream.

Paul Waberski, Brown & Co

6. Review farm vehicle usage

Ask yourself whether you really need the 22mpg 4×4 parked in the yard for that trip to collect parts and go shooting, or would a cheap runabout suffice?

Shift half the annual mileage to a vehicle doing twice the mpg, which costs half as much to service and a third less in tyres - plus saving mileage-related depreciation on a high-value vehicle - and you could save more than £1,500 a year.

William Tongue, Berrys

7. Get to grips with energy consumption

Monitor electricity meters to understand daily consumption and use metering plug sockets or sub meters to find out the main contributors.

Consider improvements to efficiency, reduction in usage and ways to bill consumption more effectively to tenants.

Install renewables where there is a good match between consumption and production (and maybe improve the match with battery storage).

William Tongue, Berrys

8. Beware the machinery treadmill

On many farms, the automatic response to high tax bills is advanced machinery investments.

This results in high depreciation, removal of cash from the business (£1 spent may save 40p in tax, but still sees 60p removed), and it fuels a treadmill of 100% writing down allowances which encourages the same behaviour to repeat.

Reinvest where the result gives efficiency gains and system changes, rather than simply new for old - so say ""yes"" to solar panels, grain bins, reduced depth cultivators, and ""no"" to newer versions of existing tech.

William Tongue, Berrys

9. High-return diversifications

All too often the cash return from a new project is swallowed in tax and loan repayments. For example, a project funded over 10 years at current interest rates will need a 20% return on capital just to break even in cashflow terms.

Few projects offer high returns without substantial risk. Building rentals, container storage and dog exercise paddocks all work numerically, although will be very location specific.

So, the most effective form of diversification might be the hardest to accept - identifying who really needs to be hands-on in the business and who could bring in cash or become self-supporting through a job off-farm could be the most significant way to generate cash, particularly for tenants.

If succession to an Agricultural Holdings Act tenancy is a prospect, be careful not to jeopardise the successor's case through them earning too much away from the tenanted holding.

10. Adopt lean thinking

Lean thinking is a business approach which involves focusing on what delivers most value. So, the idea is you spend on processes and inputs that contribute to output, but hold back on incurring costs which don't.

Examples could include holding back on annual hedgecutting, except where needed for safety reasons, and repeated mowing of unfarmed grass areas.

11. Take advantage of free advice

Farmers can access free advice and business support worth up to £2,000 a farm, by signing up to the Future Farming Resilience Fund.

It is designed to help farmers understand the changes they are facing and how they can adapt their business models.

There are 17 providers funded by Defra to give this consultancy support. However, the package each provider delivers is different - for example, group workshops, online webinars, or on-farm one-to-one support.

So before signing up to any one company, investigate what support you will be getting and whether you gel with the person you will be working with.

12. Time and task management tools

Trello is a free project management tool where you can set up lists to help record what needs to be done and plan which jobs need to be prioritised.

It's a bit like a virtual whiteboard, which is accessed from a smartphone and syncs with a desktop and laptop.

It's useful for planning time effectively and provides a central list that can be shared with family members and employees.

They can add their own comments, so everyone knows what has been actioned and what is still to do.

It might take a little getting used to, but effective communication saves time and, ultimately, money.

Simon Haley, SRH Agribusiness

13. Henry Plumb Foundation

If you are 18-35 and have a fresh business idea, then the Henry Plumb Foundation may offer financial support.

It provides funding of £500-£3,000 which can be used to pump-prime a new enterprise, or the money can be used to pay for study plans that will further your career in farming or the food industry.

The scheme also offers successful applicants access to a mentor for three years.

Investigate whether there may be other bursaries and scholarships available from colleges, universities, agricultural businesses and local show societies to fund travel plans or new start-up enterprises.

Simon Haley, SRH Agribusiness

14. Sign up for e-alerts

Sign up for email alerts which will keep you ahead of the game, particularly when it comes to information about grant schemes and new policy.

For example, it is possible to subscribe to email alerts every time the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) makes a change to any of its grant schemes which can be sent to you weekly.

Visit the RPA page on gov.uk and look for the ""Get emails"" link.

15. Alternative finance options

For those struggling to raise finance from a high-street bank, alternatives such as Community Development Finance Institutions may be worth exploring.

These are locally based, not-for-profit social organisations which can provide finance where customers might not fit the banks' usual lending criteria.

One such organisation is Enterprise Answers, based in Cumbria, which offers finance from £10,000-£150,000 for business needs such as working capital, growth, equipment and premises.

4,"Profits squeeze will hasten structural change in farming","https://www.fwi.co.uk/business/business-management/profits-squeeze-will-hasten-structural-change-in-farming","Profits squeeze will hasten structural change in farming

Costs are lower in general than a year ago, but still at elevated levels, while output values in several sectors are down considerably.

UK farming is likely to see big structural change in the next five to 10 years and 2024 may be the year when changes “hit home” in England, says consultant Andersons, with slightly more relaxed timing in Scotland and Wales.

The most challenged sector over the next five to 10 years is expected to be grazing livestock, followed closely by combinable cropping farms.

See also: Making a will – what farmers should consider

This prediction results from the reliance on subsidy in the grazing livestock sector, made up mainly of smaller farms, with combinable cropping holdings also having been high subsidy recipients in the past.

The firm's latest analysis and sector budgets show the impact of persistently high and rising inflation, especially on overheads, while output prices have been falling in key sectors such as dairy and cereals.

Inflation is also eroding the real-terms value of direct support. The shift from high to more “normal” profits will challenge cashflows, especially in respect of tax and working capital demands, with the cost of borrowing having tripled in a short time frame.

England's Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) is starting to provide limited cash support, but will not displace the guaranteed income of the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS).

Watch points

Agflation, Tiff outlook and impact of inflation

Andersons' “agflation” index shows that, over the past couple of years, the rise in the cost of inputs has been matched to a large extent by similar rises in farmgate selling prices.

However, recent falls in milk and cereal prices have led to a divergence, with the inputs index rising in summer 2023 while the outputs index is falling.

""This divergence puts profits under pressure,"" says Richard King, head of business research at Andersons. 

Defra's Total Income from Farming (Tiff), measuring the aggregate profit of the UK farming sector, shows record returns of almost £8bn for 2022 when, in general, sale prices were high and cost increases had not fully come through.

Updates to these Defra figures are common and Andersons expects the 2022 profits figures to be revised down.

The firm estimates Tiff for 2023 and 2024 will be back in the “normal” range of £5bn-£6bn, with 2023 at just under £5bn and representing a fall of about 40% compared with 2022.

""It won't feel as good as it has been, but it won't be a disaster,"" says Richard.

Farm borrowing and saving

Real-terms farm borrowing rose after the 2008 crash then plateaued for about five years between 2016 and 2021.

Since then, 2021 and 2022 profits in many farm businesses have given the scope to reduce debt.

The cost of finance has almost tripled in a very short space of time and while many farms borrow little or nothing, the rapid rise in the interest burden is already challenging some of those other businesses.

Scotland and Wales

BPS remains the main source of farm support in Scotland and Wales for 2024, with little change.

“Conditionality” requirements become part of a successful BPS claim from 2025 in Scotland, requiring farmers to take action relating to greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity, animal health and welfare and other areas.

More detail is expected on the conditionality rules early next year, while 2026 will see the start of the introduction of a new four-tier structure of farm support for Scotland through to 2027, with a base payment and top-ups for different actions.

In Wales, the Sustainable Farming Scheme (SFS) replaces the BPS and Glastir from 2025, with a three-layered payment, starting with universal requirements of 10% woodland on farms, habitats, soils, animal health and other obligations.

The next layer will offer payments for actions to enhance the environment, and the third layer will reward collaborative action.

""The current proposals ask quite a lot from farmers [for a potentially low payment]. It remains to be seen whether these requirements will be altered before the final scheme,"" says Richard.

Updated budgets for Andersons' model farms (see tables below) show the impact of the changes in input, output and support payments for England.

Arable

“Loam Farm” is a notional arable business, based on real-life data and has been running for more than 30 years, tracking the fortunes of combinable cropping farms.

It is a 600ha farm growing milling and feed wheat, winter oats, spring barley and spring beans. Oilseed rape was dropped some years ago due to its unreliability.

The farm is set to make a positive margin from production of the 2023 harvest but will see a big drop on the two previous years' results.

It was an early adopter of SFI, earning £40/ha from this source in the 2023 harvest year and building on that to £83/ha in 2024.

While milling and malting premiums for the 2023 crop have risen, the gap between feed wheat and feed barley prices has widened as feed demand from pigs and poultry in particular has fallen.

Variable costs should fall further for the 2024 harvest, but with overheads continuing to rise, the budget for the second year running shows a profit of about a quarter of that from the 2022 harvest.

Dairy

GB milk price rises overshot where world markets would have said they should be through 2022, says Andersons, and despite the farmgate cuts in the first half of this milk year, improvements in wholesale dairy commodity markets will be needed to prevent further GB farmgate milk cuts through to the spring flush.

Andersons' “Friesian Farm” model is a notional 200-plus cow business in the Midlands with a constituent basis milk contract. It has year-round calving and is trying to maximise yield from forage.

The firm's estimate for the current milk year reflects the big drop in prices so far, with further price pain to come factored into the average for the year as a whole, resulting in a negative margin from production despite lower costs.

Typical of most dairy holdings, this farm has not yet committed to the SFI. The 2024-25 estimate includes some further variable cost reductions and what Andersons terms a “normal” milk price, putting the farm just into positive margin territory.

Beef and sheep

Andersons' “Meadow Farm” is a fictional 154ha beef and sheep holding in the Midlands, also growing wheat and barley mainly for feed. It has 60 spring-calving suckler cows and finishes all progeny, a dairy bull beef enterprise and a 500-ewe breeding flock.

In 2021-22, the farm made a margin from production for the first time in many years. The following year was much more challenging. Costs rose substantially, especially feed, and the farm made a loss of £208/ha from production, with a BPS cut putting the farm into an overall loss.

For the current year, 2023-24, high beef prices look like producing a higher livestock gross margin but a lower crop gross margin. Overhead costs continue to drift upwards and the farm again makes a loss from production, although smaller than the previous year's loss.

The 2024-25 estimate year shows a further deterioration in the margin mainly through lower output prices and another BPS cut, resulting in a loss. This type of farm needs to examine the SFI for scope to recoup some of the “lost” BPS, says Andersons.

7,"Project shows how farming can hit - or better - net zero","https://www.fwi.co.uk/business/project-shows-how-farming-can-hit-or-better-net-zero","Project shows how farming can hit - or better - net zero

A pioneering carbon project in Northern Ireland has demonstrated that farms can make structured progress towards net zero and revealed that some are already hitting the target.

Under NI's Climate Change Act (2022), businesses must cut emissions by 48% before 2030 and make a 100% reduction, or reach net zero, by 2050.

Agriculture in NI is key to those targets as the largest contributor to its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, accounting for about 27% of the total output.

Because of this figure, NI farmers have been a major focus for policymakers, campaigners and the media.

However, these groups have persistently overlooked the fact that, unlike other sectors, agriculture has a capacity to capture, manage and store carbon.

Carbon stocks

And that is where the Accelerating Ruminant Carbon Zero - or ARC Zero - project comes in.

It aims to show that the focus on emissions alone does not paint an accurate or fair picture of the farming sector, which can go well beyond offsetting its own emissions.

The project was set up by Professor John ­Gilliland of Queen's University Belfast, a dry­stock farmer, former Ulster Farmers' Union president and environment adviser to the AHDB.

John wanted to respond to the criticisms that have been made without science-based ­evidence.

He says: ""Farming is being short-changed in the environmental debate, with no recognition of our ability to manage carbon. Too much of this debate is about emotion and not about data.

""Everyone talks about gross carbon emissions but won't talk about sequestration. Farming builds carbon stocks as well as creating emissions, so we felt it was being unfairly treated.""

Since the project began an initial phase in April 2021, the data produced has revealed that farmers manage huge carbon stocks totalling tens of thousands of tonnes stored in soil, pasture, crops, trees and livestock.

Importantly, it has shown that net zero is achievable within the target timeframes and demonstrated how farmers can both cut emissions and increase their carbon storage.

""I can now demonstrate to any detractors that I successfully manage 24,400t of carbon on my own farm,"" says John.

""I can face farming's critics and ask, ""˜can you do that?' I can also say, ""˜you need me in the push towards net zero'.

""Farmers are down and confused about managing carbon and how to reach net zero. But there is a way forward, so it is time to lift our heads, get on the front foot and prove to the public and governments that we can deliver net zero,"" he insists.

Ahead of the project start date in 2021 John recruited six other farmers across a range of farming types. ""We set out to amass the highest degree of quality data so that nobody could question our credibility,"" he says.

ARC Zero farmers

The target was to work out a figure for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions set against carbon sequestration, to get a net farming position. The first stage after recruitment was to establish a baseline for carbon stocks.

This was achieved by:

What is Lidar?

Light Detection And Ranging (Lidar) is a remote sensing technology which uses the light from a laser to collect measurements. These are used to create highly detailed 3D images of objects and maps that are more accurate and revealing than satellite scans.

Auditing

Auditing began in April 2021 using SAC's AgreCalc tool. The process was comprehensive and exhaustive, with data captured on stock numbers, ages, animal production performance, feed use, and buying and selling.

Also factored in were fuel and fertiliser use, including applications, utilisation of animal manures, fodder conservation and electricity consumption.

Soil analysis

Farms were divided into 2ha blocks, including woodland, with each site recorded on GPS. Core samples were taken at 25 points in each block, to a depth of 7.5cm in grassland and 15cm in arable fields. Samples were then analysed for:

Further soil sampling took place at greater depths, cross-referenced to previous management of those fields to measure carbon stocks.

The project used Agricarbon, a dedicated soil sampling company that operates across the UK, EU and parts of North America. It was introduced to take deeper soil samples at levels to 1m, or as far as the rock below would allow.

The analysis accurately measured soil carbon percentage and fine bulk density at 0-15cm, 15-30cm, 30-60cm and 60-100cm to give totals of carbon that would otherwise have been unaccounted for.

Agricarbon's involvement also lent greater robustness to the process because of its recognised laboratory analysis procedure.

Above-ground carbon

Above-ground carbon levels were also measured in trees and hedgerows.

This was carried out by BlueSky International using aircraft-mounted Lidar to form a 3D image from 40 scans a metre.

The scans build up a precise 3D picture of trees, hedgerows, pasture and cropping which would otherwise be impossible as satellites cannot deliver this resolution.

Carbon levels were then calculated by Agrifood and Biosciences Unit Northern Ireland (AFBI) via a system initially trialled by Teagasc and ratified by Ireland's Environmental Protection agency.

Across the seven farms the results revealed a carbon store of more than 515,000t, in soil and above ground.

""This is a huge stock. Once we knew forensically, for the first time, the extent of what we were holding, we could manage it to keep it locked up or add to it, for the repeat measurement in five years' time,"" says John.

With the precise carbon stocks and emissions identified, the project entered a second phase to improve via:

Management changes

Lidar scanning proved to be hugely beneficial beyond delivering an accurate measurement of the carbon stored above ground. Scanning results provided detailed images of field features and contours, says John.

The data highlighted areas that were prone to saturation, run-off, soil erosion and, therefore, nutrient loss and impact on water quality.

Tree planting/buffer strips

Erosion and nutrient concentration maps were important in knowing where to site buffer strips.

As well as reducing water pollution, buffer strips can be sited in such a way that they slow or channel flows.

This reduces nutrient losses, maintaining productivity. One of the group achieved this by planting woodland as a riparian strip beside a watercourse.

Another of the seven farms used the Lidar data to switch an erosion-prone zone from production to strategic tree planting to slow down the run-off and mop up surplus phosphate.

The trees also sequester significant quantities of carbon as they grow, enhance biodiversity and help support production performance by providing shelter for livestock, John says.

Multispecies swards and pH

Other farms planted deep-rooting herbs and nitrogen-fixing legumes. This negated the need for artificial fertiliser on these high-risk areas, avoiding losses and reducing nitrous oxide emissions.

Farmers also opted to stitch in clover to cut artificial nitrogen applications.

Another practice widely taken up across pasture was the use of multispecies swards including deep-rooting herbs such as chicory and leguminous red clover.

The deeper rooting swards, some reaching depths of 60cm, benefited soil structure, further improving drainage and carbon storage capabilities.

To make land more suitable for legume growing, particularly red clover, a number of the farms introduced liming to raise pH towards 6.5. This brought multiple benefits.

Managing pH had the additional effect of chemically unlocking soil nutrients that could then be taken up by swards or crops, limiting the need for further artificial fertiliser applications.

Earthworm populations are also better able to thrive in a more balanced pH, so improving soil structure.

However, the use of multispecies swards meant making adjustments to grazing patterns.

Multispecies swards need more time to recover from trampling, so longer intervals were introduced along with shorter grazing periods to ensure production was maintained.

Production efficiency is hugely important in reducing carbon outputs per kilogram of meat or litre of milk. ""The more efficient, the lower the emissions per unit,"" says John.

Genetics

To improve efficiency, two of the farms on the project began the move away from bigger cows, which need higher levels of maintenance feeding than a lighter framed animal.

The long-term switch should eventually lead to smaller feed requirements for the same milk production.

This is important because bought-in protein is one of the largest contributors to emissions for livestock and dairy businesses.

Research by Scotland's Rural College suggests that this change could reduce emissions by about 15% without yield loss.

Reductions in cow size are being achieved by switching to smaller breeds or breeding replacements with a smaller sire.

Genetic improvements are also under way across the livestock units to reduce finishing times, lowering carbon emissions for each kilogram of meat produced.

To ensure production targets were met, animal health management was put under a tighter focus.

Disease can rapidly cut growth rates, throw out breeding targets, extend finishing times, depress milk yields or, worse, lead to mortality. All incur heavy penalties with lost production efficiency. 

Willow feeding

Further efforts to cut methane emissions from cattle were made in grazing coppiced willow on John Gilliland's unit.

Evidence suggests that willow leaves improve gut function, limiting methane output by up to 28% per kilogram of liveweight gain.

Hedgerows

Aside from the production changes, several farms adopted new hedgerow management regimes to sequester more carbon.

When allowed to grow taller and wider, hedges can absorb and hold more above-ground carbon. Flourishing hedges then promote growth of already extensive root structures.

These can improve soil health, locking up carbon deposits below ground. New regimes followed advice which points to cutting at two- to three-year intervals, with reprofiling carried out only after 10-15 years.

Lidar information was a benefit in the new hedgerow plans because it was plain to see how wildlife habitats could be connected to help improve biodiversity.

It is clear that Lidar has shown its worth as a management tool in cutting emissions, says John. Scanning comes at a cost of about £56/ha, but should only be necessary every five years.

That equates to a little over £11/ha a year. ""That is a relatively low cost compared with its value as a tool to manage carbon and farm practices,"" he says.

The two farms that were beyond net zero were not reassessed in the second phase.

The remaining five farms all made significant reductions in their carbon emissions. On that basis most would be on track to easily meet NI net zero timescales.

Next steps

John says the project can now precisely and robustly measure what these management actions are achieving.

Initial funding from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs has come to an end, but further studies have been backed by the Co-op Foundation.

The hunt is on for further financial backing.

""Ultimately, we would like to extend these practices so that hundreds or thousands of farmers across the UK can stand up when detractors tackle us and point to their own results with undisputable confidence,"" John concludes.

Case study: Simon Best

Armagh-based arable and beef producer Simon Best farms 450ha of cereals and 40ha of grassland for a herd of pedigree Aberdeen Angus cattle.

A Leaf farmer and long-time stewardship scheme participant, Simon was already used to environmental audits, so joining ARC Zero was a logical step.

""We wanted to have a verifiable baseline that would help guide and secure the farm for the future, and the project was hugely helpful in providing this information,"" he says.

""Our farm made up half the total project area and soil sampling showed our carbon stocks - at 250,000t of carbon dioxide in soil, hedges and trees - were an equivalent 50% of the overall total.""

AgreCalc then provided emissions data at a detailed level.

Some calculators use models that have a global measure for a cow's emissions; more accurate ones provide a national or regional figure, explains Simon.

""But the data we got showed up differences between one of our animals and the next.

“This detail, combined with Lidar analysis and nutrient data, gave us management information that we could really use to guide decisions on the unit.""

The farm recorded a 53% reduction in carbon emissions. However, Simon stresses that the project covered an exceptional weather period. The dry weather in 2022 meant grain came in at 15% moisture compared with 19% at the start of the trial.

It meant the dryer was running at a fraction of its normal use and fuel costs were cut dramatically.

""This obviously influenced our emissions figures. But having the detailed comparison showed just how much of a contribution fossil fuel makes, and this is extremely useful data,"" he says.

As a result Simon is looking at renewable energy to power the dryer, or a switch to floor drying to cut emissions.

The exceptional growing year also led to good yields from much-reduced fertiliser use. This cut nitrous oxide emissions and again an outside event influenced project results.

However, it suggested major benefits could be achieved without compromising yields if fertiliser use was refined.

Other changes introduced were straw incorporation to increase organic matter and hence improve soil structure and its capacity to store carbon.

This was combined with some reduced cultivations, also in a bid to improve soil structure and encourage worm populations.

""We took out the plough but going zero-till is difficult here because of the geography,"" Simon points out.

The Lidar mapping was of real value when overlaid with the nutrient analysis from the soil sampling.

Run-off maps were a real eye opener, showing hydrologically sensitive areas which will not receive slurry, he says.

The farm is in the NI Small Woodland Grant scheme and has planted trees in some of the sensitive areas to intercept run-off. This will help build up carbon stocks.

Case study: Hugh Harbinson

Hugh Harbison runs a 180-head autumn calving dairy herd about 10 miles from the north coast of Northern Ireland in Coleraine.

The herd calves within a 12-week window to maximise milk from grass and wholecrop silage.

Soils range from loamy to black with a high organic matter, and the farm's high rainfall makes poaching a problem and silage-making difficult.

Hugh says he was fed up with media rhetoric about farmers ruining the planet while he knew that his farm's extensive hedgerows, trees and species-rich grassland must be reducing its carbon footprint.

Like others on the project, he says the Lidar mapping was a gamechanger.

""It showed us that across the 120ha farm we have 18.5km of hedgerows - and that was a shock, to realise how extensive an area they covered.

“It also showed us exactly where the run-off areas were highest and this was hugely valuable when combined with the deep-core analysis and nutrient mapping,"" he says.

Together with results showing fields were clover-poor, the data was used as a basis to switch to multispecies, nitrogen-fixing swards that included deep-rooting red chicory.

This allowed fertiliser applications to be cut by one third overall, and the highest run-off risk areas received no artificial nitrogen applications at all.

Where dirty water and slurry are applied this is now carried out with a trailing shoe to limit emissions.

Protected urea is also used rather than ammonium nitrate to further limit nitrous oxide emissions.

The carbon footprint calculations highlighted an issue with cow size, too.

""Cow size has a direct correlation with emissions, so we have begun reducing weights from the current 650kg towards 550-600kg,"" says Hugh.

The aim is to maintain performance from lighter cows which have lower emissions and require less feeding.

""There is a strong link between a farm's production performance and its carbon footprint,"" he says. ""If the performance is good then the carbon will be good.""

But a stroke of bad luck during the trial showed just how performance can be hit by an animal health issue. In 2022 the herd suffered an outbreak of dysentery introduced by a flock of starlings.

Milk output was reduced by 10% and the drop in performance showed up in the carbon footprint.

Cuts in emissions were 4% between the 2021 and 2023 measuring points, when the changes put in place should have registered a far higher reduction.

""It was hugely disappointing but clearly demonstrated the importance of animal health and its impact on the farm's carbon footprint, which we have taken as a learning point,"" Hugh says.

Project support

More than half the funding was put up by the farmers themselves with the remainder provided by the EIP Programme of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs.

Partners also included AgriSearch, Devenish, Birnie Consultancy and Queens University Belfast.

A new study endorsed by former Defra secretary George Eustice has made nine key recommendations to put farming in England on a more sustainable footing.

The Greener Pastures report by the centre-right think tank Onward offers ways the government can help farmers tackle their twin economic and environmental problems.

The study notes that agriculture faces three main environmental issues: carbon emissions are ""stubbornly high"", contributing 11% of the UK total; farming pollutes 40% of England's rivers and lakes; and farming intensification has caused biodiversity decline.

See also: NFU seeks £4bn budget for post-BPS era

Agriculture also faces four major economic challenges: low and volatile profits, with more than 40% of farms making less than £25,000 a year; low growth and productivity; a demographic crisis, with 30% of farmers aged 65 and above; and a lack of resilience to extreme weather which can hit crop yields by 40% in bad years.

The study finds five root causes are driving these problems.

Farmers faced the ""wrong incentives"" under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy, which ""encouraged farming at the expense of nature"".

Private finance to fund nature recovery and lock up carbon ""has yet to be released"", and low investment in machinery and technology ""has kept productivity down"".

Meanwhile, aspiring young farmers ""can't secure the experience, land or finance to get started"". Supermarkets are ""squeezing"" farmers and trade deals ""aren't being harnessed to support British agriculture"".

Onward's paper makes nine key recommendations to put English farming on a sustainable footing (see panel).

The report warns Defra that if it wants to attract farmers into Environmental Land Management (ELM), it needs to be ""more generous and less bureaucratic"".

It also recommends offering bonuses to the most ambitious farmers undertaking green action on most of their land, restoring farms' inheritance tax exemption, and trialling a new regenerative farm subsidy that would encourage greater environmental ambition and boost farm profits.

Failure to address farmers' frustrations with farm subsidy reform and public concern over water pollution could threaten the Conservative Party's electoral dominance in the English countryside, the study says.

It predicts the Conservatives are on course to lose 35 seats in the next general election, with Labour set to win 33 seats unless the party can restore trust in rural communities. 

Writing in the foreword of the report, Mr Eustice says Onward's new publication ""is a great contribution to that vibrant debate now taking place about agriculture, food security, land use and nature's recovery.""

Over the past three years, figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency have shown a gradual climb in the number of students enrolling to study land-based and agricultural degrees.

In the 2021-22 academic year alone, 15,640 UK students took up agricultural and food-based studies, showing a marked increase in numbers when compared with the 15,370 enrolments for 2020-21 and 13,985 in 2019-20.

Current A-level students will be aware that the Ucas application window is soon to open, but for many the decision of whether to go to university will still hang in the balance, with the same question left unanswered: is doing a degree worth it?

New entrants

For those from non-rural backgrounds, an agricultural degree can be a gateway into the industry, and provides a vital opportunity to meet like-minded people with shared interests.

Josh Redford studied agriculture at the Royal Agricultural University (RAU) in Cirencester, and now works as the regional NFU representative for Hertfordshire.

Hailing from a non-farming background, his degree provided a solid foundation from which he has built his career within the sector, and it has allowed him to gain knowledge across a range of topics.

""I first became interested when I started volunteering on a dairy farm after school. They offered me a Sunday part-time job, and from that I decided I wanted to do a degree in agriculture,"" says Mr Redford.

""I went into my degree thinking I wanted to work in the livestock sector but, as time went on, I specialised in crops and went on to take up a trainee job as an agronomist.

""It just sort of snowballed from there.""

As a new entrant into the industry, Mr Redford's degree in agriculture has been a useful talking point in job interviews, and he has found that the qualification is considered valuable among employers. 

""Many recruiters look for a degree; it's like a tick-box. It demonstrates that you have those basic written and analytical skills that are all transferable,"" he says.

""I was able to use my degree and examples of my uni work in the interview for my first job, and without that, I wouldn't have moved over to the Fens.

""University is like a catalyst for trying new things, and without it I could have easily ended up somewhere else. I would say it has broadened my horizons.""

His studies also provided a vital opportunity to meet peers with similar interests, something he had not experienced during his time at school. 

""It's a classic line, but you really are able to make valuable friends and contacts at university, and surround yourself with people who have similar interests to you,"" says Mr Redford.

 ""Before, that would have been pretty rare, coming from a big state school where you're the only person who is interested in farming."" 

Bringing value back home

Third-generation dairy farmer Joseph Sweet, from Ventonarren Farm, Cornwall, also studied agriculture at RAU. Growing up on the family-run dairy farm, he admits that pursuing a career in farming was not always the plan.

""When I was doing my A-Levels my dad had an accident on the farm. After seeing the worst side of the industry, I didn't want anything to do with farming,"" says Mr Sweet.

""The farm always drew me back, and I ended up doing a foundation degree at Cirencester.

""I wasn't really sure what I wanted to get out of it at the time - I thought I'd go into it and get a job on the fringe of farming. But as it happened, I got more and more involved in the day-to-day running of the farm.""

Joe Sweet © Joe Sweet

While Mr Sweet already had plenty of hands-on experience from growing up on farm, he found the degree modules with a business focus particularly helpful, providing inspiration for new ways to add value to the farming business at home.

""The core of the degree was mainly business related, and the studying was always angled towards farm diversifications, and having another income stream to reinvest into the business,"" says Mr Sweet.

""I had a rough idea of the ins and outs of what the farm was doing, but it definitely helps to know what you're looking at in the end-of-year summary, and to actually know what the accountant is talking about.""

Having graduated and returned home to the family farm, he has since been able to put his knowledge of diversifications into practice, and has recently installed a milkshake vending machine.

Although Mr Sweet admits that, aside from the business elements of his course, he picked up most of his practical knowledge from working alongside his mum on the farm, rather than through his studies, he believes the degree was worthwhile due to the community he was able to form.

He says: ""It's definitely more about the people I met - being surrounded by likeminded people who are all in the same industry, but slightly differently inclined in where they want to go.

""When you surround yourself at university with farmers and people involved in the sector you realise it's actually quite a cool industry to go into.""

Alternative routes

Farming on the Cambridgeshire fens just outside Peterborough, arable farmer Luke Abblitt took on his farm tenancy when he was just 21 years old, and having no degree was not considered when making his tenancy application.

It was an opportunity, he says, that he would have missed out on had he been studying.

Luke Abblitt © Luke Abblitt

""For me, having a degree wasn't important,"" explains Mr Abblitt. ""I look at all of the jobs that I do on farm - I've got to grow crops, so that would lend itself to a degree in agriculture, but what about the other stuff? I had to mend a machine this morning, so do I need a degree in agricultural engineering too?  

""I'm going to do some book-keeping later, so do I need a degree in accounting as well?""

Finding, like many farmers, that he has to wear many hats to run a successful business, for Mr Abblitt hands-on experience has been more valuable than a degree. 

""It really depends on what you want to do,"" he says. ""I'm an on-the-ground, practical farmer, but if I were to hire a farm manager, for example, I would probably want to see something that proves they are capable - and a degree usually does that.

""You wouldn't go and see a doctor who hasn't completed a degree, and has just learned on the job.

""But, for me, I've got so many aspects to my job that merge into one, I don't think a degree would help me to run the business.""

Despite opting out of a degree, Mr Abblitt studied for a national vocational qualification in agriculture, and highlights that there are a number of different routes for attaining more knowledge within the sector.

He says: ""Look at how many webinars you can access these days, as well as short courses and even remote classes - there is a lot of free training out there where you can pick up a lot of what you need to know.”

Employers

While students often undertake a degree to improve their career and employment prospects, for many recruiters the value of a degree can be trumped by other factors, such as character and experience.

Robin Aird, manager at Charlton Park Estate in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, studied a degree in agriculture at Harper Adams University, and now regularly recruits within the agricultural sector.

Robin Aird © Kathy Horniblow

When looking for the ideal candidate, Mr Aird says: ""From an employer's point of view, I don't worry about whether someone has a degree. I think common sense trumps everything.

""With farming, it's all about experience, learning, and diversity of learning. I think that's very important.

""There's no one way to learn farming, and the more ways you can experience it, the better. It's about hands-on experience.""

Regenerative farming systems go beyond the “feelgood factor” and are helping to reduce emissions, increase biodiversity, enhance public goods and deliver higher farm profits, according to research findings.

At this year's Base-UK conference, a succession of speakers discussed the results of research examining the outcomes of regenerative agriculture - most of which was done in the UK.

From the Allerton Project in Leicestershire, Alastair Leake summarised projects stretching over the past 20 years, from soil and water protection (sowap) in 2003 and the on-going Syngenta conservation agriculture work, up to the current AgriCapture carbon dioxide project.

Biodiversity and profit

He revealed that the first of these projects had confirmed soil and water were protected when tillage was reduced, which had positive knock-on effects on biodiversity.

""There was a reduction in soil erosion and run-off, earthworm and bird numbers were higher, soil biology benefited as did aquatic life.""

The work done with Syngenta - on two sites with different soil types - has gone further, he added, and bought in the financial results.

""It's more profitable,"" he said. ""On the light land site in Kent, the net profit was up by 36%. On our heavy land at Loddington, it increased by 19%.""

That work also addressed practical issues, such as work rates and operation costs, as well as greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprints - with the latter two coming down sharply in a no-till regime.

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions

For Becky Willson of the Farm Carbon Toolkit, providing evidence on how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is a key part of the organisation's remit, so that farmers can make the right decisions and improve resilience.

The organisation's work shows that enhanced soil carbon storage can deliver greenhouse gas of 5m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents/year, with farmer management having an effect on the results.

""There is a lot that farmers can measure when it comes to carbon, so they should focus on the things that will help them with management decisions,"" she stressed. ""Think about what information it is giving you.""

Where building soil carbon is the focus, it can be measured, although there is debate about the best method, she confirmed.

Both the Loss on Ignition (LoI) and Dumas techniques are used - with the Dumas method being more expensive, but likely to be recognised by the forthcoming Soil Carbon Code.

For arable farmers, the biggest impacts on greenhouse gas reductions are seen where ploughing has ceased and cover crops with no-till are being used, she said.

""Cover crops on their own have given mixed results and we are continuing to look at these.""

Results from diversity

Independent soil health consultant Joel Williams provided plenty of proof of the benefits of diversity in cover crops and rotations, from a wealth of studies.

As well as having soil, water and biodiversity advantages, plant diversity also helps with agronomic challenges, he revealed, by improving soil fertility and nitrogen use efficiency, managing weeds and pests and producing forage.

In terms of soil biology, there was a 27% improvement in soil microbial abundance, with a similar improvement in microbial activity. ""Certain species in your cover crops help with this more than others.""

Where pest and disease levels are concerned, there's a suppressant effect seen from having an extra species, such as with intercropping or companion planting, in 79% of occasions. Similarly with pests, pressure was down by 68%.

With weeds, the design of a system that has more diversity in it makes it harder for weed populations, as confirmed by a reduction in 86% of situations, added Mr Williams.

A large study on nitrate leaching showed a fall of 56% where cover crops were employed, with those being drilled earlier capturing more nitrate, as well as those on lighter soils.

Interestingly, legumes on their own did not capture as much nitrate as a mix.

""Another finding is that the carbon dioxide uptake is twice as high in a four species cover crop mix and three times higher in a mix of 12 species.

That results in higher transport rates in the plants towards the roots and a better effect on the soil.""

While there's no right answer to how many species you should aim to have, including more species will bring more functionality, he added.

""There is a legacy effect seen from a very diverse mix, but it fades over time.""

How to increase plant diversity

Farm experience: Progress to date

Duncan Wilson, Strathmore Farming Company, Angus

For Scottish farm manager Duncan Wilson, the focus is on trying to be less degenerative as he combines making a financial return with testing out different ways of doing things.

While carrots have been dropped from the rotation for soil health reasons, the business still grows potatoes and a considerable amount of the land is ploughed.

However, other crop establishment methods are being investigated, cover crops have been integrated into the rotation, bi-cropping is being tested, mob grazing is under way and input use has reduced.

Plenty of hedges, trees and margins, along with rough grazing and wild areas, means that the farm landscape is very diverse, with plenty of space for wildlife.

""We are trying alternatives but we need to be careful about the speed of change,"" says Mr Wilson. ""No two years are the same and it takes time to get results.""

As well as 1,215ha of arable crops, some 220 spring calving cows are kept on permanent pasture and different grazing systems have been tested, to find the best way of using 810ha of rough grazing.

There are also 640 outdoor sows and sheep are bought in to graze cover and arable crops.

""There is a slight reduction in yield in the arable crops where this is done - it has to be balanced with savings on fungicides.""

Lance Charity, Flood Farm, Cambridgeshire

Producing healthy food is the aim of Lance Charity, a Peterborough Council tenant farmer and relative newcomer, who produces lamb, cereals, eggs, honey and pumpkins.

As well as trying to improve the soils, he is stacking enterprises while reducing inputs and introducing novel techniques such as bi-cropping, so that he makes full use of plant diversity.

A flock of hardy Poll Dorset sheep, which lamb in September, are used to graze multi-species cover crops, with the lambs either being sold to Waitrose or used in the farm's direct box scheme.

Sheep are also used to graze the arable crops and replace the need for inputs. Where they go onto wheat in the autumn, they are moved daily, to prevent any crop and soil damage and reduce the risk of harm.

Some 300 chickens are also part of the farm, with purpose-built trailers being moved weekly around the farm and the eggs sold direct to the public.

In addition, bee hives are allowing the production of honey and a pumpkin-growing trial in 2022 was successful and will be repeated.

""Getting people onto the farm in September is good as we are lambing then,"" he says.

""We are keen to add an educational aspect to our efforts so that people understand more about healthy food.""

Regenerative farming systems go beyond the “feelgood factor” and are helping to reduce emissions, increase biodiversity, enhance public goods and deliver higher farm profits, according to research findings.

At this year's Base-UK conference, a succession of speakers discussed the results of research examining the outcomes of regenerative agriculture - most of which was done in the UK.

From the Allerton Project in Leicestershire, Alastair Leake summarised projects stretching over the past 20 years, from soil and water protection (sowap) in 2003 and the on-going Syngenta conservation agriculture work, up to the current AgriCapture carbon dioxide project.

Biodiversity and profit

He revealed that the first of these projects had confirmed soil and water were protected when tillage was reduced, which had positive knock-on effects on biodiversity.

""There was a reduction in soil erosion and run-off, earthworm and bird numbers were higher, soil biology benefited as did aquatic life.""

The work done with Syngenta - on two sites with different soil types - has gone further, he added, and bought in the financial results.

""It's more profitable,"" he said. ""On the light land site in Kent, the net profit was up by 36%. On our heavy land at Loddington, it increased by 19%.""

That work also addressed practical issues, such as work rates and operation costs, as well as greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprints - with the latter two coming down sharply in a no-till regime.

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions

For Becky Willson of the Farm Carbon Toolkit, providing evidence on how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is a key part of the organisation's remit, so that farmers can make the right decisions and improve resilience.

The organisation's work shows that enhanced soil carbon storage can deliver greenhouse gas of 5m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents/year, with farmer management having an effect on the results.

""There is a lot that farmers can measure when it comes to carbon, so they should focus on the things that will help them with management decisions,"" she stressed. ""Think about what information it is giving you.""

Where building soil carbon is the focus, it can be measured, although there is debate about the best method, she confirmed.

Both the Loss on Ignition (LoI) and Dumas techniques are used - with the Dumas method being more expensive, but likely to be recognised by the forthcoming Soil Carbon Code.

For arable farmers, the biggest impacts on greenhouse gas reductions are seen where ploughing has ceased and cover crops with no-till are being used, she said.

""Cover crops on their own have given mixed results and we are continuing to look at these.""

Results from diversity

Independent soil health consultant Joel Williams provided plenty of proof of the benefits of diversity in cover crops and rotations, from a wealth of studies.

As well as having soil, water and biodiversity advantages, plant diversity also helps with agronomic challenges, he revealed, by improving soil fertility and nitrogen use efficiency, managing weeds and pests and producing forage.

In terms of soil biology, there was a 27% improvement in soil microbial abundance, with a similar improvement in microbial activity. ""Certain species in your cover crops help with this more than others.""

Where pest and disease levels are concerned, there's a suppressant effect seen from having an extra species, such as with intercropping or companion planting, in 79% of occasions. Similarly with pests, pressure was down by 68%.

With weeds, the design of a system that has more diversity in it makes it harder for weed populations, as confirmed by a reduction in 86% of situations, added Mr Williams.

A large study on nitrate leaching showed a fall of 56% where cover crops were employed, with those being drilled earlier capturing more nitrate, as well as those on lighter soils.

Interestingly, legumes on their own did not capture as much nitrate as a mix.

""Another finding is that the carbon dioxide uptake is twice as high in a four species cover crop mix and three times higher in a mix of 12 species.

That results in higher transport rates in the plants towards the roots and a better effect on the soil.""

While there's no right answer to how many species you should aim to have, including more species will bring more functionality, he added.

""There is a legacy effect seen from a very diverse mix, but it fades over time.""

How to increase plant diversity

Farm experience: Progress to date

Duncan Wilson, Strathmore Farming Company, Angus

For Scottish farm manager Duncan Wilson, the focus is on trying to be less degenerative as he combines making a financial return with testing out different ways of doing things.

While carrots have been dropped from the rotation for soil health reasons, the business still grows potatoes and a considerable amount of the land is ploughed.

However, other crop establishment methods are being investigated, cover crops have been integrated into the rotation, bi-cropping is being tested, mob grazing is under way and input use has reduced.

Plenty of hedges, trees and margins, along with rough grazing and wild areas, means that the farm landscape is very diverse, with plenty of space for wildlife.

""We are trying alternatives but we need to be careful about the speed of change,"" says Mr Wilson. ""No two years are the same and it takes time to get results.""

As well as 1,215ha of arable crops, some 220 spring calving cows are kept on permanent pasture and different grazing systems have been tested, to find the best way of using 810ha of rough grazing.

There are also 640 outdoor sows and sheep are bought in to graze cover and arable crops.

""There is a slight reduction in yield in the arable crops where this is done - it has to be balanced with savings on fungicides.""

Lance Charity, Flood Farm, Cambridgeshire

Producing healthy food is the aim of Lance Charity, a Peterborough Council tenant farmer and relative newcomer, who produces lamb, cereals, eggs, honey and pumpkins.

As well as trying to improve the soils, he is stacking enterprises while reducing inputs and introducing novel techniques such as bi-cropping, so that he makes full use of plant diversity.

19,"What does the future hold for agricultural apprenticeships?","https://www.fwi.co.uk/careers/what-does-the-future-hold-for-agricultural-apprenticeships","What does the future hold for agricultural apprenticeships?

Earlier this year, the government-commissioned Independent Review into Labour Shortages in the Food Supply Chain highlighted the importance of apprenticeships as a means of improving the skills of the agricultural workforce.

The review made a number of recommendations for government, industry and other stakeholders, designed to attract more young people to the farming sector.

But it also brought to light the industry's concerns about the apprenticeship levy - a 0.5% tax on larger employers which is used to fund apprenticeship training

See also: Is an agricultural degree worth doing?

As of July 2022, over £3.3bn of unspent apprenticeship levy funds had been returned, unspent, to the Treasury for general expenditure, despite a growing labour shortage, skills gap, and system that is hindered by a number of shortcomings.

Land-based training body Lantra has this year conducted its own research to identify the main barriers hindering the uptake of apprentices by farming businesses, and has so far carried out interviews with more than 500 farmers.

The organisation's full research report will not be published until early 2024.

However, initial findings show that, despite almost 70% of farming businesses considering employing an apprentice, about 30% believe that the apprenticeship system is not fit for purpose.

Many of the respondents identified barriers to taking on apprentices, namely unnecessarily high academic requirements, coupled with a lack of competence training.

These were found to prevent new entrants, and mean that when apprentices arrive on farms, they lack the essential skills to begin meaningful work.

Solutions

Roughly half of the surveyed farmers said that, before they would be prepared to take on an apprentice, they would need greater support and for certain barriers to be remedied.  

Lantra is therefore developing solutions to ""de-risk"" the apprenticeship system for both would-be apprentices and employers.

This includes a ""how to"" guide, which will take employers through the process of hiring an apprentice, simplifying what can be overwhelming to first time employers.

As the industry is dominated by small and micro-businesses, the guide is targeted at helping smaller farms, where staffing is most needed, to bring new employees on board.

The guide will be released in January 2024.

One frequently raised issue highlighted by Lantra's research is that apprentices are not ""farm ready"" when they begin work, and often lack the basic practical skills required to make the most of their work placement.

Farming businesses said that apprentices arrived on farm without any vital health and safety training and without certificates of competence to operate key farm machinery, such as tractors, telehandlers, and ATVs, putting further potential risk on the employer.

Director of external relations Corrina Urquhart says:

""We are in the process of completing our research into apprenticeships, having engaged with farming businesses and policymakers, particularly to understand where there is scope to flex the current apprenticeship system.

""Lantra is keen to support farmers through the transition and, while our research shows there is an appetite for on-farm apprentices, there is a need for interventions to maximise uptake and mitigate high drop-out rates.

""A lot of farms are ""˜one-man bands' or a family business, so the burden of employment is something that can be traditionally off-putting.

""Taking on someone so young, fresh out of school or college, can be a big undertaking, particularly when we are looking at businesses that may not have ever employed someone before.

""Farmers have expressed the need for support in this area, if they are to be more willing to take on an apprentice.""

Pathway programme

Apprenticeship systems differ across the nations, and in Scotland, Lantra has had a hand in developing a six-month pre-apprenticeship programme.

A key insight from this pilot revealed that 40% of young people were successful in securing full-time jobs on farms at the end of the six-month period.

The apprentice wanted to get straight into work, and the farm business benefited from a fully trained individual within a shorter period of time.

""The six-month pathway programme into farming works well in Scotland.

""It provides practical experience, training, and knowledge, and enables the new entrant to experience the farm environment and to try out the working environment and relationship,"" explains Ms Urquhart.

""At the same time, the employer is also able to work with a potential new employee, while being supported to mentor and develop them, and without the employment risk or the administration burden.""

Are apprenticeships worth doing?

A system in need of such significant restructuring begs the question of how those taking part now are faring, and whether an agricultural apprenticeship is worth doing.

Despite the barriers identified for both apprentice and employer, accounts from current and former apprentices show that this particular avenue of study can provide a vital opportunity for new entrants to access the industry.

It is often the best route for those who prefer to gain hands-on experience, rather than classroom-based learning.

Opportunities for new entrants

Apprenticeship student Ellie Young has recently completed her end point assessment for her Level 2 Stockperson apprenticeship.

She is based at Blenheim Estate, in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, but has completed the studying element at Sparsholt College in Hampshire.

""I chose to do an apprenticeship after trying a year at college following school,"" she explains.

""I didn't really get on with college very well, so I went down the apprenticeship route and I've really enjoyed it because I've learned a lot more of the hands-on elements instead of sitting in a classroom full time - it suits me a lot better.

""For my apprenticeship, I had to go to college for one day a week, and the rest is on the farm. I learned a lot more practically and learned it a lot faster,"" she adds.

While Ms Young says she did have coursework to do as a part of her one day a week at college, she was able to attain her telehandler, spraying, and ATV tickets at the same time.

""You are learning on the job, and being taught by someone who has had years of experience in a one-to-one environment.

“It's like having a mentor, and having that style of learning is really helpful,"" she says.

""Especially coming from a non-farming background, seeing it hands-on and being shown how it's done makes it a lot easier for me to learn compared to being stuck in a classroom and still not being sure.""

Earn while you learn

Tom Wilkinson has recently completed his Level 2 and Level 3 Land Based Engineering apprenticeship, and has continued to work at Townson Tractors in Skipton, North Yorkshire, after his training.

He was initially drawn to this study route as it provided the opportunity to earn money while learning and gaining qualifications.

""I've been at Townson Tractors where I work now for four years, throughout both of my two-year apprenticeship courses,"" he explains.

""These worked out as spending a month at work, and then a week at college. It was split in blocks.

""I'd always fancied doing an apprenticeship because I'm not a big fan of being in classrooms - I don't learn very well that way.

""So being out and actually doing what I wanted to learn really helped, and I liked the fact that you could make money while you learned,"" he adds.

Apprentice minimum wage boosted

In the recent Autumn Statement, chancellor of the exchequer Jeremy Hunt announced that the minimum hourly wage for an apprentice will increase by 21% as of April 2024, to £6.40 an hour.

Relay cropping winter wheat and soya beans in one season could be worth at least £605/ha (US$300/acre) more for a US farmer in Indiana compared with just growing mono soya beans in the same field.

Jason Mauck - who crops about 1,200ha, near Muncie, alongside a 12,000 wean-to-finish indoor pig unit - has been fine-tuning his relay cropping system for about eight seasons.

See also: Why cultivation equipment is making a comeback on Wiltshire farm

Relay cropping is a system of intercropping, where two crops are growing together for part of the season, but planted and harvested at different times - a form of double cropping.

In Jason's system, winter wheat is planted in strips in the autumn and harvested in July. Soya beans are planted between the wheat strips in March or April, and then harvested in October.

""At first I thought we could do everything we do with monoculture wheat and soya beans and get twice the product,"" Jason says.

""Of course, that was impossible as there is only so much water and sunlight for both crops. It took about four years to figure out this equilibrium and how to start maximising the economics.""

Maximising economics

The first proper trials began in 2015, planting two rows of wheat every 750mm, which was treated with an autumn application of pig manure.

The farm has a supply of about 22.7m litres of manure from the pig unit.

""It worked well, but my wheat was too good, yielding 110 bushel/acre [7.4t/ha].

""What I figured out was if you excite the wheat in 30in [760mm] rows, it will grow laterally and capture all the light, and there wasn't enough moisture and light for the soya beans to grow.""

After a couple more seasons of trials, he's found that planting four consecutive rows of wheat on 190mm spacings in 1,500mm centres provides a better balance to maximise solar energy use, with the drill blocked off to create the gap to plant two rows of soya beans 500mm apart.

Fields close enough to the pig unit get manure injected between the wheat strips.

This allows him to cut seed rates by as much as 75% compared with a solid stand of 5m seeds/ha.

Where manure is not available, he reduces seed rate by about 50%.

Drilling date

Planting date is usually in late September or early October following a maize crop that has been selected for early maturity.

The bigger gap between wheat strips encourages the crop to tiller more and grow out laterally to fill the space, Jason says.

""If you give a volunteer wheat plant space, it can produce a lot of heads from a single seed, so I'm looking to exploit that to get maybe five to seven wheat heads per seed versus 1.5 heads in a mono crop scenario and create more value per seed.""

During spring, the centre wheat rows typically grow taller through competition effects, while the side rows grow laterally to create a half-circle crop architecture, not dissimilar to what you see in commercial lavender fields.

By harvest, the wheat can nearly meet across the gap above the soya beans.

Soil moisture

Part of the value of the wheat is its impact in removing excess soil moisture.

This allows Jason to plant soya beans earlier than perhaps otherwise in early April, with the wheat crop creating a microclimate that also helps to protect the beans from late frosts.

But it can be a fine balance - if it goes too dry after planting, the lack of moisture can hurt the development of the bean, although usually excess moisture is more of an issue at that time of year.

""My big motive is how can I grow wheat as cheaply as possible, while trying to increase the yield of the soya bean,"" Jason says.

""It's not about maximising wheat yields, it's about contribution margin. But that's only important if I don't shoot the beans in the head.

""If I can raise 70 bushels/acre [4.7t/ha] of regular beans but only achieve 35 bushels/acre [2.35t/ha] of relay beans, if I get too aggressive with the wheat and suck up too much water, I don't gain anything because at US$14/bushel [£163/t], the maths doesn't stack up,"" he says.

Homemade planter

Earlier planting of the soya using a home-made planter gains more days for reproductive bud set and pollination, increasing yields, Jason explains.

He also gains by planting a later maturing variety than typically grown in his latitude.

""After I harvest the wheat, I empower the soya bean with three or four times more light per plant than it had been getting, so it feels it is getting a longer day. It changes its vegetative motive to stop being in competition with itself, which shortens the space between nodes.""

He believes the earlier planting, plus the extra space for the soya bean plant to grow into, lowers the time between node set, encouraging the plant to create a new node every two and half days compared with four days in a mono crop.

Maximising node numbers should help increase yield as flowers and pods are produced at nodes, providing environmental conditions are right to fill the pods.

By increasing light interception, delivering nutrients through the manure, and space for the soya bean crop to grow into, Jason believes relay crops deliver this.

""Historically, we gain four nodes on the main stem versus narrower row mono crops, but with lots more branches, branch nodes and longer pod development on each pod site.""

Home-made soya bean drill © Mike Abram

Harvest

By wheat harvest, the soya bean plant can already be as tall as the wheat crop.

Jason uses Flexxifinger pads that snap onto the combine header to compress a 600mm-tall soya bean down to just 100mm to prevent damage to the crop.

""It's like they are doing the limbo and eventually just spring back up.""

Within a few weeks, the soya beans are meeting across the row to fill the vacated wheat gap, he says.

""It's a bit like unzipping your trousers after Thanksgiving lunch, and letting your stomach pop out - those beans will really expand and it takes no more than 20 days for the beans to zip back shut [across the gap].""

Jason thinks the wheat straw helps reflect sunlight back up into the lower part of the soya bean plant further improving light utilisation, as well as acting as a moisture conserver.

""Each plant yields more because it gets more light, carbon dioxide and water.""

This season

This year's relay crops have been in two fields - one with manure applied and one without.

Both wheat crops were harvested in early July with the manured wheat achieving 100 bushels/acre (6.7t/ha) and the non-manured crop 70 bushels/ac (4.7t/ha).

The 100 bushels/acre wheat is well above the 80 bushels/acre (5.4 t/ha) average wheat yield for Indiana.

Potentially, that might impact on soya bean yields.

""With every three to five bushels of wheat, it extracts one acre inch of water - we average around 42in [1,070mm] of rain per year.

""If I grow higher yielding wheat, I'm going to have less moisture for the soya beans.""

Income

He's hopeful the relay cropped soya beans on that field will reach 70 bushels/acre (4.7t/ha), which would provide a combined income of US$1,614/acre (£3,254/ha).

With growing costs of about US$250/acre (£503/ha), that would provide a gross margin of £2,753/ha compared with £1,886/ha for mono crop soya beans yielding 80 bushels/acre. 

On the second field, the difference between mono crop and relay crop is likely to be a bit lower - about US$246/acre (£496/ha), he calculates - if both soya bean crops yield 60 bushels/acre (4t/ha).

""In a wet year, we've broken state records for soya bean yields, but the wheat didn't do as well that year.

“But you can win either way, especially as we're planting fewer seeds using manure instead of commercial inputs, lowering input costs to where it doesn't take much yield to create contribution margin.

“If I can get two crops out there, I can kind of hack the system with lower inputs and slightly lower yields, but aggregately get more,"" he concludes.

Could relay cropping work in UK conditions?

Ripening a second crop after wheat is one of the key challenges that make a similar system challenging in the UK.

""The reason it works with wide rowcrops in Indiana is they have more heat units in summer to ripen crops later in summer,"" notes Kent grower Andrew Howard, who studied different types of intercropping for his Nuffield Scholarship in 2016.

Indiana lies on approximately the same latitude as central Spain and southern Italy, some 10 degrees further south than southern UK.

""It's pretty marginal for ripening crops once you get into September in the UK.""

Potential second crop options that might work in the UK are buckwheat, linseed or millet.

Wildfarmed's Andy Cato was planning to try relay cropping with buckwheat this season, but the weather interfered with his plans.

""I'm sure it can work,"" he says. ""The potential issue is that I don't want to leave soil in the inter-row bare until the relay crop is seeded, which would mean establishing a cover crop which can then give way to the relay crop.

“Terminating that cover crop and any weeds that have come with it might be tricky without using band sprayed herbicides, which we don't use.""

An alternative option to terminate the cover crop would be an inter-row rotavator, he says. ""I've tried one, but it is slow going.""

Machinery

Finding machinery to establish a crop in a relay system as well as it could be conventionally is also a challenge, says Lincolnshire farmer and machinery manufacturer George Sly.

""It's all home-made, even in the US, and for us to develop something costs hundreds of thousands pounds, so you have to be sure there is a market.""

George has trialled growing winter wheat in 50cm triple rows on his farm, which didn't drop in yield, he says.

""Winter wheat will tiller out and cover a remarkable area if you give it light and space, but I've found the complete opposite with spring cereals.""

But finding a second crop that would be harvestable in a relay crop system in the UK is very difficult, he agrees.

Wide rows

Shropshire grower John Bubb has developed a 50cm wide row strip-till system for the non-potato crops in his rotation, says his agronomist, Ed Brown of Hutchinsons.

The starting point was recognising wide row strip-till would suit both poppies and OSR.

Wheat made less sense, Ed admits, but three separate trials last season - where the wheat was drilled in a 10cm band - gave yields broadly the same as the farm standard.

""The wheat definitely tillers more, although it doesn't completely fill the gap between the rows,"" Ed says.

In the first wheat crop after potatoes, clover is now inter-row seeded with a Weaving IR drill in June, in the gap between the wheat bands after any herbicide applications have been completed.

The plan is for the clover to then stay in place until the next potato crop in five years.

""It's not there to harvest, but acts as a companion that helps soil structure, contributes to nitrogen and weed suppression.""

OSR will then be strip-tilled next season in the same bands as the wheat, with the clover left as a living understorey.

Autocasting

Other relay cropping opportunities in UK conditions include Autocasting cover crops or OSR into standing wheat or barley crops.

Drone firms are also beginning to offer similar services.

Both consistency of germination and slug control can be challenges with this system, Andrew notes, who has used both an Outcast system attached to a sprayer and Autocast on the combine to establish cover crops or OSR in standing or just harvested crops.

It can be a bit hit and miss in terms of consistency of germination, he says of his Autocast system, which he is using to establish a catch crop off the combine this year. ""You need moisture.

“The ones I did in July were too wet to roll, but ideally you go through with the rolls straight after to help with a chit and maybe to get some grassweed growing,"" says Andrew.

Slug challenge

The issue with broadcasting seed into standing crops is that slug control becomes difficult because of the risk of slug pellets getting caught in wheat ears, he adds.

Those various challenges with relay cropping are why all four currently believe that more traditional bi- or polycrop systems where the intercrops are harvested together are more likely to be successful in UK conditions.

Fields close enough to the pig unit get manure injected between the wheat strips.

This allows him to cut seed rates by as much as 75% compared with a solid stand of 5m seeds/ha.

Where manure is not available, he reduces seed rate by about 50%.

Drilling date

Planting date is usually in late September or early October following a maize crop that has been selected for early maturity.

The bigger gap between wheat strips encourages the crop to tiller more and grow out laterally to fill the space, Jason says.

""If you give a volunteer wheat plant space, it can produce a lot of heads from a single seed, so I'm looking to exploit that to get maybe five to seven wheat heads per seed versus 1.5 heads in a mono crop scenario and create more value per seed.""

During spring, the centre wheat rows typically grow taller through competition effects, while the side rows grow laterally to create a half-circle crop architecture, not dissimilar to what you see in commercial lavender fields.

By harvest, the wheat can nearly meet across the gap above the soya beans.

Soil moisture

Part of the value of the wheat is its impact in removing excess soil moisture.

This allows Jason to plant soya beans earlier than perhaps otherwise in early April, with the wheat crop creating a microclimate that also helps to protect the beans from late frosts.

But it can be a fine balance - if it goes too dry after planting, the lack of moisture can hurt the development of the bean, although usually excess moisture is more of an issue at that time of year.

""My big motive is how can I grow wheat as cheaply as possible, while trying to increase the yield of the soya bean,"" Jason says.

""It's not about maximising wheat yields, it's about contribution margin. But that's only important if I don't shoot the beans in the head.

""If I can raise 70 bushels/acre [4.7t/ha] of regular beans but only achieve 35 bushels/acre [2.35t/ha] of relay beans, if I get too aggressive with the wheat and suck up too much water, I don't gain anything because at US$14/bushel [£163/t], the maths doesn't stack up,"" he says.

Homemade planter

Earlier planting of the soya using a home-made planter gains more days for reproductive bud set and pollination, increasing yields, Jason explains.

He also gains by planting a later maturing variety than typically grown in his latitude.

""After I harvest the wheat, I empower the soya bean with three or four times more light per plant than it had been getting, so it feels it is getting a longer day. It changes its vegetative motive to stop being in competition with itself, which shortens the space between nodes.""

He believes the earlier planting, plus the extra space for the soya bean plant to grow into, lowers the time between node set, encouraging the plant to create a new node every two and half days compared with four days in a mono crop.

Maximising node numbers should help increase yield as flowers and pods are produced at nodes, providing environmental conditions are right to fill the pods.

By increasing light interception, delivering nutrients through the manure, and space for the soya bean crop to grow into, Jason believes relay crops deliver this.

""Historically, we gain four nodes on the main stem versus narrower row mono crops, but with lots more branches, branch nodes and longer pod development on each pod site.""

Harvest

By wheat harvest, the soya bean plant can already be as tall as the wheat crop.

Jason uses Flexxifinger pads that snap onto the combine header to compress a 600mm-tall soya bean down to just 100mm to prevent damage to the crop.

""It's like they are doing the limbo and eventually just spring back up.""

Within a few weeks, the soya beans are meeting across the row to fill the vacated wheat gap, he says.

""It's a bit like unzipping your trousers after Thanksgiving lunch, and letting your stomach pop out - those beans will really expand and it takes no more than 20 days for the beans to zip back shut [across the gap].""

Jason thinks the wheat straw helps reflect sunlight back up into the lower part of the soya bean plant further improving light utilisation, as well as acting as a moisture conserver.

""Each plant yields more because it gets more light, carbon dioxide and water.""

This season

This year's relay crops have been in two fields - one with manure applied and one without.

Both wheat crops were harvested in early July with the manured wheat achieving 100 bushels/acre (6.7t/ha) and the non-manured crop 70 bushels/ac (4.7t/ha).

The 100 bushels/acre wheat is well above the 80 bushels/acre (5.4 t/ha) average wheat yield for Indiana.

Potentially, that might impact on soya bean yields.

""With every three to five bushels of wheat, it extracts one acre inch of water - we average around 42in [1,070mm] of rain per year.

""If I grow higher yielding wheat, I'm going to have less moisture for the soya beans.""

Income

He's hopeful the relay cropped soya beans on that field will reach 70 bushels/acre (4.7t/ha), which would provide a combined income of US$1,614/acre (£3,254/ha).

With growing costs of about US$250/acre (£503/ha), that would provide a gross margin of £2,753/ha compared with £1,886/ha for mono crop soya beans yielding 80 bushels/acre. 

On the second field, the difference between mono crop and relay crop is likely to be a bit lower - about US$246/acre (£496/ha), he calculates - if both soya bean crops yield 60 bushels/acre (4t/ha).

""In a wet year, we've broken state records for soya bean yields, but the wheat didn't do as well that year.

“But you can win either way, especially as we're planting fewer seeds using manure instead of commercial inputs, lowering input costs to where it doesn't take much yield to create contribution margin.

“If I can get two crops out there, I can kind of hack the system with lower inputs and slightly lower yields, but aggregately get more,"" he concludes.

Could relay cropping work in UK conditions?

Ripening a second crop after wheat is one of the key challenges that make a similar system challenging in the UK.

""The reason it works with wide rowcrops in Indiana is they have more heat units in summer to ripen crops later in summer,"" notes Kent grower Andrew Howard, who studied different types of intercropping for his Nuffield Scholarship in 2016.

Indiana lies on approximately the same latitude as central Spain and southern Italy, some 10 degrees further south than southern UK.

""It's pretty marginal for ripening crops once you get into September in the UK.""

Potential second crop options that might work in the UK are buckwheat, linseed or millet.

Wildfarmed's Andy Cato was planning to try relay cropping with buckwheat this season, but the weather interfered with his plans.

""I'm sure it can work,"" he says. ""The potential issue is that I don't want to leave soil in the inter-row bare until the relay crop is seeded, which would mean establishing a cover crop which can then give way to the relay crop.

“Terminating that cover crop and any weeds that have come with it might be tricky without using band sprayed herbicides, which we don't use.""

An alternative option to terminate the cover crop would be an inter-row rotavator, he says. ""I've tried one, but it is slow going.""

Machinery

Finding machinery to establish a crop in a relay system as well as it could be conventionally is also a challenge, says Lincolnshire farmer and machinery manufacturer George Sly.

""It's all home-made, even in the US, and for us to develop something costs hundreds of thousands pounds, so you have to be sure there is a market.""

George has trialled growing winter wheat in 50cm triple rows on his farm, which didn't drop in yield, he says.

""Winter wheat will tiller out and cover a remarkable area if you give it light and space, but I've found the complete opposite with spring cereals.""

But finding a second crop that would be harvestable in a relay crop system in the UK is very difficult, he agrees.

Wide rows

Shropshire grower John Bubb has developed a 50cm wide row strip-till system for the non-potato crops in his rotation, says his agronomist, Ed Brown of Hutchinsons.

The starting point was recognising wide row strip-till would suit both poppies and OSR.

Wheat made less sense, Ed admits, but three separate trials last season - where the wheat was drilled in a 10cm band - gave yields broadly the same as the farm standard.

""The wheat definitely tillers more, although it doesn't completely fill the gap between the rows,"" Ed says.

In the first wheat crop after potatoes, clover is now inter-row seeded with a Weaving IR drill in June, in the gap between the wheat bands after any herbicide applications have been completed.

The plan is for the clover to then stay in place until the next potato crop in five years.

""It's not there to harvest, but acts as a companion that helps soil structure, contributes to nitrogen and weed suppression.""

OSR will then be strip-tilled next season in the same bands as the wheat, with the clover left as a living understorey.

Autocasting

Other relay cropping opportunities in UK conditions include Autocasting cover crops or OSR into standing wheat or barley crops.

Drone firms are also beginning to offer similar services.

Both consistency of germination and slug control can be challenges with this system, Andrew notes, who has used both an Outcast system attached to a sprayer and Autocast on the combine to establish cover crops or OSR in standing or just harvested crops.

It can be a bit hit and miss in terms of consistency of germination, he says of his Autocast system, which he is using to establish a catch crop off the combine this year. ""You need moisture.

“The ones I did in July were too wet to roll, but ideally you go through with the rolls straight after to help with a chit and maybe to get some grassweed growing,"" says Andrew.

Slug challenge

The issue with broadcasting seed into standing crops is that slug control becomes difficult because of the risk of slug pellets getting caught in wheat ears, he adds.

Those various challenges with relay cropping are why all four currently believe that more traditional bi- or polycrop systems where the intercrops are harvested together are more likely to be successful in UK conditions.

Relay cropping winter wheat and soya beans in one season could be worth at least £605/ha (US$300/acre) more for a US farmer in Indiana compared with just growing mono soya beans in the same field.

Jason Mauck - who crops about 1,200ha, near Muncie, alongside a 12,000 wean-to-finish indoor pig unit - has been fine-tuning his relay cropping system for about eight seasons.

See also: Why cultivation equipment is making a comeback on Wiltshire farm

Relay cropping is a system of intercropping, where two crops are growing together for part of the season, but planted and harvested at different times - a form of double cropping.

In Jason's system, winter wheat is planted in strips in the autumn and harvested in July. Soya beans are planted between the wheat strips in March or April, and then harvested in October.

""At first I thought we could do everything we do with monoculture wheat and soya beans and get twice the product,"" Jason says.

""Of course, that was impossible as there is only so much water and sunlight for both crops. It took about four years to figure out this equilibrium and how to start maximising the economics.""

Maximising economics

The first proper trials began in 2015, planting two rows of wheat every 750mm, which was treated with an autumn application of pig manure.

The farm has a supply of about 22.7m litres of manure from the pig unit.

""It worked well, but my wheat was too good, yielding 110 bushel/acre [7.4t/ha].

""What I figured out was if you excite the wheat in 30in [760mm] rows, it will grow laterally and capture all the light, and there wasn't enough moisture and light for the soya beans to grow.""

After a couple more seasons of trials, he's found that planting four consecutive rows of wheat on 190mm spacings in 1,500mm centres provides a better balance to maximise solar energy use, with the drill blocked off to create the gap to plant two rows of soya beans 500mm apart.

A new technology that captures air pollution and uses sunlight to convert it into nitrate on the leaf surface of a crop has been developed by Lincoln-based Crop Intellect.

Called R-Leaf, it uses a process known as photocatalysis to break down nitrous oxide and turn it into an essential crop nutrient, offering the potential to reduce both farm emissions and the industry's reliance on synthetic nitrogen.

See also: Video: Camera technology improves marketability for potato growers

Against a background of rollercoaster fertiliser markets and environmental concerns, the technology is being feted as a ground-breaking development that will allow farmers to make better use of nitrogen fertiliser and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with its use.

Classed as a fertiliser, R-Leaf is based on titanium dioxide and comes in a liquid formulation that also contains manganese, molybdenum and zinc.

It can be applied through a standard farm sprayer to crop foliage, either on its own or as part of a tank mix.

Once applied, it uses sunlight to convert atmospheric nitrous oxide into nitrate, which the company says helps to provide the plant with a constant supply of the nutrient.

Daylight conditions

The patented photocatalyst technology contained in R-Leaf has been designed to work under normal daylight conditions, rather than needing high intensity light usually associated with such chemical reactions, Crop Intellect says.

This allows it to react with nitrous oxide in field conditions, breaking the pollutant down in to nitrate, carbon dioxide and water - all of which are required by the plant.

What is a photocatalyst?

A photocatalyst is a material that absorbs light to provide energy to a reacting substance, so that a chemical reaction occurs.

Well studied and understood, photocatalysts are used in many industries, as filters and decontaminants as well as for driving chemical reactions.

After application, it remains on the leaf surface for up to six weeks, providing nitrate in a slow-release manner and allowing farmers to manage the use of nitrogen fertiliser.

Having been tested on both combinable and root crops, and with further trial work ongoing, R-Leaf is described as a disruptive technology that enables the production of green nitrogen while reducing harmful air pollution.

Carbon credits

For growers wishing to reduce the carbon footprint of their business or with carbon trading in mind, R-Leaf's potential to contribute towards reducing climate change has been validated at 5.4t/ha of carbon dioxide equivalent when used at a rate of 2 litres/ha, with verification coming from Climate Impact Forecast tool. 

Crop Intellect

Crop Intellect is an R&D company based at Lincoln University, led by crop and soil scientist Dr Apostolos Papdopoulos.

The company has secured substantial funding to develop R-Leaf into a global solution to the sustainability and climate change challenges faced by the farming industry and wider society.

""This is a significant development for the industry's net-zero ambitions,"" says Jeremy Hitcham, commercial manager at Crop Intellect.

""Not only will it help to improve nutrient use efficiency on farms, it also has a role in reducing air pollution.

""In the future, its use should allow carbon credits to be produced, so that they can be monetised if required.""

On-farm use

He suggests two ways in which it can be used on-farm. ""The first is to reduce your bagged nitrogen by 25% and let R-Leaf provide the rest, so that yields are maintained.

""The second is to stick to your normal farm practice and apply the same amount of nitrogen, with R-Leaf being used to give additional yield.""

Either way, R-Leaf costs £25/litre, with split applications of 2 litres/ha being recommended for cereals - giving a total cost of £50/ha. The current recommendation is to apply it at T1 and T2.

The second application is required because R-Leaf doesn't move once it has been applied, explains Mr Hitcham, so a growing plant producing new leaves benefits from the follow-up as older, treated leaves become shaded.

Trials results

Already included in Tesco's large scale commercial trial on nitrogen fertiliser use, R-Leaf is one of eight alternative fertiliser products being tested by the supermarket.

It has also received recognition from Tesco in the form of an Agri T-Jam Award for Innovation, as well as winning a Lincolnshire Technology and Innovation Award.

R-Leaf is available through Agrovista and Hutchinsons this season, as well as other suppliers.

Agrovista technical manager Mark Hemmant describes it as an exciting technology which has the potential to mitigate climate change.

""We've used diffusion tubes to show that it is taking nitrous oxide out of the atmosphere and we've measured more nitrogen in the leaf and in the grain where R-Leaf has been used,"" he says.

""However, we haven't done trials on reducing synthetic nitrogen rates by 25% yet, so can't make any conclusions about that until we've done the work.""  

Case Study: Frank Stennett, Genevieve Farms, Bury St Edmunds

Suffolk sugar beet grower Frank Stennett tried R-Leaf on some of his crop last year and recorded a 6% increase in yield.

Helped by the use of irrigation in a hot, dry growing season, untreated sugar beet gave an impressive yield of 106.15t/ha, while the portion of the crop that had received 2 litres/ha of R-Leaf had an average yield of 112.28t/ha.

The cost of using the innovative product at 2 litres/ha was about £40/ha, recalls Mr Stennett, which was easily covered by the additional 6t of beet at a 2022 price of £27/t.

""It can go on as part of a tank-mix so it doesn't have to be an additional pass,"" he says. ""However, as it was the first time of using it, I decided to apply it on its own.""

He opted to stick to his farm standard of 120kg/ha of bagged nitrogen, then applying 2 litres/ha of R-Leaf, rather than using it to reduce nitrogen use.

""I wanted to see what it could do on our light soils, given the higher sugar beet price agreed with British Sugar for 2023.

""Foliar applications are a more efficient way of getting the nutrient into crops, so it gave us the chance to look at how it could help.""

Tissue testing carried out after application showed higher nitrogen levels in the leaves that had been treated.

These levels remained steady at about 5%, while the untreated crop showed a decline in nitrogen levels over time.

Given the results, Mr Stennett regrets that he didn't put a second application on.

""Unlike many others and thanks to our ability to irrigate, the crop didn't struggle with moisture stress.

""So a second treatment may have kept the leaves greener for longer and driven more yield from a later lifting date,"" he says.

""It's certainly a rain-fast product, as we were irrigating throughout the season.""

He also applied R-Leaf to winter wheat, but the combination of the farm's light soils and the season's high temperatures meant the crop burnt off before all the measurements could be taken.

He did, however, record his best-ever wheat yields in 2022 at levels in excess of 10t/ha, but is wary of drawing conclusions without data.

""I would like to try it on the oilseed rape too, but the timings are more tricky, as you have to get it all on with the sprayer before the crop gets too tall.""

He acknowledges that the R-Leaf development sounds too good to be true, but points out that it is a very timely development.

""Anything that has been shown to remove nitrous oxide from the atmosphere has to be a positive step.

""If it helps us to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with growing crops and removes a potent pollutant from the air, it will have a place in sustainable food production.""

A new technology that captures air pollution and uses sunlight to convert it into nitrate on the leaf surface of a crop has been developed by Lincoln-based Crop Intellect.

Called R-Leaf, it uses a process known as photocatalysis to break down nitrous oxide and turn it into an essential crop nutrient, offering the potential to reduce both farm emissions and the industry's reliance on synthetic nitrogen.

See also: Video: Camera technology improves marketability for potato growers

Against a background of rollercoaster fertiliser markets and environmental concerns, the technology is being feted as a ground-breaking development that will allow farmers to make better use of nitrogen fertiliser and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with its use.

Classed as a fertiliser, R-Leaf is based on titanium dioxide and comes in a liquid formulation that also contains manganese, molybdenum and zinc.

It can be applied through a standard farm sprayer to crop foliage, either on its own or as part of a tank mix.

Once applied, it uses sunlight to convert atmospheric nitrous oxide into nitrate, which the company says helps to provide the plant with a constant supply of the nutrient.

Daylight conditions

The patented photocatalyst technology contained in R-Leaf has been designed to work under normal daylight conditions, rather than needing high intensity light usually associated with such chemical reactions, Crop Intellect says.

This allows it to react with nitrous oxide in field conditions, breaking the pollutant down in to nitrate, carbon dioxide and water - all of which are required by the plant.

What is a photocatalyst?

A photocatalyst is a material that absorbs light to provide energy to a reacting substance, so that a chemical reaction occurs.

Well studied and understood, photocatalysts are used in many industries, as filters and decontaminants as well as for driving chemical reactions.

After application, it remains on the leaf surface for up to six weeks, providing nitrate in a slow-release manner and allowing farmers to manage the use of nitrogen fertiliser.

Having been tested on both combinable and root crops, and with further trial work ongoing, R-Leaf is described as a disruptive technology that enables the production of green nitrogen while reducing harmful air pollution.

Carbon credits

For growers wishing to reduce the carbon footprint of their business or with carbon trading in mind, R-Leaf's potential to contribute towards reducing climate change has been validated at 5.4t/ha of carbon dioxide equivalent when used at a rate of 2 litres/ha, with verification coming from Climate Impact Forecast tool. 

Crop Intellect

Crop Intellect is an R&D company based at Lincoln University, led by crop and soil scientist Dr Apostolos Papdopoulos.

The company has secured substantial funding to develop R-Leaf into a global solution to the sustainability and climate change challenges faced by the farming industry and wider society.

""This is a significant development for the industry's net-zero ambitions,"" says Jeremy Hitcham, commercial manager at Crop Intellect.

""Not only will it help to improve nutrient use efficiency on farms, it also has a role in reducing air pollution.

""In the future, its use should allow carbon credits to be produced, so that they can be monetised if required.""

On-farm use

He suggests two ways in which it can be used on-farm. ""The first is to reduce your bagged nitrogen by 25% and let R-Leaf provide the rest, so that yields are maintained.

""The second is to stick to your normal farm practice and apply the same amount of nitrogen, with R-Leaf being used to give additional yield.""

Either way, R-Leaf costs £25/litre, with split applications of 2 litres/ha being recommended for cereals - giving a total cost of £50/ha. The current recommendation is to apply it at T1 and T2.

The second application is required because R-Leaf doesn't move once it has been applied, explains Mr Hitcham, so a growing plant producing new leaves benefits from the follow-up as older, treated leaves become shaded.

Trials results

Already included in Tesco's large scale commercial trial on nitrogen fertiliser use, R-Leaf is one of eight alternative fertiliser products being tested by the supermarket.

It has also received recognition from Tesco in the form of an Agri T-Jam Award for Innovation, as well as winning a Lincolnshire Technology and Innovation Award.

R-Leaf is available through Agrovista and Hutchinsons this season, as well as other suppliers.

Agrovista technical manager Mark Hemmant describes it as an exciting technology which has the potential to mitigate climate change.

""We've used diffusion tubes to show that it is taking nitrous oxide out of the atmosphere and we've measured more nitrogen in the leaf and in the grain where R-Leaf has been used,"" he says.

""However, we haven't done trials on reducing synthetic nitrogen rates by 25% yet, so can't make any conclusions about that until we've done the work.""  

Case Study: Frank Stennett, Genevieve Farms, Bury St Edmunds

Suffolk sugar beet grower Frank Stennett tried R-Leaf on some of his crop last year and recorded a 6% increase in yield.

Helped by the use of irrigation in a hot, dry growing season, untreated sugar beet gave an impressive yield of 106.15t/ha, while the portion of the crop that had received 2 litres/ha of R-Leaf had an average yield of 112.28t/ha.

The cost of using the innovative product at 2 litres/ha was about £40/ha, recalls Mr Stennett, which was easily covered by the additional 6t of beet at a 2022 price of £27/t.

""It can go on as part of a tank-mix so it doesn't have to be an additional pass,"" he says. ""However, as it was the first time of using it, I decided to apply it on its own.""

He opted to stick to his farm standard of 120kg/ha of bagged nitrogen, then applying 2 litres/ha of R-Leaf, rather than using it to reduce nitrogen use.

""I wanted to see what it could do on our light soils, given the higher sugar beet price agreed with British Sugar for 2023.

""Foliar applications are a more efficient way of getting the nutrient into crops, so it gave us the chance to look at how it could help.""

Tissue testing carried out after application showed higher nitrogen levels in the leaves that had been treated.

These levels remained steady at about 5%, while the untreated crop showed a decline in nitrogen levels over time.

Given the results, Mr Stennett regrets that he didn't put a second application on.

""Unlike many others and thanks to our ability to irrigate, the crop didn't struggle with moisture stress.

""So a second treatment may have kept the leaves greener for longer and driven more yield from a later lifting date,"" he says.

""It's certainly a rain-fast product, as we were irrigating throughout the season.""

He also applied R-Leaf to winter wheat, but the combination of the farm's light soils and the season's high temperatures meant the crop burnt off before all the measurements could be taken.

He did, however, record his best-ever wheat yields in 2022 at levels in excess of 10t/ha, but is wary of drawing conclusions without data.

""I would like to try it on the oilseed rape too, but the timings are more tricky, as you have to get it all on with the sprayer before the crop gets too tall.""

He acknowledges that the R-Leaf development sounds too good to be true, but points out that it is a very timely development.

""Anything that has been shown to remove nitrous oxide from the atmosphere has to be a positive step.

""If it helps us to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with growing crops and removes a potent pollutant from the air, it will have a place in sustainable food production.""

As weekend temperatures are expected to soar to 30C in parts of the country, rural insurer NFU Mutual has urged farmers to protect dairy herds against heat stress.

Key research found that 41% of dairy farmers said heat stress is a priority risk for their business, with average loss of production ranging from £24,000-£90,000 depending on herd size.

With the warmer summer months now upon us, key steps to ease the effects of heat stress include ensuring cattle have access to water troughs with suitable water flows, and identifying paddocks with more shade to use on hot days.

See also: Anger as Arla unveils plans for plant-based Lurpak butter

The insurer also recommends a ""siesta"" management style, where cows graze directly after milking and are housed at around 10am, with buffer feed available to them.

Cows are then sent back out to graze after the afternoon milking to graze until dusk, avoiding the worst of the day's heat.

Gregor Belcher, farm specialist at NFU Mutual, said: ""Heat stress in cows is becoming a major concern for many dairy farmers as summers get hotter.

""These measures can help reduce the negative impact that heat stress can have on welfare and a herd's productivity.""

A radical grazing technique is gathering pace which claims to maximise grassland production and rumen function by baring off pasture at the 3.5-leaf stage.

""Total grazing"" involves moving cattle four times a day, and grazing longer grass than conventional rotational grazing, but shorter than many regenerative approaches.

Advocates say this non-selective grazing method lowers costs, improves animal health, and stimulates humus formation through root exudates.

See also: 5 mistakes when adopting regen farming and how to avoid them

They say the roots are the primary drivers of humus formation and leaf litter is a secondary element.

This clashes with many regenerative systems, which emphasise leaving armour covering the soil, maintaining leaves to drive photosynthesis, and creating humus through trampled leaf litter.

Advisers and researchers are advising a ""handle with care"" approach to total grazing because it involves a different grazing pressure and management system.

Scientific verification

Total grazing is the brainchild of Jaime Elizondo, a Mexican rancher and consultant now farming in Texas. He has farmed dairy cows, beef and sheep in the Americas.

He claims a growing body of research - including a study in New Phytologist - has given credence to his theory by proving that root exudates are the prime driver of humus production and more stable forms of soil organic carbon, and are two to 13 times more important than leaf litter degradation.

Speaking at the regenerative farming conference Carbon Calling, near Appleby-in-Westmorland, Cumbria, Jaime, of Real Wealth Ranching, told delegates that many regenerative farmers were ""years behind"".

""Overgrazing is not how hard you graze but how fast you return,"" he said. ""If you return before the plant has replenished its carbohydrate reserves, you are overgrazing.

""Total grazing has doubled the stocking rate compared to selective rotational grazing in a variety of environments,"" he added. ""I ran 700 cows on 300ha with no fertiliser.""

What does total grazing involve?

Some distinctive features are as follows:

Graze the entire plant

Do not leave any leaf (""solar panel"") on the plant as this will shade out growing points at the bottom of the stem. Instead, graze the entire plant, giving the animal more fibre to balance the energy and protein.

This, in theory, removes the risk of low pH in the rumen (from oversupply of rapidly fermentable energy) and low-pH blood (from oversupply of protein to the rumen) and leads to healthier sheep and cattle.

Graze at the 3.5-leaf stage

This means more fibre is present than at a younger stage, but the plant is yet to seed, so quality is sufficient. This more advanced plant can regrow from the energy in its root systems, rather than by photosynthesis.

Law of thirds

Split your farm into three. The first third is the intensively grazed portion for the growing season. The second is buffer to get through droughts. The final third is deferred for grazing in winter and hay cuts if needed.

These can be rotated from year to year as much as possible.

Move stock four times a day

Rumens work on four or five eating events a day (batch rumen process), so shift cattle onto a fresh break four times daily to ensure they are hungry and can eat the sward down. Daily moves will do, but they are not as good.

More moves each day result in more summer rest time (30-45 days) so the sward can reach the 3.5-leaf stage by the time the livestock return.

Adapted genetics

Livestock must be selected and reared in a forage-based environment to thrive.

Trees and livestock

Paddocks are split up by trees (30-40m apart), offering shade, nutrition, and rooting systems under the grassland to help soil biology and mycorrhizas. A savannah should be created, which is 30% trees.

Biochar

Cattle can be supplemented (80-100g a head a day) with biochar (pyrolysed wood or vegetation) to maintain health and help carbon storage in the soil.

Reaction: Pros and cons

Farmers Weekly asked Harper Adams University beef and sheep production lecturer Sarah Morgan, soil adviser Ian Bell of Northern Soil Regen, Glyn Mitchell of the Carbon Farm Hub, and farmers at Carbon Calling for their views and advice.

Feeding more milk to dairy calves to achieve faster growth rates is no longer just a management technique.

Dairy farmers need to rethink their calf rearing, because feeding more than the traditional two litres twice a day, weaning later, and rearing calves in pairs or groups are all essential to meet the biological needs of the calf.

This was the message from scientists speaking recently at Trouw Nutrition's third calf symposium. They agreed these methods are the way to produce a resilient and sustainable dairy cow.

Heifer rearing objectives a decade ago focused on growth, lean animals and early weaning, said Trouw's head of ruminant research, Dr Javier Martin-Tereso.

Yet he said that a lean calf at weaning does not produce more milk as an adult.

See also: Why feeding more milk to calves is more cost-effective

The goals have now shifted and today welfare is top of the list of priorities, which means meeting the biological needs of the calf including:

However, Javier reported a survey of British dairy farmers that confirmed 65% still feed less than six litres of milk/day a calf.

Prof Nina Von Keyserlingk, from the University of British Columbia, argued that caring for the calf means feeding it more milk.

""Restricted feeding causes them to suck another calf because they are hungry,"" she said, adding that calves have a biological need to suckle. This is why teat feeding is better.

Rearing in groups

Milk drunk from a bucket ""disappears in 45 seconds"", said Nina, while a teat stimulates and satisfies natural suckling behaviour, generating saliva, which neutralises gut acidity.

Trials have also shown the importance of rearing calves socially, as they can adapt to new situations (whereas individually reared calves cannot). This is important for future herd life, she said.

""While efforts can be made to meet its biological needs, the difficulty is in measuring a calf's emotional state. Often, the term ""˜environment enrichment' sounds like something is added if we have a bit of cash.

""Instead, we should talk about well-resourced pens, giving the calf what it needs,"" she added.

Research shows that meeting the calf's biological needs in early life switches on the calf's signals to develop metabolism and lifetime productivity.

""Every step taken to meet the calf's biological needs results in a fantastic response - short and long term - and benefits the calf.

""She is more likely to stay in the herd and be more productive. There is a return on investment,"" said Javier.

Cattle, sheep and dairy farmers concerned about the rising risk of tick-borne diseases in their livestock are being invited to take part in a three-year research project.

The aim of Optick is to understand how to improve surveillance and management of tick-borne disease threats in the UK's changing environment. It is funded by UK Research and Innovation and Defra.

See also: Redwater fever in cattle: What it is and how to manage it

Climate change, land-use changes (such as more woodland), and a growing density of deer and livestock hosts are driving the increased threat, says Dr Beth Purse of the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.

Beth is the co-principal investigator of the project. She says: ""We need to understand how woodland expansion for biodiversity, through Environmental Land Management schemes, is going to trade off with tick-borne disease risks."" 

Growing risk

Optick focuses on the impact of four diseases, all transmitted by the same vector, Ixodes ricinus.

This tick has traditionally been associated with forests, but it can build up to high densities in grassland and moorland, posing a risk to sheep and cattle grazing in these areas, as well to farmers and the public.

These diseases are:

""Globally, there is an increase in tick-borne disease burdens, and we can see new tick risk areas emerging, causing unpredictable disease incidents like herd breakdowns,"" says Beth. 

""These diseases rank high among farmer priorities, according to Ruminant Health & Welfare.

""Although not particularly widespread, they can have severe long-term impacts on production in tick-dense areas,"" she adds.

Knowledge gaps

The project is designed to address key gaps in knowledge that hamper disease management. These include:

By involving all sectors at each stage of the project, researchers aim to ""develop the best evidence base for policy and farm management"".

The study will also produce surveillance tools, risk guidance and modelling frameworks to help farmers be more prepared in tackling these diseases. 

How to get involved

Farmers and vets are invited to take part in interviews and surveys covering farmer perceptions and priorities about ticks, tick-borne diseases, disease control strategies and impacts.

These, and a series of annual workshops, will begin in December/January.

In addition, in North Wales, and Devon and Cornwall - previous hotspots for tick-borne diseases in livestock with high densities of all the key hosts - researchers are seeking 40 farms where they can carry out ecological surveys and blood-sample livestock for pathogens.

Findings will be integrated with landscape analysis and transmission modelling.

To find out how to take part, go to optick.ceh.ac.uk or email info_optick@ceh.ac.uk

Optick is a partnership between the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, University of Liverpool, Moredun, the Animal and Plant Health Agency and UK Health Security Agency.

The UK is in the grip of its worst-ever avian influenza outbreak, TB continues to ravage farms and African swine fever is spreading westwards across Europe.

Most farms have a general livestock insurance policy, but often only after a serious disease has struck does it become clear that specific losses were not covered.

General livestock insurance policies do not come with disease cover as standard.

See also: Business clinic: does insurance cover costs of fly tipping?

Farmers often assume that the loss of an animal to disease will be covered, but policies are more likely to cover general risks such as fire damage, accidents and theft.

Animal losses to disease must be specified separately and will come at an additional cost, says Chris Walsh, farming insurance specialist at NFU Mutual.

Diseases covered

Foot-and-mouth, avian influenza, salmonella, classical swine fever, TB, brucellosis, Aujeszky's disease, maedi visna and anthrax are among the most commonly available diseases for addition to policies.

The cost and availability of the options varies according to the ever-changing level of risk.

For example, poultry farms have been in the grip of the worst-ever avian flu outbreak. The average pay-out to affected farms is £600,000 over the past year, and some individual claims have cost insurers more than £1m.

While progress on a vaccine offers hope, the assumption made by some global insurance risk assessors is that the virus could be endemic in the UK, says Mr Walsh.

Poultry keepers with existing avian flu policies will be able to keep their cover, but the risk and costs are too great to insure any new customers at present.

Likewise, for bovine TB insurance, farms in hotspots and with a history of breakdowns, can find it difficult to obtain cover.

Matt McWhirter, divisional director at insurance broker Lycetts, says the TB situation demonstrates the difficulty in insuring against livestock disease losses.

In areas such as vehicle cover, insurance is mandatory. This provides a nationwide funding base for the small percentage of drivers who make claims, he says.

However, livestock disease cover is not compulsory, so in areas with a low risk of a disease, such as TB in the east of England and Scotland, farmers will not take out insurance.

Those in high-risk areas will want cover, bringing insurers a high risk of paying out from a limited funding base.

This is the key reason why livestock disease insurance is becoming increasingly expensive, Mr McWhirter he says. 

Although the pig sector faces the looming threat of African swine fever (ASF) arriving in the UK, a combination of rising input prices and post-Covid/post-Brexit market disruption, has forced farms into the red and disease cover is a cost too far.

NFU Mutual has offered an ASF option to policyholders since December 2019. Since then the disease has spread westwards across Europe, with cases reported in wild boar in Germany.

Despite the increasing risk, only a handful of producers have taken out the policy. Mr Walsh says: ""It is one more cost to bear for the industry, and without a case so far in the UK, the risk is seen to be one worth taking,"" says Mr Walsh.

However, the situation would change rapidly if the disease made the jump across the Channel. Demand for cover would rise and the risk to insurers would grow.

How long insurers would be able to offer cover to new customers remains to be seen.

Mr Walsh says it is likely it would follow the same pattern as avian flu, with early policy­holders accessing cover more easily and later requests facing higher premiums or no offer at all.

Insurance cost

A premium of £250 would provide about £100,000 of disease cover, according to Lycetts, but the figures vary hugely between businesses which have distinct risk levels.

The disease profile within an area and the individual risks - herd or flock size and management system - all have a bearing on the final cost of cover.
Premiums have changed over the past 18 months.

The costs of replacing stock or contaminated feed following an outbreak, plus any required cleaning and disinfection operations, have all risen, says Mr McWhirter.

Practice on the farm will affect payment rates too. A business that buys in stock from a high risk area or with lower levels of biosecurity could see premiums adjusted upwards or cover refused altogether.

What does insurance cover?

Diseases such as avian flu, TB and brucellosis attract government compensation at a percentage rate of the animal's value. Insurance is then used to cover a proportion of the remaining amount.

Primary disinfection is carried out by government officials, with the cost borne by Defra, but the cost of secondary cleaning and disinfection is down to the farmer's account.

The outlay for operations after an outbreak of the virus can be considerable, particularly as fuel, chemical and labour costs have gone up. However, this cost can be included in policies.

An area that is often overlooked is business interruption. Disease outbreaks and government movement or trade restrictions can shut down businesses for long periods.

The resulting loss of income can be higher than the original livestock losses, so it is worth considering cover that bridges the gap until cash starts to flow into the business again.

Avoiding pitfalls

The first step is to research and consult on the risk and potential cover available with a broker or a range of advisers.

Discussing any changes and keeping the insurer up to date with these is vital. Cover can be refused if the farm details are altered after the cover has been taken out, Mr Walsh says.

For example, even small changes to stock numbers or buying procedures - such as taking stock from a new area - may alter the cover required.

Breakdowns in biosecurity may also nullify a claim. Insurers will investigate farms and may not pay out if agreed levels of biosecurity have not been met, he adds.

It is important to understand precisely what is included in a policy, along with any obligations this places on the insured, so it should be read and any queries addressed.

""Don't assume that the words brucellosis or anthrax in a policy mean that animal losses to the disease are automatically covered,"" says Mr McWhirter.

Understanding what is included also applies with an annual policy renewal - book a date about four weeks ahead of the policy being reissued.

That gives time to ensure all the details are correct, any changes are explored and that the cover is still appropriate.

It is important to keep abreast of changes that may affect the value of stock and any issues affecting exposure to disease risks.

Our review of 2023 in agricultural events continues with a look at July and August, when an early harvest (for some), the Sustainable Farming Incentive, farmworker deaths, anti-farming agendas, rural crime initiatives, bovine TB, beavers, excessive paperwork and staff shortages were all hot topics.

See also: Natural England told to change farmer engagement on Dartmoor

July

Catchy weather meant the 2023 harvest got off to a faltering start but for some winter barley growers who were combining at the start of the month it was their earliest ever harvest.

Not such good news for the winter wheat harvest though as rain delayed cutting until the end of July.

It wasn't the weather that put a dampener on relations between farmers and the Welsh government at the Royal Welsh Show""¦ it was trees.

NFU Cymru president Aled Jones and his deputy Abi Reader announced that they would boycott the proposed Sustainable Farming Scheme if the government didn't row back on its requirement for farms to have 10% tree cover to be eligible to join.

Rural affairs minister Lesley Griffiths said she was ""extremely disappointed"".

Carmarthenshire farmer Ian Rickman was elected as the new president of the Farmers' Union of Wales.

Health and Safety Executive data showed there had been 21 recorded farmworker deaths in the UK over the past year.

Six members of the public were also fatally injured on farms, bringing the total to 27. Statistically, this made agriculture the most dangerous industry in the country.

An update to the 1972 Poisons Act was announced by the Home Office requiring farmers to provide photo ID from 1 October 2023 when they purchase ammonium nitrate (AN).

Fertiliser manufacturer CF Industries said it would close its ammonia production facility at Billingham in County Durham with the loss of 38 jobs, leaving the UK more reliant on imported ammonia to produce AN.

MPs called for a review of Natural England's remit amid accusations of an ""anti-farming agenda"" after a series of controversial decisions, including a proposal to restrict livestock grazing on Dartmoor without consulting farmers.

Brad Tooze, director of greener farming at Natural England, acknowledged that ""high-profile, difficult cases"" had fed into negative feelings towards the agency.

MPs on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs committee also called for a review of the protected status of beavers.

Excessive paperwork was blamed for keeping farmers in the office for more than 15 hours a week. A survey had shown that the most time-consuming tasks were linked to assurance scheme compliance.

There was more positive news from Hampshire County Council as it bucked the trend of authorities selling off council farms by signing five new tenancies.

And an eight-year-old Simmental-cross cow owned by Dorset farmer Philip Dean gave birth to triplet heifer calves, an event that happens just once in every 100,000 births.

A Colorado beetle was found in a field in Kent.

August 

August saw a new weapon in the fight against rural crime, with the creation of the National Rural Crime Unit to share intelligence across UK police forces and overseas.

A new NFU Mutual report showed that the cost of rural crime to the industry had risen by £9m, to £45.9m, over the past 12 months.

© Tim Scrivener

Another new report, this time from the NFU, showed that almost one-third of dairy farmers were considering quitting the sector.

Insufficient returns, volatile markets and requirements for on-farm investment were cited as reasons.

In Wales, it was the pressure on farmers from bovine TB that hit the headlines.

A survey highlighted the financial and mental health toll the disease was having on dairy and beef producers.

Of the 101 farms with a breakdown at that time, 72 had been under restrictions for more than five years.

Pembrokeshire milk producer Steve Evans called on the Welsh government to introduce a targeted badger cull.

But the government responded by insisting there was ""no evidence"" that culling badgers would significantly help the country achieve its goal of TB eradication.

Animal disease outbreaks were listed on the UK government's official risk register as among some of the most serious threats the country faced.

Diseases such as African swine fever, foot-and-mouth disease and avian influenza were listed as threats in the first update to the register in three years.

Funding worth £9m was given to 14 research projects to tackle endemic disease in the UK livestock sector, with recipients - including researchers - investigating the use of artificial intelligence for early detection of disease in dairy cattle and vaccines for bovine respiratory disease.

After a long period of losses, many pork producers saw a return to profit thanks to higher pig prices and falling costs of production.

But difficulties continued for meat processors with a warning of staff shortages in the food supply chain.

Chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association Nick Allen said high visa costs had made sourcing skilled workers from overseas increasingly difficult.

Meanwhile, farm businesses were urged not to fall foul of new government rules on employing illegal workers, with penalties increasing from £15,000 to £45,000 per illegal worker for a first-time breach.

The Farm Safety Foundation's annual Mind Your Head campaign returns for its sixth year this week, with a rallying call for farmers and industry to work together to tackle the root causes of stress, anxiety and poor mental health.

This year's campaign runs from 13 to 17 February and comes at a time when growing pressures and uncertainty have contributed to a deterioration of mental health within the sector. The Office for National Statistics reported 36 farming suicides in England and Wales in 2021.

Farming charities: Who to call to get help 

Rabi 0800 188 4444

Rsabi 0808 1234 555

FCN 03000 111999

Yellow Wellies 01789 455198

Bringing together more than 300 farming organisations and charities, the week-long event strives to break down the stigma associated with mental health, bypassing the invisible barriers that prevent some farmers from seeking help.

See also: Video: Son's death leads family to back mental health charity

Stephanie Berkeley, manager of the Farm Safety Foundation (aka Yellow Wellies), said: ""Our research shows that levels of mental health in farming are deteriorating and it is being propelled by - in addition to many other things - the current political climate, stress caused by Covid and its aftermath, spiralling costs and continuing barriers to adequate care for many people living and working in the rural community.

""Urgent action is needed to support the ongoing mental health of our farmers.""

A survey of more than 900 farmers found that 94% of the UK's young farmers believe mental health is one of the greatest, and most hidden, challenges facing the industry - a figure that has risen from 84% in 2019.

Yellow Wellies is encouraging farmers to get involved and share their stories using the #MindYourHead hashtag on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. For more information, visit yellowwellies.org.

Parents of tragic young farmer join the campaign

Andy and Lynda Eadon, from Warwickshire, lost their son Leonard, a student at Harper Adams University, who took his own life in January 2022 aged just 22 years old.

A year on, the couple are passionate advocates for mental health in agriculture and have given their backing to Yellow Wellies' Mind Your Head campaign. They are using their own heart-breaking experience to raise awareness of the signs of poor mental health and how to help someone find the confidence to seek the support they need.

The couple have created the Five-a-Day Challenge in Leonard's memory.

Lynda said: ""When Leonard died, it became a very strong feeling that we had to do something to bring people in the farming community together to talk. This is why Andy devised Five-a-Day Challenge - five very simple things you can do every day to look after your mental health.

""Our hope is that, because Leonard was so well known and it shocked so many people, we want people to keep talking about it and keep remembering him and realise that they need to be aware of what they're feeling and reach out if they need it. There is no shame. There is no stigma. But there is support.""

So far, more than 18,000 of the bright-red Five-a-Day challenge cards have been distributed to markets, young farmers' clubs and through the NFU Student Farmer magazine.

Six farmers hope to implement a new assurance standard this September, paving the way to sell regenerative produce under a premium label.

The Green Farm Collective initiative also aims to share knowledge on regenerative farming practices, and trade both carbon and biodiversity at a premium price.

See also: Biological brews help grower keep crop disease at bay

It is currently developing its own set of unique Food Integrity Assurance standards, which will enable the sale of regenerative produce, using the groups' audited premium label. 

Ready for implementation in September 2023, the standard will require membership for a baseline such as Red Tractor or Leaf. Assessment will be delivered via a self-declared checklist submitted by each member.

One of the six founders, Michael Kavanagh, who hosted a recent open day in Shropshire, says: ""The Green Farm Collective is a brand created by farmers for farmers.""

The collective is working to the following principles: member knowledge exchange, establishing a premium regenerative food standard, and trading carbon and biodiversity to private companies and individuals.

""We are firm believers of producing regeneratively produced food for a premium price that will benefit human health, soils and the environment,"" he says.

Innovation award

The Green Farm Collective has launched a Green Innovation Award.

The £10,000 prize will go to a project that actively contributes to sustainable farming practices.

Competitors must demonstrate how they would implement an innovation on farm, which improves the farming system and has a marked impact on the sustainability of the farm or sees biodiversity improvements. 

Membership criteria

Farmers who practise regenerative and nature-friendly farming techniques are welcome to join the collective, alongside ethical businesses and individuals who want to invest in sustainable farming practices and environmental outputs.

However, farmer ""suppliers"" wanting to join must fit certain criteria before they can become a member.

This includes running a farm business which demonstrates net-zero, certified natural capital credentials, high soil health status, quantified soil carbon verification and operating regenerative practices.

""‹Speaker and honorary member of the collective Patrick Holford has spent 40 years studying human health and endorses the initiative's regenerative farming methods.

He believes farmers can increase the nutrient value of food by better managing soils, therefore, reducing the amount of food consumers need to eat to obtain nutrition for overall health.

""Research shows that health issues can be solved with correct nutrition. Healthy soil improves food nutrient density, which improves our health and the quality of our lives,"" says Patrick.

""My focus now, is on agricultural soils."" 

Benefits of membership

An annual active farm business membership costs £250, and provides:

Sponsorship membership costs £10/year with access to:

Corporate and Individual adviser membership is also available.""‹

""‹Carbon and biodiversity investments

The Green Farm Collective has constructed a carbon package to sell to prospective customers and two further biodiversity bundles that investors can benefit from.

Trinity AgTech's digital carbon calculator, Sandy, is used to record and generate carbon and natural capital data.

Carbon certificates will be sold on an annual basis, but only if farms are reaching net zero with excess carbon to sell.

Two biodiversity investments will also be available, sold as an annual agreement. Trading of both carbon and natural capital is via Trinity Natural Capital Markets.

The first package is based on in-field biodiversity within the crop.

This ensures farmland is managed sustainably to encourage soil health, in line with the Green Farm Collective farming policy such as adopting no-till and reducing synthetic inputs.

The second package is centred on enhancing biodiversity areas around field margins, hedges, ponds, trees, beetle banks and wildflower areas. 

""‹The collective also intends to create crowdfunded projects for the Green Farm Collective community to invest in.

These could include specific wildlife and habitat creation or enhancement and public engagement/education facilities.

Founders of the Green Farm Collective

From left: Jake, Michael, Tim, Simon, Richard and Angus © Green Farm Collective

Jake Freestone

Jake is farm manager at Overbury Farms in the Cotswolds, where he operates a no-till system, with extensive cover crops, in a diversified rotation which integrates sheep. Insecticides are no longer used, and seed dressings have largely been eliminated. He takes pride in using regenerative practices to increase biodiversity across the estate.

Michael Kavanagh

Michael manages a farm in Shropshire, where his focus lies in promoting plant health and minimising artificial inputs. He grows milling wheat, malting barley and quinoa, and runs a flock of 500 ewes. He has not applied insecticides on crops for seven years, helping promote populations of beneficial insects. 

Tim Parton

Staffordshire farmer Tim describes himself as a ""biological farmer"". He fuels the health of his soils and crops through a combination of home-brewed microbe and fungal mixes and timely micro-nutrient sprays.

He has eliminated synthetic fungicide use and places nutrition at the heart of his crop production strategy.

Simon Cowell

Farming on the east coast of Essex on low-lying land with little natural topsoil, Simon has reduced cultivations for the last 20 years to let soils naturally restructure and build fertility.

He runs a­ diverse rotation of up to 10 different crops which includes legumes and flowering crops to fix N and provide habitats for pollinators. Resultingly, he has seen a significant cut in artificial chemical and fertiliser use.

Richard Suddes

Richard farms beef and arable with his family in County Durham. His 140-head of pedigree Limousine cattle are fed on grass, silage and a 98% home-grown cereal ration.

The family also run a large free-range egg unit, where artificial fertiliser use for muck has been considerably cut back. Richard plans to completely eliminate fertiliser use in the near future.

Angus Gowthorpe  

North Yorkshire beef and arable farmer Angus places soil health at the heart of crop production. He has significantly reduced inputs cost and largely maintained crop yields.

He can now confidently grow crops without synthetic fungicides, insecticides and plant growth regulators.

The Green Farm Collective initiative also aims to share knowledge on regenerative farming practices, and trade both carbon and biodiversity at a premium price.

It is currently developing its own set of unique Food Integrity Assurance standards, which will enable the sale of regenerative produce, using the groups' audited premium label. 

Ready for implementation in September 2023, the standard will require membership for a baseline such as Red Tractor or Leaf. Assessment will be delivered via a self-declared checklist submitted by each member.

One of the six founders, Michael Kavanagh, who hosted a recent open day in Shropshire, says: ""The Green Farm Collective is a brand created by farmers for farmers.""

The collective is working to the following principles: member knowledge exchange, establishing a premium regenerative food standard, and trading carbon and biodiversity to private companies and individuals.

""We are firm believers of producing regeneratively produced food for a premium price that will benefit human health, soils and the environment,"" he says.

Innovation award

The Green Farm Collective has launched a Green Innovation Award.

The £10,000 prize will go to a project that actively contributes to sustainable farming practices.

Competitors must demonstrate how they would implement an innovation on farm, which improves the farming system and has a marked impact on the sustainability of the farm or sees biodiversity improvements. 

Membership criteria

Farmers who practise regenerative and nature-friendly farming techniques are welcome to join the collective, alongside ethical businesses and individuals who want to invest in sustainable farming practices and environmental outputs.

However, farmer ""suppliers"" wanting to join must fit certain criteria before they can become a member.

This includes running a farm business which demonstrates net-zero, certified natural capital credentials, high soil health status, quantified soil carbon verification and operating regenerative practices.

""‹Speaker and honorary member of the collective Patrick Holford has spent 40 years studying human health and endorses the initiative's regenerative farming methods.

He believes farmers can increase the nutrient value of food by better managing soils, therefore, reducing the amount of food consumers need to eat to obtain nutrition for overall health.

""Research shows that health issues can be solved with correct nutrition. Healthy soil improves food nutrient density, which improves our health and the quality of our lives,"" says Patrick.

""My focus now, is on agricultural soils."" 

Benefits of membership

An annual active farm business membership costs £250, and provides:

Sponsorship membership costs £10/year with access to:

Corporate and Individual adviser membership is also available.""‹

""‹Carbon and biodiversity investments

The Green Farm Collective has constructed a carbon package to sell to prospective customers and two further biodiversity bundles that investors can benefit from.

Trinity AgTech's digital carbon calculator, Sandy, is used to record and generate carbon and natural capital data.

Carbon certificates will be sold on an annual basis, but only if farms are reaching net zero with excess carbon to sell.

Two biodiversity investments will also be available, sold as an annual agreement. Trading of both carbon and natural capital is via Trinity Natural Capital Markets.

The first package is based on in-field biodiversity within the crop.

This ensures farmland is managed sustainably to encourage soil health, in line with the Green Farm Collective farming policy such as adopting no-till and reducing synthetic inputs.

The second package is centred on enhancing biodiversity areas around field margins, hedges, ponds, trees, beetle banks and wildflower areas. 

""‹The collective also intends to create crowdfunded projects for the Green Farm Collective community to invest in.

These could include specific wildlife and habitat creation or enhancement and public engagement/education facilities.

Jake Freestone

Jake is farm manager at Overbury Farms in the Cotswolds, where he operates a no-till system, with extensive cover crops, in a diversified rotation which integrates sheep. Insecticides are no longer used, and seed dressings have largely been eliminated. He takes pride in using regenerative practices to increase biodiversity across the estate.

Michael Kavanagh

Michael manages a farm in Shropshire, where his focus lies in promoting plant health and minimising artificial inputs. He grows milling wheat, malting barley and quinoa, and runs a flock of 500 ewes. He has not applied insecticides on crops for seven years, helping promote populations of beneficial insects. 

Tim Parton

Staffordshire farmer Tim describes himself as a ""biological farmer"". He fuels the health of his soils and crops through a combination of home-brewed microbe and fungal mixes and timely micro-nutrient sprays.

He has eliminated synthetic fungicide use and places nutrition at the heart of his crop production strategy.

Simon Cowell

Farming on the east coast of Essex on low-lying land with little natural topsoil, Simon has reduced cultivations for the last 20 years to let soils naturally restructure and build fertility.

He runs a­ diverse rotation of up to 10 different crops which includes legumes and flowering crops to fix N and provide habitats for pollinators. Resultingly, he has seen a significant cut in artificial chemical and fertiliser use.

Richard Suddes

Richard farms beef and arable with his family in County Durham. His 140-head of pedigree Limousine cattle are fed on grass, silage and a 98% home-grown cereal ration.

The family also run a large free-range egg unit, where artificial fertiliser use for muck has been considerably cut back. Richard plans to completely eliminate fertiliser use in the near future.

Angus Gowthorpe  

North Yorkshire beef and arable farmer Angus places soil health at the heart of crop production. He has significantly reduced inputs cost and largely maintained crop yields.

He can now confidently grow crops without synthetic fungicides, insecticides and plant growth regulators.

Farmers Weekly has launched a landmark survey to measure the progress which has been made for women in agriculture over the past ten years.

The views of women and men are being sought as part of the research, which builds on a similar survey carried out by Farmers Weekly in 2014.

The results from this survey will help form the basis of direction for a new Farmers Weekly campaign - Level The Field - which will seek to engage all people and organisations across our industry to bring about change that will make agriculture fairer, more equitable and more inviting for women. 

 

We're seeking cross-industry involvement and representation and the campaign is already supported by the NFU, the CLA and crop production and grain marketing business Frontier Agriculture.

See also: Opinion: Celebrating the achievements of women in farming

Huge strides have already been made for women in farming over the past few decades, but problems still remain, such as:

Level The Field will seek to offer solutions to these issues through an innovative set of measures, supported by key partners in the industry such as The Institute for Agriculture and Horticulture (Tiah), to be revealed in the new year.

The Liberal Democrats have passed a motion at their autumn party conference calling for an extra £1bn/year to be added to the UK farming budget.

Research by the House of Commons Library, commissioned and analysed by the Lib Dems, has shown that farming subsidies have taken an 8.3% real-terms cut since 2019. 

If the 2019 funding of £3.304m had kept pace with inflation, the 2022 budget should have sat at £3.478m.

See also: Defra provides clarity on farming budget spend

Instead, last year it was £3.212m, meaning there was a £265m shortfall, or a real-terms cut of 8.3%. 

Lib Dem MP for Somerton and Frome Sarah Dyke, who comes from a family of farmers, accused the Conservative government of pushing farmers out of business through a lack of financial support and undercutting them in trade deals.

""The Conservatives have completely abandoned the farming community,"" said Ms Dyke, when reading the motion at the conference in Bournemouth on Monday 25 September.

""Everywhere you turn, they are pushing farmers out of business, refusing to give them the financial support they need to keep feeding the nation their great produce.""

Ms Dyke called for more support for local produce, as opposed to post-Brexit trade deals that have undercut farmers and ""pushed many farm businesses to the brink"".

""Without this investment, we will see more farms go under and the public will not be able to try our fantastic domestic produce,"" said Ms Dyke.

""Farmers are essential to the UK economy and way of life. We have to ensure that can continue long into the future.""

Defra spent £2.23bn on the farming budget in the 2022-23 financial year, which was below the government's commitment to spend an average of £2.4bn for each year across the life of this parliament.

""˜Every penny to be spent'

Defra ministers have pledged to roll over any unspent money into 2024 and promised that every penny earmarked for agriculture by the Treasury will be spent.

The UK government currently allocates about £3.5bn in total to the UK agriculture budget each year - a legacy of the old EU CAP. This figure has not changed since Brexit, but has been eaten into by inflation.

In July, a study commissioned by the RSPB, the National Trust and the Wildlife Trusts, and launched at the Groundswell regenerative farming event, concluded devolved governments must invest at least £4.4bn/year in nature- and climate-friendly farming to meet environmental commitments.

Farmers Weekly has contacted Defra for a comment.

How Lantra can help solve farming's skills shortage

Provided by

Lantra is a skills charity, committed to supporting workforce development in the environmental and land-based sector by providing comprehensive careers information, robust industry intelligence, and nationally recognised training and qualifications.

It's National Careers Week and a perfect time to explore the rewarding employment opportunities land-based industries have to offer.

Lantra's CEO Marcus Potter explains how the organisation's new website can help.

© Lantra

Why have you decided to launch a new website?

Finding your dream job or the next step on the ladder can be a daunting task, as information sources are limited.

Colleges and universities offer some of their own information and advice, but this is fragmented and not always easy to find.

We wanted to make it simpler for those interested in a career in environment and land-based industries like farming to get the help they need, all in one convenient place.

There is also a skills shortage throughout the food supply chain, from production on farm through to processing, and we feel a duty to help meet this challenge.

A 2022 Institute of Agriculture and Horticulture (TIAH) survey of 681 farming employers reported that 25% were currently seeking staff and 63% said filling vacancies was ""difficult"".

Certified tractor drivers and sprayer operators, stock/herdspersons and general farm workers were some of the hard-to-fill roles, and knowledge or skills in health and safety, environmental and regulatory, basic IT and biosecurity are lacking in the talent pool.

This makes it hard for employers to find the right people and the lack of skills and knowledge also has implications for staff productivity.

Recent changes to agricultural policy, with food producers now having sustainability and net-zero obligations to meet, is only exacerbating the situation, as it requires a completely new set of skills.

Agriculture is no longer the sector for low skilled workers it's perceived to be and we hope the new resource will help people find and fill vacancies and solve the labour and skills shortage.

Kirsty Muirden © Lantra

Why has Lantra taken a lead on careers information?

After government funding to sector skills councils was cut in 2014, Lantra wound down its careers services and focussed solely on training, which remains one of its core offerings.

We are a not-for-profit organisation and now the training side of the business is making a surplus, we have taken the opportunity to reinvest and reinvigorate our role as a national careers information provider.

Lantra also felt that some preconceptions about farming and other land-based industries needed to be challenged.

By doing this through the website and other media, we hope the initiative will help deepen the talent pool available to employers.

This includes promoting women in land-based roles traditionally dominated by men and tapping into inner city and ethnic communities, whose members may not be aware of the opportunities available.

We are also increasing investment in granular research to identify where the skills shortages are.

We can then use that information to improve our training offering or work with specialist third parties to deliver on industry needs.

Matthew Douglas © Lantra

How will the website help career seekers?

Lantra has designed its website to showcase more than 250 roles across land-based sectors, with a significant chunk related to food production.

Users can browse these roles, find detailed information on qualifications and training needed and how to get it, expected pay and conditions, and common day-to-day tasks.

In many sectors, career progression is very structured and linear, but it is not always as clear cut in agriculture and horticulture.

That is why the website also outlines career progression opportunities that might arise from each role, shaking off the assumption that farming is low-paid, low-skilled and offers little chance of moving up the ladder.

There are cases where an employee has started as a herdsperson on a stock farm and is now agriculture manager for a major food company.

We give an indication of the path a career might take with the right training and qualifications.

How will the website help employers?

The 2022 TIAH report suggests that 37% of business respondents are not confident of retaining staff and some 45% had lost staff in the past 12 months before responding.

The new website can show employers the skills and training their employees need and how to facilitate courses, which helps make staff feel valued. In turn, this will increase productivity and help retain people long-term.

With farming's poor safety record, investing in staff will also make them safer and increasingly important is education on working in a more environmentally friendly manner within land-based industries.

An example of that would be training on how to cut a hedge properly, creating a biodiverse habitat rather than something hit back hard and providing little value to wildlife.

That can really improve your sustainability credentials as a farming business.

What about apprenticeships?

Lantra already helps with course assessments of land-based apprenticeships and is currently undertaking some research as to what the barriers are for small businesses taking on apprentices.

We believe we know why apprenticeships are an underutilised tool for recruiting and retaining staff in farming, which is a lack of information and advice on how to navigate the process successfully.

Lantra is conducting some research to confirm this assumption and aim to provide a toolkit on the website and in printed format, providing basic information about how they work, how to recruit the right apprentice, look after them and get the best out of them.

Go to www.lantra.co.uk to find out more.

Careers services from Lantra - key points

New website can help promote exciting farm careers

Wiltshire farmer and contractor Rob Boole thinks the new digital careers resource from Lantra could help break down some of the stigmas surrounding agricultural jobs - especially regarding pay - and entice new entrants into the industry.

Rob Boole © Lantra

The family business, which he runs alongside his mother and father, contract farms more than 200ha and covers more than 20,000ha with its four Bateman sprayers annually.

Mr Boole attended a school in an urban area where agriculture was seen as the last choice for school leavers, or a closed shop for those already associated with farming through family.

However, the reality is that working for a modern farming business like his own is highly technical, with his staff operating the latest modern machinery with GPS guidance.

The uptake of such technology, as well as data tools, automation and robotics, is only going to increase and should help inspire more young people - or those changing careers - to choose farming.

""The thought of planting seed in September, then 12 months later loading a lorry full of grain that you've produced to be taken for processing as a result of all your hard work can be extremely rewarding.""

Mr Boole thinks Lantra's new website will be an important resource for new entrants to access information about the positive opportunities within farming.

He would also like to see things like machinery simulators used to get youngsters inspired to become skilled operators, which are in short supply.

""Farming has its challenges, but food production is only going to become more important as the global population increases.

""There are many reasons to be positive about the industry and there are plenty of exciting and interesting career paths out there for people to follow,"" adds Mr Boole.

Farmers Weekly will be at the New Scientist Live event in London next month to bust common myths about farming and bring agriculture to life for everyone interested in science and technology.

Alongside our partners, we will host the ""Future of Food & Agriculture: Feeding the World Sustainably"" exhibit, which aims to highlight every facet of our pioneering industry to the next generation.

See also: How close is hydrogen to being a viable farm machinery fuel?

About New Scientist Live

The world's biggest festival of science and technology runs from 7-9 October at ExCeL, London.

New Scientist Live attracts thousands of people every year including career-minded science, technology, engineering and maths students. 

Over the three days, visitors can get hands-on with exhibits on the show floor and be inspired by talks from more than 50 speakers across four stages.

Find out more at live.newscientist.com.

We'll showcase agriculture's environmental credentials and dispel the misconception that working in the industry is slow-paced, low-tech and low-skilled, and encourage new entrants to think seriously about a future in food and farming.

""Our industry is developing at a phenomenal pace using some of the most advanced technologies and sciences available.

No matter your background or particular area of interest, it offers stimulating and meaningful career paths,"" says John Deere tactical marketing manager Chris Wiltshire.

Sustainable credentials

Show-goers can see first-hand how science, electronics and computers are integral to modern agriculture - and that these technologies can help underpin sustainable food production. 

For KWS, New Scientist Live provides a platform teach about the link between science and plant breeding.

""It allows us to engage with all age groups who are enthusiastic to learn more about plant breeding and genetics,"" says breeding station manager Gill Covey.

Visitors can get insights into plant breeding and genetics © Telling Photography

Mindful of the challenge that the next generation faces when it comes to ensuring food security in the face of climate change and unpredictable seasonality, Innovation Agritech Group will be bringing a GrowFrame 360 model.

The system grows crops without the need for soil or sunlight, and with much lower water requirements than conventional crops.

""Vertical farming offers a sustainable diversification and succession opportunity that allows for continuous innovation and training,"" says business development director Kate Brunswick.

Water-saving technology will be on display from Isah, which will be demonstrating a cross-section of a cropped field with attenuation storage and irrigation. Sensors control the water, explains Isah's Kevin O'Grady.

""You can move the sensor to start the water pump and watch as the cloud monitoring records the moisture levels,"" he says.

The system collects and recycles rainwater, and reuses nutrients and fertiliser from the topsoil to enhance crop production. Water is conserved for crop irrigation in dry periods, and stored to mitigate flooding when rainfall is high.

Educational pathways

Representatives from We Are Land-based Engineering will be on hand to discuss the different educational pathways and careers available.

As digital media and marketing specialist Gareth Ford puts it: ""If you don't know about it, how can you choose to study it or go into it as a career?""

The lack of land-based engineers coming into the industry has a knock-on effect for farm businesses.

""We wish to change that by educating youngsters on exactly what land-based engineering is, and how they can become part of this brilliant industry,"" he adds.

Agco after-sales training manager Richard Charles agrees:

""If we do nothing, then we get nothing. But if we do something, then results will start to show and more people will remember that there are exciting machines, processes and opportunities in our industry which can provide a long-term career.""

Students interested in accessing higher education courses will be able to speak to staff from the University of Essex, RAU and lead education partner Harper Adams University, which will all be bringing their message to the heart of the capital.

Visitors can also immerse themselves in a future of farming VR experience that is being developed at Harper Adams. It shows how robotic technology will be used to produce food in the future to help feed 9.8 billion people by 2050.

The university's chief global impact officer Ian Rowley explains:

""Innovation enables us to develop practical teaching with real-world applications, from 3D technology at the Harper and Keele Veterinary School through to developing food waste into chicken feed at our School of Sustainable Food and Farming.""

An agricultural education and demo centre in the Cotswolds is promoting British farming, welcoming new entrants and hosting an array of topical events and courses for farmers.

Each year, 25,000 visitors are welcomed to the FarmED food and farming educational centre at Honeydale Farm in Oxfordshire which aims to inspire, educate and connect people to sustainable agricultural systems.

Whether you are a farmer, policymaker, researcher, food lover, student or just generally interested in discovering more about agriculture, the FarmED centre offers something for everyone.

Officially opened by King Charles in June 2021, the founders and directors of the centre, Ian and Celene Wilkinson, aim to:

The organisation is a not-for-profit community interest company that relies on generous help, donations and support from local people and organisations.

""Our motto ""˜Let's talk about farming' means just that. We host people with different ideas, providing them with a place for open, honest debate,"" says Ian.

What's on show at Honeydale?

Honeydale Farm boasts 45ha in the beautiful Cotswold countryside.

Visitors can freely roam the heritage orchard, micro dairy, kitchen garden, eight-year rotation trial plots and natural flood management, and take a self-guided tour to find out what's happening on the farm.

Or if you are after an in-depth analysis of regenerative agriculture and the trials carried out on the farm, a farm walk, led by Ian or a member of the team each Friday, provides just that for a fee.

Micro-dairy

FarmED aims to address the lack of opportunities for first-generation farmers by providing them with facilities and encouragement to get a foot on the farming ladder.

The farming centre has offered one young farmer the opportunity to start up a micro-business to gain experience that can be scaled up to bigger projects.

First-generation farmer Hallam Duckworth did not come from a farming background, but after studying agriculture at university he became passionate about animal husbandry and keen to supply quality, fresh produce to his local community.

© FarmED

He got in touch with the farm about the possibility of starting up a micro-dairy and, in spring 2021, the farm welcomed the arrival of three Fleckvieh cows and calves.

Hallam now milks the cows once a day, and leaves the calves to suckle freely on their mothers.

He sells milk via a subscription scheme at £2/litre and supplies the cafÃ© and shop, as well as making his own ice cream.

Rotation trial plots

The farm is demonstrating an eight-year rotation trial. Visitors can inspect the continuous cereals plot, heritage wheats, clover understories, cattle grazing herbal leys, agroforestry strips and wild bird seed plots.

Agricultural team lead Kate Henderson explains: ""As a demonstration farm we test new ideas to inspire others to think about what they could do on their land and engage researchers and policymakers to understand the complexity of farming practices.

Kate Henderson © MAG/Emma Gillbard

“It's important to trial new farming methods so growers can visit, get the conversation going and see if it could work for them,"" she says.

Kate says the different effects on soil structure in the various plots are stark.

""We see more friable and water-retentive soils in the herbal ley compared with the continuous cereals, yet the continuous cereals offer the highest overall gross margin.""

For Essex mixed farmer George Young a visit to Honeydale inspired the integration of herbal leys and cattle into his arable rotation.

In the past four years, George has sown 100ha of herbal leys, which are grazed by cattle, and he says this forms the bedrock for his regenerative farming journey.

Heritage wheat varieties grown for their greater disease tolerance and reduced nitrogen requirements are also on show. Grown alongside an understory of clover, no pesticides or fertiliser are used.

A focus on farm-to-fork circular economies is important to the demo centre, which is why flour is milled locally and destined for sale in the shop and cafÃ©.

Despite heritage wheats yielding 50% less than modern cultivars, a premium market offers 10 times more.

Kitchen garden

A community-supported agriculture scheme in the form of a 2ha kitchen garden also supplies nutritious fruit and vegetables to local people.

Not only does this help cut food miles and waste, but it actively encourages local people to get outside and learn about food production.

Local volunteers can join the initiative on Thursdays and Fridays to make the most of the community space and get involved with the project.

For new farming entrant Abi Gwynn, who is carrying out a one-year internship at the education centre, the kitchen garden provides a community hub that she's keen to get involved with.

""It's great to be working in the kitchen garden as it brings people back to the land. In today's society, so many people no longer know their neighbours and an initiative like this brings people back together,"" she says.

The kitchen garden is run by a group of five part-time employees who sell 180 seasonal veg boxes each week, all year round.

A subscription of £9/box is paid and whatever is harvested that week is divided equally. 

A mission to promote fruit orchards and bee hives

Orchards were once a common sight on many UK farms, but in recent decades 90% of traditional orchards in England and Wales have been lost to land use conversion.

Today, just 23% of fruit and vegetables eaten in the UK is grown domestically, but FarmED is on a mission to increase this.

© MAG/Emma Gillbard

The farm's apple orchard is home to 144 trees. This include heritage Oxfordshire varieties such as Old Fred, Red Army and Blenheim Orange, which date back to the 1740s.

Other fruit trees include cherry, apricot, damson, mulberry, nectarine and peach.

A number of beehives are also dotted around the farm, benefiting from the diversity of the farm environment. This contributes to the farm's output through pollination, while providing good-quality honey that is sold in the shop.

59,"Gene-edited crops moves closer after bill gains royal assent","https://www.fwi.co.uk/arable/gene-edited-crops-moves-closer-after-bill-gains-royal-assent","Gene-edited crops moves closer after bill gains royal assent

A parliamentary bill for gene-edited food crops to be developed, grown and sold in England has passed into law.

The Genetic Technology (Precision Breeding) Act received royal assent on Thursday 23 March, following 10 months of debate across both houses of parliament.

See also: First gene-edited wheat field trial successful, say scientists

The bill updates regulation of precision-bred organisms in England and seeks to enable breeders to use gene-editing technologies, such as Crispr-9/CAS9, to develop more resilient, healthier, and higher-yielding crops.

But devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not approved the commercial use of gene editing.

Under the provisions of the act, a new science-based and streamlined regulatory system will be introduced to facilitate greater research and innovation in precision breeding - with stricter regulations remaining in place for genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

The UK government will take a ""precautionary, step-by-step approach"" to rolling out the new legislation, bringing in precision breeding for plants first, followed by farm animals later.

However, a further vote by MPs will be required before this can be implemented.

Defra chief scientist Gideon Henderson said: ""The ability to use gene editing to make precise, targeted changes to the genetic code of organisms, in a way that can mimic traditional breeding, enables development of new crop varieties that are more resistant to pests, healthier to eat, and more resilient to drought and heat as climate changes.""

Royal assent of the bill represents a significant milestone, but it is not the end of the legislative process.

FSA role

Secondary implementing provisions could take another two years to pass through parliament, meaning the new rules may not come into force before the next general election. 

Before any changes to market, the Food Standards Agency will need to consult on a separate approval process for food and feed marketing and produce a new proportionate risk assessment for precision-bred food and feed.

Defra says it could take at least five years before gene-edited crops could be available for farmers to grow commercially in England.

Work to develop gene-edited crops is under way in the UK.

Rothamsted Research is carrying out field trials of gene-edited wheat with reduced levels of a cancer-causing compound commonly found in toasted bread.

Crop research institute Niab has been using gene editing experimentally in a variety of crops, including wheat, barley, rice and strawberries, for several years.

But Pat Thomas, campaign director of Beyond GM, said the only people who stand to benefit from GE technology are biotech companies.

A parliamentary bill for gene-edited food crops to be developed, grown and sold in England has passed into law.

The Genetic Technology (Precision Breeding) Act received royal assent on Thursday 23 March, following 10 months of debate across both houses of parliament.

See also: First gene-edited wheat field trial successful, say scientists

The bill updates regulation of precision-bred organisms in England and seeks to enable breeders to use gene-editing technologies, such as Crispr-9/CAS9, to develop more resilient, healthier, and higher-yielding crops.

But devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not approved the commercial use of gene editing.

Under the provisions of the act, a new science-based and streamlined regulatory system will be introduced to facilitate greater research and innovation in precision breeding - with stricter regulations remaining in place for genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

The UK government will take a ""precautionary, step-by-step approach"" to rolling out the new legislation, bringing in precision breeding for plants first, followed by farm animals later.

However, a further vote by MPs will be required before this can be implemented.

Defra chief scientist Gideon Henderson said: ""The ability to use gene editing to make precise, targeted changes to the genetic code of organisms, in a way that can mimic traditional breeding, enables development of new crop varieties that are more resistant to pests, healthier to eat, and more resilient to drought and heat as climate changes.""

Royal assent of the bill represents a significant milestone, but it is not the end of the legislative process.

Five years of trial work in Northamptonshire have shown that cover crops in a direct drilling system removed 27t/ha of carbon dioxide equivalents, highlighting their role in reducing a farm's carbon footprint. 

However, the trials also showed that 17t/ha of carbon dioxide equivalents can be lost from soil with deep tillage.

See also: Grower's soils improve and inputs reduce with regen approach

Independent researcher David Purdy has spent the past five years at Agrovista's AgX trial site investigating the effect of cultivations and cover cropping on soil biology and structure.

And he believes the key to good soil health is to maximise the amount of energy farmers get into them. ""It's all about getting energy into soils and photosynthesis is where it starts.""

Biomass drives worm numbers

He points to the relationship between cover crop biomass and worm numbers on the site's silty, clay loam. ""As cover crop biomass increases, you see a rise in worm numbers.""

And as worm numbers increase, so do infiltration rates. He says this is because there are more worm channels in the soil along with more roots.

One factor driving cover crop biomass is drilling date, and one trial looked at three different timings - mid-August, end of August and mid-September.

Results showed earlier drilling increased biomass for all three species trialled - black oats, phacelia and clover.

After five years of no-till and cover crops, David is now seeing more organic matter in soil, but there is scope to go further.

""Soil organic matter content is 8.65% near the hedge, and plots range from 3.7% to more than 5%, so we know they are capable of holding more [organic matter].""

Carbon stocks

One area that is seeing more interest is carbon trading and the ability to earn credits with a regen approach, so David looked at the impact of cultivations and cover crops on soil carbon stocks.

Measuring is tricky, involving the taking of soil cores and measuring soil carbon and bulk density at four different depths - 0-15cm, 15-30cm, 30-60cm and 60-90cm. The first finding was that carbon decreases with increasing depth.

Looking at 0-15cm, cultivating with a Kverneland DTX - a standard piece of kit in that area - led to a reduction from 52t/ha to 47t/ha of carbon stocks.

Effectively, deep tillage burnt 3t/ha of carbon, which equates to 17t/ha of carbon dioxide equivalents.

For cover crops, he saw an increase at 15-30cm with carbon stocks increasing from 36t/ha to 44t/ha (27t/ha carbon dioxide equivalents). This is the depth where the bulk of the roots are, which explains why no significant differences were seen at other depths.

David concludes that cover crops do sequester carbon, while deep tillage is harmful.

He adds that levels in the field are about half that of the grass margins, so there is plenty of opportunity to bury more carbon in soil.

66,"Farm profit forecasts point to focus on fixed costs","https://www.fwi.co.uk/business/business-management/farm-profit-forecasts-point-to-focus-on-fixed-costs","Farm profit forecasts point to focus on fixed costs

Fixed costs offer the greatest scope to improve financial performance on combinable crop farms.

While yield plays an important part, control of overheads sets the higher performers apart.

Forecasts using standard and higher performing data for in-hand farms show that the 2023 harvest will produce a big drop in profits, with a slight recovery for the 2024 crop.

However, that recovery still produces ""worryingly low"" returns, says Andrew Atkinson, farm consultant with Strutt & Parker.

The net margins of higher performing businesses in 2024 are expected to be more than 75% greater, at £422/ha, than those of average performing farms, at £237/ha.

See also: Steep price rises put focus on machinery costs

""While a higher wheat yield from these farms improves financial output, it is the lower level of fixed costs that makes the greatest difference (£597/ha versus £475/ha), which is due to quality of farm management,"" Andrew says.

A tool developed by Strutt & Parker's farming and research team helps assess the sensitivity of arable net margins to changes in some of the main variables, such as fertiliser and diesel costs and crop sales values.

Using the 2021 harvest year as its baseline, this compares income, expenditure and profits, initially using a universal set of assumptions for average and higher-performing in-hand arable businesses.

The fixed-cost figures are broadly based on Farm Business Survey (FBS) data. 

Yields for the higher-performing business are 9t/ha of wheat, 7.6t/ha of winter barley, 6.2t/ha of spring barley and 3.1t/ha of oilseed rape.

It also has lower fixed costs typical of the best arable businesses, at £397/ha.

The variable costs in the 2021 baseline data are the same for both the average and higher-performing farms, with the better performance coming from using inputs more effectively, as well as lower fixed costs.

2023 net margins

With both fixed and variable costs rising, Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) dropping and lower crop receipts (the model uses £200/t for 2023 wheat sales), the 2023 crop average net margin falls to £183/ha, which is 60% lower than the 2021 baseline.

The net margin for the high-performing business is £364/ha, a 41% drop compared with 2021.

However, these margins are before interest and any imputed rent charge, and the average working capital demand grows to £173,614 or £1,325/ha for the 131ha example farm (FBS average cereal farm size), a full 40% higher than in 2021.

The higher-performing business sees a 43% greater working capital requirement, at £158,598 or £1,211/ha.

2024 estimates

Strutt & Parker is currently budgeting for a cut of almost 25% in seed, spray and fertiliser costs for 2024 crops, based on the recently announced new season UK ammonium nitrate price and an expectation that spray costs will stabilise.  

However, the budgets also allow for crop sales prices to reduce further, to about £190/t for wheat, reducing total crop receipts (all crops) by 6%.

This results in 2024 ""standard"" net margins rising to £237/ha for an average in-hand farm, and to £422/ha for the higher-performing business.

""Due to the reduction in input costs, working capital requirements are lower than in 2022 and 2023 but are still 24% higher than they were in 2021,"" Andrew says.

The estimates should give cause for thought and a more frequent revisiting of budgets than most managers might usually do, he says.

Key budgeting points

Options

""It's a luxury to have the time to think strategically, but it's best to give yourself that time if you can, so that you can consider a range of options based on ""˜what if' scenarios, rather than being forced into what seems like the only option at a certain time.""

Examples of limited options might include a key person leaving, becoming ill or retiring and the employer finding it difficult to replace them.

""If you game-plan possible situations, you can consider options such as whether you need to replace a machine, use contractors, or approach a neighbour to share machinery and/or labour."" 

The S&P tool offers the option to change variables including rotation, areas grown, yields, input and output prices so that the results can be produced for individual businesses, whether for in-hand, let land or contract farming agreements.

With costs rising, BPS dropping and crop sales receipts falling, the 2023 ""average"" net margin falls to £183/ha, which is 60% lower than the 2021 baseline.

The net margin for the higher-performing business is £364/ha, a 41% drop from the 2021 baseline.

Working capital requirements continue to rise, to £1,325/ha, or 40% higher in 2023 than in 2021 for a standard farm with 131ha of arable crops.

It will fall for the 2024 crop to £1,175/ha, but will still be 24% higher than in 2021.

Net zero and livestock: Exploring the farmer options

Provided by



The four UK Agri-Tech Centres of Agricultural Innovation are the result of a unique collaboration involving UK Government, industry and academia to drive greater efficiency, resilience and wealth across the agri-food sector. Supported by Innovate UK, the Centres are harnessing leading UK research and expertise and providing new facilities to:

Farming is battling a raft of pressures right now, but sustainability challenges will continue, highlights Phil Bicknell from the Centre for Innovation Excellence in Livestock (CIEL), the UK agri-tech centre driving innovation for the livestock sector.

Net zero is a core area of work for CIEL and it's the golden thread that links several priority focus areas for the livestock supply chain: feed and nutrition, animal health, welfare and resource efficiency.

Sustainability, and specifically net zero, continues to be a focus of research and innovation across the CIEL network.

In 2022, the vast majority of the 26 sites where CIEL has invested in agri-research capability carried out projects related to emissions and the sustainability of livestock systems.

And there's more in the pipeline - some public-funded, but a big proportion paid for and driven by businesses across the supply chain.



Phil Bicknell, Head of Business Development, CIEL © Agri Tech Centres

It's vital that this research pipeline continues.

CIEL's first industry report ""˜Net Zero Carbon & UK Livestock', published in 2020, highlighted that even if we see broad uptake of the technologies available to us right now, we don't even get halfway to the 2050 net zero ambition.

More broadly, that work established benchmarks for a range of farming systems across the main livestock types in the UK.

With the expectation for the agri-food sector to take positive action around emissions, farmers already have a wide range of options that can help reduce emissions at farm level.

This was explored in CIEL's subsequent report, ""˜Net Zero & Livestock: How farmers can reduce emissions.'

It identified that greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced from the main livestock types by 23% and ammonia emissions by 15% if wide-scale, and highly effective, mitigations are adopted across UK farms.

The first of its kind to model and collate data at this scale, the report covers a range of mitigating scenarios in real-life case studies across dairy, beef, sheep, pig and poultry farms.

It focuses on positive, practical solutions for the industry over headline categories.

The need for improvement in herd or flock production efficiency is one key area highlighted that should be the focus for most farmers in the drive to reduce their carbon footprint.

With input costs being top of mind for many, the potential efficiencies around feed, forage and nutrient management are particularly pertinent.

There's obviously a range of businesses with different systems, operating in different geographies, and with different challenges.

A single template isn't going to work for individual farm businesses, but we all have options available.

Next up for CIEL is exploring the new innovations and technologies that can help further progress on the net zero challenge. These will be the focus of a new industry report from CIEL ready in Spring 2023.

Alongside new technologies, we need wide-scale adoption to build on the reductions the livestock sector has already recorded.

The reports commissioned by CIEL aim to provide producers, supply chain partners and policymakers with the information needed to support evidence-based decision making when it comes to farming in a net zero world.

This independent evidence basis is important. Agriculture, particularly livestock production, is not short of rhetoric and opinion when it comes to environmental impact.

But decisions - whether they're policy, commercial or practical - must be based on evidence.

74,"Will cultured meat kill off the livestock industry?","https://www.fwi.co.uk/business/markets-and-trends/meat-prices/will-cultured-meat-kill-off-the-livestock-industry","Will cultured meat kill off the livestock industry?

Billions of pounds have been ploughed into the development of cultured meat over recent years, with governments, venture capitalists and even climate-conscious celebrities scrambling to cash in.

This rush has seen investment in the UK cultivated meat sector soar by 400% in 2022, and some are already projecting that the global industry could be worth $25bn by 2030, as companies look to new technology to reduce their carbon footprints.

But for many people, meat grown in a laboratory still feels like a sci-fi dream. So what exactly is it?

See also: Lab-grown meat more costly for environment, study finds

Illtud Dunsford, a Welsh livestock farmer and the chief executive of Cellular Agriculture, the first UK start-up in the cultured protein sector, said: ""In its most basic form, you take a cell from an animal such as a cow, and instead of feeding that cow forage, you are feeding the cell. That is the difference in terms of the process.

""The cell has originated from an animal and, as you feed it the same nutrients livestock would need, the cell multiplies. That output is still chemically and nutritionally equivalent to meat.

""It is meat - it is just not produced in the same way we traditionally produce meat.""

Adventurous customers

In the UK, industry leaders are looking to enter the market in the next two to three years - but in that timescale, availability of the product is likely to be restricted to high-end restaurants catering to adventurous customers.

That is already the case in Singapore, where small meals containing cultured chicken nuggets and breast are available for the equivalent of around £12-£15.  

In England, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) will need to approve a ""novel food application"" before cultured meat can be sold, with the timescale for approval running at around 18 months. No company has yet submitted such an application to the FSA.

Cultured meat products are not expected to become more commonplace for at least 10-15 years, but there is a determination upon the part of investors to make that a reality.

Way out of livestock farming?

Some of those investors have also made it clear that they see cultured meat as humanity's way out of livestock farming.

But Mr Dunsford doesn't believe it is realistic or desirable for cultured meat to replace animal agriculture, because many of its by-products, such as collagen, are still needed by other industries such as pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.

He also points out that cultured meat requires a population of cells from an animal. ""You need livestock from that perspective,"" he said.

""There are varying options of what that would look like longer term.

""There could potentially be donor herds, not altogether different from the idea of regenerative practice, where you have a lesser number of animals on a piece of land so it can aid in terms of environmental land management.""

Feed cells

All the inputs needed to feed livestock would still be needed to feed cells too, though probably on a lesser scale.

Marianne Ellis, professor of bioprocess and tissue engineering at the University of Bath, explained how this process works.

""You need to feed in what we call a cultured media, which is essentially a nutrient broth which contains sugars, salts and other minerals, vitamins and proteins which the cells grow on,"" she said.

""That all happens in what we call a bioprocess, which contains tanks we grow the cells in and controls the temperature, the rate of food supply and the rate of waste removal.

""It takes place in three stages. We take the stem cells, we grow them up in one type of medium so we get as many cells as we can, we then change this slightly to make them into mature muscle cells and the final stage is the maturation, where we have protein laid down.

""The process will take three to four weeks and the amount you get will depend on the population of cells and how big the factory is.""

Farmer scepticism

But many farmers remain sceptical. Evan Roberts, a dairy farmer from North Wales, said: ""There's a bit of concern about how much it will replace the meat we are used to now and how it'll affect us as farmers and the community.

""In Wales we have got a big farming community and also the Welsh language which relies on that community, so we need to make sure it remains strong.""

What is the likely effect on farming?

Tom MacMillan © Telling Photography

Tom MacMillan, professor of rural policy and strategy at the Royal Agricultural University, Cirencester, is leading a project looking at the effect cultured meat could have on British farming.

As part of the research, his team is looking at whether the product can sit alongside animal agriculture, and in particular, turn some of the waste from abattoirs into the raw materials needed to produce cultured meat.  

""It's early days, but an interesting idea, because obviously a lot of the companies in cultured meat are trying to come up with a production system which does not include animals at all,"" he said.  

""Thinking about a version of it that does involve animals and makes the most of some of the waste products from current livestock meat processing, from their point of view, will evoke mixed feelings.

""But it's an interesting possibility that we'll certainly be looking into. Whether it shows up as a significant opportunity remains to be seen.""

Focus groups

Prof MacMillan's UK government-funded project, which has been developed with farming organisations, cultured meat businesses, food companies and charities, was put together because no consideration was being given to how farmers would fare in a world where cultured meat was commonplace.

So far, the team has spoken to farmers in six focus groups from a range of sectors, and in the next stage of the research, the potential impact on eight different farms will be modelled.

Besides the concern about dairy cull cows, some more general fears were expressed in the focus groups, including that cultured meat would further accelerate the public's disconnection with food production.

A worry about the ""Americanisation"" of the food system, with power consolidated in the hands of a few companies, was also fairly widespread.

Prof MacMillan said: ""This is a real risk. As things are, given a lot of this is about private investment coming in from outside the sector and developing proprietary technologies which have high ambitions to take the market share for meat, you'd imagine it would lead to that further consolidation of power.

""But one of the questions for policymakers is: ""˜Are there versions of this?' If there was more public investment in it, that would be better for farming and might lead to more decentralised production.""

Carcass balance

For Prof MacMillan, though, the biggest problem posed by cultured meat is the effect it could have on carcass balance in the short-term.  

The first available cultured meat is likely to displace processed products such as sausages, patÃ©s, or mince, because the texture is easier to replicate. But this is likely to reduce the market for the fifth quarter.

""There is a potential threat in how it could affect the value available to livestock producers,"" said Prof MacMillan.

In dairying specifically, Prof MacMillan's research found there was real worry about how the value of cull cows could be affected by cultured meat.

 

What are the opportunities for farmers?

Despite farmers' concern, a key piece of research being led by Tom MacMillan at the Royal Agriculture University has identified a number of potential opportunities for agriculture from cultured meat - on top of the chance to sell raw materials such as feedstocks and cell lines.

Pasture-fed livestock farmers, in particular, feel that their unique selling point would be strengthened by an ""industrial"" alternative entering the market.

There is also a hope that some cultured meat production could take place on-farm - as has already happened in the Netherlands.

And perhaps most intriguingly, several of Prof MacMillan's focus groups said the livestock industry was in need of a ""game changer"" - both for environmental reasons and because of unsustainable low farmgate returns.

But is cultured meat the gamechanger farming needs? Only time will tell.

Change is in the air in the agri-research space, with plans afoot to merge three of the four Agri-Tech Centres to form a single Agri-Tech ""Catapult"".

The aim is ""to create an innovation ecosystem that will strengthen connections, and accelerate robust, commercially viable and sustainable solutions"".

Sounds like so much gobbledygook? Maybe. But the message is clear - the Agri-Tech Centres are in for a shake-up. So, what's going on?

The Agri-Tech Centres were established in 2013, with the aim of helping to commercialise new technologies and close the gap on overseas competitors in terms of productivity, where the UK has been lagging for many years.

See also: Can Agri-Tech deliver new ""˜golden age' for farmers?

The four centres created were:

It is the first three of these that are set to merge - the fourth, Agrimetrics, will remain a separate entity.

Nine Catapults

As for Catapults, there are nine of them, established by government agency Innovate UK, operating from more than 50 sites in the UK to help accelerate and scale up new technologies.

Their work areas range from gene therapy and medicines to satellites and renewable energy - providing expertise and facilities for businesses to test, demonstrate and improve their ideas.

Announcing the planned creation of a new Agri-Tech Catapult in late September, science and innovation minister George Freeman pointed to the need to commercialise the UK's academic research base and so bridge the gap with industry.

""With the global population set to hit nine billion within the next 25 years, we need to double global food production using the same land with half as much energy and water,"" he said.

""That is the challenge driving global demand for agri-tech - the technologies that allow us to produce more with less.""

Peter Quinn, who chairs the board overseeing the creation of the new Agri-Tech Catapult, said a new single organisation would ""build on the three Agri-Tech Centres' strong foundations to accelerate innovation, and strengthen the UK's world-class agri-tech ecosystem"".

Foundations

But just how strong are these foundations?

Tina Barsby, former chief executive of the National Institute of Agricultural Botany, has her doubts, saying there are significant lessons to be learned from the past 10 years.

""The legacy of the centres of innovation is not one of unmitigated success,"" she said in a recent article for Science for Sustainable Agriculture.

""Suggestions that the Agri-Tech Centres have played a ""˜vital role in translating agricultural innovation into commercial success' or that they have ""˜bolstered food security, reduced our carbon footprint, and enhanced productivity' are simply not backed up by the evidence.""

Growth in UK agricultural productivity had continued to fall behind other countries, she said, while progress in reducing UK farming's carbon footprint had remained ""stubbornly slow"".

""I would struggle to name specific projects where the three centres have translated agricultural innovation into commercial success over the past decade,"" she added.

As a member of the original Agri-Tech Strategy leadership council, Dr Barsby also criticised the """"˜capital only"" funding model.

""Restricting their ability to invest in anything other than equipment, capital and basic running costs meant the centres were entirely dependent on attracting investment in research projects from commercial partners,"" she said.

This has hindered their ability to establish new agri-tech capabilities, or plug gaps in the existing R&D landscape, she argued.

Taking issue

Not surprisingly, the three Agri-Tech Centres take issue with these allegations, particularly in relation to carbon emissions.

""It's very much a live area,"" said Phil Bicknell, director of Ciel. ""Across all the Agri-Tech Centres, carbon-related research projects are in progress or in the pipeline.""

One specific example is a project Ciel is involved in, investigating whether cattle methane emissions can be reduced by using a chemical extracted from daffodils.

The Chap Net Zero report also sets out mitigation practices to reduce the global warming impact of UK arable and horticulture crops.

Mr Bicknell also denies that the funding model has hindered the work of the Agri-Tech Centres or made them too dependent on commercial partners.

""Our focus is on creating and facilitating the link between science and industry,"" he said.

""That means working with commercial partners, ensuring that research and innovation address real-world problems and provide practical and viable solutions.""

Genetic improvement

But it's not just about funding. Dr Barsby is also critical of the Agri-Tech Centres' perceived lack of focus on genetic innovation - a technology that she says can really help with on-farm productivity and efficiency.

""The single most important factor driving on-farm productivity gains is genetic innovation, yet this was not a core focus for any of the centres,"" she said.

""Consequently, the John Innes Centre, our flagship genetic institution, has hardly interacted with the centres at all.""

Dr Barsby points to two separate reviews of plant science which both highlighted the need for a more joined-up R&D pipeline for genetic innovation ""to transfer promising early-stage discoveries from lab to field"".

This lack of ""translational"" research is a particular barrier to progressing the one area which could really drive productivity gains for British farming, says Dr Barsby.

""As priorities for the new Agri-Tech Catapult are developed, it seems unthinkable that the importance of translational research in the context of crop genetic innovation could be overlooked yet again."" 

Criticism denied

But the criticism is denied, with the Agri-Tech Centres adamant that innovation through genetic technologies is a key strand of activity across all the centres. 

They point to a recent pilot study using genetic selection to identify superior, worm-tolerant sheep and breed them into the wider flock.

""Breed for CH4nge"" is another industry-wide programme to measure and collect methane emissions data, and breed sheep with a naturally low carbon footprint.

Fraser Black, the chief executive of Chap, said:

""While work on genetic improvement - both conventional and advanced - is a key strand of the work of the centres for both crop and livestock systems, we work in many other aspects of agri-tech such as precision engineering, controlled environment production, and biopesticide development.

""We believe Dr Barsby's main emphasis is on crop improvement for arable systems which, although important, is only part of the overall focus of the centres.

""Furthermore, productivity is only one measure of success. The Agri-Tech Centres look to provide a range of complementary tools for an integrated effective farming system. Productivity improvement is only one of those tools.""

As ever, it seems, there are two sides to every story - and two scientific opinions for every argument.

What others have said about the Agri-Tech Centres

Daniel Pearsall, co-ordinator of Science for Sustainable Agriculture:

""The Agri-Tech Centres were set up to bridge the chronic neglect of translational research - with the aim of taking the findings of our brilliant UK scientists through to practical technology and on-farm application.

""But the model did not work, due partly to the capital funding limitations and the reluctance to get involved with genetics.

""They have been more conveyors of resource rather than actors. Innovate UK says it has been transformational. The evidence on the ground suggests that it has not.""

Dr Kate Pressland, manager of the Centre for Effective Innovation in Agriculture:

""It has been tricky for the Agri-Tech Centres in the past as they were set up with public money, but with a mandate to bring in commercial income.

""This has made it difficult to deliver impact-driven research aimed at farmers on the ground, and to achieve a measurable return on investment.

""However, they have been very active in applying for funding under Defra's latest Farming Innovation Programme, putting in lots of bids for producer- and industry-centric projects - but are competing with each other within the same fund. Coming together under one roof makes sense.""

What you need to know about the new Agri-Tech Catapult

What is a Catapult?

Established by the UK's innovation agency, Innovate UK, the Catapults are a network of technology and innovation hubs.

They are independent, not-for-profit organisations, providing facilities and expertise to other businesses, research bodies and government, to accelerate technical advance.

What are the benefits of creating a new Agri-Tech Catapult?

The aim is to create a new structure that allows for greater cross-sector working in areas such as climate change mitigation, disease control and sustainability.

Sharing knowledge with experts in other areas is seen as a particular benefit.

Will the new Agri-Tech Catapult be any more successful in raising productivity and efficiency?

While the three Agri-Tech Centres are adamant they have done a good job, they see the creation of the Agri-Tech Catapult as putting food and farming on a par with other high-profile sectors, and so more likely to attract government research and investment.

""It positions food and farming as a strategic sector for the UK economy,"" said a spokesman.

What will happen to Chap, Ciel and Agri-EPI?

The centres will continue operating until the new merged business is implemented in April 2024.

All current workstreams and projects will be maintained until then, and some may be transferred to the new Catapult.

Will there still be an equal focus on all crops, livestock and engineering?

The new merged business will maintain a focus on all three areas, as well as exploring new sectors within the wider area of food, feed, fuel and fibres.

Additional private finance, on top of any money provided by the Environmental Land Management scheme in England, will be needed if farmers are to deliver a resilient food system and meet the government's environmental goals, 

This is according to a new Defra-commissioned study, led by the Green Finance Institute, in partnership with 13 other groups including banks, the NFU, Tenant Farmers Association and supermarkets.

See also: Environmental Land Management - your questions answered

The report sets out four key ways in which more private finance can be unlocked. These are:  

The aim is that more private finance will ""facilitate food production and environmental improvement, while diversifying farmers' incomes"".

""Putting these market enablers in place will provide a solid foundation to deliver on this ambition, and meet the UK’s climate and environmental ambitions, which include stimulating at least £500m of private investment per year by 2027 to support nature recovery."" said a statement.

Challenge

NFU president Minette Batters indicated that farmers were up for the challenge.

""As custodians of the land, boosting carbon sequestration, biodiversity and water quality are just as much a priority for farmers and growers as producing quality, nutritious food for the nation,"" she said.

""Greater access to private sector finance will enable British farm businesses to continue to invest in this important work and, crucially, build business resilience.""

This is particularly important given that the current government budget of £2.4bn for English agriculture is only ring-fenced until the end of this parliament - which is expected in 2024.

Thereafter, the sector will be competing with many other departments for Treasury funding and there are fears it could lose out.

At a recent National Sheep Association webinar, Janet Hughes, head of future farming at Defra, predicted that there would be increased private investment in the sector.

She said her department was keeping a close eye on it, to ensure that developing government schemes were complementary to that.

""We want you to be able to earn money from carbon credits, biodiversity net gain and water companies,"" she said.

Biodiversity continues to decline across the UK.

Agriculture and climate change are the main drivers according to the report recently released by the State of Nature, compiled by more than 50 wildlife and conservation organisations comprising the State of Nature partnership.

Inevitably, there's been reflexive irritation from some in the farming community at these findings (and there's little doubt that some of the organisations that comprise the State of Nature are often instinctively hostile towards agriculture).

Yet scant issue can be taken with the broad sweep of evidence - nature is in decline globally, including in these isles.

With agriculture taking up to 70% of our land area, it's inevitable we play a part in that.

See also: Opinion – we should hang our heads in shame at our safety record

About the author

However, the authors also acknowledge we are making progress towards ""nature-friendly farming"", though the scale of investment is paltry versus the scale of the challenge following decades of ""policy-driven management practices which have had major negative impacts on nature"".

This is what farmers have been saying for years, most recently concerning the vertiginous underfunding of Environmental Land Management.  

Some extremists criticise farmers as being solely to blame for the environmental ills of the world.

The reality is that most recognise the impact food production has on nature is directly correlated to the demands placed on farmers for ever cheaper, ever more plentiful food to feed an ever growing population.

You get the food system you pay for, and we are paying bottom dollar.

Yet, as the report acknowledges, solutions to biodiversity decline exist, with ""good evidence that well-designed agri-environment schemes [AES] can benefit nature"".

My experience of the GWCT's Allerton Project, a research and demonstration farm at the heart of AES development for three decades, supports this.

Areas of farmed land managed for nature can have a positive impact on biological diversity in the farmed landscape.

Providing invertebrate habitats, pollen and nectar sources, winter bird feed mixes and buffer strips benefits not only nature, but carbon accounting, field efficiency and even overall profit.

Allerton shows how to achieve modern, productive farming alongside a thriving natural environment. So why aren't we all doing it?

It isn't that farmers lack the will. The rapid proliferation of AES agreements in recent years and farmer-led cluster groups to enact environmental gains on a landscape scale are testament to that.

It's that we lack the financial means to carry society's ecological conscience on our shoulders, a point of bipartisan agreement across the spectrum from the State of Nature to the NFU.

Indeed, only recently the RSPB called for a budget of at least £4.4bn for nature-friendly farming in the UK (a number subsequently echoed by the Liberal Democrats).

So, is the State of Nature criticising farmers? No, no more than it's criticising the climate above our heads.

Its real targets are the politicians and corporates who continue to voice platitudes about our natural world, but do nothing to support those on the ground to act.

Take this report not as a critique, but as more power to our elbow in advocating for a sustainable financial settlement for food, farming and the environment.

Environmentally, the benefits are well recorded.

The Woodland Trust's Farming for the Future report found that over a 30-year period, silvoarable systems can sequester the equivalent of 8t of carbon dioxide/ha/year, which is equivalent to the average annual carbon footprint of a UK household.

The charity estimates that establishing  silvo-pastoral agroforestry on  30% of the UK's grassland would achieve net-zero targets for the grassland sector by 2050, with a net sequestration rate of 21m tonnes of carbon dioxide/year by 2062.

But despite high levels of interest and growing records of the benefits, the Woodland Trust says only 3.3% of the UK's agricultural area is under agroforestry.

Food production and sustainability

When it comes to food production and agroforestry, Jeremy Evans, outreach adviser for the Woodland Trust, says there is no single answer.

""It is not going to be the same across all landscapes, farms or systems,"" he said. ""Some of the benefits aren't entirely tangible or monetary.

""It is a hell of a leap of faith, but as we work with more and more farmers, it is all building up and will hopefully become mainstream. It hasn't been for everyone, but I think it's building that way.""

Speaking broadly of the economic benefits, Jeremy explains:

""At the minute, you can't cost the environmental benefits that agroforestry can bring in terms of soil, water, air and habitat quality.

""What you are gaining is future resilience and that sustainability effect on your farm.

""In a lot of agroforestry schemes there might be a reduction in food production, but this is slight, and the benefits are all of the other things trees can deliver.

""If it works really well, like in the case of Stephen [Briggs] (see case study below), then you're quid's in all the way.

""In a worst case, you should not be that much out of pocket, and you've got greater resilience in your farming system which increases sustainability.""

Government funding holds the key to wider uptake

The general consensus is that, nationally, a lack of government support is likely to be behind the slow uptake of agroforestry.

While the Woodland Trust offers a ""Trees for Farms"" grant, which in some cases sponsors up to 100% of the cost for an agroforestry system, competition is high and places limited.

But with the launch of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI), funding for agroforestry is expected to be announced next spring.

""We heard at the Agroforestry Show that the stewardship schemes are bringing out agroforestry funding,"" says Jeremy Evans from the Woodland Trust.

""We think this will sit under SFI and will definitely be about in-field agroforestry - so not the boundary systems, hedges and edges and shelter belts, but silvopasture or silvoarable systems,"" he explains.

""The Forestry Commission is very confident that this scheme is coming on board next year, and I hope it comes through on this promise.""

Case study: Farming with trees

Stephen Briggs © MAG/Emma Gillbard

Having established the UK's largest agroforestry system on his farm in Cambridgeshire, first-generation farmer Stephen Briggs has integrated fruit trees into his arable cropping system.

Asked how agroforestry supports an economically viable farming business, he says:

""We have to look at the bigger picture. The farming model that we have today, whether that be livestock-focused or crop production, is largely a specialised high-input, high-output model.

""This has obviously served a lot of people very well for many decades.

""Going forward, with the challenges of climate instability and extremes of temperature, we have to ask whether our farming models are fit for purpose.""

Planting 4,500 fruit trees more than a decade ago, Stephen says it was an investment in the farm's future.

""In terms of profitability and economic stability, we are entering a period of history where we need to adapt our farming models to something with more resilience to be able to remain profitable.

""Yes, being profitable today is important, but we need to put measures in place now to make sure we are profitable tomorrow.""

Taking 52ha of land, Stephen planted the 4,500 fruit trees across the landscape at a density of 80 trees/ha in lines spaced 27m apart, leaving a 24m alley to grow cereal crops in.

""That results in 8% of the land area occupied by a perennial fruit tree crop, and 92% doing exactly what it was before,"" he says.   

""The single biggest input to all of our farming systems is sunshine,"" Stephen explains. ""We all harvest the sunlight, so as an arable farmer I recognise that a seed starting each year is quite risky.

""You wouldn't have solar panels on the roof and turn them off from 1 July to 1 October. But that's exactly what we do with cropping.

Business resilience

""So, from an economic perspective, I have to make the environment in which my business operates as resilient as possible to the challenges that come over the hill.

""All we've done with our agroforestry model is to try to build in some climate resilience by having a mix of annuals and perennials.""

Having funded the system himself, Stephen says he saw an economic return on the investment within eight years.

""As a tenant, we needed an economic return within the term of our tenancy, so now, when the fruit trees yield, we can add value,"" he explains.

As well as the added income from the fruit trees, Stephen says the agroforestry system has also given a boost to his arable crops.

""We're now finding, 15 years in, that those perennial rooting structures are helping improve drainage in the winter, and in the summer we're getting less water loss and less crop stress.

""We are seeing more crop at the edges of the field, and actually getting a yield lift. That's because the subterranean beneficial soil fungi such as mycorrhizas are more present.""

Implementing regenerative agriculture principles across 14,000ha is a central component of Dyson Farming's long-term circular farming model, as it produces high-quality food with minimal environmental impact.

The plan has been to employ as many of the five regenerative principles as possible to improve soil health and build resilience, while recognising that some measures can't be introduced immediately.

See also: Essex farm uses borage and herbage seed to fight blackgrass

As a result, the approach taken looks different on all the farms, emphasising that it is not about being right or wrong, but making best use of resources and matching them to soil conditions.

""There's lots of opportunity,"" says research agronomist Tom Storr.

""But with such a range of soil types across Lincolnshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire, as well as very varied cropping, there are also considerable challenges.""

Five regenerative principles

SFI

As part of this commitment and despite growing potatoes and sugar beet on its farms in Lincolnshire, the entire Dyson Farming business entered the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) intermediate soils standard, worth £40/ha, when it was open.

""Having green cover on 70% of the land over winter was the aspirational bit,"" says Tom.

That standard is no longer available under SFI 2023, so he will have to take another look at what's on offer.

""We already grow cover and catch crops, make use of living understoreys and include companion crops, so we will expand these practices when and where it's appropriate.""

Already, there have been lessons learned, he adds. ""We've been tracking lots of data, so we have some idea about what's working and what isn't, with plenty more still to understand.

""Catch crops don't succeed everywhere, particularly on heavy soils, for example, as following wheat yields suffer, while seed rates and drilling dates have to be spot on with cover crops.""  

There is no set rotation in place at any of the Dyson Farming locations, he reveals, but some cropping choices are changing as the business considers what will be expected of it in the future.

Lincolnshire

In Lincolnshire, where the company has two main sites, Nocton and Carrington, there is a 45% bias towards winter wheat and oilseed rape, with forage maize being grown for an anaerobic digestion (AD) plant.

There are also root crops and other forages, as well as a 12ha agroforestry site.

Around two-thirds of this land receives some sort of disturbance, Tom points out.

""We're still moving a lot of soil, but it is coming down. There's no denying that potatoes make being regenerative more challenging, especially when it comes to soil disturbance.""

Trials are helping to pinpoint which operations can be dropped and how the potatoes can have less of an impact, but there is a balance to be achieved so that yields and quality don't suffer, he stresses.

Another solution has been to replace some of the forage maize with an oats/vetch mix, which also goes to the AD plant but is less demanding on the soil and has an inherent fertility benefit.

In Gloucestershire, winter barley and beans are included in the rotation and a mixed cultivations system is in place, while the Oxfordshire farms runs a 12m controlled traffic farming (CTF) system on its easy-working soils.

""The rotation and the cultivations system in place varies with soil type, as you would expect. Each of the regenerative principles makes a contribution, as we keep moving forward.""  

Potato production - plan of action

Soil cover

There has been more success with the aim of keeping the soil covered, he says.

""We are trying several things, from establishing a clover understorey in cereals to including companion crops and retaining chopped straw.

""Catch and cover crops have a place with this aim, as does the shift in our cropping.""

In the same vein, keeping living roots in the soil is being supported by growing cover and catch crops.

An Anglian Water trials site on the Lincolnshire farm, looking at 19 cover crop species and four different mixes, has been helpful in refining seed rates and understanding more about the best establishment conditions.

""We're getting there,"" acknowledges Tom. ""There are a number of factors to get right.""

Otherwise, livestock integration is ongoing. There are 5,000 sheep in Lincolnshire, grazing cover crops, leys and permanent pasture, but not many on the Carrington site, as the high-magnesium soils are prone to poaching.

Herbal leys are grazed very hard and then brought back into arable production by direct drilling.

Organic manures are used to reduce synthetic nitrogen applications, while soil organic matter levels are being monitored

Overall, livestock integration is running at 27% in Oxfordshire, 24% in Gloucestershire and 23% at Nocton, with Carrington at just 3.5%.

Environment

An integrated system that addresses biodiversity, habitat and the provision of public goods is behind Dyson Farming's approach to environmental protection.

As Ian Willoughby, the company's environmental co-ordinator, explains, management decisions are based on the results of detailed monitoring, so that the right measures are put in place.

A good example of this in practice is with yellow wagtails, which are ground-nesting and prefer an open landscape typical of some farmland, he explains.

""By keeping track of birds, pollinators and water quality, we know what our impact is,"" he says.

""Bird surveys are done at migration and in the spring, while monitors placed in our field margins give us pollinator activity information.""

There are 250ha of margins in Lincolnshire, he reveals, as well as 111 owl and kestrel boxes.

There are also three Mid-Tier Countryside Stewardship schemes and two Higher-Level Stewardship schemes operating, as well as the intermediate Sustainable Farming Incentive soils standard.

The value of existing agri-environment schemes has to be considered as Environmental Land Management becomes a reality and more detail is revealed, adds Ian, with private funding options also being assessed.

""We are having positive conversations with partner organisations and we are also in a facilitation fund with five other businesses in Lincolnshire, covering 15,000ha and making changes at scale.""

Woodland is managed under a 10-year plan and is now covering its cost.

Water is monitored for nitrogen and phosphorus across six locations, to understand if any spikes seen come from farming practice or are due to cross-contamination from housing.   

Dyson Farming

A diverse range of land types growing both food and energy crops across 14,000ha, along with property and leisure divisions and a knowledge provision arm, make up Dyson Farming.

Started in 2012, it now spans east and west Lincolnshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire and employs 170 people.

It looks after 1,300ha of environmental stewardship features - including 390,000m of hedgerows, 11,700 trees and 250,000m of watercourses.

Energy is generated at its Lincolnshire-based anaerobic digestion plant, which powers more than 10,000 homes.

The waste heat is used in the company's 6ha glasshouse, which produce strawberries for Marks & Spencer, while the digestate goes back onto the land in a circular farming system.

With seven people on the Dyson Farming Research team, the output from this division underpins every decision and is shared with 150 farmer subscribers, who attend technical meetings and field days.

Increasingly, technology is playing a key role - from reducing agrochemical applications by 90% to the more effective storage and spreading of digestate, helping with synthetic nitrogen fertiliser reductions.

Anna Jones is a freelance journalist and founder of Just Farmers, a group putting practical farmers in touch with the wider media. Here she shares her thoughts on Jeremy Clarkson as an ambassador for farming

I don't spend much time thinking about Jeremy Clarkson. So when Farmers Weekly asked me for my views on whether he's ""good or bad for British agriculture"", ahead of next week’s second series of Clarkson's Farm, I had to do some research.

I decided to ask a group of farmers for their thoughts, bearing in mind his controversial comments about the Duchess of Sussex and his delayed apology.

See also: What's in Your Shed? visits Jeremy Clarkson's 400ha farm

Everyone agreed his attack on Meghan Markle was wrong. Their comments varied from “vile” to ""going a bit far"".

One (male) farmer said the majority of people ""generally agree"" with Clarkson, and he's done ""a lot of good for farming"".

Someone else suggested the whole furore was ""irrelevant to farming"" and would ""all calm down"". One woman shrugged and said she found him quite funny.

Another man asked: ""How do you even know his article was against women?""

In case you missed it""¦ writing in The Sun in December (in a column that has since been taken off the website), Clarkson paints a disturbingly stark image of himself lying in bed, grinding his teeth, being plagued by contemptuous thoughts of Meghan Markle, his cells so fired up on hatred that he can't sleep.

Maybe it was there, tossing and turning in the darkness, that he was struck by the thought of parading the Duchess ""naked through the streets of every town in Britain while the crowds chant ‘Shame!’ and throw lumps of excrement at her.""

I bet he thought the Game of Thrones reference made him sound cool. Pillock!

Clarkson even shared his bizarre female hate-list, with Meghan Markle holding the top spot over Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon and child murderer Rose West. It's hardly an article for women, is it?

Only one woman in the group spoke up to criticise him (though she seemed a little nervous doing so).

Afterwards, two other women came to speak to me privately. One, a woman of colour, said she was disgusted and wanted to say so, but worried that people would think she was ""playing the race card"".

The other, in a lowered voice, said it was interesting how it was mostly men who had defended him.

I was shocked by how uncomfortable, and cowed, these women felt among their peers. Both expressed concerns about how Clarkson's tarnished image now reflects on British farming.

As an industry, we went to town on Clarkson - showering him with praise, shoving awards at him like infatuated groupies.

NFU 2021 Farming Champion of the Year! Winner of the Flying the Flag for British Agriculture Trophy!

Wined, dined, and adored at a farming awards ceremony! Finally - a famous, influential ambassador for British farming. Hurrah!

We forgot one important thing. Jeremy Clarkson is not an ambassador for anyone but himself.

Placing a proven loose cannon on such a pedestal is a dangerous game which could easily backfire. Is a spiteful provocateur really the kind of champion we want?

Yes, Clarkson's Farm (the TV programme) is good for farming. But Clarkson (the man) also puked out a venomous pile of misogynistic trash that should never have left his weird, hate-riddled bedchamber, let alone wind up in a national newspaper.

My fear is that by being so quick to jump into bed with everyone's favourite ""farming hero"", our industry is cosied right up next to a prat. And what are we doing to call him out? Diddly squat.

Harry Davies

Hopes Ash Farm, Herefordshire

Harry Davies © Richard Stanton

Harry Davies says it was the ""herculean challenge"" of increasing global food production while managing the environmental impacts that inspired him to head to Harper Adams to study agriculture.

He believes he is a very different person now than before he started university, as he finishes his final year, inspired to take his learnings home to the family farm to increase profitability and sustainability.

Changes already implemented at the mixed farm include introducing genomic testing in the dairy herd, which has helped to add more than £100 to the herd's average profitable lifetime index in the past 12 months.

""I am exceptionally pleased with how one specific lecture has translated into measurable performance enhancement,"" he says.

Having achieved an impressive average of 71% over his first two years, Harry then took on a placement with NE Salmon, working both in the UK and in Western Australia.

The uni years

His lecturer describes Harry as a ""joy to teach"" and applauds his communication, engagement, listening and passion.

As a livestock producer in the Wye catchment, he took a subject close to home - elevated phosphate levels within the River Wye - and explored it through his dissertation project, looking at the technology for stripping phosphate from animal manures.

Harry will swiftly acknowledge that his biggest weakness can be worrying about decisions made on the farm, but he tries to achieve some downtime riding his motorbike or watching rugby to allow him to switch off.

He is also an active member of his local YFC and got involved with the university's off-road club.

Passion for agriculture

On Harry's CV, a long list of livestock and land-based qualifications, nearly all of which were gained during his time at Harper, testify to his dedication to self-development.

His passion at home has always been the dairy enterprise, which is why he pursued an arable placement to fill the knowledge gap he felt he had in that area.

He has considered working elsewhere once he leaves university, but has decided to head back to Hopes Ash Farm near Ross-on-Wye.

""I am excited about the things I want to do at home. We have ongoing projects, such as a small-scale AD [anaerobic digestion] plant going up this summer, and we have moved from turkeys to chickens, so I just want to get my teeth stuck in.

""I felt the opportunities and learning curve I would have from managing the AD project would be greater than sitting on somebody else's tractor for a year.""

He also wants to bring more regenerative principles to the farm, driving out synthetic inputs and using livestock more effectively.

""I don't think regenerative farming is a fad. The name might be a fad - I don't know what it'll be called next week - but the principles behind it are fantastic and that's the direction of travel I want to move in,"" says Harry.

Life after university

In the short term, he plans to use scholarship funds to complete his Basis and Facts qualifications.

One of the reasons for this is to better understand what inputs he can eliminate without drastically reducing output.

Longer term, he would like to be more involved with Arla and the NFU, and undertake a Nuffield scholarship.

Harry admits he occasionally struggles to say no, but this means he has squeezed every opportunity out of his university experience, which stands him in good stead for an exciting future career.

""I'm biting off more than I can chew, and chewing as hard as I can,"" he summarises.

What the judges say

Harry's passion and enthusiasm for agriculture is infectious. He has used his time at university to develop personally and has a strong knowledge in all areas with a clear vision for the future.

Isla Soutter

Yew Tree Farm, Leicestershire

Isla Soutter © Richard Stanton

Farming is in her blood, and it's fair to say that Isla Soutter has grasped every opportunity in the sector that has come her way.

This includes jumping in at the deep end with a placement in the poultry sector.

She was raised on beef, sheep and arable farms, but turned down a more familiar placement to work with an egg producer and broaden her agricultural experience. It was a brave move for somebody who admits she ""despised chickens"" at the time.

Isla now sees her placement as a progressive young farmer with McDonald's and the Lakes Free Range Egg company as a highlight of her four-year course and a key contributor to her personal development.

She also introduced six hens to the farm at home in Ashby De La Zouch.

The uni years

Her course tutor praises her willingness to repeatedly step outside her comfort zone and highlights the graft she has put in to achieve good grades. 

Isla has worked consistently hard throughout education, not falling behind despite time spent as a young carer and a move from Cumbria to the Midlands in the middle of her GCSE exams.

There is never a moment wasted outside of studying, either, with time dedicated to the UK Hereford Cattle Society and playing rugby at university and home.

She credits sport with helping her develop skills such as teamwork and decision-making to achieve a common goal.

Scholarships have allowed her to complete additional land-based training courses that are offered at the university, and helped fund travel and accommodation for visits to industry events such as the Oxford Farming Conference.

Passion for agriculture

Isla is a student ambassador at Harper Adams; encouraging others into agriculture is something she's passionate about, as is educating consumers on where food comes from.

In fact, she would put food on the national curriculum given half the chance.

Through her role on the committee of the local agricultural show, she has introduced an educational stand with the local college as well as a butchery demonstration.

""In the future, hopefully we can give people a different perspective on where their food comes from, which could lead to less misinformation, supporting British farming to become more sustainable, reducing food miles, reducing food waste and improving diets.""

Cattle are Isla's first love, and she enjoys both exhibiting and, more recently, judging at livestock shows.

Informed by her learning on sustainable animal production systems and her dissertation on consumer perceptions and attitudes, she believes agriculture has a bright, and sustainable, future if it can embrace new research and technology.

Life after university

Upon returning from Australia's west coast this summer, where she hopes to visit a variety of different farms, Isla will embark on a two-year graduate programme with the agriculture team at ABP Food Group.

In time, she wants to continue travelling, with her sights set on the 2025 World Hereford Conference in Kansas and a Nuffield scholarship.

""Travel has allowed me to recognise the significant contribution various nations make to the world's food production.

""Having the opportunity to experience different systems has broadened my technical knowledge and understanding of our shared challenged surrounding food security,"" she says. 

What the judges say

Isla has never been afraid to get out of her comfort zone. She works hard to gain a rounded knowledge of the industry and has a passion to inspire the next generation through education.""

Oliver Stephens

Brindely Avenue, Buckinghamshire

Oliver Stephens © Richard Stanton

Oliver says he struggled to engage at secondary school, so when he found out agricultural college was an option instead of A-levels, he ""leapt at it"".

He left Berkshire College of Agriculture with a distinction, an award for the most ""ability in agriculture"" and an entrance scholarship for Aberystwyth University. No mean feat for somebody with no farming background.

Instead of heading straight to uni, though, Oliver spent a year gaining as much practical experience as possible - milking, lambing, grain carting, doing general farm work and assisting at a grain store.

""I could have got away without doing it because university is very theoretical, but I am so glad I did it and would recommend other people do it,"" says Oliver.

""That year taught me so much about what happens on farm, and how the farming calendar works.""

The uni years

Oliver's grades reflect a lot of hard work. He is currently on track to achieve a first-class degree and was awarded ""Best performance during a year in industry"" for his year group.

His final-year tutor says he is a dedicated student, always looking for opportunities to learn and asking insightful questions.

She also says he has prepared several presentations good enough for international conferences.

Oliver was thrilled to be selected as Frontier's commercial rotation placement student for his year in industry after an intensive selection process.

He returned to Aberystwyth to focus his dissertation on the rooting capacity of a heritage oat variety.

The results showed that the Pillas oat could be a promising new cover crop option thanks to its root biomass production under both low- and high-nutrient conditions.

His findings are now being used in further research into the variety at the National Plant Phenomics Centre.

Throughout his time at university, Oliver was elected as a member of the student staff consultative committee and has been an active member of the Aber Uni Canoe Club, enjoying whitewater rafting as well as hiking and camping in his spare time.

Passion for agriculture

When starting at college, Oliver's end goal was to have his own farm, but this has now changed.

Inspired by an adviser on his placement, he wants to work in an advisory capacity to help farmers find the right solutions for their businesses.

He is keen to inspire others to pursue a career in the world of agriculture, too, and has already encouraged his brother to go to Berkshire, as he did.

However, having witnessed first-hand the challenges of gaining experience, he thinks it is something farmers should improve on if the industry is to thrive.

""How often do you hear of an employer complaining they can't find staff who know how to drive a tractor for harvest, or can lamb a ewe""¦ and yet they are not willing to teach them,"" he says.

Life after university

Oliver has a clear idea where he is heading next. Kings Crops, a division of Frontier where he did his placement, has offered him a role when he finishes university.

He will be working in cover crop mix formulation and administration, and training as a technical adviser.

He dreams of doing a Nuffield scholarship, or similar project exploring the potential of novel crops for UK agriculture's sustainable intensification, and one day hopes to find himself on the stage at Groundswell.

""My aim is to give as many farms as possible the knowledge and confidence to make real changes that will benefit their soil, environment and bottom line,"" he says.

What the judges say

Oliver loves to get into the detail of the subject he is studying and excels at it. His strong desire to improve farm health and safety is refreshing to see in someone of his age.

The first Farmers Weekly Question Time, a series of live regional debates on key agricultural topics, kicked off at Harper Adams University on 2 February 2023.

Farmers shaped the discussion by putting their searching questions to a panel of policymakers and influential figures, including farming minister, Mark Spencer.

Questions covered a range of topics, including the Environmental Land Management (ELM) scheme, trade, food prices and controversial celebrity Jeremy Clarkson.

Farmers questions

A member of the audience quizzes the panel at Farmers Weekly Question Time © Richard Stanton

What is the best way to encourage more farmers to participate in the government's Environmental Land Management (ELM) scheme?

Farming minister Mark Spencer said Defra had already increased payment rates to make them ""credible and attractive"", as well as making the schemes ""accessible and easy to engage with"".

""Frankly, the way we now sell that is to go and evangelise about it,"" he added.

Olly Harrison was pleased to find he was going to be rewarded for actions he is already taking on his arable farm, but warned his dyslexia would mean he still needed to pay someone to go through the application process for him.

For Vicki Hird, the fact that Defra has chosen to stick with income foregone payments is disappointing. ""It has still got some real problems in that context, particularly for upland farmers,"" she said.

""Recognising the value of public goods differently in different parts of the country is something [the government is] going to have to review.""

She also called on the government to provide more affordable or free advice to help farmers get involved.

How can the outcomes and therefore the value of ELM be measured without any baselining taking place before the schemes?

Prof Michael Lee said that, in a scientific experiment, he would have to have an exact baseline, but noted it is not possible to treat the real-world environment in this way.

He did, however, point to the work taking place on research farms to calculate baselines.

""We have got to use a network of demonstration farms, which can testbed and track that, and then the farming community within their environment can go back and see that,"" he said.

""But, of course, each intervention will work differently in different parts of the country based on soil types and meteorological conditions, so it is phenomenally complicated.""

Mark Spencer, meanwhile, said increasing insect and bird populations ""has to be good for nature"".

""We will know we have improved, but we will not be able to measure it from the start point,"" he added.

Audience comment from Richard Yates, Bridgnorth: ""I have been farming in this way in agri-environment schemes since the last century and I do not think your schemes recognise that. I am prohibited from entering. Michael Gove said you needed 70% of the area in agri-environment schemes for it to be a success. Will you even get 17%?""

Panel response from Mark Spencer: ""I think we can do a lot better than that, but I am surprised that if you are farming in that way, why you would not embrace the schemes and get paid for what you are already doing.

""One of the challenges with an audience like this is to come to an event of this nature you are already politically engaged and you are interested in agricultural politics and the future of the industry.

""I have got to try to get to your friends and neighbours who do not engage in these meetings, and that is going to be where the higher hanging fruit is.""

Will trade deals with other countries be good or bad for the sustainability of UK agriculture?

Vicki Hird said new trade deals pose a ""real risk"" to ELM, food standards and consumer understanding.

""We need consumers to support local farmers and have that connection,"" she said. ""It is very difficult if you have got more food coming from overseas.""

But Olly Harrison said he believed trade could ""go both ways"".

""Why can't we sell the rest of the world our produce?"" he asked, prompting applause from the audience.

Mark Spencer agreed, saying the UK was ""way ahead of the curve"" on sustainability and pointing to a recent deal signed in Montreal, Canada, to reduce pesticide usage.

But on marketing UK produce abroad, he said the government had to be ""a little bit careful"".

""Agriculture is not a special case on its own,"" he added. ""Nobody is out there promoting the UK car industry. Why are we not promoting ourselves? Why has it always got to be government-led?""

Audience comment from Andrew Court, Staffordshire: ""It is all very well to say we can do partnerships, but it is not a level playing field throughout the world, simply because of exchange rates and what is happening in the global markets.

“It is all very well to say we can balance seasonality, but if it is cheaper somewhere else, what is the guarantee the country we are supplying is not going to go elsewhere?""

Audience comment from Anna Jones, Shropshire: ""I was lucky enough when I was doing my Nuffield scholarship to go to Denmark, New Zealand and Ireland.

“Every time I talked to them about our ambitions to push our exports, all three looked at me as if I was mad and said: ""˜Why would you want to do that? We don't do it because we want to do it, we do it because we have populations of 5 million people and we don't have a domestic market on our doorstep. You guys don't have to do this, you have a massive domestic market - 68 million people.'

""When we are trying to compare ourselves to these big boys, are we actually comparing apples and pears?""

Given the shortage of available land and finances, how should young people get into farming?

Prof Michael Lee said it was important to work with schools and the wider community to show farmers are not just ""people in wellies with a piece of straw hanging out of their mouth.""

""[Agriculture] is a vital, sexy industry that is going to solve problems such as how we are going to feed 11 billion people without destroying the planet,"" he added.

He also suggested land was not always needed to enter the industry, pointing to the example of a group of young farmers with no land who made a success out of a flying flock, improving the health of arable soils. 

Olly Harrison said the easiest way to get into agriculture was to make money outside the industry first, but also called for interest-free loans to be made available for entrants, while Vicki Hird recommended protection for the county farms estate.

Mark Spencer highlighted the new entrant pilot schemes Defra is currently working on, but added: ""I do not diminish the size of the challenge; it is huge.""

Audience comment from Matt Redman, Cambridge: ""One thing pretty much avoided by everyone is there is incredible scope to get people into industry working for others. We seem to get fixed on the point of view that you have got to do it yourself.

""This devalues the message that there is another route into industry. Then the government further devalues it by calling pretty much every agricultural worker unskilled.""

Do you agree with the principle that consumers must pay the real cost of food?

Olly Harrison said consumer prices are disconnected from the farmgate price, but suggested the problem was likely down to marketing, with the public willing to pay more for bottled water than milk.

He also claimed farmers were being ""ripped off"" by those further up the supply chain - a point echoed by Vicki Hird, who explained farmers only get 0.09p profit from a loaf of bread. 

""In the middle, between the farmgate price and where food goes, there is a huge extraction of wealth,"" she said.

She urged the government to keep the Groceries Code Adjudicator, and the consultation launched last year that proposed submerging it into the Competition and Markets Authority.

Mark Spencer said: ""The Groceries Code Adjudicator is the responsibility of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, but to change that they will have to come and seek approval from Defra. It is a very important role we should keep.""

He added the government would regulate if retailers and processors did not start sharing profit more fairly.

What should be done to secure UK food production and rural communities in light of the continual loss of agricultural land for large-scale tree-planting projects, including the purchasing of family farms for so-called offsetting by large corporations?

Mark Spencer said government had to make sure trees were being planted in the right places, because they could take land out of production and put more pressure on the system.

But he added: ""We are actually getting more productive year-on-year. We get about 1% more productive every year, which means that, in 10 years' time, there will be that ability to take land out of food production into more environmental schemes and for more environmental benefits.""

Vicki Hird, meanwhile, pointed to agroforestry as a possible solution to the problem. ""Putting trees on farms - livestock farms and alongside crops - has great potential,"" she said.

""There is a win-win-win from agroforestry. Even the Committee on Climate Change has recognised this and said we could get 40% of the tree-planting targets from agroforestry, rather than boring monoculture plantations. I think we can go further than that.""

Audience comment from John Downes, Shropshire: ""My son Tim has been helped by the Woodland Trust to do agroforestry and it was successful.

“We hosted an event in Shropshire called Down To Earth, and 1,700 people came to see what we were up to. The trees were part of the visit.

""He has planted willows because we all know willows are the cow's aspirin, but we have also done earthworm counts, comparing the land between the trees and under the trees. Under the trees, they are tenfold higher. There are multiple benefits. Healthier cows and healthier soil.""

Is Jeremy Clarkson still a good ambassador for farming or should he be cancelled?

Olly Harrison said Jeremy Clarkson has ""made a living out of being controversial"" and he was always going to cross the line at some point.

""But you cannot take it away from him. He makes very entertaining TV programmes and people say he has done more for UK agriculture than the NFU has done in the past 50 years,"" he added.

Mark Spencer, speaking in a personal capacity, also said Jeremy Clarkson had been a ""force for good."" ""He has actually shown how difficult farming is and how unprofitable it can be,"" he said.

""Credit to him. In his own controversial style, he has reached the places we cannot reach, and, on balance, that is a good thing.""

But Vicki Hird disagreed, saying he had ""definitely crossed the line"".

""I did like the first series. I am not sure I will watch the next one because I thought [his Meghan Markle comments were] just appalling,"" she said.

Audience comment from Poppy Rawlings, Harper Adams student: ""We have spoken a lot this evening about education of young people and about how consumers see farming.

“As much as he has done a lot for farming and I can see how he has made a lot of people interested, do you not think the comments he makes about minority cultures is preventing people wanting to enter agriculture?""

106,"Will the beet moth strike again in crops this summer?","https://www.fwi.co.uk/arable/sugar-beet/will-the-beet-moth-strike-again-in-crops-this-summer","Will the beet moth strike again in crops this summer?

English sugar beet growers are counting the cost of the beet moth, which was seen in large numbers for the first time last summer.

The moth (Scrobipalpa ocellatella) devastated some crops with the larvae feeding on foliage, leading to defoliation and secondary rots. Importantly, they can also feed on roots.

Worst affected growers were left with little option other than lifting defoliated crops earlier, losing out on yields.

See also: Herbicide-tolerant sugar beet draws growers amid high costs

So where has it come from and why are UK growers suddenly seeing their crops devoured by the caterpillars?

Rosemary Collier, a specialist in the management of pest insects in horticultural crops at the University of Warwick, has been investigating the outbreak.

She says a good source of information is the network of moth groups in the UK and the well-established wildlife recording across Europe.

UK sightings

Prof Collier points out that until recently, the moth was mostly present in very local populations - shingle coasts and saltmarshes in southern England. The larvae were likely to be feeding on sea beet.

Sporadic inland records were considered as probable wanderers from nearby coastal habitats.

In 2020, a notable influx was reported in Bedfordshire and to a lesser extent in Huntingdonshire.

The following year there were recorded sightings in Suffolk and a few in Cambridgeshire, indicating the possible establishment of inland breeding populations.

Then last summer, there was a significant eruption in the range and numbers both westwards and northward, with hundreds found on some occasions.

Further afield

Looking further afield, the moth does well in warm countries where it completes more generations, says Prof Collier.

She points to Hungary where changes in larval populations were correlated with temperatures in July and August and negatively with humidity.

Similarly, Slovenia first saw it back in 2003, which happened to be a dryer and warmer year, which also hints at the hot, dry conditions last summer being a factor in the population explosion and its spread inland.

But for those growers hoping the cold winter frosts will nip them off, Hungary has cold winters and the British Beet Research Organisation’s head of science, Mark Stevens, confirms that larvae are being seen in crops, suggesting it has survived the December freeze.

When she asked moth experts whether they thought the species had migrated in the UK or from abroad, no one could say for sure.

However, Prof Collier suspects it has spread from the Netherlands and Belgium, as it was a new species to many counties over this period.

How to manage it?

To identify possible ways of managing the pest, Prof Collier has looked at research and experience overseas.

Breeding: Varietal screening in Iran saw some differences, so breeding may help longer term.

Cultural: Plant density and dense canopies are important factors in reducing pest numbers, by increasing the surface area to nutritional area.

The resulting microclimate (particularly raised moisture levels) also favours predators and beneficials.

In Egypt, intercropping sugar beet with narrow row (25cm) onions reduced pest infestations.

Monitoring: Pheromone trapping could have a role in monitoring, as there is a need to know when moths are present and flying. But further work is needed on how many traps are needed and when to deploy them.

Natural control: The moth has a range of natural enemies (such as parasitoids), but detailed work would be needed to determine which occurred in the UK. The pest will also be consumed by general predators such as birds.

Mechanical control: One study showed irrigation can help and there is also work in Egypt showing that ploughing can help, by burying pupae/larva deeper so have further to travel to the surface.

We don't know how far they fly, but may need to look separation of old crops and new crops.

Chemistry: Finally, on chemical control, it is likely to be killed by insecticides approved for the control of caterpillars, as there is no reason to believe it has developed resistance. But there are no approved products.

If there were, she says targeting contact insecticides may be a problem. ""You would have to target the caterpillars, as there is little hope of killing moths, and eggs are not easy to kill too.""

In conclusion, Prof Collier says the moth is here to stay and given the right conditions, it will affect crops again.

English sugar beet growers are counting the cost of the beet moth, which was seen in large numbers for the first time last summer.

The moth (Scrobipalpa ocellatella) devastated some crops with the larvae feeding on foliage, leading to defoliation and secondary rots. Importantly, they can also feed on roots.

Worst affected growers were left with little option other than lifting defoliated crops earlier, losing out on yields.

So where has it come from and why are UK growers suddenly seeing their crops devoured by the caterpillars?

Rosemary Collier, a specialist in the management of pest insects in horticultural crops at the University of Warwick, has been investigating the outbreak.

She says a good source of information is the network of moth groups in the UK and the well-established wildlife recording across Europe.

UK sightings

Prof Collier points out that until recently, the moth was mostly present in very local populations - shingle coasts and saltmarshes in southern England. The larvae were likely to be feeding on sea beet.

Sporadic inland records were considered as probable wanderers from nearby coastal habitats.

In 2020, a notable influx was reported in Bedfordshire and to a lesser extent in Huntingdonshire.

The following year there were recorded sightings in Suffolk and a few in Cambridgeshire, indicating the possible establishment of inland breeding populations.

Then last summer, there was a significant eruption in the range and numbers both westwards and northward, with hundreds found on some occasions.

Further afield

Looking further afield, the moth does well in warm countries where it completes more generations, says Prof Collier.

She points to Hungary where changes in larval populations were correlated with temperatures in July and August and negatively with humidity.

Similarly, Slovenia first saw it back in 2003, which happened to be a dryer and warmer year, which also hints at the hot, dry conditions last summer being a factor in the population explosion and its spread inland.

But for those growers hoping the cold winter frosts will nip them off, Hungary has cold winters and the British Beet Research Organisation’s head of science, Mark Stevens, confirms that larvae are being seen in crops, suggesting it has survived the December freeze.

When she asked moth experts whether they thought the species had migrated in the UK or from abroad, no one could say for sure.

However, Prof Collier suspects it has spread from the Netherlands and Belgium, as it was a new species to many counties over this period.

How to manage it?

To identify possible ways of managing the pest, Prof Collier has looked at research and experience overseas.

Breeding: Varietal screening in Iran saw some differences, so breeding may help longer term.

Cultural: Plant density and dense canopies are important factors in reducing pest numbers, by increasing the surface area to nutritional area.

The resulting microclimate (particularly raised moisture levels) also favours predators and beneficials.

In Egypt, intercropping sugar beet with narrow row (25cm) onions reduced pest infestations.

Monitoring: Pheromone trapping could have a role in monitoring, as there is a need to know when moths are present and flying. But further work is needed on how many traps are needed and when to deploy them.

Natural control: The moth has a range of natural enemies (such as parasitoids), but detailed work would be needed to determine which occurred in the UK. The pest will also be consumed by general predators such as birds.

Mechanical control: One study showed irrigation can help and there is also work in Egypt showing that ploughing can help, by burying pupae/larva deeper so have further to travel to the surface.

We don't know how far they fly, but may need to look separation of old crops and new crops.

Chemistry: Finally, on chemical control, it is likely to be killed by insecticides approved for the control of caterpillars, as there is no reason to believe it has developed resistance. But there are no approved products.

If there were, she says targeting contact insecticides may be a problem. ""You would have to target the caterpillars, as there is little hope of killing moths, and eggs are not easy to kill too.""

In conclusion, Prof Collier says the moth is here to stay and given the right conditions, it will affect crops again.

Way forward

Winter bean crops have been struck by a widespread influx of chocolate spot.

Growers are advised to spray infected crops earlier than usual if weather remains unsettled to get on top of the disease.

We ask two experts for their advice this season.

See also: Shallower potato cultivation depths recommended in wet season

Why is the disease prominent?

Frosty winter conditions hit crops hard this season with temperatures plummeting as low as -10C.

Cool and wet conditions throughout March and April exacerbated disease risk and restricted early spring recovery.

Becky Howard, PGRO research and development manager, says the number of samples sent through the organisation's plant clinic infected with chocolate spot are notably higher than usual.

""Many crops were early-sown this season into good seed-beds. But earlier drilling increases risk of chocolate spot as crops emerge sooner to develop a larger, lusher canopy, which is susceptible to disease.

""Winter frosts then damaged the leaf surface allowing the botrytis pathogen to infect crops,"" says Dr Howard.

Wet spring conditions created the perfect environment for the disease to thrive, with fungal spores spreading via rain splash from existing lesions on lower leaves to new growth.

Debris from previous crops and nearby bean volunteers have also contributed.

What are the recommendations for infected crops?

Independent AICC agronomist Peter Cowlrick of CCC Ltd, based in Hampshire and West Sussex, advises an early pre-flowering fungicide spray for high-pressure October-drilled crops.

Typically, the first fungicide spray for winter beans is during early flowering at the beginning of May (T1 timing). The second is applied three to four weeks later at the T2 timing.

""Crops remain two to three weeks away from the flowering period. Where disease pressure is high and weather conditions allow, an early holding spray before flowering will help control disease,"" he says.

As most fungicide treatments have protectant rather than curative properties, Mr Cowlrick recommends applying the spray after three to five days of dry weather.

This ensures new leaf growth is protected from infection as chemistry can only prevent new leaves from becoming infected.

Which actives and rates to use?

A sufficient range of actives are available to control the disease, but assessing the order of application will be an important decision for growers and agronomists.

Under high disease pressure, rates should not be dropped below 75% of the recommended dose, warns Dr Howard.

""Chocolate spot is responsive to dose rate and keeping disease under control with effective doses is key to its long-term management and reducing resistance build-up,"" she says.

However, Dr Howard notes the importance of checking labels for application restrictions.

For example, azoxystrobin can only be used from first flowering at GS60, and tebuconazole from stem extension at GS40.

""Chocolate spot needs careful management as it can be a very damaging disease. Better weather forecast this week offers a good opportunity for growers to get on the ground,"" she says.

Mr Cowlrick is recommending high-disease crops with a three-quarter rate of an approved Tebuconazole at the pre-flowering spray for cost-effective control, followed by Elatrus Era (benzovindiflupyr + prothioconazole) at T1.

""This is only applicable to high-pressure, early-drilled crops. That's why close monitoring by growers and agronomists is important to keep an eye on things,"" he says.

If chocolate spot pressure remains high, he advises an application of Signum (boscalid + pyraclostrobin) or azoxystrobin plus Tebuconazole at T2.

How can crop nutrition combat disease?

Optimum nutrition promotes good crop health, which is why soil P and K indices are important.

Too low indices can increase disease susceptibility. That's why topping up with foliar sprays can be beneficial.

""Magnesium is one to watch in winter beans as it affects overall plant health,"" says Mr Cowlrick.

""The addition of Epsom salts to a tank mix can provide a simple way of getting magnesium to the plant, but do check compatibilities prior to mixing,"" he says.

Manganese, molybdenum, boron, sulfur and zinc also play important roles.

116,"New study reaffirms livestock and meat benefits to society","https://www.fwi.co.uk/livestock/new-study-reaffirms-livestock-and-meat-benefits-to-society","New study reaffirms livestock and meat benefits to society

New research has reaffirmed scientific evidence of the crucial benefits of livestock systems and meat to society.

The peer-reviewed study, published in the scientific journal Animal Frontiers on Saturday 15 April, provides evidence of livestock and meat's benefits for health, sustainability, food security and socio-economic development.

It builds on scientific debate and evidence developed through the October 2022 International Summit on the Societal Role of Meat, hosted by Irish agricultural research authority Teagasc in Dublin.

See also: Scientists seek evidence on red meat health risk claims

The study’s authors are among nearly 1,000 scientists around the world who have warned that livestock systems are ""too precious to become the victim of simplification, reductionism or zealotry.""

Teagasc assistant director of research Declan Troy welcomed the publication, saying: ""Livestock farming supports the livelihoods of about one in six people on the planet. It supplies food, nutrition, income and more, to hundreds of millions of people and is of enduring cultural significance for many. 

""Today's publication shows that deploying scientifically sound practices in animal agriculture is key to succeeding in the face of global health, climate and development challenges.""

Experts who participated in the October 2022 summit called for this major new analysis to inform public policies and recommendations related to meat production and consumption.

Alice Stanton, of the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland, said: ""The peer-reviewed evidence reaffirms that the most prominent global study which claimed that consumption of even tiny amounts of red meat harms health [the 2019 Global Burden of Disease Risk Factors Report] is fatally scientifically flawed and should be retracted.

""In fact, removing fresh meat and dairy from diets would harm human health. Women, children, the elderly and those on low incomes would be particularly negatively impacted.""

Dr Wilhelm Windisch, of Technical University Munich, Germany, added: ""One-size-fits-all agendas, such as drastic reductions of livestock numbers, could incur environmental and nutritional consequences on a massive scale.""

Sara Pedersen of Farm Dynamics, Vale of Glamorgan, is the 2023 Farmers Weekly Livestock Adviser of the Year.

Veterinary consultant Sara Pedersen has assisted one dairy farmer in South Wales to cut lameness in his milking herd and win a valuable milking contract, which adds an extra £8,000 to his monthly milk cheque.

Sara introduced mobility scoring every two weeks for Russell Morgan's 230-strong Holstein milking herd, and over a three-year period cut lameness from 45% of his cows down to just 8%.

Vet facts

This dramatic fall in lameness is estimated to have saved him £60,000 over the three years, and led to Russell signing up for a milk supply contract with retailer Marks & Spencer.

""It's no good farmers getting their grazing right and their parlours right if the cows don't want to walk,"" Sara says.

Causes of lameness

The strict scoring regime led to regular visits from a skilled foot trimmer, which helped cut down on the three main causes of lameness - bacterial digital dermatitis, sole ulcers and white line problems from poor cow movement. Improving cow comfort and ventilation also helped.

""Some 30% of the cows had sole ulcers when we started, and now there was only one case last year,"" she says.

Sara focused on lameness after leaving vet school having never trimmed a cow's foot. She wanted to highlight this as a key issue in dairy herds, along with nutrition and fertility, so she set up her own company, Farm Dynamics, in 2014 from her base in Cowbridge.

This interest led her to a PhD at Nottingham University, which she is about to complete, involving the largest study in the world on the need for foot treatment for young heifers before they enter the milking herd.

She is also helping to train other vets in foot care and lameness.

She says the benefits of improved cow mobility extend to helping the environment - more efficient milk production and lower culling rates can help reduce overall carbon emissions by producing more milk from the same number of cows.

Herd expansion

With a healthier, more mobile herd, Russell is now looking to increase his Holstein herd from 230 milking cows towards 300-350, and with lameness under control it will allow him to put more of a focus on genetics to improve productivity.

""We would not have got the M&S contract in February 2001 without Sara's help, while she has also been helping with ideas about housing and general herd health,"" he says.

Sara started working at the farm in 2019, and implemented the three-year strategy the following year.

The farm's focus on nutrition, fertility and finally lameness has seen the average annual milk yield from the robot-milked herd rise by 3,500 litres over the three years from 8,000 litres to 11,500 litres, although a lot of that improvement came from better nutrition.

The farm has been using robots for five years and has joined the 38 farms that supply milk to M&S, and so Russell allows the cows to graze outside for a set number of days a year to meet the retailer's requirements.

Insect-borne livestock diseases that were once confined to the tropics are increasingly likely to threaten farms in the UK as climate change expands the number of countries where they can thrive.

A 2019 study, Bluetongue Risk Under Future Climates, which looked at how changing temperatures in northern Europe might affect outbreaks of bluetongue virus, suggested that an outbreak typically expected once every 20 years could become almost an annual occurrence by the 2070s in a worst-case climate change scenario.

One of the authors, Andrew Morse, says the UK is already vulnerable to vector-borne diseases but, as the temperature increases, the risks will be much higher.

""We expect that risk forecasting and early, accurate disease detection, along with efficient strategies for disease control, will become increasingly vital in future, warmer climates,"" says Prof Morse, who leads on climate impacts at the University of Liverpool.

History

UK agriculture has a long history of new diseases; there are many examples of infections, in pigs in particular, which arrived here from other countries and are now commonplace.

Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome, for example, first appeared in the UK in 1991 and, within 12 months of its arrival, respiratory disease affecting pigs in the immediate post-weaning period started to become a serious problem for some producers.

It has since become endemic, as it has in most pig-producing countries globally.

James Wood, of the Department of Veterinary Medicine at Cambridge Veterinary School, says a number of new diseases in pigs in particular have caused repeated problems for UK farmers. ""All sorts of different viruses have emerged in pigs. Most didn't start in the UK, but have ended up here,"" he says.

Other threats

And it is another disease of pigs, African swine fever (ASF), that is now one of the most obvious and potentially potent threats to the UK herd, with a high level of infection in continental Europe in both wild boar and farmed pigs.

In the past six months, the disease challenge from wild boar has inched closer to the UK, although the high levels of infection seen in farmed pigs is still further away, in Germany and Poland.

Prof Wood, who also sits on the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha) science advisory board, says ASF is still loosely classified as a medium risk in the UK, but he warns: ""It only needs a ham sandwich carelessly discarded in a hedge by a visitor from a country with ASF for the disease to arrive in the UK.""

Foot-and-mouth disease is an ever-present threat. While swill feeding was identified as the reason for the start of the 2001 epidemic, foot-and-mouth has a long history of spreading across borders.

A key difference between that disease and ASF, though, is that foot-and-mouth is not currently present in Europe. But Prof Wood says the UK should remain vigilant.

A number of other transboundary diseases are getting increasingly harder to control due to climate change, including Rift Valley fever and lumpy skin disease virus in cattle. Apha has also recently highlighted cases of tick-borne fever, which occurs in both sheep and cattle.

Bluetongue virus - a major threat from climate change

The potential re-emergence of bluetongue virus in the UK is a real cause for concern as temperatures rise.

The last significant outbreak came in 2007, when the virus was transmitted here from Belgium and the Netherlands by midges.

James Wood at Cambridge Veterinary School says: ""There is nothing we can do to control midges. It is not like having disease control systems in place [at borders] for a live pig or a ham sandwich.""

Bluetongue is present in sheep and cattle in continental Europe, where it can cause major disease problems, but there are no vaccination or other control measures in place in the UK.

The exceptionally warm summer in Europe in 2006 was the trigger for the outbreak in the UK the following year.

""To a very great extent, this explains how climate change can impact on insect-borne diseases,"" says Prof Wood. ""In the case of bluetongue, the weather needed to be warm enough for long enough for the virus to replicate in the midge population.""

Lucky escape

Fortunately, the 2007 UK outbreak was limited to 135 farms, which Andrew Morse at the University of Liverpool describes as a ""lucky escape"".

A combination of the geographic location of the virus introduction, the more moderate temperatures experienced in 2007, and pre-existing animal movement restrictions in place to control foot-and-mouth had all helped contain its spread, he says.

""Were bluetongue to have been introduced to the UK in 2006, however, our simulations show that 1,000 farms could have been affected,"" says Prof Morse.

How does the UK keep livestock diseases out?

Early detection is vital to controlling the spread of all diseases, so the UK government has a number of systems in place, including participation in the many preventative programmes in the EU that aim to minimise disease spread across borders.

Apha says it also has robust systems in place to monitor emerging animal diseases and identify risks.

It has developed the Great Britain disease surveillance dashboards, to share surveillance information gathered from data submitted to the GB veterinary diagnostic network.

That network includes Apha's veterinary investigation centres in England and Wales, disease surveillance centres operated by Scotland's Rural College Veterinary Services, Apha's network of universities, and other partners that provide post-mortem services, as well as Apha's Lasswade centre in Scotland for poultry.

Using that surveillance information, Apha publishes regular assessments of the likelihood of an outbreak.

For instance, in August 2022, a qualitative assessment considering the risk of introducing African swine fever to the UK from Europe was conducted, resulting in the risk level increasing to ""medium,"" which means it ""occurs regularly"" or is ""likely"".

It also identified a medium level of uncertainty, which implied that risk managers would need to consider more options for risk reduction.

The Centre of Expertise for Extensively Managed Livestock, developed by Apha, also keeps an eye on disease threats in extensively managed animals, where regular or close inspection for disease detection is more challenging.

Based in Carmarthen, Wales, the centre is a GB-wide resource and forms part of the wider veterinary surveillance system operated by Apha.

Is the current system fit for purpose?

Apha's ability to deal with a major disease outbreak has come under scrutiny.

In November 2022, an inquiry by parliament’s Public Accounts Committee prompted concern that the UK's main animal disease facility, Apha’s centre at Weybridge in Surrey, had deteriorated to a point where the UK was vulnerable to a major outbreak on the scale of the 2001 foot-and-mouth crisis.

The committee said Defra had ""comprehensively failed"" in its management of the site, identifying more than 1,000 single points of failure that would severely undermine its ability to respond to a major outbreak of animal disease.

The report suggested that the centre would struggle with anything more demanding than the current outbreak of avian influenza, adding that the UK faced real threats from African swine fever and rabies.

Defra has now drawn up a redevelopment programme that is likely to cost £2.8bn, but that is not due for completion until 2036.

In the meantime, the centre has devised contingency plans, but its ability to perform the crucial surveillance testing needed during a disease outbreak could be hampered, the committee warned.

Livestock auctioneers are in demand, with markets wanting committed, professional people.

Both the Livestock Auctioneers Association (LAA), representing market operators in England and Wales, and Scotland's Institute of Auctioneers and Appraisers (IAAS) will support aspiring auctioneers to complete their formal training while also learning on the job.

This is through a course in Livestock Market Operations and Management, offered by Harper Adams University and run by Dr Michael Simcock.

See also: Consider becoming a skills training instructor to boost farm income

There are 30-40 students on the course at any one time, with an intake of about 10 a year.

Michael receives calls from employers looking for auctioneers. Successful completion of the course delivers membership of the respective bodies representing markets and auctioneers.

This is in addition to on-the-job training which can be undertaken by a wide range of candidates, from those who have recently left school but have some work experience in markets, to graduates in a suitable subject or a related qualification such as chartered surveying.

The course is a combination of tuition and coursework, with the LAA paying a substantial portion of this and the employer expected to contribute the remainder.

For the 2023 intake, the total fee over four years is £7,500.

The learning covers a wide range of the aspects of the job an auctioneer, fieldsperson and/or market manager might have to handle, including health and safety, welfare, supply chain issues, people management, tax, law and valuation.

Zanna Dennis is the LAA's development officer. She also works part-time at Bentham Market and is attending the course to inform her LAA work.

""We want to encourage more people into the industry,"" she says. ""All roles at the market are essential; you're working in a small team in a big business.""

Next generation

The LAA has a well-supported 70-strong next generation group, for members aged up to 40, which meets up to four times a year.

This offers members a forum in which to exchange ideas and experiences and sometimes to raise issues which they may not be comfortable discussing openly with senior management of the businesses they work for, says Zanna.

""It's a good social and professional network, with lots of peer-to-peer learning."" 

Some marts also offer an apprenticeship route to auctioneering - for example, Carlisle-based Harrison & Hetherington.

Skipton-based Craven Cattle Marts (CCM) and Craven College have joined with several local farmers to offer apprenticeships aimed initially at 16- to 18-year-olds under the general farm worker apprenticeship qualification.

This involves placements at Skipton Auction Mart to gain sale day experience, plus farm-based experience and day-release college training.

Launching the scheme earlier this year, CCM's general manager and auctioneer, Jeremy Eaton, said: ""It's noticeable that with the requirement for students to stay in full-time education until the age of 18 that the traditional source of applicants for roles around livestock markets, particularly those who live on farms, has dried up.

The combination of CCM working alongside proactive farms means that a student can fully learn a variety of disciplines to become very employable in the rural sector.""

How does the LAA/IAAS course work?

Candidates must already be working in the industry and be supported by their employer.

The minimum age is 18 and students should have maths and English GCSEs at grade C or above, or have been employed in or undertaken work experience in the livestock sector.

Enrolment is in January, during an induction and tuition week at Harper Adams. Further study is supported online through to July, with a return to the university for further tuition, visits and assessment.

Students are encouraged to get together between campus visits to check out local markets and meat processors, and other related activities.

The first two years cover work towards the University Foundation Certificate, studying three modules each year. This achieves associate status with LAA/IAAS.

Students can then move to the Certificate of Higher Education, involving three more modules over two years, to gain fellow status.

All modules are graded Level 4 in the National Framework for Higher Education Qualifications, the equivalent to the first year of a degree course.

Graduates in certain subjects and holders of other suitable qualifications can cut short the route to the qualifications, but there is still a minimum study requirement.

Livestock market stats

Stock numbers sold through the 120 English and Welsh LAA marts in 2022 just topped the 2021 figure.

Compared with 2019 - the last full year before Covid-19 hit trade - mart throughputs last year saw an increase of more than 250,000 head. Turnover was up by £27.5m to just over £2.1bn.

2022 numbers - England and Wales

Cattle 1.02 million

Sheep 9.65 million

Pigs 97,000

Calves 242,000

Market challenges

A study by Exeter University's social sciences department in 2020 identified the main challenges for auction marts as lower stock numbers being kept overall, more deadweight selling, business rates, TB control requirements and staffing.

It found that for some marts, attracting new auctioneers or auction managers who are right for the job was very difficult.

Many marts prefer to bring people in at a young age and train them to fit the market in question.

For those markets that were able to recruit auctioneers, time pressures sometimes hampered efficient training of new recruits.

Hailsham market opportunity for career auctioneer

Hailsham is a traditional charter market, dating back to 1252 and the only livestock market still operating in the geographically wide county of Sussex.

It holds weekly prime and cull stock sales on Wednesdays and, depending on the season, weekly or fortnightly store stock sales on Mondays.

Senior auctioneer and fieldsman Roger Waters is over 70 and has 50 years' selling experience, while sheep auctioneer Nick Young is well into his 60s.

Both are fully committed to the market, but want to see it in the hands of a new auctioneer with some experience, who can take on much of the work.

This includes a busy off-site farm machinery and stock sales calendar of about 25 sales a year, including the annual Dolphin sheep fair.

""We'll carry on, but it's a wonderful opportunity for someone young and fit to come in and take the market on,"" says Roger.

Hailsham has a loyal and enthusiastic farmer following, says Nick, who considers auctioneering a vocation.

The number of sheep producers in the area has grown in recent years, and continues to do so, bringing in new vendors.

The nearest alternative market is Ashford in Kent (46 miles to the east), then Salisbury in Wiltshire (108 miles west), and Thame in Oxfordshire, which is 116 miles distant.

As with all marts, the community and support aspects of Hailsham are important and intrinsic to the operation, with a Farming Community Network presence on site and a thriving market cafÃ©.

There is a planning application to take the market out of its town centre location to a greenfield site west of the town.

This will be heard late this year but the market will remain in place at its current location until permission on a new site is secured, says site owner David White.

There is a contract to sell the current site for development, but this is conditional on both the new market site and the current site gaining planning consent.

Once this is in place, the market will have two years in which to construct its new home.

Fears about how it would work in practice and doubts about the payment rates on offer saw the Sustainable Farming Incentive get off to a slow start, with just a couple of hundred farmers signing up in the first few months.

Since then, higher payment rates and a management fee have been unveiled, along with the promise of six new standards coming on stream later this year, as Defra looks to meet its target of 70% of farmers involved by 2028.

In this article, Farmers Weekly speaks to two growers who have already considered the Sustainable Farming Incentive’s (SFI) place on their farms, as they look at new funding opportunities.

They are also weighing up if the forthcoming standards will appeal.  

One has already signed up, while the other has not been tempted to enter an agreement.

Farmer 1: ‘No’ to signing up

Stephen Goodwin, Costow Farms, Northamptonshire

Even though Stephen Goodwin's regenerative approach means that Costow Farms in Northamptonshire more than meets the SFI intermediate soil standard requirements, he has not been tempted to enter into a three-year agreement to date.

The Base-UK vice-chairman, who farms 650ha of arable and 200ha of grass with his family at Marston St Lawrence, near Banbury, has transformed the mixed farm in recent years and put soil health at the heart of the operation - making it a prime candidate for the government's first part of the Environmental Land Management scheme.  

However, having studied the SFI soil standard in detail, his main concern is the lack of flexibility, especially around the grazing of cover crops, as livestock have been integrated into the arable rotation and are an important part of the farming system.

As such, sheep are used to graze the covers right down before drilling the following spring crop.

That means he can't guarantee sufficient green cover in February, which is a requirement of the intermediate soils standard, as conditions might go against him.

""I understand why green cover at all times in important but there are times when the fields have been grazed off to almost nothing by February before spring barley is drilled,"" says Mr Goodwin.

He highlights another example from this year - his stubble turnips didn't do that well, following the very dry establishment period, so he has some land where sheep are currently being fed fodder beet.

They will remain on those fields until next month before the land receives muck and is then drilled with maize in April/May.  

While he hopes that Defra would be flexible on the need for a well-established green cover in winter, he remains cautious.

""It is a stumbling block for us,"" he adds. ""We will keep reviewing the SFI and how it could work, but it doesn't pay enough for us to change the way we farm.""

As Mr Goodwin started his regenerative journey 20 years ago, he is confident about the state of his soils and their ability to withstand weather extremes and capture nutrients.

""We direct-drill into chopped straw, use cover and spring crops and have livestock - so I'm not worried that our soils are deteriorating or at risk of erosion. Soil organic matter levels are around 6-7%.""

He also questions the value of having to test soil organic matter levels as part of the SFI, as any long-term changes take time to show up.

""Given the uptake figures, I'm certainly not alone in wondering whether it's worth doing.""

Mr Goodwin's other point is that he contract farms on a share-farming basis, so needs to understand that any SFI payment would come back into the contract farming agreement.

""It's unlikely to happen here, but there will be instances where the landowner will benefit rather than the farmer.""

He is aware of the six new SFI standards announced at the beginning of the year and, as he hasn't used an insecticide on the farm for some time, recognises that £45/ha on offer under the integrated pest management standard would be achievable immediately.

""Standards like this show that the SFI is going the right way and we will keep an open mind as new ones are launched,"" he confirms.

The business already has a Countryside Stewardship agreement, so the considerable amount of hedging work undertaken at Costow Farms is included in the existing scheme, as are areas for pollinators and biodiversity, he adds.   

Farmer 2: ‘Yes’ to signing up

Rob Waterston, Welford Estate Partnership, Berkshire

Signing up to the SFI intermediate soils standard last year, which pays £40/ha, was an easy decision for the AHDB's Newbury Monitor Farm host and farm manager Rob Waterston.

Already committed to a wide rotation featuring both spring crops and cover crops, and on a mission to improve soil health at the Welford Estate Partnership, he found that the requirements for the standard mirrored his current farm practice.

""We were doing it anyway,"" he says. ""When we considered the detail of the scheme, it made sense for this business and validated the direction that we had been taking.

""It also went some of the way to plugging the gap that a reducing BPS has left.""

Changes introduced since 2015 on the 640ha farm have seen a gradual move to no-till, where conditions are right, and a reducing reliance on bagged inputs.

With soil health central to the farming system, straw is chopped and incorporated, while farmyard manure is also used to build organic matter.

Sewage sludge is applied on a rotational basis and soil testing is already carried out.

Some 231ha of cover crops are grown, many of which couldn't be included in the farm's Mid Tier Countryside Stewardship when it was set up in 2020.

""We could only get 88ha into the original agreement and we weren't able to change it,"" says Mr Waterston.

As a result, he put 633ha into the SFI intermediate soils standard, which amounts to £25,000, showing the contribution that alternative funding sources can make.

Having also committed to a carbon credits scheme, he is clawing back lost funding and will continue to investigate other income sources.

The cover crops at Welford are grazed and he recognises the importance of not overgrazing them as a condition of the SFI.

""Our aim is to eat one-third, trample one-third and leave one-third, so there should be enough green cover left,"" he says.

The only action that he has had to add to meet the standard is the use of a soil score card. ""We weren't doing it but it's a good discipline and straightforward to achieve.""

Mr Waterston has looked at some of the detail of the new standards and is tempted, but believes there is an element of risk in some of them that he will have to weigh up carefully.

""The payment of £45/ha not to use an insecticide is interesting, as we are already trying to do that. But it's a big leap to say that we are not going to use them point blank.""

Likewise, the companion cropping payment of £55/ha is tempting, but can be tricky to achieve in practice.

""We grew a clover understorey in our beans one year, but then managed to kill it in the following wheat crop,"" he recalls.

""We also have berseem clover companions in our oilseed rape, which looked wonderful in the autumn, but the sharp frosts we've had since then means that there's nothing left now.

""The good news is that it has saved the use of a herbicide, but we no longer have the plant diversity in those fields. We need to understand how these unintended developments will be viewed by Defra.""

Mr Waterston acknowledges that the SFI is the right way to go and that the online application process is good, but will wait for more detail before committing to the new standards in the summer.

SFI: What's coming next?

Six new standards have been announced and will open for applications later this year.

Existing SFI agreement holders can add them to their agreements, as well as adding land parcels. Some of the actions are rotational, so can be worked into the farm system.

The new standards are:

The only action that he has had to add to meet the standard is the use of a soil score card. ""We weren't doing it but it's a good discipline and straightforward to achieve.""

Mr Waterston has looked at some of the detail of the new standards and is tempted, but believes there is an element of risk in some of them that he will have to weigh up carefully.

""The payment of £45/ha not to use an insecticide is interesting, as we are already trying to do that. But it's a big leap to say that we are not going to use them point blank.""

Likewise, the companion cropping payment of £55/ha is tempting, but can be tricky to achieve in practice.

""We grew a clover understorey in our beans one year, but then managed to kill it in the following wheat crop,"" he recalls.

""We also have berseem clover companions in our oilseed rape, which looked wonderful in the autumn, but the sharp frosts we've had since then means that there's nothing left now.

""The good news is that it has saved the use of a herbicide, but we no longer have the plant diversity in those fields. We need to understand how these unintended developments will be viewed by Defra.""

Mr Waterston acknowledges that the SFI is the right way to go and that the online application process is good, but will wait for more detail before committing to the new standards in the summer.

SFI: What's coming next?

Six new standards have been announced and will open for applications later this year.

Existing SFI agreement holders can add them to their agreements, as well as adding land parcels. Some of the actions are rotational, so can be worked into the farm system.

Fears about how it would work in practice and doubts about the payment rates on offer saw the Sustainable Farming Incentive get off to a slow start, with just a couple of hundred farmers signing up in the first few months.

Since then, higher payment rates and a management fee have been unveiled, along with the promise of six new standards coming on stream later this year, as Defra looks to meet its target of 70% of farmers involved by 2028.

In this article, Farmers Weekly speaks to two growers who have already considered the Sustainable Farming Incentive’s (SFI) place on their farms, as they look at new funding opportunities.

They are also weighing up if the forthcoming standards will appeal.  

One has already signed up, while the other has not been tempted to enter an agreement.

Farmer 1: ‘No’ to signing up

Stephen Goodwin, Costow Farms, Northamptonshire

Even though Stephen Goodwin's regenerative approach means that Costow Farms in Northamptonshire more than meets the SFI intermediate soil standard requirements, he has not been tempted to enter into a three-year agreement to date.

The Base-UK vice-chairman, who farms 650ha of arable and 200ha of grass with his family at Marston St Lawrence, near Banbury, has transformed the mixed farm in recent years and put soil health at the heart of the operation - making it a prime candidate for the government's first part of the Environmental Land Management scheme.  

However, having studied the SFI soil standard in detail, his main concern is the lack of flexibility, especially around the grazing of cover crops, as livestock have been integrated into the arable rotation and are an important part of the farming system.

As such, sheep are used to graze the covers right down before drilling the following spring crop.

That means he can't guarantee sufficient green cover in February, which is a requirement of the intermediate soils standard, as conditions might go against him.

""I understand why green cover at all times in important but there are times when the fields have been grazed off to almost nothing by February before spring barley is drilled,"" says Mr Goodwin.

He highlights another example from this year - his stubble turnips didn't do that well, following the very dry establishment period, so he has some land where sheep are currently being fed fodder beet.

They will remain on those fields until next month before the land receives muck and is then drilled with maize in April/May.  

While he hopes that Defra would be flexible on the need for a well-established green cover in winter, he remains cautious.

""It is a stumbling block for us,"" he adds. ""We will keep reviewing the SFI and how it could work, but it doesn't pay enough for us to change the way we farm.""

As Mr Goodwin started his regenerative journey 20 years ago, he is confident about the state of his soils and their ability to withstand weather extremes and capture nutrients.

""We direct-drill into chopped straw, use cover and spring crops and have livestock - so I'm not worried that our soils are deteriorating or at risk of erosion. Soil organic matter levels are around 6-7%.""

He also questions the value of having to test soil organic matter levels as part of the SFI, as any long-term changes take time to show up.

""Given the uptake figures, I'm certainly not alone in wondering whether it's worth doing.""

Mr Goodwin's other point is that he contract farms on a share-farming basis, so needs to understand that any SFI payment would come back into the contract farming agreement.

""It's unlikely to happen here, but there will be instances where the landowner will benefit rather than the farmer.""

He is aware of the six new SFI standards announced at the beginning of the year and, as he hasn't used an insecticide on the farm for some time, recognises that £45/ha on offer under the integrated pest management standard would be achievable immediately.

""Standards like this show that the SFI is going the right way and we will keep an open mind as new ones are launched,"" he confirms.

The business already has a Countryside Stewardship agreement, so the considerable amount of hedging work undertaken at Costow Farms is included in the existing scheme, as are areas for pollinators and biodiversity, he adds.   

Farmer 2: ‘Yes’ to signing up

Rob Waterston, Welford Estate Partnership, Berkshire

Signing up to the SFI intermediate soils standard last year, which pays £40/ha, was an easy decision for the AHDB's Newbury Monitor Farm host and farm manager Rob Waterston.

Already committed to a wide rotation featuring both spring crops and cover crops, and on a mission to improve soil health at the Welford Estate Partnership, he found that the requirements for the standard mirrored his current farm practice.

""We were doing it anyway,"" he says. ""When we considered the detail of the scheme, it made sense for this business and validated the direction that we had been taking.

""It also went some of the way to plugging the gap that a reducing BPS has left.""

Changes introduced since 2015 on the 640ha farm have seen a gradual move to no-till, where conditions are right, and a reducing reliance on bagged inputs.

With soil health central to the farming system, straw is chopped and incorporated, while farmyard manure is also used to build organic matter.

Sewage sludge is applied on a rotational basis and soil testing is already carried out.

Some 231ha of cover crops are grown, many of which couldn't be included in the farm's Mid Tier Countryside Stewardship when it was set up in 2020.

""We could only get 88ha into the original agreement and we weren't able to change it,"" says Mr Waterston.

As a result, he put 633ha into the SFI intermediate soils standard, which amounts to £25,000, showing the contribution that alternative funding sources can make.

Having also committed to a carbon credits scheme, he is clawing back lost funding and will continue to investigate other income sources.

The cover crops at Welford are grazed and he recognises the importance of not overgrazing them as a condition of the SFI.

""Our aim is to eat one-third, trample one-third and leave one-third, so there should be enough green cover left,"" he says.

The only action that he has had to add to meet the standard is the use of a soil score card. ""We weren't doing it but it's a good discipline and straightforward to achieve.""

Mr Waterston has looked at some of the detail of the new standards and is tempted, but believes there is an element of risk in some of them that he will have to weigh up carefully.

""The payment of £45/ha not to use an insecticide is interesting, as we are already trying to do that. But it's a big leap to say that we are not going to use them point blank.""

Likewise, the companion cropping payment of £55/ha is tempting, but can be tricky to achieve in practice.

Miscanthus: The profitable solution for flood-prone fields

Provided by



Terravesta is the leading miscanthus supply chain specialist, producing sustainable energy from marginal land.

Miscanthus is a sustainable renewable energy crop and it grows on less productive land, which means it doesn't compete with vital food production.""¯

The Lincolnshire based company delivers a complete miscanthus supply chain solution for producers of the crop and works with over 300 UK growers, to serve several sustainable end markets, including power generation - both small and large scale.

To find out more about Terravesta, visit terravesta.com

As well as offering long-term, consistent income, and environmental benefits on less productive, flood prone or high-risk land, miscanthus is now more affordable and profitable, thanks to new Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) payments.

3 reasons why miscanthus is more affordable and profitable

Crop specialist, Terravesta, offers growers long-term contracts to grow and sell the crop, which has an average lifespan of 15 years.

Miscanthus thrives on flood prone land, it stores 2.35 tonnes CO2e per hectare per year, it can help to stabilise flooded soils and receives no cultivation post-plating, bringing biodiversity benefits.

The crop requires no fertiliser, and while some weed control is advised during establishment, after the crop is established in year two, it requires minimal to no inputs.

A solution for flood-prone land

Results of a study from the Institute of Biological Environmental and Rural Sciences (IBERS) at Aberystwyth University concluded that miscanthus can thrive on waterlogged fields, it provides soil stability and crop yield is not affected by excess water.

According to the lead author in the study, Dr Jason Kam, crop quality is not compromised by flooding.

“There is no significant difference in yield and other physiological development. Observed height and tiller number have no differences between winter flooded and non-flooded ground,” says Jason.

""Because of miscanthus' perennial nature, annual planting is not needed. This therefore reduces soil disturbance to a minimum,"" he says.

""The structure of miscanthus rhizome and root helps to stabilise soils, making it more resilient against flood-caused soil erosion,"" adds Jason.

East Yorkshire farmer profiting with miscanthus on waterlogged land

East Yorkshire arable farmer, Rob Meadley, grows 12 hectares of miscanthus on varying quality, flood-prone land that previously wasn't delivering a viable return with arable crops.  

Rob planted miscanthus in March 2012 in good conditions, but this was followed by the wettest April on record, meaning the freshly planted crop was in standing water, and the bad weather hit again in June.

Rob explains that the 2014 harvest was affected by the legacy of flooding and lack of weed control.

""Arable crops would never have survived the conditions that the miscanthus was exposed to, and we didn't lose any money on inputs.

The annual yield quickly recovered, and in 2017 and 2020, we had bumper harvests of over 13t/ha.""

Ultimately, Rob explains that there would not have been another option for a crop on that land which would have been as profitable.

""Back in 2012 when we decided to plant miscanthus, the principle was looking at the whole farm net margin and identifying the risk in this area.

""It wasn't performing as well as other parts of the farm and miscanthus was 100% the right decision for it.

“The only other option for that land would have been environmental grass, but miscanthus beats this hands down from a net margin point of view,"" he adds.

Lincolnshire farmer growing miscanthus on fields that flood

Terravesta chairman, William Cracroft-Eley, planted a miscanthus crop in 2015 on flood-prone fields, having previously grown it in other areas on the farm.

When it came to the first harvest, the crop was 4 feet underwater due to flooding. The crop was left standing.

William left it until the following year and had a bumper harvest.

""It was a win-win situation, because no damage was done to the land, no money was spent on contractors, it wasn't a loss, because we harvested the crop the following year with the new growth and we hadn't spent any money on inputs because no fertiliser was applied,"" he says.

""Miscanthus does well on all types of land, and like any crop, it does better on more favourable land.

“But, it also thrives where other crops fail, and this could be for numerous reasons, and in this case it's become an ideal solution to water logged land which would otherwise be unprofitable,"" says William.

Crop specialist, Terravesta, offers growers long-term, retail-index linked contracts to grow and sell the crop, which has an average lifespan of 15 years.

The company will supply Terravesta AthenaTM rhizomes, planting equipment and agronomy throughout the crop's life, ensuring successful crop establishment under its planting promise, with establishment finance available from Oxbury, the Agricultural Bank.

Applying manures to standing crops in the spring can help to reduce fertiliser costs, improve soil condition and minimise environmental losses.

Tighter regulations, along with high fertiliser prices, are prompting a re-think about the use of manures on arable farms, with growers keen to get the most from the nutrients they contain while avoiding any leaching.

An important resource when used in the right way, manures do more than supply a range of crop nutrients, with their organic matter content also helping with soil health goals.

See also: How farm data integration could improve N use efficiency

""The nutrient value of these materials has more than doubled recently,"" says Lizzie Sagoo, soil scientist with Adas.

""Getting their worth in terms of crop nutrients and organic matter content has to be balanced with losses from nitrate leaching and ammonia emissions.""

Nitrate leaching tends to be higher when applications are made during the autumn and early winter – when crops aren't growing and rainfall is higher following application - so the shift away from the autumn spreading of solid manures is expected to gather momentum.

Farmers Weekly has spoken to two growers who are making spring spreading in standing crops work.

Richard Suddes, Lanchester, County Durham

County Durham farmer Richard Suddes has applied both chicken muck and half-rotted cattle manure over the top of his standing arable crops in the spring for the past six years, without any difficulties or adverse effects.

As a result, some of his feed wheats only required as little as 55kg/ha of artificial nitrogen last year, having received most of their nutrient requirement from a well-timed application of solid manure.

Being able to spread it tramline-to-tramline in wheat, to a width of almost 48m in a fine spread, means that the wheat plants can grow around it unhindered, while both crop and soil health benefit from applications.

Reducing fertiliser use

For Mr Suddes, who was named Soil Farmer of the Year in 2017 and is a member of the Green Farm Collective, the practice means that bagged fertiliser use continues to come down, while the farm's hungry glacial till soils are being improved.

""We're getting the benefit of the nutrients, when they're most needed by the crops, and preventing the leaching losses that can occur from autumn and winter spreading,"" he says.

Given current inflationary pressures, appropriate and accurate spreading of farmyard manure in the spring is also helping to peg his costs of production, while making good use of a resource already on the farm and smoothing out workloads.  

Soil health is much better, with earthworm activity and soil biology on the up, helped by the farm's very diverse rotation and no-till approach.

Soil organic matter levels have risen over the years, with cattle manure continuing to be targeted at fields in most need.

Applications are generally made in March, just as soils are starting to warm up, when both worms and soil fungi are more active, so the manures disappear quickly, he explains.

""The worms get to work on it almost immediately,"" he says. ""They pull it into the soil profile, so we let them do the hard graft.""  

Having switched to direct-drilling in 2009, he is overseeing an integrated system that prioritises soil health and biodiversity, while reducing the farm's reliance on synthetic inputs.

""I would expect to see crop damage if we were trying to put too much on,"" says Mr Suddes. ""Even when we first started, with our old 8m muck spreader, the wheat was undamaged by the spreading operation.""

Twin disc spreader

The purchase of a Richard Western twin disc spreader three years ago improved the practice and allowed him to spread it wider, going up to 48m in wheat.

In oilseed rape, he limits the spread to 24m, to protect the plants as they start to grow away in the spring.

""Having been no-till for 13 years, there's no problem with getting a 24t muckspreader up the tramlines,"" he points out. ""Our soils travel very well now.""

A free-range poultry enterprise on the farm provides 800t of chicken muck a year.

It is analysed before it is applied at a rate of 5t/ha across the board, so that Mr Suddes knows how much nutrient is being applied and can match and top-up supplies to the needs of the crop.

He points out that a theoretical, much higher 14t/ha application of chicken litter would provide 250kg of nitrogen, of which 30-50% is available, on normal soils.

""More research needs doing, but there is tremendous nutrient value in these materials. They are soil conditioners too.""

Having 280 head of beef cattle at South Farm means that he is also able to make use of half-rotted manure, leaving it for three to four months before spreading it at a rate of 10t/ha.

He finds it preferable to do this in the spring, as autumn workloads are already very high and there's a greater risk of leaching.

""Depending on the timing of application, the manure can also work as soil armour, helping to protect it.""

On one occasion, cattle muck was applied to a brome-infested winter barley crop just prior to T1, so that the weed population was partly smothered.

""It allowed the barley to grow away,"" he recalls. ""We were able to harvest it before the brome seeds were viable, so it helped with our weed control.""

Edwin Taylor, Shotley Bridge, Northumberland

Northumberland grower Edwin Taylor has found that spring manure applications made to winter wheat deliver far more gains than damage, as well as easing workloads.

Another long-term user of no-till, he has been applying well-rotted cattle muck and compost with a twin spinning disc spreader in the spring for some years, to both winter cereals and to spring oats as they are emerging.

""The system that we have in place allows us to do it,"" he explains. ""The ability to travel on this land has improved and the tramlines are well-established - they've been there for more than 12 years.""

Ground conditions are often better in the spring than the autumn, continues Mr Taylor. ""We make better use of their nutrient value at this timing, it fits in with our rotation and it allows us to get the spreading done.""

There's also far less risk of nitrate leaching and soil damage when it's drier, he points out. ""We always check the conditions before we go.""

The farm's northern location means that harvest is often late, leaving very little time to get the next crop established in optimum conditions. ""Spreading farmyard manure at this stage would hold us up even more.""

""Depending on the timing of application, the manure can also work as soil armour, helping to protect it.""

On one occasion, cattle muck was applied to a brome-infested winter barley crop just prior to T1, so that the weed population was partly smothered.

""It allowed the barley to grow away,"" he recalls. ""We were able to harvest it before the brome seeds were viable, so it helped with our weed control.""

Edwin Taylor, Shotley Bridge, Northumberland

Northumberland grower Edwin Taylor has found that spring manure applications made to winter wheat deliver far more gains than damage, as well as easing workloads.

Another long-term user of no-till, he has been applying well-rotted cattle muck and compost with a twin spinning disc spreader in the spring for some years, to both winter cereals and to spring oats as they are emerging.

""The system that we have in place allows us to do it,"" he explains. ""The ability to travel on this land has improved and the tramlines are well-established - they've been there for more than 12 years.""

Ground conditions are often better in the spring than the autumn, continues Mr Taylor. ""We make better use of their nutrient value at this timing, it fits in with our rotation and it allows us to get the spreading done.""

There's also far less risk of nitrate leaching and soil damage when it's drier, he points out. ""We always check the conditions before we go.""

The farm's northern location means that harvest is often late, leaving very little time to get the next crop established in optimum conditions. ""Spreading farmyard manure at this stage would hold us up even more.""

138,"","https://www.fwi.co.uk/arable/crop-management/nutrition-and-fertiliser/how-two-arable-farmers-apply-manure-to-standing-crops","How two arable farmers apply manure to standing crops

Applying manures to standing crops in the spring can help to reduce fertiliser costs, improve soil condition and minimise environmental losses.

Tighter regulations, along with high fertiliser prices, are prompting a re-think about the use of manures on arable farms, with growers keen to get the most from the nutrients they contain while avoiding any leaching.

An important resource when used in the right way, manures do more than supply a range of crop nutrients, with their organic matter content also helping with soil health goals.

""The nutrient value of these materials has more than doubled recently,"" says Lizzie Sagoo, soil scientist with Adas.

""Getting their worth in terms of crop nutrients and organic matter content has to be balanced with losses from nitrate leaching and ammonia emissions.""

Nitrate leaching tends to be higher when applications are made during the autumn and early winter – when crops aren't growing and rainfall is higher following application - so the shift away from the autumn spreading of solid manures is expected to gather momentum.

Farmers Weekly has spoken to two growers who are making spring spreading in standing crops work.

Richard Suddes, Lanchester, County Durham

County Durham farmer Richard Suddes has applied both chicken muck and half-rotted cattle manure over the top of his standing arable crops in the spring for the past six years, without any difficulties or adverse effects.

As a result, some of his feed wheats only required as little as 55kg/ha of artificial nitrogen last year, having received most of their nutrient requirement from a well-timed application of solid manure.

Being able to spread it tramline-to-tramline in wheat, to a width of almost 48m in a fine spread, means that the wheat plants can grow around it unhindered, while both crop and soil health benefit from applications.

Reducing fertiliser use

For Mr Suddes, who was named Soil Farmer of the Year in 2017 and is a member of the Green Farm Collective, the practice means that bagged fertiliser use continues to come down, while the farm's hungry glacial till soils are being improved.

""We're getting the benefit of the nutrients, when they're most needed by the crops, and preventing the leaching losses that can occur from autumn and winter spreading,"" he says.

Given current inflationary pressures, appropriate and accurate spreading of farmyard manure in the spring is also helping to peg his costs of production, while making good use of a resource already on the farm and smoothing out workloads.  

Soil health is much better, with earthworm activity and soil biology on the up, helped by the farm's very diverse rotation and no-till approach.

Soil organic matter levels have risen over the years, with cattle manure continuing to be targeted at fields in most need.

Applications are generally made in March, just as soils are starting to warm up, when both worms and soil fungi are more active, so the manures disappear quickly, he explains.

""The worms get to work on it almost immediately,"" he says. ""They pull it into the soil profile, so we let them do the hard graft.""  

Having switched to direct-drilling in 2009, he is overseeing an integrated system that prioritises soil health and biodiversity, while reducing the farm's reliance on synthetic inputs.

""I would expect to see crop damage if we were trying to put too much on,"" says Mr Suddes. ""Even when we first started, with our old 8m muck spreader, the wheat was undamaged by the spreading operation.""

Twin disc spreader

The purchase of a Richard Western twin disc spreader three years ago improved the practice and allowed him to spread it wider, going up to 48m in wheat.

In oilseed rape, he limits the spread to 24m, to protect the plants as they start to grow away in the spring.

""Having been no-till for 13 years, there's no problem with getting a 24t muckspreader up the tramlines,"" he points out. ""Our soils travel very well now.""

A free-range poultry enterprise on the farm provides 800t of chicken muck a year.

It is analysed before it is applied at a rate of 5t/ha across the board, so that Mr Suddes knows how much nutrient is being applied and can match and top-up supplies to the needs of the crop.

He points out that a theoretical, much higher 14t/ha application of chicken litter would provide 250kg of nitrogen, of which 30-50% is available, on normal soils.

""More research needs doing, but there is tremendous nutrient value in these materials. They are soil conditioners too.""

Having 280 head of beef cattle at South Farm means that he is also able to make use of half-rotted manure, leaving it for three to four months before spreading it at a rate of 10t/ha.

He finds it preferable to do this in the spring, as autumn workloads are already very high and there's a greater risk of leaching.

139,"FSA unveils streamlined approach to gene-edited crops","https://www.fwi.co.uk/arable/fsa-unveils-streamlined-approach-to-gene-edited-crops","FSA unveils streamlined approach to gene-edited crops

Plant breeders have welcomed proposals by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) for a new streamlined, science-led approach to regulating gene-edited crops in England.

An FSA board meeting on Wednesday 20 September discussed plans for the regulation of precision bred food and feed products under the Genetic Technology (Precision Breeding) Act 2023.

Until recently, it was believed the FSA was planning to require a separate risk assessment, expert committee scrutiny, public consultation, approval by both Houses of Parliament and secretary of state sign-off for every precision-bred product.

See also: Debate: Gene editing the pros and cons for farming

Mirroring the regulatory process already adopted in Canada, and the approach proposed by the EU Commission in July, the FSA is now recommending a move away from the lengthy regulated products process currently applied to GMOs, novel foods and irradiated foods.

Instead, it is seeking to adopt a more streamlined process for precision-bred organisms (PBOs), more proportionate to the scientific evidence of risk.

The FSA's proposals are due to be presented to parliament in summer 2024, and are scheduled to come into force at the end of next year.

The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Science and Technology in Agriculture said the FSA proposals could pave the way for England to take a leading position in the research, development and commercialisation of precision-bred products.

The British Society of Plant Breeders (BSPB), the representative body for the UK plant breeding industry, and crop science organisation Niab also welcomed the FSA's recommendations.

BSPB chairman Robin Wood said: ""By accelerating the development of improved crop varieties, more precise breeding technologies such as Crispr/Cas gene editing will help plant breeders keep pace with demands for increased agricultural productivity, resource-use efficiency, more durable pest and disease resistance, improved nutrition and resilience to climate change.""

Field trials

Niab said nine new field trials for gene-edited plants have been notified in England since simplified arrangements for research into gene-edited crops were introduced by the Westminster government last March.

These include trials of pod shatter-resistant oilseed rape, non-browning potatoes, omega-3-enriched camelina, tomatoes higher in provitamin B3 and low-asparagine wheat.

Niab chief executive Mario Caccamo said: ""England could genuinely be on course to become one of the best places globally to invest in agri-food research and innovation.""

Devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales have previously opposed the Precision Breeding Act, indicating their preference to remain aligned with the EU. Both administrations have remained tight-lipped over their plans since the EU's deregulatory proposals were published in July.

Differing views

However, anti-genetic engineering lobby group Beyond GM remains sceptical.

""Under the FSA's Tier 1 and Tier 2 proposals (see panel below), the vast majority of genetically modified precision bred organisms will pass into the food and feed system with no safety assessment, no monitoring, no labelling, no reliable traceability and no provisions for co-existence to protect non-GMO, organic, natural and artisanal producers and brands,” said the group’s director Pat Thomas.

“The presumption of safety and equivalence to traditionally-bred products does not reflect the science and the absence of enforcement measures means developers can easily scam the system.

“This is not what the public, farmers, food businesses or retailers want or deserve.""  

FSA two-tier system for regulation of gene-edited crops

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is proposing a two-tier system for the regulation of precision-bred organisms (PBOs) in England.

Tier 1 products are defined as very similar to traditionally bred products, which consumers are familiar with and for which potential safety risks are understood.

Tier 2 products are defined by the FSA as novel foods or PBOs with compositional changes that could affect toxicity or allergenicity, or other potential safety concerns. These would be subject to case-by-case risk assessment.

The FSA is an independent food safety watchdog that was set up by the government in 2000 to protect the public's health and consumer interests, working across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

140,"Why Dyson Farming is trialling different cover crops","https://www.fwi.co.uk/arable/land-preparation/cover-crops/why-dyson-farming-is-trialling-different-cover-crops","Why Dyson Farming is trialling different cover crops

Cover crops are a key part of Dyson Farming's commitment to improve soil health and transition towards a regenerative approach on its 14,000ha of farmland spread across Lincolnshire, Gloucestershire, and Berkshire.

But like many, the business feels it can still tweak how they are integrated into its rotation, which is why, in conjunction with Anglian Water and Boston Seeds, it is running a field-scale, large-plot trial of multiple different cover crop types, varieties and mixtures in Lincolnshire.

See also: How to achieve the most effective cover crop destruction

The business is attempting to reduce cultivations, where possible, across its rotation, which includes potatoes, sugar beet, peas, wheat, barley, maize, and rye for anaerobic digestion.

""As part of reducing cultivations we need something in its place to help structure soils,"" says Tom Storr, research agronomist for Dyson Farming.

Useful aid

Cover crops will never be the complete answer for compaction caused by heavy machinery, but they're a more than useful aid, he says.

Across the business, catch crops are planted after oilseed rape and vining peas before autumn-sown wheat, and overwintered cover crops grown before spring crops, such as potatoes, sugar beet, spring barley and maize.

But changes in the rotation and some emerging threats mean the business may need to change some of its cover crop practices.

""With high nitrogen prices, increasing legumes in the rotation could be beneficial, but we don't know what impact that would have on our vining peas, while we're not using covers before potatoes everywhere as we have one eye on wireworm.

""How can we mitigate that? The industry is starting to look at cover crops and think about what that species gives and what it doesn't, and what problems it might cause either through pests, disease or being difficult to drill through.""

The trial

The business would also like to understand better nutrient uptake and release, and the impact on following cash crops.

That led to the trial, which is comparing five different cereal cover crops, four clovers, four vetches, three mustards, three radishes and four mixtures.

All were drilled in early September in large plots of 12x80m using a Horsch Avatar demonstrator.

One half of the plot was drilled following cultivation with a Simba SLD, while the other half was direct-drilled into previous crop stubble.

An immediate observation from the trial is that the vetches are much more reliable than the clovers, which have mostly failed to establish to any degree.

Slug and other pest pressure might have contributed, although Dr Storr wonders too whether they didn't get the establishment spot on for the clovers and whether they would have benefited from rolling.

However, with cover crops commercially broadcast using a seed applicator on the autumn Simba SLD cultivator, he says the business needs robust cover crops that will grow in that system.

""We've also got the added pressure of SFI [Sustainable Farming Incentive] requirements requiring well-established green cover by December, and not wanting to waste seed,"" he says.

Establishment differences

Differences in establishment were also evident in some cover crop species between direct-drilled and cultivated, with generally the direct-drilled side establishing better with faster green canopy cover development, especially for brassicas and cereal cover crops.

""There was about 10% more moisture held in the no-till side when measured with a soil moisture probe to 5cm depth.

""Increasingly, if we get dry summers and autumns that moisture conservation will be important,"" Dr Storr says.

The cultivated side also became a little cloddy because it was so dry when cultivated, he notes, while there were large cracks to lose seed down, and less seed-to-soil contact, which may have contributed to poorer establishment.

Cover crop varieties

The trial is also comparing different varieties of the same cover crop species.

""There's a lot of understanding in a cash crop of what a specific variety brings. It would be nice to get to the same with cover crops - what are the differences and is there an agronomic benefit?""

Villiana hairy vetch © Mike Abram

In the trial, there was a clear difference in growth between some of the vetches, for example, with Bingo purple vetch much more vigorous than Villiana hairy vetch and Jose spring vetch.

Extra legumes in cover crop mixes offer potential mitigation to high nitrogen fertiliser prices by fixing some nitrogen for following cash crops.

Research in the UK is limited on how much and when that nitrogen might be available, Dr Storr notes.

Jose spring vetch © Mike Abram

""In the US, some clovers and vetches can fix up to 150kg/ha/year of N, but they're probably quite thick stands grown in warmer climates over a better growing window than our winter, so we likely have to take down our expectations.""

Nodules have formed on the vetches, he says. ""So they should be doing a small job at least.""

Soil nitrogen

In some of the covers and a fallow control, soil mineral nitrogen cores to 20cm depth are being taken with the help of Anglian Water on a monthly basis over winter to identify whether nitrogen is being removed from the soil by the cover, and later in spring to see whether it is released as the cover crop senesces to be available for the following cash crop.

""The aim is to understand when the nitrogen is returning to the soil to see whether it is possible to synchronise that with putting the next crop in.""

By comparing cereal covers, vetches, mustards, the Smart radish and a couple of mixtures, he hopes to get a feel for which might meet the goal of taking up nitrogen over winter to reduce the risk of leaching, and then slowly releasing it as the follow crop might need it, and whether tillage makes a difference.

""By the November sampling there had been a reduction of about 70-80% in soil nitrogen across the board, including the fallow where it has moved below the sampling depth, whereas hopefully in the covers it is in the plants.""

Yields will be taken from following maize crop to see which of the covers had a positive or negative impact, he concludes.

Current cover crops at Dyson Farming

Dyson Farming farm managers are using about 10 different multispecies cover crop mixes commercially, research agronomist Tom Storr says.

Some are bought as ready-made, off-the-shelf mixes, while others are put together by the farm managers, with cost potentially changing both the choice of species and also the percentage inclusion of a species.

Oats and vetch is a typical choice ahead of non-spring barley cash crops, such as sugar beet and maize.

""It's a simple, economical mix that we get good results from,"" Dr Storr says. ""It can be grazed, which helps turn the biomass into more nutrient-available material.""

Before spring barley, the mix tends to be based on linseed, vetch and phacelia.

Ideally, the farm would prefer to direct-drill spring barley into the cover crop residue, but Dr Storr says flexibility with cultivations are important, as is soil type and how much biomass or residue is left.

""With a variety of drills used across the farms, residue flow through them is an important consideration to ensure that it does not hinder the drilling operations.""

In some instances, large biomass cover and catch crops have caused problems with the speed and efficiency of the drilling operations.

""Choosing more upright species that are easier to drill into can help, and there's a lot you can do with cover crop seed rates to control the amount of biomass to help make direct-drilling possible,"" he suggests.

Termination timing is also key, although grazing with sheep can help manage excess biomass.

Cover crops are a key part of Dyson Farming's commitment to improve soil health and transition towards a regenerative approach on its 14,000ha of farmland spread across Lincolnshire, Gloucestershire, and Berkshire.

But like many, the business feels it can still tweak how they are integrated into its rotation, which is why, in conjunction with Anglian Water and Boston Seeds, it is running a field-scale, large-plot trial of multiple different cover crop types, varieties and mixtures in Lincolnshire.

The business is attempting to reduce cultivations, where possible, across its rotation, which includes potatoes, sugar beet, peas, wheat, barley, maize, and rye for anaerobic digestion.

""As part of reducing cultivations we need something in its place to help structure soils,"" says Tom Storr, research agronomist for Dyson Farming.

Useful aid

Cover crops will never be the complete answer for compaction caused by heavy machinery, but they're a more than useful aid, he says.

Across the business, catch crops are planted after oilseed rape and vining peas before autumn-sown wheat, and overwintered cover crops grown before spring crops, such as potatoes, sugar beet, spring barley and maize.

But changes in the rotation and some emerging threats mean the business may need to change some of its cover crop practices.

""With high nitrogen prices, increasing legumes in the rotation could be beneficial, but we don't know what impact that would have on our vining peas, while we're not using covers before potatoes everywhere as we have one eye on wireworm.

""How can we mitigate that? The industry is starting to look at cover crops and think about what that species gives and what it doesn't, and what problems it might cause either through pests, disease or being difficult to drill through.""

The trial

The business would also like to understand better nutrient uptake and release, and the impact on following cash crops.

That led to the trial, which is comparing five different cereal cover crops, four clovers, four vetches, three mustards, three radishes and four mixtures.

All were drilled in early September in large plots of 12x80m using a Horsch Avatar demonstrator.

One half of the plot was drilled following cultivation with a Simba SLD, while the other half was direct-drilled into previous crop stubble.

An immediate observation from the trial is that the vetches are much more reliable than the clovers, which have mostly failed to establish to any degree.

Slug and other pest pressure might have contributed, although Dr Storr wonders too whether they didn't get the establishment spot on for the clovers and whether they would have benefited from rolling.

However, with cover crops commercially broadcast using a seed applicator on the autumn Simba SLD cultivator, he says the business needs robust cover crops that will grow in that system.

""We've also got the added pressure of SFI [Sustainable Farming Incentive] requirements requiring well-established green cover by December, and not wanting to waste seed,"" he says.

Establishment differences

Differences in establishment were also evident in some cover crop species between direct-drilled and cultivated, with generally the direct-drilled side establishing better with faster green canopy cover development, especially for brassicas and cereal cover crops.

""There was about 10% more moisture held in the no-till side when measured with a soil moisture probe to 5cm depth.

""Increasingly, if we get dry summers and autumns that moisture conservation will be important,"" Dr Storr says.

The cultivated side also became a little cloddy because it was so dry when cultivated, he notes, while there were large cracks to lose seed down, and less seed-to-soil contact, which may have contributed to poorer establishment.

Cover crop varieties

The trial is also comparing different varieties of the same cover crop species.

""There's a lot of understanding in a cash crop of what a specific variety brings. It would be nice to get to the same with cover crops - what are the differences and is there an agronomic benefit?""

In the trial, there was a clear difference in growth between some of the vetches, for example, with Bingo purple vetch much more vigorous than Villiana hairy vetch and Jose spring vetch.

Extra legumes in cover crop mixes offer potential mitigation to high nitrogen fertiliser prices by fixing some nitrogen for following cash crops.

Research in the UK is limited on how much and when that nitrogen might be available, Dr Storr notes.

Jose spring vetch © Mike Abram

""In the US, some clovers and vetches can fix up to 150kg/ha/year of N, but they're probably quite thick stands grown in warmer climates over a better growing window than our winter, so we likely have to take down our expectations.""

Nodules have formed on the vetches, he says. ""So they should be doing a small job at least.""

Soil nitrogen

In some of the covers and a fallow control, soil mineral nitrogen cores to 20cm depth are being taken with the help of Anglian Water on a monthly basis over winter to identify whether nitrogen is being removed from the soil by the cover, and later in spring to see whether it is released as the cover crop senesces to be available for the following cash crop.

""The aim is to understand when the nitrogen is returning to the soil to see whether it is possible to synchronise that with putting the next crop in.""

By comparing cereal covers, vetches, mustards, the Smart radish and a couple of mixtures, he hopes to get a feel for which might meet the goal of taking up nitrogen over winter to reduce the risk of leaching, and then slowly releasing it as the follow crop might need it, and whether tillage makes a difference.

""By the November sampling there had been a reduction of about 70-80% in soil nitrogen across the board, including the fallow where it has moved below the sampling depth, whereas hopefully in the covers it is in the plants.""

Yields will be taken from following maize crop to see which of the covers had a positive or negative impact, he concludes.

Current cover crops at Dyson Farming

Dyson Farming farm managers are using about 10 different multispecies cover crop mixes commercially, research agronomist Tom Storr says.

Some are bought as ready-made, off-the-shelf mixes, while others are put together by the farm managers, with cost potentially changing both the choice of species and also the percentage inclusion of a species.

Oats and vetch is a typical choice ahead of non-spring barley cash crops, such as sugar beet and maize.

""It's a simple, economical mix that we get good results from,"" Dr Storr says. ""It can be grazed, which helps turn the biomass into more nutrient-available material.""

Before spring barley, the mix tends to be based on linseed, vetch and phacelia.

Ideally, the farm would prefer to direct-drill spring barley into the cover crop residue, but Dr Storr says flexibility with cultivations are important, as is soil type and how much biomass or residue is left.

""With a variety of drills used across the farms, residue flow through them is an important consideration to ensure that it does not hinder the drilling operations.""

In some instances, large biomass cover and catch crops have caused problems with the speed and efficiency of the drilling operations.

""Choosing more upright species that are easier to drill into can help, and there's a lot you can do with cover crop seed rates to control the amount of biomass to help make direct-drilling possible,"" he suggests.

Termination timing is also key, although grazing with sheep can help manage excess biomass.

142,"Are wetland crops the future on lowland peat?","https://www.fwi.co.uk/business/business-management/agricultural-transition/are-wetland-crops-the-future-on-lowland-peat","Are wetland crops the future on lowland peat?

England's lowland peat soils are some of the most valuable when it comes to food production, but they also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.

Draining peatland soils has allowed them to be used to grow a wide array of fresh vegetables, salads, grains, meat and dairy products over many centuries.

However, it has also led to an ongoing cycle of peat oxidation, soil degradation and subsidence.

This results in carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere and puts the long-term future of such soils under threat.

According to the recent Lowland Agricultural Peat Task Force Report - chaired by farmer and chairman of the Association of Drainage Authorities Robert Caudwell - greenhouse gas emissions from lowland agricultural peatlands account for about 3% of England's overall total emissions.

The taskforce report concludes that for climate change reasons and to ensure that our peat soils can continue to provide for future generations, farmers must be helped to transition to more sustainable management practices.

See also: How fenland farmers are cutting greenhouse gases from peat

What does the report recommend?

The report makes 14 recommendations to ensure lowland peat soils can be managed more sustainably.

Some of these can be delivered in the short term, while others will need further development over the mid- to long term.

Key to the future, it suggests, is retaining more water in lowland peat landscapes because this will slow the release of carbon.

However, it stresses this does not mean that water levels can, or should, be raised in all peatland settings. Nor is it advocating measures which will halt the productive use of the land.

""New measures for peat can only be deployed if farm businesses are to remain viable,"" it says, adding: ""No farmer on peat soil should be left financially worse off for better managing our carbon stores.""

Raising water levels on peatland would need to be done in a managed way to maintain the profitable use of the land, with social and economic considerations balanced against environmental ones, says the report.

""New ways of farming on peat must be practically and economically viable, and they must not drive food production overseas, nor increase emissions arising from food production.""

The report details how improving water-level management will require significant investment in water storage and control systems. Alongside changes in water levels is the need to embrace wetter modes of farming on peat.

So how can lowland peat be farmed more sustainably?

The task force recommends that Defra should use schemes such as the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) and Countryside Stewardship (CS) to incentivise management practices that would help farmers preserve peat and reduce emissions as part of their existing farming regimes.

Payments could be based on a sliding payment scale depending on the height to which the water table is restored and to account for differences in topography, soil and climate.

It suggests that CS could also be used as a vehicle to help pay for the capital infrastructure that will be needed to raise water levels.

Meanwhile, Peat Sensitive Farming Advisers (PSFAs) could be introduced to build trust and understanding in new wet farming techniques.

There is also an ambition for farmers, particularly those on marginal and low-lying farmland, to transition to a system called paludiculture.

Wetland farming site at Horsey © Broads Authority

What is paludiculture?

This is the name given to the growing of commercial crops on rewetted peat.

Eighty-eight native UK wetland species have been identified with potential for energy, food, fodder, medicinal use and raw material provision.

The two crops getting the most attention are typha (bulrush), which can be used to make insulation fibreboard, and farmed sphagnum moss, which has the potential to replace peat as a growing media.

Is it a commercial option now?

Not yet. A subgroup of the taskforce has set out a roadmap for making the wide-scale adoption of paludiculture a commercial reality in England over a 10-year timescale, starting this year.

However, the report's authors acknowledge that it is unlikely to be widely practised by 2033.

One of the priorities will be developing the business cases for different crop and product combinations, so farmers are reassured that switching to wetter forms of farming is financially viable.

This will involve establishing field-scale experimental trials for farmed spagnhum and typha within the next two or three years, so information can start to be collected about establishment methods, crop management, pests, diseases, labour requirements, how to harvest it and ultimately, the economics.

Along the way there will be practical challenges to address, such as whether existing machinery can be adapted to cope with the new crops and conditions.

Another crucial part of the jigsaw is establishing how farmers might be able to stack payments for the wider benefits of wetter farming, by selling nutrient neutrality, biodiversity net gain and carbon units from peatland.

Other crops that may be suitable for paludiculture

Reception for recommendations?

The NFU has welcomed recognition of the need to balance soil protection with sustainable food production, in addition to the taskforce's acknowledgement of the complexities of re-wetting of lowland peat to reduce emissions.

""We are pleased a range of mechanisms, from Environmental Land Management schemes through to technical advice and capital grants, will be made available to help improve lowland peatland management,"" said a spokesman.

However, it has stressed that it is crucial that farmers are included in any local decisions on lowland peat management, especially those that involve raising water levels.

The Country Land and Business Association says the report emphasises that a ""paradigm shift in farming on peat"" must occur, but it is clear there is not yet enough knowledge available for an immediate transition.

Meanwhile, Defra has agreed to all 14 of the taskforce's recommendations.

Case study one: Rindle wetter farming trial

Lancashire Wildlife Trust is leading the charge in terms of research on how to combine reductions in carbon emissions on lowland peat with financially viable food production.

The Trust started its paludiculture journey four years ago when it established the Winmarleigh carbon farm by rewetting 2ha of lowland peat and then planting sphagnum moss to start the process of re-vegetating the peat.

This led to an 86% drop in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the space of one winter, when compared with a neighbouring plot of grazed pasture.

While they found farmers were interested in the work, their feedback was that they were unlikely to get involved on their own farms because of the need to keep producing food and make a living.

The team is now trialling growing celery and blueberries using paludiculture techniques.

Mike Longden, senior project officer in Lancashire Wildlife Trust's Peatlands Team, says the celery trial is the first time that anyone in the UK has trialled farming traditional food crops on land with a higher water table.

Now in its second year, the team is experimenting with how the crop performs if the water table is kept at either 50cm, 30cm or 10cm below surface level.

Traditionally, the water table would be around 1m below surface level.

During the first year, no fertilisers or pesticides were used to enable the team to collect baseline data about GHG emissions.

This meant the crop just failed to reach the point of harvest.

However, this year the crop is being managed with similar inputs to those for a commercial crop on unwetted peat and, so far, is looking very promising.

""What we've tried to do is farm it as closely as possible to how a farmer would, including using the same machines,"" says Mike.

""The difference is our trial has the crop grown in either ""˜wet', ""˜wetter' and then ""˜completely wet' conditions, so we can identify the sweet spot where we get the best crop and the lowest greenhouse gas emissions.

""At the moment, we are thinking there might be a slight drop in yields, but are exploring how farmers might be compensated for this because of the carbon savings they would be making.""

The objective is to gather enough evidence to prove to farmers there is a business case to try growing crops in a different way, or experiment with new crops.

""There isn't a ""˜one answer fits all' - it has to be a mosaic of land uses, with the correct crops, in the correct field with the correct hydrology.

A trial crop of 800 blueberry plants was planted earlier this year, from which the team hopes to take a harvest in 2025.

Different species have been planted to see which perform best under wet conditions and they are also experimenting with growing sphagnum moss as a companion crop.

The team is also lead partner in a £400,000 research project funded through the government's Paludiculture Exploration Fund which will see a 5ha crop of typha (bulrush) planted next year.

Farmer Steve Denneny, who will be growing the crop, said: ""I'm excited to be part of this trial to find a new way to manage my land that is more environmentally friendly, but will also provide a commercially viable crop.""

Case study two: Reed trials in the Broads

Andrea Kelly © Broads Authority

The Broads Authority in Norfolk established its first wetland demonstration site in 2021 to see how crops suitable for paludiculture perform in a field setting.

The crops are being grown in a series of “compartments” located on the lowest parts of a 3ha field, which has been made available by the Horsey Estate.

The land was previously down to grass and is typical of the Broads landscape, where all the peatland remains under pasture.

Andrea Kelly, environment policy adviser for the Broads Authority, which is leading the trial, says the initial focus of the project has been on the production of reed, given that is a traditional feature of the Broads.

There are reed cutters already operating in the area and an established market for the end product, which is used as thatching material.

""We import about 97% of the reed we need for thatch, and it is estimated we need about 5,000ha of additional reed to satisfy demand from all the thatched properties in the UK,"" says Andrea.

""Imported reed comes from China and eastern Europe, the supply is less reliable than it has been and often it sweats in transit. Everyone who owns a thatched house will tell you they would much rather have local thatch.""

With minimal intervention, reed typically takes around three to four years to get to the point of harvest and from then on will produce an annual crop.

The other crops being trialled are more “futuristic”, as the end markets are less developed, but include typha, miscanthus and reed canary grass - the latter being a high-protein fodder crop or energy biomass, says Andrea.

The team has decided that sphagnum moss is probably not appropriate for large areas of the Broads because most of the land has never been ploughed and harvesting moss requires flat land.

To help explore markets for plant-based fibres, the Broads Peat Partnership (a partnership of stakeholders operating within the Broads Catchment and Norfolk Fens) has just been awarded £395,000 through the Paludiculture Exploration Fund for a Fibre Broads project.

This initiative will identify areas in the Broads most suited to wetland crops and explore the potential of crops such as typha to produce unbonded fibreboard, which can be used in the construction industry.

Other key projects

Fens

Fenland Soil has secured £450,000 through the Paludiculture Exploration Fund (PEF) to extend its existing landscape mapping work - identifying peatland suitable for change of land use to paludiculture - to four new Internal Drainage Boards (IDBs).

It will also be establishing a commercial-scale, paludiculture trial.

Meanwhile, the Peatland Progress project has secured support from the National Lottery Heritage Fund to support a five-year trial of wet farming techniques across 120ha in the Cambridgeshire Fens. This will be the first farm-scale trial in the UK.

Somerset Levels

Coates English Willow has been awarded money through the PEF to look at the potential of growing low-impact willow on the peat on West Sedgemoor.

The project will research and develop techniques for more efficient planting, lower herbicide use, and improved harvesting practices.

In addition, the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group Southwest has been given funding to explore different land use options which could provide an income stream for owners of the lowest-lying fields.

Rising demand for sustainable fibres and the ability of crops such as flax and hemp to capture carbon from the air could see their return in arable rotations, offering farmers an alternative income.

They are also attractive in being true break crops for cereals that do not need heavy chemical use.  

Farmers Weekly looks at two separate projects aimed at helping to re-establish fibre crops growing in the UK.

See also: Why Yorkshire farmers are growing miscanthus and hemp

Project 1: High carbon capture cropping

Growing demand for low-carbon natural fibres in construction, defence, aerospace and automotive manufacturing could see the revival of UK fibre crop growing, with the help of a £5.9m Defra-funded project.

Fibre crops, hemp and flax is one of the four cropping options being investigated by the Centre for High Carbon Capture Cropping (see “High carbon capture cropping”).

High carbon capture cropping

The Centre for High Carbon Capture Cropping (CHCx3) is a four-year, 22-partner project, led by Niab.

Its aim is to help UK farmers and growers target net zero and build farming resilience through diversifying their arable and forage cropping.

There are four cropping options being investigated:

Leading the crop genetic resource component of fibre crops, hemp and flax is Heather Oldfield, business development manager at Elsoms, who has spent time working in the natural fibre crop sector with the company.

Market potential

Heather believes there is huge potential for UK fibre growing and points out that Europe, which is the biggest flax grower in the world, has had its second poor harvest in a row, due to extreme weather.

In addition, the Netherlands, which is a big grower of the crop, is seeing increased pressure for land being taken from farming.

Therefore, manufacturers have increasingly been looking to the UK to potentially grow the crop.

Heather adds that there is a long history of fibre crop production, processing and manufacturing in the UK.  

Another attraction is the strong prices fueled by increased demand for fibre.

""Flax returns are the highest they have ever been, due to poor harvests in Europe and increased end user demand. Long fibre is trading at £1.90/kg.

Given a typical 6t/ha retted straw yield, she says there is potential for a good return.

But for growers to benefit from this market, work is needed to develop UK expertise, and this is where the four-year project comes in.

The aim is to identify the best varieties for the UK, look at crop agronomy and also link up the various parts of the supply chain.

Variety

At the heart of the work is the on-farm trials, and last year there were four sites. Each had a 10ha trial area containing replicated blocks of six flax varieties and five hemp varieties, resulting in the project's first harvest last summer.

Elsoms is working with researchers at the University of York, building on several years of expertise to improve crop variety traits to meet the needs of developing markets that are best suited to UK conditions.

With flax, Elsoms has a long-standing partnership with Dutch breeders Van De Bilt, and they are working together to identify those that may be suitable in the UK.

""The Netherlands is not that far from the UK and has similar conditions,"" says Heather.

Processing and testing

Hemp is being processed at East Yorkshire Hemp for uses in construction materials, insulation, mattresses, textiles, woven and non-woven composites, and low-carbon alternatives to products such as plasterboard.

All varieties will be kept separate throughout the processing to ensure products can be tested, and any differences noted.

SHD Composites, who are leading the way in Natural Fibre composite research and solutions, will perform a number of tests, including strength of woven fibres and suitability for end markets.

This will enable identification of varietal traits for more specific end uses. 

Agronomy and growing

Another part of the project is to develop expertise in growing the crops to enable growers to produce quality fibre.

For example, while hemp doesn't need tramlines as no inputs are needed, it does need a fine/level seed-bed.

Heather explains that an uneven seed-bed leads to uneven establishment. Ideally, the crops all need to be the same height for high-quality, consistent fibre yield.

Flax is more delicate than hemp and also needs good seed-beds. The aim is to produce a single stem on each plant, so requires careful management, weed control, and a high seed rate to avoid tillering.

Flax doesn't suffer much disease, but crops may need some weed control early on and farmers have to rely on Extensions of Authorisation for Minor Use, with flax being classed as linseed on the label.

However, some herbicides can affect fibre quality by checking growth. ""The aim is to produce flax stems 90-120cm in length.""

Therefore, the project is looking at herbicides to determine what chemicals farmers can and can't use to maximise fibre quality.

Harvesting and retting

This year, only one site was pulled and the rest were cut.

Heather explains that pulling is where the crop is pulled out of the ground using specialist equipment with about 5cm of the root still attached to the stem, leaving behind the fibrous roots.

Pulling results in longer fibres and the aim is to have more than 1m. Next year, we aim for all the flax trial sites to be pulled, she says.

The fibre is then turned with a special turner and baled with a special baler to retain longer fibres.

In contrast, hemp is cut with a cutter or drum mower and is turned and baled using conventional equipment.

Between cutting/pulling and baling, the fibre is retted, which takes about three to six weeks. This is the riskiest period for the crop, as it is open to the elements.

Early lessons

One lesson already learned was that any overwinter cover crop must be fully incorporated before fibre crop drilling. ""Fields need to be cultivated to get the good seed-beds that the crops need.""

Another was the importance of drill timing for flax. The threat of flax beetle means the crop needs to be drilled when its cooler - ideally, end of March/early April.

However, delays in securing the Home Office licence for the hemp crop meant both crops were drilled in early May.

While flax beetle was not a problem last spring, it did mean it was getting a bit late baling the fibre, increasing the risk of the weather turning during the retting process.

""We just about got away with it this season and it has sharpened our minds for future years.""

But overall, she is really pleased with how the crops grew.

""Hemp reached 3.2m high and flax at 1.2m meant we managed to hit the European gold standard for both crops.""

Future

The project is ongoing and next year will see it expand to six sites. Another key piece of work is generating the carbon footprint data for end users, backing up the green credentials of natural fibres.

""Ultimately, our aim is to create a viable supply chain and demand so growers have the confidence to grow fibre crops.

In turn, end users will have the confidence that contracts will be fulfilled with the required quality.""

Green markets

The construction, aerospace and car manufacturing industries are all looking at their environmental credentials and have net-zero targets to meet.

One way to cut carbon is to incorporate natural fibres in their products, having a much smaller footprint than carbon fibre from oil.

Heather Oldfield points to F1 racing as an example, as teams now have to use 15% sustainable materials in making the cars.

The front wings are currently made from carbon fibre, but they shatter into very small pieces during collisions, resulting in races being halted.

If they incorporate flax fibre into the panel, they find they flex and bend more, breaking into bigger chunks.

Ford is also looking at using natural fibres in its new electric vans.

Batteries make them heavy and the manufacturer plans to use natural fibre panels to reduce weight, so that it can increase van capacity.

Project 2: Ancient craft of linen production

A group of Scottish farmers are collaborating with weavers and textile makers to revive the ancient craft of linen production in Scotland.

Flax was grown across Scotland for many centuries for textile and linen mills until cheaper, imported textiles became popular in the 1900s.

Innovative Farmers is leading a field lab to find new varieties and rediscover lost knowledge on linen fibre crop production.

It hopes to demonstrate the crop as an option for nature-friendly rotations that could meet a growing demand for sustainable textiles.

More plots

Farming consultant and field lab co-ordinator Colleen McCulloch explains that this summer they had three trial farms with small plots and the aim is to double this to six sites next year.

This year, they trialled three varieties - Avian, Delta and Tango - bred in Holland, and next year she hopes to include varieties from other parts of the world with a similar climate.

While the James Hutton Institute is analysing the results, she says initial observations from the harvest are that all three varieties broadly did well.

However, one appears to have performed less well than the other two, growing consistently shorter and less dense across all three sites. 

Also weed pressures had a noticeable effect on crop yield. In plots with heavy weed pressure, crop density and height were lower than weed-free plots.

She also noted that plots which previously received compost produced taller and thicker plants.

Exchange knowledge

In addition to the trials, Innovative Farmers is working with small companies and organisations to exchange knowledge and establish the supply chain to process flax into yarn.

It is also looking into larger volume markets such as sustainable insulation.

The core organisations involved in the Innovative Farmers project are the James Hutton Institute and the Edinburgh College of Art.

However, since starting, the network has grown and the organisations involved include:

""We hope that by working together we can develop a sustainable Scottish textile industry,"" she says.

Rising demand for sustainable fibres and the ability of crops such as flax and hemp to capture carbon from the air could see their return in arable rotations, offering farmers an alternative income.

They are also attractive in being true break crops for cereals that do not need heavy chemical use.  

Farmers Weekly looks at two separate projects aimed at helping to re-establish fibre crops growing in the UK.

Project 1: High carbon capture cropping

Growing demand for low-carbon natural fibres in construction, defence, aerospace and automotive manufacturing could see the revival of UK fibre crop growing, with the help of a £5.9m Defra-funded project.

Fibre crops, hemp and flax is one of the four cropping options being investigated by the Centre for High Carbon Capture Cropping (see “High carbon capture cropping”).

High carbon capture cropping

The Centre for High Carbon Capture Cropping (CHCx3) is a four-year, 22-partner project, led by Niab.

Its aim is to help UK farmers and growers target net zero and build farming resilience through diversifying their arable and forage cropping.

There are four cropping options being investigated:

Leading the crop genetic resource component of fibre crops, hemp and flax is Heather Oldfield, business development manager at Elsoms, who has spent time working in the natural fibre crop sector with the company.

Market potential

Heather believes there is huge potential for UK fibre growing and points out that Europe, which is the biggest flax grower in the world, has had its second poor harvest in a row, due to extreme weather.

In addition, the Netherlands, which is a big grower of the crop, is seeing increased pressure for land being taken from farming.

Therefore, manufacturers have increasingly been looking to the UK to potentially grow the crop.

Heather adds that there is a long history of fibre crop production, processing and manufacturing in the UK.  

Another attraction is the strong prices fueled by increased demand for fibre.

""Flax returns are the highest they have ever been, due to poor harvests in Europe and increased end user demand. Long fibre is trading at £1.90/kg.

Given a typical 6t/ha retted straw yield, she says there is potential for a good return.

But for growers to benefit from this market, work is needed to develop UK expertise, and this is where the four-year project comes in.

The aim is to identify the best varieties for the UK, look at crop agronomy and also link up the various parts of the supply chain.

Variety

At the heart of the work is the on-farm trials, and last year there were four sites. Each had a 10ha trial area containing replicated blocks of six flax varieties and five hemp varieties, resulting in the project's first harvest last summer.

Elsoms is working with researchers at the University of York, building on several years of expertise to improve crop variety traits to meet the needs of developing markets that are best suited to UK conditions.

With flax, Elsoms has a long-standing partnership with Dutch breeders Van De Bilt, and they are working together to identify those that may be suitable in the UK.

""The Netherlands is not that far from the UK and has similar conditions,"" says Heather.

Processing and testing

Hemp is being processed at East Yorkshire Hemp for uses in construction materials, insulation, mattresses, textiles, woven and non-woven composites, and low-carbon alternatives to products such as plasterboard.

All varieties will be kept separate throughout the processing to ensure products can be tested, and any differences noted.

SHD Composites, who are leading the way in Natural Fibre composite research and solutions, will perform a number of tests, including strength of woven fibres and suitability for end markets.

This will enable identification of varietal traits for more specific end uses. 

Agronomy and growing

Another part of the project is to develop expertise in growing the crops to enable growers to produce quality fibre.

For example, while hemp doesn't need tramlines as no inputs are needed, it does need a fine/level seed-bed.

Heather explains that an uneven seed-bed leads to uneven establishment. Ideally, the crops all need to be the same height for high-quality, consistent fibre yield.

New farming entrants Nikki and James Yoxall take a tough line when selecting replacements for their steadily growing herd of beef cattle.

Faced with more frequent extremes in weather brought on by climate change, and with limited resources, they say their system must be ""super-low input"" and resilient to make money.

See also: How three breeders market their bulls

The Yoxalls began their farming journey five years ago when they moved to Howemill, a small farm in the Deveron valley in Aberdeenshire, with two heifers.

Rather than buying in more stock to build up their herd, they are breeding replacements based on a tough set of selection criteria.

""This early in the system, it's about the cow,"" says Mrs Yoxall. ""As new entrants, we don't have lots of capital to throw at animals, machinery, sheds and so on.

""We need the animals to do the heavy lifting. Also, as we don't have long-term access to land, we need animals that can cope with being moved [from one site to another].""

Farm facts: Howemill, Glass, Aberdeenshire

Selection pressure

To remain in their herd, a cow must get pregnant, hold the pregnancy, suckle her calf, hold body condition, get back in calf, have good feet and not suffer from mastitis.

""We're asking a hell of a lot, but our whole approach is to develop strong genetic resilience, because [climate change means] extreme conditions are becoming more frequent,"" she says.

Nikki and James Yoxall © MAG/Judith Tooth

""If you prop up animals when they're struggling - put them in a shed, give them supplements and so on - rather than addressing the root cause, it becomes really expensive.

""Our cattle have to perform off what is available. So, for example, we don't reseed pastures.

""We're trying to improve soil diversity via [species-rich] hay bales, so we're tweaking things, but we don't do any ploughing. It's a nuanced and sympathetic approach to land management.""

With cows, calves and in-calf heifers, the predominantly Shetland herd is now 28-strong.

Originally a crofting breed, Shetlands are small, very hardy, maternal, have a good temperament and are locally appropriate, say the Yoxalls.

However, they are now switching from a Shetland to an Angus bull to introduce hybrid vigour into future replacements and act as a terminal sire.

Grazing benefits

Prompted by neighbours looking for additional grazing, they set up Grampian Grazing, looking after other people's stock at Howemill and on other land including the nearby 349ha (862-acre) Beldorney estate, owned by Highlands Rewilding.

Regenerative food production is an integral part of this estate's plans, with cattle used to improve soil health and diversity as well as producing beef.

The Yoxalls' herd spent the winter here on land cut for hay last summer.

Two-thirds of the bales were left where they came off the baler, while the remaining third was replaced with species-rich hay from a local RSPB reserve. The hay was fed along with deferred grazing, as needed.

""The hay keeps the cattle warm by firing up the rumen on a cold day and optimising rumen function to use fibre and protein - and the protein doesn't go through them too quickly,"" says Mrs Yoxall.

The herd moved off the winter routine in early April to spend two weeks grazing 0.6ha (1.5 acres) a day before moving to the calving paddocks.

The six-week block of calving begins in early May. Most fields are grazed a maximum of three times a year, with some grazed just once for conservation reasons.

""Our whole way of working is to increase diversity and abundance in the landscape using adaptive grazing and a holistic management framework for decision-making,"" she says. This approach to grazing management also considers ecological, economic and social factors.

""We carry out dung scores, forage analysis and mobility monitoring. We will treat individuals, but overall, we want a strong and resilient herd. So far, it's worked as we'd hoped. But we are right at the start of our journey.""

Local demand

Finishing target is about 300kg deadweight at 26-27 months; older than 30 months significantly impacts profitability.

Their beef is only supplied locally, to reduce food miles and serve the local community. Any interest from potential customers further afield is redirected to producers local to them.

""There's no point in competing: many more opportunities come from collaboration than from competition,"" argues Mrs Yoxall.

In a bid to connect with more local people, the Yoxalls have recently restored a mobile catering unit with funding from Scotland Food and Drink.

Mr Yoxall says: ""Food access is really important [to us] - many people in our community wouldn't [normally] buy our produce, but would come out and buy a burger.""

New projects

The current setup does not pay a full-time salary, but neither is it a full-time job.

""It's profitable for the hours we put in, and we don't claim any subsidy,"" says Mrs Yoxall, who also works part-time as head of research at the Pasture-Fed Livestock Association.

Mr Yoxall, formerly a classic car mechanic, studied agriculture at Scotland's Rural College Aberdeen campus and works part-time as head of regenerative agriculture at Highlands Rewilding.

""Our aim is to increase herd size and become closer to full-time,"" says Mrs Yoxall.

""We wouldn't do this if it didn't make financial sense - that's part of [our] holistic management [approach].

""With more beef boxes, we can sell beef more frequently to the same customer bases, and supply to more restaurants.""

They have recently expanded their operations with a share-farming agreement on a neighbouring 40ha (100-acre) farm.

For this venture, producing 100% pasture-fed breeding stock for sale, the neighbour is providing the land, the two parties share the cattle, and the Yoxalls are supplying most of the labour, expertise and handling equipment.

The first six pedigree Angus cows arrived in February and calved in March.

""They've come from systems that don't provide too many crutches - ideally outwintered, not too routinely medicated, and grass-fed as far as possible,"" says Mrs Yoxall.

""We will apply the same selection pressure to this new herd - we need more people breeding animals that thrive in low-input systems.""

They are among six farmers taking part in an Innovative Farmers field lab testing the impact on soil health and forage quality of bale grazing.

For the next four years, the farms will take soil samples in summer after the ground has recovered from winter grazing to look for changes in soil carbon, nitrogen, potash, phosphate and electrical conductivity [a measure of salt content], and carry out forage analyses.

The aim is to find out if bale grazing has benefits beyond not having to house stock over winter.

151,"How to group calves for successful social rearing","https://www.fwi.co.uk/livestock/how-to-group-calves-for-successful-social-rearing","How to group calves for successful social rearing

To successfully rear calves in pairs or groups, use benchmarks to select for calf health: below 3% mortality and less than 5% of calves with poor transfer of passive immunity.

Then pair/group calves before they are 14 days old, with an age range of no more than 14 days - preferably just seven.

This is the advice of Dr Jennifer Van Os, assistant professor in the department of animal and dairy sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

See also: Calves fed more milk make resilient cows

She says while research shows the benefits in liveweight gain and cognitive flexibility in heifers reared socially, health outcomes are not as clear-cut.

However, 72% of surveyed farmers rearing in pairs/groups were satisfied with calf health.

Health is one of the key concerns for farmers and vets when considering a switch from individual to group housing.

In fact, calf hutches were originally developed in the 1960s to counteract high levels of disease and death.

Solo housing remains the norm in the US, with 77% of surveyed farms still rearing in single hutches, says Jennifer.

""Farmers say they can control and monitor what calves are eating and health issues.

""Physical separation decreases disease risks, and calves are easier to handle for vaccinating and disbudding.

""There used to be a rational reason to quarantine calves, but things change, and the pendulum has swung,"" she adds.

Social housing is not only more acceptable to the general public, but also important for calf welfare.

Cattle are herd animals and highly motivated by social contact.

It stimulates play behaviour, and calves learn appropriate social interaction and have more resilience to stress at weaning.

The result is a more adaptable and less neophobic heifer.

""This means they have a good learning ability and can adapt to change: new housing, feed, social groups - and they can learn to go into a parlour on both sides.

""Calves have greater solid feed intakes, higher weight gains and average daily gains, and it can protect against cold stress.

""To date, no study has shown that individually reared calves outperform pairs or groups.""

Challenges of switching to group housing

There are challenges to switching over, not least the cost of supplying the right housing system for groups, group size, and whether to feed manually or automatically.

However, the biggest barrier, Jennifer finds, is the unwanted behaviour of cross-sucking other calves.

""This was reported by 85% of producers who pair/group, and there is a spike in cross-sucking during weaning.

""One study said it was not associated with navel infection before weaning, or mastitis and cell counts later in first lactation.

""But there are strategies to reduce cross-sucking: feed enough milk and provide the opportunity to suckle on a teat,"" says Jennifer.

A slow-flow teat, and allowing calves to suckle for a further 20 minutes after their milk bucket is empty, satisfies the natural urge to suck, as does sufficient milk volume, which leads to satiation.

However, a group of calves can sometimes result in worse respiratory outcomes, and group size is a risk factor.

""The same principles apply for good health whether in groups or alone, such as colostrum protocol, hygiene and biosecurity, good ventilation and all-in/all-out group formation.

""Individual housing isn't the only way to keep calves healthy,"" she says, adding that some farms may need to adjust management practices before transitioning from individual housing.

""Be careful about putting two single hutches side by side and getting calves to share a bigger pen, as both calves will squash into one hutch.

""This is a low-entry option, however, and gives you a chance to try it out. Then think of longer-term investment.""

Dr Jennifer Van Os was speaking at the TotalDairy conference (6-7 November, Stratford-upon-Avon).

Greater collaboration from all stakeholders in the industry is key to achieving TB-free status.

This was the message from a packed room of delegates at the National TB Conference last week (29 November).

Sarah Tomlinson, Kingshay veterinary consultant and TB Advisory Service technical director, said the biggest barrier to TB control was the ""them and us"" mentality when it came government, vets, and farmers.

See also: 4 farmers' badger-proofing inventions help cut TB risk

""We share a common goal: working towards a TB-free future. We need legislation to protect disease status and allow [farmers] to trade, but we also need to give vets and farmers choices to allow them to manage TB in line with their business goals.""

Defra's Ele Brown echoed this sentiment, adding: ""The common enemy is the bacteria, none of us in this room.""

Progress

TB is now at its lowest level in England in 15 years. Sarah said: ""I believe the reduction in the badger density, through the hard work of the farmers and local vets and everyone working together, has had a massive impact on that.""

Lord Richard Benyon, Defra minister until the recent cabinet reshuffle, could not attend the conference but wrote a speech, which was read out by Ele.

He called TB a tragedy for British farming and reaffirmed the government's commitment to badger culling.

""Where evidence supports culling, we will continue to take that course,"" he said.

Challenges

Despite the progress in England, Sarah said thousands of new breakdowns were occurring in high risk areas (HRAs) annually and said more work was needed to stop this, including more sensitive testing.

She also urged the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha) to develop better communication lines with independent vets.

This would give farmers and their vets access to data to help them manage TB as they do other infectious diseases.

She described how farmers blighted by TB were unable to engage in positive steps towards reducing endemic disease or improving their farm's carbon footprint.

""Farmers are too busy fire-fighting TB to have the physical and mental energy to do anything else - that's what TB does.""

Next steps - collaboration and vaccination

Dr Ruth Little, social researcher at Defra, said collaboration between policymakers and those affected by TB was key to overcoming “fatalism” - whereby farmers feel they have no control over the disease.

She said there had been a “step change” at Defra and a realisation that working together with other stakeholders, and making sure farmers can feed back how proposals will affect their businesses, result in better outcomes.

One of these outcomes has been the setting up of the Core Group, comprising Defra, Apha and Welsh and Scottish governments, along with the British Cattle Veterinary Association, British Veterinary Association, NFU, researchers, scientists, and farmers.

The biggest breakthrough on the horizon is cattle vaccination, with 600 cattle on UK farms taking part in the second phase of a vaccination trial.

Half of the animals have been vaccinated and the remaining left unvaccinated.

Scientists will assess the safety of the vaccine alongside the efficacy of the Diva skin test, which it is hoped will be able to differentiate between vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals, unlike the skin test.

If the trials are successful, the vaccine will then need Veterinary Medicines Directorate approval, and new trading laws will need to be negotiated for vaccinated animals before farmers can start using it.

Prof James Wood, from the bTB Partnership, said experiments in Ethiopia, partly funded by the UK government, had showed that vaccinated cattle exhibited a 60% reduction in TB lesions.

In the UK, disease transmission is lower than Ethiopia, so it is hoped UK farms might see higher levels of efficacy like those reported in New Zealand, where efficacy was 86%.

Most importantly, James said Ethiopian studies showed there was a reduction in the transmission of disease where animals had been vaccinated.

He described the vaccine as ""imperfect"", but said it could be an important part of the toolbox in HRAs.

""What's important is that we don't let perfect be the enemy of the good. We can still make progress, even if it is not perfect.""

France's agriculture ministry has announced plans to invest â‚¬200m (£178m) in its fruit and veg sector, to strengthen its productive capacity.

The French government says the sector is a ""pillar of its food sovereignty"" and the investment is part of its action to adapt to climate change and the agro-ecological transition.

France says only half of its fruit and vegetables are grown locally, and it wants to ""support investment in production and encourage the consumption of these products"".

See also: UK growers call for urgent government action on horticulture

Over the next seven years, the government will inject â‚¬200m into the sector to make crop production more efficient.

The money will be spent on new agricultural equipment and robots, modernising glasshouses, research, development and innovation.

Agriculture minister Marc Fesneau said: ""It is imperative to produce more and better, to meet the needs and expectations of French consumers and the effects of climate change.""

In the UK, against the backdrop of supermarket shelves empty of fruit and vegetables, the NFU this week published a horticulture growth strategy, which, if backed by the government, could minimise future supply chain disruption and deliver long-term growth.

NFU Horticulture and Potatoes Board chairman Martin Emmett warned: ""For too long, we've only had warm words from government about how important the horticulture sector is, but no detail on how it wants to achieve growth.""

Defra agreed that the domestic horticulture sector was crucial to the resilience of the nation’s food system and an important part of the wider economy.

""Our new farming schemes will support farmers to produce food profitably and sustainably, including £600m in grants for equipment to help farmers become more productive,"" a spokesman said.

Biologicals will make up 25% of the overall crop protection market by 2035, growing by more than three times to a value of $30bn (£24bn), predicts Dr John Wiles, global biology leader with Corteva Agriscience.

Currently, the global figure stands at $9bn (£7.3bn), but the combined drivers of sustainable production, legislation, new modes of action and better efficacy will see that pace of change accelerate.

""They won't necessarily replace synthetic chemicals, which will be required for the foreseeable future, but they will increasingly be adopted as complementary solutions,"" he predicts.

See also: Biopesticides ""˜as good as pesticides' to protect wheat

Derek Oliphant of AgbioInvestor agrees and points out that the market is moving forward rapidly, helped by political initiatives such as the European Green Deal, the UK's National Action Plan for Sustainable Pesticide Use, and Japan's Green Food System, to name a few.

""New market growth will all come from biopesticides,"" he says. ""It's being driven by regulation, as well as the lack of alternatives.""

The biopesticides market achieved 15% growth in 2022, with products seen as environmentally safe and having low toxicity.

""Concerns about plant extracts and microbials are around stability and shelf-life, not residues or ecosystem collapse.""

There is no doubt that alternative products have a role in integrated control systems and have shown to be effective, especially when their use is knowledge-based, says Professor Neil Havis of Scotland's Rural College (SRUC).

He cites elicitors - agents or compounds that can induce plant resistance - as a good example.

""They either mimic the action of natural elicitors or mimic signals,"" he says.

""Laminarin, which is derived from seaweed, is just one such product - it elicits a response and has anti-fungal activity. It is approved for use in wheat already and should get other crops soon.""

Is there a place for mechanical weeding in winter wheat?

Resistance, regulation and public pressure surrounding herbicide use means that alternative in-crop tools such as mechanical weeding are relevant, says Niab research agronomist Will Smith.

""There are a number of ways to mechanically remove and bury weeds, from pre-sowing cultivations to weed harrowing and inter-row cultivation,"" he says.

Inter-row cultivation allows more aggressive cultivation and removes established weeds, so is often carried out in the spring, he explains. As it is spatially selective, crop damage is minimised.

Niab work across four sites using the technique shows that it adds consistency to overall blackgrass control, but that herbicide activity remains important to the end results.

""On its own, it gave 20-25% control of grassweeds, whereas herbicides alone gave an average of 75% control,"" reveals Will.

""Those results hide a great deal of variation - in one year, just 5% control was achieved from a £130/ha herbicide programme.

""Combining the two control methods resulted in a small uplift of 10-20%, depending on the season.""

That has led Will to the conclusion that herbicides should be used to do the heavy lifting at the pre-emergence stage, with mechanical weeding used to follow up in the spring.

""We know that most herbicides struggle against blackgrass in the spring, so that's the time for alternatives.

""Of course, there are unsuitable conditions for hoeing - if you go too early, it can result in root movement and cutting in the crop.""

The cost of inter-row hoeing is about £10/ha/pass, reveals Will, and there's often a small yield reduction of about 10%.

""A combined system can end up being slightly more expensive at £150/ha, when you factor in the cost of the machine and the labour, but much will depend on the weed pressure.""

His view is that inter-row weeding is one of the solutions that can help farmers hit environmental targets. ""It's about finding the right niche for it and perfecting the technique for grassweed control,"" concludes Will.

Trials at SRUC reveal elicitors perform best when combined in programmes with fungicides, allowing fungicide rates to be reduced.

A spring barley trial gave a 0.9t/ha yield benefit from a programme based on an elicitor and reduced fungicide, which cost £39/ha - some £12/ha less than a full fungicide programme.

""There are still things to learn about products like this, including application timing, length of resistance, optimum formulation and compatibility,"" says Neil.

Biocontrol is another area of interest, he notes. ""This uses naturally occurring micro-organisms, such as bacteria and fungi, to reduce the inoculum or disease caused by a pathogen.""

They work by parasitism and predation of one organism by another, or by antibiotics that are harmful to target pathogens.

They may also provide cross-protection or growth stimulation, he explains.

""Getting the best from any of these innovations comes from using them in a holistic approach.""

What's happening in Europe?

Strong social and political pressure in Europe to reduce pesticide use has seen the introduction of the EU's Farm to Fork strategy, which has a target of reducing pesticide use by 50% by 2030.

At the current rate of change, that overall target is expected to be hit, although countries are progressing at different rates - France and Italy are on course, but Germany is behind.

In France, researcher Dr Nicolas Munier-Jolain of Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (Inrae) is running the DEPHY network of demonstration farms, which was set up in 2010 and involves 3,000 farmers from all cropping sectors - arable, vineyards, orchards, vegetables, ornamentals and tropical crops.

Tasked with reducing pesticide use, these farms are being supported to adopt integrated pest management (IPM) and share their knowledge, with the onus being on individual farms to find solutions that suit their circumstances.

The results have been encouraging, with applications to arable crops coming down by an average of 26%. ""This figure hides wide variability across farms, but progress is being made.""

The consequences for productivity and profit have also been investigated, continues Nicolas.

""We've seen that using less pesticide has given a slightly lower yield - due to techniques such as delayed drilling, variety choice and less nitrogen - but the resulting fall in costs mean that profits are up.""

Among the most pioneering farmers, pesticides use is down by 40% and productivity is up by 6%, but that has also led to changes in what's being grown.

""There are less cereals produced but more legumes and grasses.""  

The farm context, the management practices used and better decision-making have all been identified as key factors in reducing pesticide use, he adds.

Pesticide reductions in France

Another project, IPMworks, is a European network of demonstration farms, used to monitor how integrated pest management (IPM) is being adopted and how well it is working.

Again, farmers exchange their knowledge, explains Nicolas, with groups of 10-15 farmers all being supported by an adviser. ""This is all about cost-effective IPM strategies.""

All of the article contributors were speaking to Farmers Weekly at this year's British Crop Production Council congress ""Shaping the Future of Crop Protection"", which was held in Harrogate in early November.

Niab work across four sites using the technique shows that it adds consistency to overall blackgrass control, but that herbicide activity remains important to the end results.

""On its own, it gave 20-25% control of grassweeds, whereas herbicides alone gave an average of 75% control,"" reveals Will.

""Those results hide a great deal of variation - in one year, just 5% control was achieved from a £130/ha herbicide programme.

""Combining the two control methods resulted in a small uplift of 10-20%, depending on the season.""

That has led Will to the conclusion that herbicides should be used to do the heavy lifting at the pre-emergence stage, with mechanical weeding used to follow up in the spring.

""We know that most herbicides struggle against blackgrass in the spring, so that's the time for alternatives.

""Of course, there are unsuitable conditions for hoeing - if you go too early, it can result in root movement and cutting in the crop.""

The cost of inter-row hoeing is about £10/ha/pass, reveals Will, and there's often a small yield reduction of about 10%.

""A combined system can end up being slightly more expensive at £150/ha, when you factor in the cost of the machine and the labour, but much will depend on the weed pressure.""

His view is that inter-row weeding is one of the solutions that can help farmers hit environmental targets. ""It's about finding the right niche for it and perfecting the technique for grassweed control,"" concludes Will.

Trials at SRUC reveal elicitors perform best when combined in programmes with fungicides, allowing fungicide rates to be reduced.

A spring barley trial gave a 0.9t/ha yield benefit from a programme based on an elicitor and reduced fungicide, which cost £39/ha - some £12/ha less than a full fungicide programme.

""There are still things to learn about products like this, including application timing, length of resistance, optimum formulation and compatibility,"" says Neil.

Biocontrol is another area of interest, he notes. ""This uses naturally occurring micro-organisms, such as bacteria and fungi, to reduce the inoculum or disease caused by a pathogen.""

They work by parasitism and predation of one organism by another, or by antibiotics that are harmful to target pathogens.

They may also provide cross-protection or growth stimulation, he explains.

""Getting the best from any of these innovations comes from using them in a holistic approach.""

What's happening in Europe?

Strong social and political pressure in Europe to reduce pesticide use has seen the introduction of the EU's Farm to Fork strategy, which has a target of reducing pesticide use by 50% by 2030.

At the current rate of change, that overall target is expected to be hit, although countries are progressing at different rates - France and Italy are on course, but Germany is behind.

In France, researcher Dr Nicolas Munier-Jolain of Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (Inrae) is running the DEPHY network of demonstration farms, which was set up in 2010 and involves 3,000 farmers from all cropping sectors - arable, vineyards, orchards, vegetables, ornamentals and tropical crops.

Tasked with reducing pesticide use, these farms are being supported to adopt integrated pest management (IPM) and share their knowledge, with the onus being on individual farms to find solutions that suit their circumstances.

The results have been encouraging, with applications to arable crops coming down by an average of 26%. ""This figure hides wide variability across farms, but progress is being made.""

The consequences for productivity and profit have also been investigated, continues Nicolas.

""We've seen that using less pesticide has given a slightly lower yield - due to techniques such as delayed drilling, variety choice and less nitrogen - but the resulting fall in costs mean that profits are up.""

Among the most pioneering farmers, pesticides use is down by 40% and productivity is up by 6%, but that has also led to changes in what's being grown.

""There are less cereals produced but more legumes and grasses.""  

The farm context, the management practices used and better decision-making have all been identified as key factors in reducing pesticide use, he adds.

Pesticide reductions in France

Another project, IPMworks, is a European network of demonstration farms, used to monitor how integrated pest management (IPM) is being adopted and how well it is working.

Again, farmers exchange their knowledge, explains Nicolas, with groups of 10-15 farmers all being supported by an adviser. ""This is all about cost-effective IPM strategies.""

All of the article contributors were speaking to Farmers Weekly at this year's British Crop Production Council congress ""Shaping the Future of Crop Protection"", which was held in Harrogate in early November.

160,"Local farmers lead clean up of phosphate polluted river","https://www.fwi.co.uk/news/environment/local-farmers-lead-clean-up-of-phosphate-polluted-river","Local farmers lead clean up of phosphate polluted river

Farmers are leading the way in a joint effort to clean up the River Wye in Herefordshire - reducing phosphate pollution by changing farming practices.

In just over a year, lasting solutions to the high phosphate levels in the river have been identified. A timescale for phosphate reduction has been agreed, thanks to the willingness of businesses, retailers and government agencies to work together.

See also: Climate change will worsen farm water pollution, study shows

Collective approach

This collective approach has added to the momentum originally created by the local farming community, which is keen to reverse the deterioration of the River Wye and improve the ecology of the area.

As Fownhope-based arable farmer and instigator Martin Williams explains, recognising that there was an issue in the catchment and accepting there would have to be an element of compromise were two key steps in making progress.

A lack of data on the agricultural side and a prevalent blame culture meant a certain amount of ""sword-fighting in the dark"" to go the true picture, says Mr Williams.

""Over the past 18 months, there have been many events organised to discuss the river and plenty of dialogue with relevant bodies,"" he reveals.

""As a result, we now have the awareness and co-operation that we need to change things for the better.""

There is also a route map for achieving results. Along with a new phosphate audit tool that's being developed, it will support farmers and businesses in making better-informed decisions.

What's the problem?

The River Wye rises in the Cambrian mountains and flows for 152 miles, making it the fifth longest river in the UK.

It is one of the most protected rivers in the UK and is under site of special scientific interest and special areas of conservation status.

The water quality of the Wye has been a cause for concern for some time and its ecological status is described as ""unfavourable - recovering"".

The current problems are centred on algal blooms, that grow quickly in hot weather. These are exacerbated by levels of phosphate pollution, which originate from numerous sources.

In addition, lower river levels reduce the oxygen content of the river, killing aquatic life and affecting water quality.

More than manure

While the widespread use of poultry manure as a fertiliser was originally blamed for the situation, the issue is more complex than that, with numerous sources, including water treatment facilities and other farming activities, also contributing to the pollution.

""Back in the summer of 2021, the national press was running articles vilifying the farming community, especially broiler production, for the state of the river,"" says Mr Williams.

""Something had to be done so farming had a voice and the situation was better understood. Only then could we move forward.""

Martin Williams © Richard Stanton

The first exploratory meeting that he organised with the help of the Wye and Usk Foundation was well-attended and included representatives from farming, food processing, research institutions and environmental organisations.

""Once all the facts and figures were presented, it was clear that livestock manures, biosolids and digestate were contributing as much as 75% of the excess phosphate in the River Wye, with the catchment running at a surplus of 2,000t of phosphate a year.

""From a farming point of view, having access to nutrient-rich manures had gone from being a blessing to being a curse,"" says Mr Williams.

Importantly, the tone of that meeting meant that developing workable solutions became the focus, rather than each party apportioning blame for a long-term issue.

Research findings

During the initial meeting, Shane Rothwell from Lancaster University reported the findings of rephOKUS, a large research project on phosphate use in the food system.

This confirmed that phosphate leakage from land to water was also occurring.

Not only did this blow the myth that soil phosphate is immobile, the work also showed that the phosphate loadings were too much for the sandy and loam soils to retain.

""Livestock dominate the phosphate flows in the Wye catchment,"" says Dr Rothwell.

""The main movement of phosphate is in the manures, which is why changing how they are used can help, but there's also a huge reserve of phosphate in Herefordshire soils.""

It was the catalyst that was needed for change, recalls Mr Williams, as it showed that soil input was exceeding phosphate demand by 30%, leading to its accumulation every year.

""It got us all thinking about our soil indices and our land management practices,"" he says.

""If the soils can't hold the phosphate that's being applied, there's an obvious need for a different approach. Ultimately, farmers are responsible for what they put on their land.""

Poultry industry

Getting the poultry industry to play its part in addressing the problem was essential, says Kate Speke-Adams, formerly of the Wye and Usk Foundation, as the use of poultry manures as fertiliser can be a risk.

""If it's not applied in the right way and at the right time, some of the excess phosphate content in these manures can find its way into the water through soil diffusion.""

Avara Foods - one of the UK's largest producers of poultry - was willingly involved in the discussions from the start, as almost half of the company's production comes from its Hereford operation.

It agreed to take full accountability for the phosphorous used in its processes, from changing the chickens' diets to enhanced manure management and new destinations for chicken litter (see ""Avara's ""˜bold plan' for reducing pollution"").

Since then, it has been encouraging to see work done by egg packer Noble Foods, says Ms Speke-Adams.

The company has been working with her colleagues to deliver one-to-one farm advice and develop solutions to pollution, such as building wetlands.

""Free-range egg production units can be hotspots for phosphate,"" she says.

""Where they are well-established, soil indices of 5, 6 and 7 have been recorded.""

In the same way, Stonegate Eggs is engaging in the efforts being made to prevent nutrient and sediment pollution, reflecting that all parts of the supply chain are intent on making improvements.

Further up the chain are the retailers, who are also involved and putting pressure on others to step up.

Tesco, which has signed up to the Courtauld Commitment, is now part of the collective action with regard to sustainable water use and water quality.

""Tesco recognising that the catchment is saturated and that it can play its part in getting change to occur has really picked up the pace,"" says Ms Speke-Adams.

""If their suppliers are expected to be transparent about their practices and look for ways to improve, it helps to change old habits.""

Avara's ‘bold plan’ for reducing pollution

The supply chain for Avara Foods covers 120 farms in the Wye catchment area. These farms jointly produce about 160,000t/year of poultry manure, or just over 3t/week.

Each one is an independent business, supplying into the Avara operations in Hereford and nearby Newent on long-term contracts.

The water pollution risk arises when farmers decide to use the manure on their own land or sell it to third parties as fertiliser.

Taking full accountability for the phosphorous used in the company's processes is the right thing to do and part of its wider environmental responsibilities, says John Reed, Avara's director of agriculture, who has committed to other initiatives over the next two years.

""We have already identified four potential destinations for poultry litter,"" says Mr Reed (see ""Where does all the poultry litter go?"" below).

""It makes sense to use existing infrastructure, where possible, while establishing best practice for manure management.""

Wider action

As word spread, other organisations have added their support and accepted the challenge, she notes.

Welsh Water has invested in its sewage treatment infrastructure and given grants to farmers to support water quality, while Herefordshire Council - which has calculated that the economic impact of the planning moratorium in the catchment is £200m - has been instrumental in agreeing on progress.

A Landscape Recovery bid, put together with the help of the Wye and Usk Foundation by 14 landowners and covering 1,100ha of farmland, was unsuccessful - but the group was not deterred and will continue to support changes to agricultural practices.

At the same time, the Environment Agency, which is working with a range of partners in the Wye catchment to improve water quality, carried out 136 farm inspections last year.

Of these, 101 were to high-risk fields and sites, while the others were to anaerobic digestion plants and poultry units. Regulatory powers were used in 36 instances and 10 warning letters were issued.

There has also been a move to ""export"" litter out of the catchment, with main contractor Gamber Logistics now moving about 20,000t away from the source to counties in need of the nutrient, to alleviate the pressure.

""There is a plan that everyone has signed up to and we are seeing a sea change in behaviour,"" says Ms Speke-Adams, who is now with the Herefordshire Rural Hub.

""But there are 2,000 farmers in Herefordshire, so we want to see more of them involved.""

Where does all the poultry litter go?

Current model

Future model

Over the next two years, Avara will be taking further action, says John Reed, the company's director of agriculture. Working with farmers, there will be a transition to a different model for poultry manure that is commercially viable and sustainable.

Avara is focusing on long-term actions that are sustainable and create value, says Mr Reed.

""We've recognised that we can play a role in the condition of the Wye,"" he adds.

""These are ambitious goals, but they will help to reduce the carbon footprint of the supply chain and improve the ecology of the area.""

Case study: Clay Estates

Mark Wood © Richard Stanton

Mark Wood, farm manager at Clay Estates in south Herefordshire, was set a challenge by his new employer when he started his job 20 years ago.

His most urgent task was to find ways of keeping soil in the fields, rather than seeing it running out of the gates and heading towards the river after heavy rainfall.

His starting point was to improve soil structure by increasing its organic matter content, as well as changing the rotation so that potatoes were grown less frequently and only on specific sites.

""Building in some resilience and doing things differently has really helped,"" says Mr Wood.

""As well as improving the water-holding capacity of the soils, it expanded our working window and reduced soil damage.""

Recognising that there was variability in the estate soils, Mr Wood had all of the fields tested so that he would be able to variably apply fertiliser according to soil zones and crop requirements.

Aware of the declining state of the River Wye, he also took a gamble and decided that the soil P index should be 2-, rather than 2+, so that any risk to water from excess phosphate was minimised.

""We have managed fine at 2-; there hasn't been any detriment to yield or quality.""

He now uses manures on a one-in-four basis, has reduced tillage, introduced cover crops and used stewardship to include buffer strips and margins - all of which are helping to keep soils healthy and water protected.

""With water protection, it's about doing more than one thing - we are always looking for improvements and learning about what works.""

Mr Wood also recognises the need for farmers in the area to work together. He now shares a drill with others and liaises closely with the estate's contract potato grower, especially at harvest time.

""We don't allow de-stoning, only have potatoes on a one-in-10 basis in certain fields and are intent on preventing any run-off from potato fields,"" he reveals.

""Cover crops are grown to prevent nutrient loss and cultivations are used strategically.""

Managing climate conditions is becoming more challenging, he adds, but the local farming community knows that looking after the river is an essential part of their role.

""We are doing things in a smarter way,"" he says. ""Our primary role is to produce food and, to do that, we have to plough and use organic manures sometimes.

“But by having a plan in place and working with the partner organisations, we have reduced our impact on the soil and on water, and we will continue to look at ways to improve that.""

What's next in clean-up quest?

A farm audit tool for phosphate is being developed by a consortium of research and environmental organisations to help with measurement and reporting.

Expected to be ready in the next two years, it will establish the phosphate baseline on individual farms and highlight actions that will mitigate the impact of farm activities on phosphate levels.

The tool will also be able to help with inspection implications and will eventually include a trading platform, in line with the development of nutrient neutrality as a condition of planning.

A document titled What Does Good Look Like? is also being produced, so that the implications of development, abstraction, climate change and other environmental factors on the River Wye are clear.

With the farm audit tool running behind it, site-specific actions can be carried out without putting the health of the river at risk or threatening nearby habitats.

Andy and Lynda Eadon of Napton, Warwickshire, are the 2023 Farmers Weekly Farming Champion of the Year.

Andy and Lynda have made a profound difference to the way people in the countryside think about mental health and have raised a vast amount for charity. 

The Warwickshire farming couple began this work after their son Len - a talented and popular 22-year-old - took his own life on New Year's Day 2022.

Despite finding themselves in an unimaginable situation, they decided to do everything in their power to prevent what happened to them happening to other families. 

With huge courage, drive and selflessness, they set about improving mental health awareness among young people and raising funds for three important charities:

They received prime minister Rishi Sunak's Points of Light award, recognising outstanding individual volunteers and those making a change in their community and inspiring others.

Among their many endeavours was launching a Five-a-Day mental health challenge, for which they created wallet-sized cards printed with advice such as encouraging people to talk openly. More than 18,000 of these cards have been distributed.

This summer, their efforts centred on an incredible tractor journey - travelling more than 2,000 miles from John O'Groats to Land's End - to spotlight how mental health can affect those in rural communities, to help break down the stigma surrounding it and to share the message that no one need feel isolated or alone.

The tractor was fitted with a front-mounted beacon - and this inspired the name of their ongoing campaign, Len's Light, which shines a light on mental health and suicide issues. 

Among the stop-off points were livestock markets, country shows, the Houses of Parliament, the Farmers' Club and Harper Adams University where Len had studied.

""Our goal has always been to leave a legacy for Len, and we hope that Len's Light will be more than an incredible spectacle, but prompt a wider, ongoing conversation around mental health in agriculture,"" Andy said.

""If we can stop one family going through what we did, and are continuing to go through, then it will have been worth it,"" he added. 

By the time the Eadons arrived in Cornwall, their campaign had raised more than £115,000, with more donations arriving daily through the summer.

They also encouraged thousands of people, who saw the relay as a ""beacon of hope"", to start conversations with neighbours, friends or family members about mental health issues. 

Making a difference

""Initiatives like this by Lynda and Andy - under the most tragic of circumstances - really do make a difference,"" said Stephanie Berkeley, manager of the Farm Safety Foundation.

Jude McCann, chief executive of the Farming Community Network, said: ""Andy and Lynda and the Len's Light campaign are carrying a vital message of support that is resonating with farmers and people living in rural communities across the UK.

""None of us should feel alone - we are part of a supportive community that is here to listen, support and help.""

The tractor relay concluded in Land's End on 20 July but, as the Eadons pointed out, the journey did not end there. They vowed to keep working, in Len's memory, on this vital cause. 

Lynda and Andy have dedicated their lives to generating greater mental health awareness among young people in farming - and will undoubtedly save lives. 

Their remarkable efforts are a fitting tribute to Len.

What makes the Eadons our winners

The Farmers Weekly 2023 Farming Champion of the Year Award is sponsored by the NFU



""Despite many worthy contenders this year, there can be no better winners than Andy and Lynda Eadon.

""Few of us can imagine what they've been through, but their reaction to Leonard's tragic passing has been incredible.

""They decided that their task was to do all they could in Len's memory, to ensure that this didn't happen to other farming families.

""Their tireless campaigning is testament to their selflessness, drive and bravery and is matched only by their compassion for their fellow farmers and their families. 

""They are truly extraordinary people, and the legacy of good they are building in Len's memory will benefit countless others in our industry.""

Minette Batters, NFU president

The use of share farming agreements could rise as tighter gross margins and further cuts to direct subsidies in England make alternative arrangements such as contract farming less relevant.

Share farming agreements operate where two parties jointly farm the same land, typically involving the owner or tenant of farmland entering a contract with a share farmer.

Gary Markham, director at rural tax adviser and accountant Land Family Business, describes it as a true joint venture.

See also: CFAs need new approach in light of BPS phase out

He expects many alternative agreements to convert to the share farming model from this autumn onwards for several reasons, including financial sustainability, flexibility and to protect the inheritance tax (IHT) position of farm owners.

The most common form of joint venture historically has been a contract farming agreement (CFA) with the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) income included in the operation.

However, with cuts to the BPS since 2020, these agreements have come under pressure because there is less return for the contractor, says Gary.

Share farming principles

""In arable, the good returns from the 2021 and 2022 harvests have been a sticking plaster; they have delayed that financial pressure, but prices in 2023 will be much lower and inputs higher and it will be crunch time.

""There will be a rush from the autumn through to the spring to restructure joint ventures - share farming is the absolute answer.""

Shared gross margin

This is because the gross margin is shared, in contrast to CFAs, where the landowner or farmer and the contractor each receives a fixed amount in advance of a share of the surplus from the farming operation.

For the contractor, this is a basic contracting fee that should at least cover their costs, while the landowner receives a fixed charge for the provision of land, buildings and a share farming bank account to fund the operation.

With lower 2023 harvest returns and BPS dropping, the sum due to the contractor as their share of the surplus will be substantially reduced, says Gary.

There may be good IHT reasons for shifting from a CFA to share farming, as in some cases HMRC might see the farmer as not being sufficiently involved in the management of the land, running the risk that they could lose agricultural property relief (APR).

""Share farming is a robust model for IHT,"" says Gary, who has already adapted agreements into share farming models by changing the remuneration.

Share farming advantages

Instead of the usual CFA method, he suggests splitting the gross margin to reflect the value of each party's respective inputs to the agreement.

Share farming suits all enterprises

While share farming is often associated with dairying, having originated in New Zealand where share milking is common, it is suited to all enterprises.

In recent years, the model has gained traction in arable situations, with livestock farmers introducing sheep and cattle onto arable land to increase soil organic matter.

This presents a good opportunity for new entrants because of the relatively low capital start-up costs of a sheep enterprise, he adds.

The model can also be a good fit for farm diversifications, too. Gary's livery business operates in his buildings within a share farming agreement.

""Renting out farm buildings is not good for IHT; share farming is better as it demonstrates that the farmer is involved in farming or activities for the purposes of APR or business property relief,"" Gary says.

The Tenant Farmers Association (TFA) advises on joint ventures as well as tenancies. It sees share farming as a niche solution that suits in limited circumstances.

Chief executive George Dunn says there has been no increase in share farming inquiries and puts this down largely to the landowning community being risk averse.

""For two individuals to share risk, you have to focus on specific goals and not everyone can cope with that,"" he says.

Case study: James Price and Sam Clarke

Sam Clarke (left) and James Price © James Price

When arable farmer James Price was offered an additional 650ha of land to rent, it presented a business opportunity not only for him but for a sheep farmer, too.

James took on the new land in Oxfordshire and formed a separate joint venture, Mustard Sheep, with shepherd and agricultural consultant Sam Clarke, to graze 1,200 sheep on cover crops.

The business not only generates a secondary income from the land, but helps manage blackgrass and introduces organic matter into the arable soils.

The pair had been close friends for several years and already had a business relationship - Sam's sheep grazed mustard cover crops that James had introduced to improve his arable soils.

Share farming was the logical next step when James had the chance to expand his arable operation to about 1,500ha.

""It was a big jump in acreage and the land had some issues with weeds, but it was an opportunity I couldn't turn down,"" he says.

Joint venture

He decided to plant 162ha of herbal leys to help manage those issues and to graze it with sheep, offering Sam that opportunity.

""Sam couldn't justify buying additional sheep to graze that acreage without a more permanent arrangement so I suggested we did it together, as a joint venture,"" says James.

James provided the land, Sam the handling and other equipment, which he already owned, and each put in 600 North Country Mule ewes.

Mustard Sheep has its own bank account, which is used for receiving the income and paying the variable costs associated with running the joint venture.

This includes income from sales of lambs and cull ewes and expenditure on seed. There was a big cost in year one when the herbal leys were planted.

Labour is also paid from the account - the business employs 1.5 labour units and Sam, who also works as an agricultural consultant, is paid a fee for managing the sheep enterprise; James has no involvement in the day-to-day running of the business. Insurance cover has been added to James' existing policy.

""Because we were a new business, the quotes for having a separate policy were very high so I was able to tack it onto my policy,"" says James.

This additional premium will be charged back at cost to Mustard Sheep.

Equal profit shares

Profits from the joint venture are shared equally. Both parties recognise that they benefit from the arrangement, which was established in September 2022.

""Land is one thing you can't farm without so it has given me the opportunity to push my business on and James benefits because I was already well kitted out with equipment, fencing and labour, what you might call ""˜oven ready',"" says Sam.

The pair talk daily on the phone and have formal quarterly meetings to assess the business and to plan ahead.

Although they had worked together previously through the grazing arrangements, forming the joint venture has given both a mutual appreciation of the needs of each other's enterprises.

""If I need the sheep off by 14 February to plant spring barley, Sam understands that. We have a common interest so we plan where the sheep will graze,"" says James.

Monitoring cashflows

For farmers considering new agreements, James recommends closely monitoring cashflows.

""It is important to understand where the money is coming from,"" he says, adding that successful share farming agreements rely on several elements.

""The key to it is to get on very well and that you can have a good working relationship.

""Having different skill sets is important, too. Sam has the expertise with the sheep but also has agronomy experience so he understands the needs of my arable system.""

Case study: Tim May and Oliver Chedgey

In a good trading year, Tim May and Oliver Chedgey share the glory. In a poor year, the financial hit on their dairy farming business is also split two ways.

The pair have been share farming since 2017 after Tim decided to reintroduce a dairy herd to Kingsclere Estates, his family's 1,012ha farm in north Hampshire, to build soil health and reduce the weed burden in the arable enterprise.

""I recognised the farm's biggest strength was grass and dairy and wanted to get livestock back onto the farm to get grass back into the rotation,"" he says.

A farm business tenancy model was not the right fit because Tim didn't want the dairy fixed on a specific acreage. He wanted the benefit from the cows to be spread across the entire farm.

""We could have set the dairy up ourselves and employed a herdsman, but there was always the risk of that person leaving and we would have to start the process all over again,"" he says.

Tim sought advice from Christopher D'Olley, a partner at land agent Carter Jonas, a keen advocate of share farming.

The opportunity was advertised in Farmers Weekly and, in 2017, Tim established a share farming business with Oliver, on a five-year rolling agreement.

The business now milks 420 New Zealand Friesian cross-breds in a 20-a-side mobile milking parlour.

Tim provides the land and home-grown feed and Oliver owns the machinery and puts in labour and his expertise and knowledge of dairying.

Running costs

The cows are owned equally. Interest and depreciation on new infrastructure or machinery contributed by either party is accounted for.

""No one gets paid directly for what they contribute, but that value gets attributed to their share of the running costs,"" Tim explains. ""When we apportion the sales it is accounted for then.""

Running costs such as contracting and veterinary fees are shared - their suppliers invoice them separately for 50% of the total cost of the service or goods.

The cost of insurance cover for the cows is shared, but Tim has his own public liability insurance for the estate and Oliver has cover for his own business.

Oliver Chedgey © Kingsclere Estates

Alongside the share farming agreement is a farming policy agreement that sets out who is responsible for what.

This covers issues such as ensuring that no metal fencing stakes from temporary fence lines are left lying around the farm as a hazard for other farm equipment.

It is a live document so new responsibilities can be integrated as they arise.

Tim says one of the appeals of share farming is that it doesn't come with some of the legal obligations of a partnership.

""When you are setting up a new, young business, having that separation is important,"" he believes. What it does do is bring two managerial minds together.

Sharing responsibility

""It is not a landowner-farmer relationship, it is two people working together and sharing the responsibility,"" Tim adds.

For it to work, everyone involved needs to understand the concept of the share farming model, he says.

""Not everyone will understand share farming because it is not as mainstream as a partnership or tenancy,"" he adds.

It is important the agreement has a clear exit strategy too, to allow the agreement to end amicably if needed.

171,"Analysis: What is being done to secure water resources for UK farmers?","https://www.fwi.co.uk/business/business-management/agricultural-transition/analysis-what-is-being-done-to-secure-water-resources-for-uk-farmers","Analysis: What is being done to secure water resources for UK farmers?

Agriculture faces a raft of water-related challenges, and industry leaders are highlighting the need for a fully integrated management plan to ensure growers and livestock producers have access to adequate supplies.

The combined effects of climate change and an expanding population is putting pressure on UK water resources, and agriculture is expected to face increased competition for water resources in the coming decade and beyond.

While the pattern of change is unlikely to be uniform, future water availability will vary across the UK and over time, making constraints inevitable in times of extreme heat and drought.

For this reason, making sure there is enough water allocated to farming is a priority, says NFU national water specialist Kelly Hewson-Fisher.

See also: Farming rules for water: What's in store?

Farm policy

Policymakers must devise a plan that recognises the critical role it plays in agricultural production and food security.

""We need good planning and investment in infrastructure in order to be confident of withstanding current and future pressures,"" she says.

""Building resilience into our water system makes sense - for all users, not just farmers.""

At the same time, the effect of farming practices on water quality and the environment is also being scrutinised, after land management was identified as a contributing factor in the declining quality of the UK's surface and groundwater.

As a result, farmers are expected to take action to prevent both point source and diffuse pollution and manage any impacts on water quality, while using water efficiently to maintain production.

Farming Rules for Water

Clean and plentiful water is one of the six public goods that the new Environmental Land Management (ELM) scheme will contribute to, showing the government's intent to address the nutrient and sediment pollution that comes from farming activities.

Under the Environment Act, Defra has committed to a long-term target of at least a 40% reduction in nitrates, phosphates and sediment going into the water environment from farming by 2038 - a target that many green groups describe as weak and unambitious as they ramp up the pressure on government to take tougher action.

Already, the Farming Rules for Water, which were introduced in 2018, are in place to minimise water pollution and retain nutrients on-farm through better practice, with all farms legally obliged to comply.

Their interpretation required clarity after an inflexible approach to muckspreading was taken in 2021, effectively preventing manure applications to most fields in the autumn.

After urgent consultation, updated guidance on how the Environment Agency should apply the Farming Rules for Water cleared the way for muckspreading and the application of other organic manures in autumn and winter, providing there was no water pollution risk from their use.

Far from being a green light for all types of spreading, the pollution risks associated with different types of manures and the need to demonstrate that applications have been planned and accounted for are central to the new guidance.

Abstraction licence changes

For farmers who rely on abstraction for irrigation or filling reservoirs, there are changes coming to abstraction licences, which will see charges rise and a move to an Environmental Permitting Regulations system in 2024. ""The change is all about sustainable abstraction to protect water bodies,"" says the NFU's Kelly Hewson-Fisher. ""Farmers actually use less than 2% of the total water abstracted in the UK, but there are hotspot areas.""

Be aware of expiry dates on licences and note that all licences will be referred to as converted permits once the new system is up and running. It is just part of a big shake-up of water resources that's coming, she adds. ""We are active at a regional and a national level and will keep issuing updates, but all farmers should aim to keep themselves abreast of developments.""

""Put simply, healthier soils absorb and retain more water for longer periods of time,"" she says.

Other water management benefits can be gained, she adds - especially when combined with other practices, such as reduced or no tillage, the use of cover crops and strategic residue management.

Jackie Evans, managing director of agriculture and land at farm consultancy Adas, says adapting existing farm buildings and infrastructure to capture and store rainwater can have a big impact, as this water can be used for washing down and cleaning, as well as spraying.

""There will be arable farms where growing more autumn-sown crops makes sense from a water availability perspective, or where switching to crops such as rye and grain maize, which have a lesser water requirement, is the right course of action.""

Boreholes and reservoirs may have a place in the long term, depending on individual farm circumstances and their water use, but they have greater cost implications, she notes.

Flooding

Last year's heatwave underlined the pressure on water supplies, and extreme weather is also triggering flooding events, says NFU flooding and drainage adviser Zoe Moore. Farmers have a role to play in flood management and can help to alleviate flood risk, she says - especially where actions are a planned element of catchment management and participants get compensated for providing a service.

""We're still waiting to see if ELM will provide for this, as there isn't provision otherwise,"" says Ms Moore. ""Unless they've entered into a private agreement, farmers are currently doing this at a cost to themselves.""

Natural flood management techniques used as part of a package of measures may be supported, she acknowledges, as there are grants available for wetland development as well as tree and hedgerow planting. These techniques, which take their inspiration from nature, catch and detain water where it falls, helping to reduce and slow peaks of water after a rain event.

Advice and grant support

The Catchment Sensitive Farming programme - a partnership between Defra, Natural England and the Environment Agency - offers training, advice and grant support to farmers to help them improve water quality and reduce flood risk on their land.

Advisers cover the whole of England, and the advice comes on a one-to-one basis free of charge.

Most of the water companies also offer grants and expert advice on environmental solutions that protect river health and drinking water quality.

In addition, Water Management Grants from the Farming Transformation Fund are for capital items that help increase productivity through the efficient use of water, such as new reservoirs and associated equipment.

Water security

All farm businesses can take action to safeguard water security now, believes Ms Hewson-Fisher, who says that there are short-, medium- and long-term strategies that can be applied to ensure that agriculture gets its fair share of supplies.

""Having had a summer in 2022 that featured prolonged dry conditions and high temperatures, water resources are front of mind,"" she says.

""So it makes sense to think about what you can do to help manage water availability on your farm.

“Understanding the risks to your business of changing water availability is really important - this is an issue that isn't going to go away.""

If you haven't already done so, improving soil health is a good place to start. Increasing soil organic matter content will bring corresponding improvements in both infiltration rates and water holding capacity, making soils more resilient and better able to cope with deluges and droughts.

Case study: Garth Weston, Oxfordshire

Drought last spring and summer was far more impactful on Garth Weston's Oxfordshire farm than he was prepared for - and it hit him hard.

Crop yields and lamb performance were affected by the lack of rainfall, he reports, while he was unable to return some of his temporary grass leys to arable production.

In addition, the AHDB Monitor Farm host suffered high losses on its cricket bat willow enterprise and some of the chosen Countryside Stewardship options failed to establish successfully after harvest, given the lack of moisture.

""It was so dry we couldn't take the leys out or get the kill we needed from glyphosate applications,"" he recalls.

""A grass ley must be actively growing for glyphosate destruction to work, so a key element of that approach was missing in 2022.""

The hot, dry weather also meant that he was left with higher blackgrass numbers in cereal crops than he had aimed for. The prolonged drought conditions also affected glyphosate activity after harvest and reduced pre-emergence herbicide performance.

Farming just over 400ha at Sydenham Grange Farm, near Thame, Mr Weston is in the process of integrating livestock into the arable rotation and has introduced four-year grass leys to both fatten lambs and help with blackgrass control.



Reducing inputs

He is also looking to reduce reliance on artificial inputs, use less fuel and produce higher quality forage, while farming with his environmental responsibilities in mind.

The overall plan is that the sheep and arable enterprises will share the heavy, low-lying land. The 1,100 ewes will then be housed from Christmas onwards in readiness for lambing.

Cover crops are being considered, both for their soil function benefits and to extend the grazing provision for the sheep.

Finishing the lambs last year proved difficult, as forage growth slowed and the ground needed to be rested.

A lack of available grass meant that the worm burden increased and parasite control was challenging.

Crop yields were down, and spring beans were particularly disappointing at 2.81t/ha.

His Group 1 winter wheat averaged 7.83t/ha but didn't make milling specification, most likely due to it being unable to take up the nitrogen required to meet grain protein levels

As a result, Mr Weston has now made the decision to install a borehole to supply the whole farm.

Having done the research and initial surveys, he believes it will bring the resilience that the business requires for its future. ""It is costly but we've calculated that it will have a two-year payback,"" he says.

""We are not alone as farmers in having to manage either too much or not enough rainfall, but this step will mean we can access a secure water supply when we need it most.""

Reservoir plan for eastern England

One of the UK's driest regions, the east of England, is set to get two new reservoirs - helping to secure water supplies for decades to come and make the region more resilient to the risks of drought and flooding.

The proposed reservoirs would be located between Chatteris and March in Cambridgeshire, and between Grantham and Boston in Lincolnshire. Both new facilities expected to similar in size to Grafham Water.

Proposals are at an early stage. The first consultation has just completed, and work on constructing the reservoirs is not expected to start until 2029.

Felixstowe HydrocycIe - securing water by reducing waste

A farmer-led project is saving and reusing drainage water that would have been lost to the North Sea, so that it can be used to irrigate crops on six farms and replenish existing reservoirs in Suffolk.

In 2018, five local farmers got together to form Felixstowe Hydrocycle, securing an EU grant of â‚¬969,000 (£857,585) to part-fund the construction of 11km pipeline and appropriate water management infrastructure to bring drainage water back inland.

Recognising that a shortage of fresh water supplies was a threat to the future of their businesses, the farmers worked with the Environment Agency and several other partners to develop a sustainable solution and make additional water available for their high-value crops.

As well as refilling 14 farm reservoirs, the recovered water is helping to conserve the mudflats and saltmarsh found on the Felixstowe Peninsula.

The water is sourced from the Kingsfleet, where the local drainage board was pumping more than 1m tonnes of water into the tidal River Deben each year, putting valuable habitats at risk from erosion.

A novel method of water storage - managed aquifer recharge - which uses the natural water holding-capacity of the underlying strata, is being trialled.

In this system, surplus water is pumped into shallow lagoons or trenches, where it soaks into the ground and supplements normal winter rainfall.

This recharges groundwater stores and avoids the need to construct large reservoirs. Any water not reabstracted is left in the ground to maintain spring and river flows.

For current A-Level students, the UCAS application window is fast approaching.

It is a necessary process for those who wish to continue their education at university, but often a dreaded one, as many struggle to write their personal statements.

Farmers Weekly spoke to Liam Dowson, head of student recruitment at the Royal Agricultural University in Cirencester, to get his advice for writing a successful application and choosing the right course for you.

Top advice

Research

For those considering going to university, the first step should always be to carry out research to find out which university, and course, is the right match.

Liam recommends taking time to look on university websites, paying particular attention to the course specification and module options.

He says: ""An agriculture course at one university could actually be quite different to an agricultural course at another university.

“You need to look at the course content, at what the themes are within the course, what modules you will be studying, the pathways you will go on, and whether this matches your interests.""

While initial research can be done online, Liam advises attending a university open day to get a sense of what it would be like to be a student there.

""We do find that going to open days is the best way to get a feel for a place. It gives you the chance to talk to the staff and students, and have a look around all the facilities, whether that's the classrooms, the labs, accommodation or student bar.

""We find that students tend to get a good feel of a university even within 10 minutes of being there,"" he says.

Student life

A key part of finding the right university is being able to see yourself studying and living there. To get a flavour of life on campus, Liam suggests looking on Instagram at the students' union page.

""Our students' union has got an Instagram page, and as a university we don't get any say in what they put on there. It is all entirely authentic and student-led.

""I look at that and think it's such a great insight into what it is like to be a student here, because they're posting student content of all the societies, clubs and trips that they go on. You get a really good sense of what student life is like.""

Personal statement

The personal statement is the part of the UCAS application that students often find most difficult.

It is a short essay which gives them the opportunity to demonstrate their interests and achievements.

Here to take the stress out of the process, Liam has a tried-and-tested formula for writing a strong personal statement.

""There is no right or wrong""¦ because it is specific to the individual. But what we want is to read through and see that the person is genuinely really interested in the course and has a real desire to come and study here.

""A good way to demonstrate this is to talk about experiences that are relevant to the course.

""This could be work experience, where you can talk about what you've learned and enjoyed, and how it is going to help you in the future.

""It could be wider reading that you've done, or perhaps a summer school or taster course that's run by a university that you've attended, or it could be webinars and Ted talks.""

The key is to take these experiences and explain how they have been beneficial, rather than writing them as a list.

""It's slightly cheesy, but there's something called the ""˜ABC rule' that you can follow,” says Liam. 

""A stands for Activity, so if you've done something, that's great. But B stands for Benefit, so you need to explain what the benefit of the activity was. What have you learned from it? Think about how has it helped you, and what insights you have gained.

""C stands for Course, so the final step is linking this back to the course. Why is it relevant to what you want to study?

""If you can cover those three elements, then you will have a good formula for a strong personal statement.""

There are several measures that farmers can take to protect their wheat crops from stem rust disease, which is on the brink of re-establishing itself in UK fields.

Conditions have become more conducive to the disease, with warmer summers, a move to later maturing wheat varieties and more spring cropping in rotations.

The disease, which can reduce yields by up to 90% in severe cases, was once common in western Europe, with frequent epidemics.

See also: The rare moth putting sugar beet yields at risk this autumn

However, since the last big epidemic in 1955, there were several decades when it hadn't been seen in the UK, says Diane Saunders, a plant pathologist at the John Innes Centre in Norwich.

In 2013, the UK saw its first recorded case in nearly 60 years. Since then, stem rust has been observed at several locations, generally affecting just one to two plants in each case.

But this all changed last summer when it was the most widespread since 1955.

Prof Saunders knows of sites across 12 different English counties and Wales and the AHDB reported earlier this summer that its Recommended List trial site in Lincolnshire had plants showing the classical stem rust symptoms on stems, leaves, and ears.

So where has it come from and could this spell its return? To answer this, you need to look at its life cycle.

Prof Saunders points to its very complex life cycle, with five different spore releasing stages (see panel) and two different plant hosts - cereals and barberry bushes.

Possible source of 2022 outbreak

With no evidence of local infection from barberry bushes, the thinking is that the disease is moving long distances on wind from other parts of the world as urediniospores.

""This year has been unusual and we have seen more Saharan dust clouds - these may help move spores to the UK.""

She noted that in mid- to late June, there was one notable cloud and this could have picked up these urediniospores from North Africa or anywhere along the cloud’s route through Europe to the UK.

About two to three weeks before stem rust reports started to come in, there was a particularly big Saharan dust cloud that moved north to the UK and she believes this may have led to widespread infection this summer.

Another change this year is that up to 2021, all UK outbreaks were caused by a single race of stem rust, but researchers are now seeing more races in the UK.

So what was the reason the epidemics stopped in the 1950s? One key factor was a focus on managing the alternative host of the disease - common barberry (Berberis vulgaris).

Berberis vulgaris © rusgrus01/Adobe Stock

There was legislation (such as in Sweden) and removal campaigns to limit the shrub in wheat-growing areas.

For example, in the US, a removal campaign ran from 1918 to the 1970s, where in just the first 15 years of the campaign 18 million barberry bushes were removed.

This was effective in reducing outbreaks by removing a local source of infection.

The shrub was also largely removed across England up until the early part of the 20th century.

But that is now a distant memory and the numbers of these bushes have started to increase. Some of these have been planted in efforts to conserve the Barberry Carpet moth, an endangered species.

To examine the potential hazard of barberry as a source of inoculum, Prof Saunders’ team have looked at bushes in several locations in the east of England since June 2017.

Stem rust life cycle

The fungus that causes stem rust has several spore stages.

It requires wheat and barberry hosts to complete its life cycle.

The pathogen also requires high temperatures (the optimum temperature is above 20C)

Five spore-releasing stages:

Urediniospores

In the UK, airborne urediniospores generally originate from south-west Europe and North Africa. These spores, when air movements are appropriate, cause initial infection on wheat.

Teliospores

Relatively late in the season, black elongated pustules containing the teliospores develop, mainly on the stems. These spores overwinter on wheat stubble.

Basidiospores

Eventually, teliospores produce secondary spores - basidiospores - that infect barberry, where the pathogen enters a sexual phase.

Aeciospores

On barberry, aeciospores are produced that can infect crops near field edges very late in the season.

Uredospores

In wheat, infection by aeciospores gives rise to the uredospore stage. This stage is associated with typical symptoms on wheat - orange/brown sporulating pustules, which occur in stripes on leaves and stems.

Prof Saunders highlights that the disease was present in a bush that was less than 1m from a barley crop, that subsequently got infected.

This indicates stem rust is completing its life cycle and overwintering in the UK.

To help identify high-risk bushes, the John Innes Centre developed a tool farmers can use. They enter the location of current bushes and using current weather data the tool will calculate how far spores could travel from a barberry bush.

This will help estimate how far away bushes need to be planted and enable targeted monitoring of higher risk barberry bushes close to cereal crops.

Breeding

Moving to the role of varietal resistance, the John Innes Centre worked with Niab to look at 43 varieties on the AHDB Recommended List.

Inoculation trials in glasshouses revealed that 80% were very susceptible to stem rust.

Further work in South Africa on adult plants, where the disease is naturally present, classed all 58 UK varieties as susceptible. 

""So we don't have much resistance in current UK varieties.""

Drilling date

Planting early can help prevent epidemics, Prof Saunders says. Wheat stem rust only infects wheat in the summer months, so if plants are greener for a shorter period, the risk is lower.

However, modern high-yielding varieties tend to stay greener longer, into the July/August danger zone.

""The trend to later maturing varieties on the RL may influence incidence of stem rust in future,"" she warns.

Wetter autumns could also increase risk if farmers are forced to abandon drilling and go for a spring wheat instead, as seen in Ireland in 2019.

Again, spring varieties mature later and push crops into the July/August stem rust danger zone.

""More spring cropping creates conditions for increased number of outbreaks seen in the UK.""

Fungicide

Finally, the good news is that chemistry seems to be effective. Outbreaks are only being seen on untreated areas of winter wheat.

There was legislation (such as in Sweden) and removal campaigns to limit the shrub in wheat-growing areas.

For example, in the US, a removal campaign ran from 1918 to the 1970s, where in just the first 15 years of the campaign 18 million barberry bushes were removed.

This was effective in reducing outbreaks by removing a local source of infection.

The shrub was also largely removed across England up until the early part of the 20th century.

But that is now a distant memory and the numbers of these bushes have started to increase. Some of these have been planted in efforts to conserve the Barberry Carpet moth, an endangered species.

To examine the potential hazard of barberry as a source of inoculum, Prof Saunders’ team have looked at bushes in several locations in the east of England since June 2017.

Stem rust life cycle

The fungus that causes stem rust has several spore stages.

It requires wheat and barberry hosts to complete its life cycle.

The pathogen also requires high temperatures (the optimum temperature is above 20C)

Five spore-releasing stages:

Urediniospores

In the UK, airborne urediniospores generally originate from south-west Europe and North Africa. These spores, when air movements are appropriate, cause initial infection on wheat.

Teliospores

Relatively late in the season, black elongated pustules containing the teliospores develop, mainly on the stems. These spores overwinter on wheat stubble.

Basidiospores

Eventually, teliospores produce secondary spores - basidiospores - that infect barberry, where the pathogen enters a sexual phase.

Aeciospores

On barberry, aeciospores are produced that can infect crops near field edges very late in the season.

Uredospores

In wheat, infection by aeciospores gives rise to the uredospore stage. This stage is associated with typical symptoms on wheat - orange/brown sporulating pustules, which occur in stripes on leaves and stems.

Prof Saunders highlights that the disease was present in a bush that was less than 1m from a barley crop, that subsequently got infected.

This indicates stem rust is completing its life cycle and overwintering in the UK.

To help identify high-risk bushes, the John Innes Centre developed a tool farmers can use. They enter the location of current bushes and using current weather data the tool will calculate how far spores could travel from a barberry bush.

This will help estimate how far away bushes need to be planted and enable targeted monitoring of higher risk barberry bushes close to cereal crops.

Breeding

Moving to the role of varietal resistance, the John Innes Centre worked with Niab to look at 43 varieties on the AHDB Recommended List.

Inoculation trials in glasshouses revealed that 80% were very susceptible to stem rust.

Further work in South Africa on adult plants, where the disease is naturally present, classed all 58 UK varieties as susceptible. 

""So we don't have much resistance in current UK varieties.""

Drilling date

Planting early can help prevent epidemics, Prof Saunders says. Wheat stem rust only infects wheat in the summer months, so if plants are greener for a shorter period, the risk is lower.

However, modern high-yielding varieties tend to stay greener longer, into the July/August danger zone.

""The trend to later maturing varieties on the RL may influence incidence of stem rust in future,"" she warns.

Wetter autumns could also increase risk if farmers are forced to abandon drilling and go for a spring wheat instead, as seen in Ireland in 2019.

Again, spring varieties mature later and push crops into the July/August stem rust danger zone.

""More spring cropping creates conditions for increased number of outbreaks seen in the UK.""

Fungicide

Finally, the good news is that chemistry seems to be effective. Outbreaks are only being seen on untreated areas of winter wheat.

There are several measures that farmers can take to protect their wheat crops from stem rust disease, which is on the brink of re-establishing itself in UK fields.

Conditions have become more conducive to the disease, with warmer summers, a move to later maturing wheat varieties and more spring cropping in rotations.

The disease, which can reduce yields by up to 90% in severe cases, was once common in western Europe, with frequent epidemics.

However, since the last big epidemic in 1955, there were several decades when it hadn't been seen in the UK, says Diane Saunders, a plant pathologist at the John Innes Centre in Norwich.

In 2013, the UK saw its first recorded case in nearly 60 years. Since then, stem rust has been observed at several locations, generally affecting just one to two plants in each case.

But this all changed last summer when it was the most widespread since 1955.

Prof Saunders knows of sites across 12 different English counties and Wales and the AHDB reported earlier this summer that its Recommended List trial site in Lincolnshire had plants showing the classical stem rust symptoms on stems, leaves, and ears.

So where has it come from and could this spell its return? To answer this, you need to look at its life cycle.

Prof Saunders points to its very complex life cycle, with five different spore releasing stages (see panel) and two different plant hosts - cereals and barberry bushes.

Possible source of 2022 outbreak

With no evidence of local infection from barberry bushes, the thinking is that the disease is moving long distances on wind from other parts of the world as urediniospores.

""This year has been unusual and we have seen more Saharan dust clouds - these may help move spores to the UK.""

She noted that in mid- to late June, there was one notable cloud and this could have picked up these urediniospores from North Africa or anywhere along the cloud’s route through Europe to the UK.

About two to three weeks before stem rust reports started to come in, there was a particularly big Saharan dust cloud that moved north to the UK and she believes this may have led to widespread infection this summer.

Another change this year is that up to 2021, all UK outbreaks were caused by a single race of stem rust, but researchers are now seeing more races in the UK.

So what was the reason the epidemics stopped in the 1950s? One key factor was a focus on managing the alternative host of the disease - common barberry (Berberis vulgaris).

Mycorrhizal fungi play a valuable role in maximising crop performance, and a team of researchers is on a mission to delve deeper into the world of mycorrhizas to explore how fungal populations can promote crop production.

By genetically engineering plants with different expressions of target genes, researchers at Cambridge University’s Crop Science Centre hope to optimise fungal colonisation of crop roots and reduce artificial inputs.

What we know already 

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are widespread in soils and grow in association with plant roots, playing an important role in the plants’ nutrient and water uptake, explains Dr Tom Thirkell, a researcher at the Crop Science Centre.

""The symbiosis can bring added benefits to plants, such as improved defence against pests and pathogens, increased water use efficiency, improved soil structure, and tolerance to heavy metals.

“Soils rich in these fungi can also show lower greenhouse gas emissions,"" he says.

Mycorrhizal fungi are found in virtually all farmed soils. About 70% of plant species (notably excluding brassicas - see box below) use this symbiosis, which sees fungi colonise internal root tissue and develop external structures called hyphae.

These hyphae extend into the soil and increase the surface area from which plants can access essential nutrients. Mycorrhizas also play an important role in building soil structure,

Previous studies have shown that mycorrhizal fungi can provide crops with 100% of their phosphorus uptake and a significant proportion of their nitrogen.

""It is often said that plants don’t have roots - they have mycorrhizas,"" says Tom. “I think that's fair to say, given how abundant and widespread mycorrhizas are.""

The gene-editing trial 

In collaboration with Niab, the research team at the Crop Science Centre are carrying out a spring barley field trial investigating the effect of a nodulation signalling pathway gene known as NSP2.

This gene is central to the signalling process between plant and fungus. 

However, the NSP2 genes are usually expressed only when plant nutrients are in short supply.

""In low-phosphorus scenarios, we see high colonisation of mycorrhizal fungi in the roots, whereas in high-phosphorus scenarios there is low colonialisation,"" he says.

It is believed this happens because the plant does not need to engage with the fungi, as it has plentiful supply of phosphorus available.

Therefore, artificial inputs often cause plants to reject the fungi, which means mycorrhizas tend to be more abundant in organic and low-input systems.

The research team says it is possible to gene edit and genetically modify plants to overexpress the NSP2 gene, increasing the activity of the signalling pathway and allowing fungi to colonise the root in high-P scenarios.

The team hopes that increasing mycorrhizal colonisation can then bring greater crop benefits.

Modified spring barley

This technology has already been tested in glasshouses and is now moving to field-scale trials of Golden Promise spring barley.

Genetically engineered lines of winter barley are being investigated in the trial.

The first is a genetically modified barley which has increased expression of the NSP2 gene to enhance colonisation.

It contains DNA from Medicago truncatula - a small annual legume commonly used in genomic research.

The second is a gene-edited barley which has had symbiosis signalling genes knocked out, preventing fungal associations from forming.

This will act as a control to identify the role fungi play in the natural environment and how colonisation can be promoted.

Parasitism v mutualism

Although fungi colonisation is important, Tom says it does not guarantee a benefit to crops.

""For reasons we still don't fully understand, not all plants receive the same benefit from mycorrhizal colonisation. In some cases, the fungi are beneficial, but in others they can act almost like parasites on their plant hosts.

“This may be due to unequal exchange of resources between plants and fungal partners or something similar to a defence response - the plant mistaking the mycorrhiza as a pathogen rather than a symbiont.""

For example, when investigating 99 different wheat lines from an Avalon x Cadenza mapping population, fungal colonisation resulted in a broad range of shoot biomass differences.

In some cases, fungal inoculations caused an almost doubling of shoot biomass. In other wheat lines, the mycorrhizas caused a growth penalty - a 30% reduction in shoot biomass.

""The cause of this is still unclear; we're working to ensure the plants respond positively,"" he says.

Promoting mycorrhizal fungal colonisation on-farm

Mycorrhizal populations are most healthy in undisturbed soils, particularly permanent pasture, field edges and woodland.

Keeping living roots in the soil throughout the year will help promote fungi colonisation, while soil disturbance (physical, chemical or biological) disrupts fungal networks.

""The greater the abundance and the diversity of the fungi networks in arable soils, the greater the benefit to the growing crops"", says Dr Tom Thirkell.

""Through this sampling project, we hope to investigate the impacts of different management practices and how we can optimise this to promote the most beneficial fungal populations,"" he says.

A farmer-led project, in collaboration with the British On-Farm Innovation Network (Bofin), plans to take root samples from across the UK to build up a greater knowledge of mycorrhizal fungi.

How much mycorrhizal fungi is present in UK farm soils? How does farm management affect mycorrhizal colonisation? Are populations of mycorrhizal fungi the same by crop, soil type and location?

These are just a few of the questions the project hopes to address.

A “soil squad” formed of more than 50 farmers have tested root samples and sent them to the Crop Science Centre for analysis to quantify the amount of mycorrhizal fungi in crops.

""This is the first time UK arable crops have been benchmarked in this way,"" says Tom.

Mycorrhizal benefits for brassicas

Brassicas including oilseed rape, cabbage and mustard are unusual among crops in that they do not form mycorrhizal associations.

Exactly why this is remains a mystery, but it is thought that the brassicas evolved alternative methods to obtain soil nutrients such as the excretion of enzymes and acids.

Consequently, their fungal associations were lost.

Growing companion crops that are susceptible to mycorrhizal colonisation alongside brassicas may provide an indirect way of promoting mycorrhizal benefits to these otherwise non-mycorrhizal crops.

A Devon farmer's idea to send cows to Uganda has grown into an organisation offering training in sustainable farming and business skills across rural east Africa. 

When dairy farmer David Bragg first had the idea to send a cow to Uganda, little did he know it would grow into an organisation working with nearly 1.38 million people across rural Africa.

Last year, Send a Cow changed its name to Ripple Effect to reflect the range - and impact - of the work it does with farming families in Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda and Zambia.

""We started with what some might consider a somewhat naÃ¯ve process of providing milk for families for nutrition,"" says David, who is now retired and rents his farm in Lapford, Devon, to his daughter and son-in-law.

""But we discovered we were providing animals that gave manure that contributed to compost making that contributed to soil health and fertility, so families with animals benefited significantly.

""If someone was given an animal, they would breed a female replacement and pass it on. But people were also very willing to transfer their knowledge between each other.

""There was a real sense of the ripple effect happening long before it became known as Ripple Effect.""

An agroecological approach was developed, with the aim of building people's capacity to manage their own resources better.

The cow remained very much part of it, says David, but increasingly other animals, such as goats and rabbits, were also used as part of an overall goal to improve productivity.

Family roles

Tackling social issues is also key to successful outcomes when working with a community. Families are encouraged to identify which members are doing which household tasks and who could be making a better contribution.

""We increasingly find that women are empowered to become more involved in decision making and income generation, and men are very willing for that to happen and contribute to things they wouldn't have [previously], like fetching water and looking after the children while the women are in training,"" says David.

Robert Tamuzade, an enterprise development officer for Ripple Effect, worked on a project in Kyotera, a flat area of poor soils in the Central Region of Uganda, from 2016 until this year.

The project involved 400 households headed by a widow, widower or child (the area was badly affected by HIV Aids).

Training

In the first year, training in home and personal hygiene, and relational and group leadership skills, was given, and psychosocial support offered. In year two, 54 households expressed an interest in having a cow.

They were trained in pasture and animal management and in-calf cows were sourced.

By the end of that year, 74 in-calf cows had been distributed to trainee farmers. ""Many farmers wanted cows, but they had to have enough land to grow food for the family as well as pasture for livestock,"" says Robert.

Malnourishment among children, and even adults, was such that consumption of animal products by the community was the priority, to improve health.

Group members without cows could buy milk at low cost from those that did. And for those in extreme need, families with cows shared milk free of charge.

As well as livestock, families were given seeds to grow crops. With training in business skills, they started growing crops for sale, selling and marketing together in groups to earn more money.

They were also trained in how to save their income as a group, accumulating profits that could then be used to buy land in preparation to receive a ""pass-on"" gift.

Power of the cow

By the end of the project, there were 131 cows in the community.

""A dairy cow for an African farmer is a very powerful tool because it provides plenty of milk for the family, and crop yields are increased because manure is collected and composted to feed the crops.

""It also brings respect, and there is money to spend on healthcare and school fees,"" says Robert.

""Previously, so many children were not going to school because families couldn't afford it. At the end of the project, children had graduated from school because of the power of the cow.""

A livestock committee, elected by the farmers, was set up to ensure their animals continue to be managed well.

And a young farmer was trained to offer veterinary services such as artificial insemination and routine treatment, to monitor the cows' performance and offer advice, paid for by the farmers.

Case study: Lucy Nalule

Ripple Effect's Robert Tamuzade with Lucy Nulale © Ripple Effect

Lucy Nalule relies on the land surrounding her home to grow food and gain any income.

Widowed, and with four children to care for, she was finding it increasingly hard to grow enough food as the weather became more unpredictable and the soil less productive.

This led to her children suffering from regular bouts of disease.

""Before Ripple Effect came to us, we would frequently fall sick,"" she says. ""Our main food was matooke [plantain bananas] and that would grow weak, and we only had dirty water.""

Working with Robert Tamuzade, Lucy has learned how to grow a variety of fruits and vegetables in her kitchen garden.

The family was also given a cow, whose manure, combined with training in crop rotation, bedding and water storage, has rejuvenated the soil.

As a result, the household's nutrition and income have greatly improved, and Lucy can now afford to pay for her children's school fees and books.

""One of my highlights of working with Ripple Effect is the wide recognition we received. I used to lack confidence and people would not come to my home. But we have become known far and wide,"" she says.

Lucy has created her own ripple effect of positive change by sharing what she has, and what she knows, with her neighbours.

After she received her cow, it gave birth to a female calf, which she passed on to her neighbour Gerald, ensuring he could also access the milk and manure that have made such a difference in her life.

Growing forage crops using the push-pull method

© Ripple Effect

Instead of sending animals out to graze whatever they can find by day and bringing them back at night without any further feed, Ripple Effect has trained farmers to grow productive forage crops using the push-pull technique.

This method has been developed in partnership with the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology and supported by Rothamsted Research.

It involves planting maize in a 40sq m block, bordered by a 2m-wide strip of napier or bracharia grass, with leguminous desmodium planted between the maize rows.

The desmodium controls Striga, a parasitic weed that attaches itself to maize roots and sucks out nutrients, by causing suicide germination, while the grass on the border acts as an attractant trap plant for pests such as stemborers.

By growing three forage crops together, the maize is protected, while also benefiting from nitrogen-fixing by the desmodium.

Napier grass and desmodium also provide high-quality forage, and because they are perennial plants, they conserve soil moisture and improve soil health.

Food and farm leaders have sent an open letter to UK supermarkets urging fairer treatment for suppliers, as many farmers say they are ""on their knees"".

Guy Singh-Watson, founder of Riverford Organic Farmers, is heading up the Get Fair About Farming campaign, which claims the buying practices of the six leading UK supermarkets are leaving farmers ""struggling to survive"".

Watch his impassioned speech in the video below where he explains that farmers simply cannot make farming pay.

See also: Food prices: Why farmers get the smallest share and how to change it

A survey of British fruit and vegetable farmers, carried out by research firm Opinion Matters, found almost half (49%) fear they will go out of business in the next 12 months, with the behaviour of supermarkets cited as a leading factor.

The letter, sent to chief executives of Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Lidl and Aldi, claims supermarket buying practices are ""all too often imbalanced, short term and wasteful"".

It states: ""Farmers are denied commitment or security - with whole crops rejected at the last minute in favour of cheaper options elsewhere, or just because supermarkets change their mind.

""Good food ends up rotting in the field. Farmers are left without payment for their crops. And without a stable, reliable income, they are struggling to survive.

""If farms continue to close, the British produce that customers know and love risks disappearing from your shelves altogether.""

Almost 5,000 people have signed a petition which calls on government to amend the grocery supply code of practice to require retailers to ""buy what they agreed to buy, pay what they agreed to pay, agree on fair specifications, commit to the long term and pay [farmers] on time"".

The government must also ""stand up for British food and farming through robust regulation of the relationship between supermarkets and suppliers"".

The letter has been signed by more than 100 farmers, chefs and celebrities, including industry bodies Sustain and the Soil Association, chef Rick Stein, Dragon's Den star Deborah Meaden, and TV presenters Julia Bradbury and Jimmy Doherty.

201,"What would a tenant farming commissioner offer the sector?","https://www.fwi.co.uk/business/business-management/tenancies-rents/what-would-a-tenant-farming-commissioner-offer-the-sector","What would a tenant farming commissioner offer the sector?

The government's promise to issue a call for evidence this summer on the proposal for a tenant farming commissioner (TFC) for England is yet to be fulfilled.

That commitment came in response to one of the many recommendations made in the Rock Review of the tenanted sector.

The call will seek evidence on the benefits such a role could bring and how it might work in practice, says Defra.

A tenant farming commissioner would aim to ensure government policy is tenant proof and that there is fairness within the tenanted sector, says the Rock Review.

The review also calls for a commissioner to have the remit to examine and strengthen dispute resolution processes between landlords and tenants.

See also: Rock review – what are the keys to a vibrant tenanted sector?

Scotland's TFC success

Scotland introduced a tenant farming commissioner in 2017 and its first appointee, Dr Bob McIntosh, remains in the role.

His approach and achievements have been roundly welcomed by both landlord and tenant organisations.

Christopher Nicholson, chairman of the Scottish Tenant Farmers Association (STFA), says the establishment of the office of TFC in Scotland has brought huge benefits to the country's tenanted sector:

""It is not just the tenanted sector that has benefited from the TFC, but also wider land reform issues currently being addressed by the Scottish Land Commission, which has seen the benefit of codes of practice and is looking to apply similar principles to other areas of land management in Scotland,"" says Christopher.

Landowner body Scottish Land & Estates also sees the appointment as very constructive in facilitating sensible discussions.

""Bob is hugely respected by everyone – which is vital - and rather than favouring any side, he has worked diligently for the overall good of the sector,"" says Stephen Young, SLE's director of policy.

""Key to the success of the tenant farming commissioner is setting out a clear remit for the role and then finding someone with the knowledge, experience and willingness to maintain neutrality in order to provide confidence to all stakeholders in the sector.

""In Scotland, we've been very fortunate that Bob McIntosh has worked positively with tenants, landlords and other parties to bring people together even when difficult discussions have been necessary.

""One of Bob's first successes was creating a series of good practice guidance, in conjunction with stakeholders, on how many aspects of tenant-landlord negotiations should be conducted.

""It was a beneficial development that gave sensible steps for different parties to follow, hopefully making matters less adversarial in the process.

""In that regard, the role of the TFC has been really constructive, not in creating new bureaucracy or another figure to wield power over the sector, but in facilitating sensible discussions than can avoid the mistaken pursuit of new legislation being introduced to solve problems.""

What has the Scottish TFC achieved?

Scottish tenant farming commissioner (TFA) Dr Bob McIntosh was the Scottish government's director for environment and forestry between 2012 and 2015.

Prior to that was the director of Forestry Commission Scotland. He is also a partner in a 263ha hill farm.

Among his achievements are the establishment of the Tenant Farming Advisory Forum, bringing together many organisations to discuss issues affecting the tenanted sector.

The forum advises on priorities for the codes of practice issued by the TFC, for commissioning research and investigative studies and identifying barriers to creating a thriving tenant farming sector.

Bob has also produced many guides and codes of practice for the sector, including on:

Means of reporting alleged beaches of the TFC Scotland codes have been created by Bob, who has also produced a recent guide on how it might be made easier for tenants to plant trees and on alternative dispute resolution in resolving tenancy matters.  

Reaction to TFC for England proposal

The possibility of a TFC for England has had a broadly very positive reception. Tenant Farmers Association chief executive George Dunn is anxious that the call for evidence is not further delayed.

""In addition, the call for evidence itself must not be an excuse to push this issue into the long grass,"" he says.

""In the light of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs select committee's inquiry into the tenanted sector, it would be helpful for Defra to ask the committee to help it gather views on the terms of reference, governance, structure and role of a tenant farming commissioner.""

""It would also seem sensible for the commissioner either to chair the newly established farm tenancy forum or at least be a standing member of it.""

The justification for creating the role of a commissioner is already clearly set out within the Rock Review report, says George, so the call for evidence should be used to answer questions on how a commissioner for England should operate.

""Their role would not be to lobby for tenants but to benefit both sides,"" he says.

He sums up the TFC's principal functions outlined by the Rock Review as covering the following areas:

Many sectors of the economy and society have an ombudsman or a commissioner where people can receive independent support and advice, particularly in circumstances where one side or other holds a dominant position, points out the TFA.

""There is much that a commissioner could bring to ensure both fairness within the landlord tenant sector and that it plays its part in delivering wider environmental and social outcomes for the nation as a whole,"" says George.

CLA remains unconvinced

Country Land and Business Association president Mark Tufnell says the organisation is not yet convinced that the tenant farming commissioner role is necessary.

""This role will be looked at by the Farm Tenancy Forum and further evidence needs to be gathered,"" he says. ""The CLA supports a thriving tenanted sector that works for both landlords and tenants.

""Collaboration is increasingly important, and many landlords are already engaging with their tenants on participating in schemes.

""Learning from Scotland, both the remit of a tenant farming commissioner and the independence of the person appointed to the role are absolutely critical should the minister decide to set one up.

""Trust is a vital ingredient in a flourishing tenanted sector, so impartiality of any commissioner would have to be enshrined in legislation, and rigorously upheld by the office holder.""

Recourse to any commissioner would have to be available to both landlords and tenants, says the CLA.

202,"Scientists challenge ‘green’ claims of organic farming lobby","https://www.fwi.co.uk/news/environment/scientists-challenge-green-claims-of-organic-farming-lobby","Scientists challenge ‘green’ claims of organic farming lobby

A group of scientists has challenged the claims of organic certification body Organic Farmers and Growers (OF&G) that trebling the area farmed organically will deliver significant climate change and biodiversity benefits.

The claims are contained in a new report, Growing organic - a multifunctional component of English land use policy, which says a targeted shift towards organic farming can help the government meet its climate change and biodiversity goals.

See also: How nature focus helps profits rise on east Kent farm

OF&G calculates that if 10% of English farmland was organic, ammonium nitrate use would fall by around 179,000t, leading to a greenhouse gas reduction equivalent to the carbon sequestered by 135,000ha of broadleaved trees.

The report also claims that organic systems are associated with a 21% increase on the number of field margin plant species, a 35% increase in farmland bird species, and a 26% gain in pollinator abundance, linked to the absence of pesticides.

""Underwritten by clearly defined and auditable legal standards, organic is proven to provide significant improvements in public goods delivery and natural capital gains,"" said OF&G chief executive Roger Kerr.

Challenge

But pro-science think-tank Science for Sustainable Agriculture has challenged these claims.

""The scientific evidence increasingly indicates that optimising food production on as small a land area as possible is the most sustainable way to feed a growing population, while leaving space for nature and carbon sequestration,"" said a spokesman.

""OF&G's 10% target for organic land use is relatively modest, but the fact remains that any increase in organic farming will inevitably reduce yields, requiring more land elsewhere to make up for the loss in production.

""This could have significantly worse environmental and climate impacts at a global level. It would also drive up prices to consumers, many of whom cannot afford to pay a premium for organic food. These factors do not appear to have been accounted for in the report.""

Dismissed

But Mr Kerr dismisses these claims, saying the conventional approach to food production doesn't offer any assurances of self-sufficiency.

""Recent events arising from the invasions of Ukraine shows how febrile and volatile markets can be,"" he said. 

""To deliver food security (nutritional, economic and environmental) we must explore approaches that reduce dependency on fossil fuel energy and are integrated with climate mitigation and adaptation, and biodiversity restoration.

""Organic has a positive part to play in this and within a wider land use framework.""

With regards to food prices, Mr Kerr points to evidence elsewhere in Europe. ""Where organic food is integrated in the mainstream offering, food prices are comparative with non-organic. However, in the UK, retailers position organic as premium,"" he said.

OF&G wants to see greater government support for organic farming within the upcoming Land Use Framework, both through Defra's Environmental Land Management schemes and with more public investment in organic research and development.

Dr Simon Griffiths

 Designing Future Wheat John Innes Centre

 Simon studies height and flowering time in bread wheat and the genes which control the interaction between these traits to influence yield.

 Simon's research undertakes large scale screening of wheat lines, using mapping techniques to identify QTL for traits of interest.

 Simon uses field phenomics platforms to measure traits in real time under agricultural conditions and identifies markers targeted to specific environments. These are used to inform breeders of traits of interest alongside provision of pre-breeding germplasm.





 The group study height and flowering time in bread wheat, taking the two characteristics together, because the developmental processes behind them are entwined, exerting a complex influence on the way a wheat crop fits lifecycle to environment while allocating captured resources to one organ or another. What genes control this balancing act?

 To answer this question, specialised techniques are used pinpoint genes within the large and complex genome of bread wheat. The specific DNA sequence changes that confer beneficial effects are identified and tools developed that allow breeders to use this new knowledge for the production of elite wheat varieties. Extensive use is made of Landraces to capture genetic variation that is lost to modern bread wheat but through work carried out here can now be used.

 The genes identified in this work operate within molecular networks. They see how they operate within these networks to provide new ideas for the application of the genetic architecture of wheat to design new varieties of this crop fit for the challenge of sustainable food security.

Clarkson's Farm star Kaleb Cooper has announced plans to launch a bursary to help Royal Agricultural University (RAU) students to pursue careers in agriculture.

Self-made agricultural entrepreneur and farming contractor Kaleb shot to fame overnight on Clarkson's Farm, Amazon Prime's hit TV series which follows the ups and downs of Jeremy Clarkson as he tries to run a business on his Oxfordshire farm.

The 24-year-old has been working in and around farms since he was a schoolboy and is a passionate supporter of UK agriculture and opportunities for young people to enter the sector.

See also: Clarkson's Farm 2 prompts mass support for British farming

On Thursday 11 May, Mr Cooper joined undergraduate RAU students in Cirencester to launch his new annual bursary, which will provide £3,000 to support a student in exploring different paths into agriculture.

Work placement

It includes the opportunity of getting a work placement with Mr Cooper himself, or one of his industry partners, either during the student’s university studies, or as a gap year placement.

Open to RAU undergraduate students who are living in the UK, the bursary will start accepting applications in September, with the first student receiving their award in early 2024.

Mr Cooper is keen to encourage applicants who are not from a farming/agricultural background and those who can demonstrate hardship or financial need.

He said: ""Having come from a non-farming background myself, I believe agriculture can be for anybody. I know there's so much potential for young people to have brilliant careers in agriculture.

""It should be open to all, and if you have financial difficulties or you're completely new to farming, please do apply.""

RAU vice-chancellor Peter McCaffery said he was delighted Mr Cooper had chosen to support RAU students.

""This bursary will help to give the successful applicant the chance to follow their dreams and pursue a career in agriculture as Kaleb himself did. We are very excited to be working with him,"" Prof McCaffery added.

Who is Kaleb Cooper?

Kaleb Cooper is a farming contractor from Oxfordshire and bestselling author of The World According to Kaleb. He plays a central advisory role to Jeremy Clarkson in the Prime Video series Clarkson's Farm.

Growing up in the Cotswolds, Mr Cooper knew he wanted to be a farmer from a very young age. At 13, he was given responsibility for three chickens on four acres of land. Within months, this turned into 450 hens, laying eggs that he sold to teachers at his school.

By the age of 14, he was breeding sheep and working on a dairy farm and at 15 he bought his first tractor. On leaving school, he went on to study agriculture at Moreton Morrell College, before setting up his own farm contracting business.

Now aged 24 - and with a growing family (baby number two is due next month) - Mr Cooper recently wrote his debut book, The World According to Kaleb, which immediately became a Sunday Times bestseller and has already sold more than 80,000 copies. His second book, Britain According to Kaleb, is due out in October this year.

Tucked into the south-west corner of Scotland in an area dominated by livestock, lies the Lawson's arable farm which yielded a surprise 6.2t/ha crop of oilseed rape. 

What started out as a suckler farm with up to 600 head of cattle, Airlies Farm has since evolved into a full-scale arable unit run by brothers Mark, Philip and Ben, alongside Mark's wife Gina.

A rotation of winter wheat, winter barley and winter oilseed rape is in place.

With a strong focus and drive to improve crop performance, Mark Lawson’s crop of Acacia oilseed rape won silver in the 2022 Yield Enhancement Network (YEN) awards, achieving an impressive 84% of its 7.4t/ha yield potential.

""A silver win was really unexpected. Our farm average oilseed rape yields are about 3.7t/ha and if we push this to more than 4t/ha we are happy, let alone over 6t/ha.

""Our objective is to produce this level of yield consistently, year-on-year,"" he says.

Transitioning beef to arable

Airlies Farm is located in Wigtownshire, a 40-minute drive from the coast of Stranraer, and stands out among its neighbours with its purely arable rotation.

""Converting from beef to arable certainly didn't come without its challenges, especially when the farm is situated in a Scottish less favoured area,"" says Mr Lawson, who reflects on the ""months and months"" spent de-stoning the land.

He highlights how ""the excavator was the most used machine on farm"" and that growing crops on just 10-12cm of topsoil can be challenging.

Since 1989, the Lawsons had run a 230 cow suckler herd, but faced with increased feed and transport costs, the brothers decided to grow their own. Grain was kept as livestock feed while straw was used for bedding.

""We started trialling whole crop barley, wheat and triticale. After a few successful years, we ended up buying a 10-year-old Massey Ferguson 40RS auto-level machine with a 20ft header.

""We were impressed how the auto-level worked on our steep land,"" says Mr Lawson.

It wasn't long before a local grain merchant asked if the farm had surplus grain for sale, and from that the enterprise began to grow and grow. In 2017, the final cattle were sold.

However, being the only arable farm in a predominantly livestock area comes with many benefits.

""Pests and disease pressures are low and the different cropped environments benefit different wildlife species,"" explain Mr and Mrs Lawson.

Of the 320ha farm, 240ha is now under arable production with a rotation of winter wheat, winter barley and winter oilseed rape. Grass is grown for silage to support the farm's bed and breakfast cattle lets.

Winning ways

Mr Lawson reveals that it was a conversation with seed advisor Douglas Bonn of Nickersons which convinced him to enter YEN and explains the competition was a really positive experience.

“When the awards were announced we couldn't believe it.”

The winning oilseed crop was planted in August with a 6m Sulky disc drill at a seed rate of 3.55kg/ha, with an aim of 24 plants/sq m. Land was lightly cultivated with a Simba Xpress.

He aims to drill rapeseed as early as possible in August as he describes the weather as ""a cliff edge"". Although drilling into September is plausible, success or failure seems to be a lottery.

""The season before last, we lost all our rapeseed crops when we drilled in September after a late winter barley harvest.

""The OSR just about made it through to January, but with three to four weeks of freezing wind, crops burned off, and attacked by slugs and rabbits.""

The focus is on winter cropping as the farm's shallow and stoney soils which present just 10-12cm of top soil do not suit spring drilling in dry conditions.

But with such shallow soils restricting the development of deep burrowing tap roots - often deemed essential for effective nutrient and water uptake - how did crops perform so well?

In an area of high winter rainfall, shallow soils enable some reprieve as water percolates through the top soil.

This provides crops with a plentiful and accessible supply of water to combat the shallow root structures.

Agronomy

The crop came out of the winter well, so a growth regulation was applied at stem extension alongside a broad spectrum foliar feed and a total of 220kg N/ha.

Tissue analysis highlighted the crop was short of boron. A four-way mix of boron, carboxamide and triazolinthione fungicide for sclerotinia and a biostimulant spray was applied early-flowering.

Being so far north, the flowering period can last for many weeks, which prompted a second mid-flowering application.

This time, a crop enhancer to increase chlorophyll and maximise green leaf area was added.

Light leaf spot is the main disease threat at Airlies, but a robust spray programme keeps it in check.

""Harvest commenced on 5 August after a spraying off with glyphosate 10 days prior. We struggled to get the YEN crop into the trailer - so we knew we were onto some high yields.""

""We treated all rapeseed crops exactly the same as we wanted to use the YEN report to see how we could improve across the whole farm. There is always more to learn,"" concludes Mr Lawson.

The importance of lime

© Mark Lawson

Correcting pH levels was a key hurdle to overcome when converting the farm, with liming required annually.

Following difficulty finding reliable contractors, the family decided to take the job on themselves, purchasing a 20-year old Terra-Gator 1803 self-propelled lime spreader (pictured above), which has proven its worth.

""Our pHs are now 6.9-7.0 thanks to regular liming. It is an easy thing to neglect, but it has made a huge difference to soils,"" says Mr Lawson.

Wet autumn leaves half of winter area drilled

The Lawson family base their rotation on winter crops of wheat, barley and oilseed rape as spring crops grown in such shallow soils find it difficult to establish in dry conditions.

However, this season an extremely wet autumn prevented half of the winter area from being sown, leaving 120ha destined for spring barley.

Two varieties will be sown: Westminster and new addition Mermaid which is commonly grown in Northern Ireland.

Mark Lawson has recently purchased a second-hand direct drill and plans to trial this across the spring barley area. Also on order is a new Massey 8S.305 which he hopes will arrive before drilling commences.

What makes oilseed rape yield well?

A decade of YEN research shows that while light and water availability remain critical limiting factors to yield, successful crops must optimise biological growth to convert available energy into grain.

Maximising biomass puts crops in a prime position to convert sunlight into yield.

Historic YEN weather analysis and OSR yields reveal high yielding seasons are associated with a warm October, dry December, warm March, dry and sunny April, and a wet cool May.

Some fields are unsuitable for winter cropping next season because of the surge in blackgrass seed return from the higher number of blackgrass heads in winter wheat crops.

And it may also be the year for farmers to hit the reset button, with ploughs being dragged out of the nettles to fully bury seed in badly infested areas.

This is according to Niab weed biologist John Cussans, who believes drastic action will be needed to get blackgrass back to manageable levels.

See also: Expert advice on using rotations to tackle blackgrass hotspots

As the post-mortem starts on a disappointing season, he says one notable observation was the very variable levels of success, sometimes seeing good and poor control on the same farm.

To understand why, he points to the extreme conditions last autumn and this spring.

The autumn

Last autumn, it came down to the conditions when the crop was drilled.

Looking at the experience at Niab's Morley Farm in Norfolk, in the first half of October there was a prolonged period of low or no rainfall and limited sunshine.

It meant achieving a weed seed chit and effective stale seed-bed was difficult before drilling in many earlier sown crops.

Some crops were drilled at the start of this dry period and poor pre-emergence herbicide efficacy was seen.

""A lack of chit pre-drilling also meant more blackgrass plants were germinating into the sown crops,"" John says.

When the rain did arrive in the second half of October, the higher soil moisture did mean high herbicide efficacy and relatively low weed plant numbers for many of the late drillers.

That's why it is a very mixed picture in the autumn, he says.

The spring

Unseasonal conditions at the start of this year meant it was all about the development of the crop canopy, says John.

Relatively warm and dry conditions at the start of the year influenced crop canopy, resulting in reduced crop competition.

""You want canopies to take off and, with the later-drilled crops, the size of plants and surviving weeds meant they didn't get much competition.""

Then around the optimum timing for spring graminicides, higher-than-normal rainfall saw fewer opportunities to spray.

This all means a very mixed picture in the spring.

So where next? He believes the focus needs to be on risk management.

""Because of the incredible variability in the level of fresh seed return between farms and fields, a real assessment of the risk (weed pressure/conditions) in following crops is needed.""

If no ploughing has been carried out in a field, maybe this is the year to think about a reset, he says, especially if bromes are also an issue.

Where is the weed pressure greatest? Then the farmer can tailor sowing date and herbicide programme according to risk.

In some cases, he believes some fields are simply not suitable for winter cropping.

Longer term

In the longer term, John believes farmers need to have more of a focus on the crop itself, especially the period of rapid growth in the spring.

""There is an increasing frequency of springs where crops are subject to stress when they should be making rapid growth and finish the work of the pre-emergence herbicides.""

Case study: Pasture Hill Farm, Lincolnshire

Lincolnshire farmer Daniel King © MAG/Richard Allison

A brand new herbicide has helped one Lincolnshire farmer buck the trend this year, with fields being the cleanest he has seen for some time.

And the only difference to his approach at Pasture Hill Farm near Bourne is the inclusion of Luximo (cinmethylin) in his pre-emergence herbicide stack.

Farm Facts

Blackgrass has been Daniel King's biggest weed problem on his heavy soils in south Lincolnshire in the past 20 years.

In response, he widened his rotation, incorporated spring crops, and now grows competitive, fast growing wheat varieties such as Cranium and Champion.

These are drilled at high seed rates of 550-600/sq m with the aim of having a minimum of 300-350 plants/sq m in spring.

Daniel also applies a robust herbicide programme and hand-rogues blackgrass, depending on labour availability.

Delayed drilling

But he says the single most successful technique for reducing blackgrass numbers is delayed drilling until mid-October.

""In the past 10-15 years, we have gone as far as we can with delayed drilling in the last few days of October,"" he says.

""Drilling late is a nightmare on heavy soils like ours. We would love to drill earlier on our soils and the temptation is there, but the blackgrass will come back and bite you.""

Stale seed-beds are also part of his strategy. Where possible, a Horsch Terrano follows the combine to create a stale seed-bed. This is sprayed off at least once, if not twice, before drilling.

He has regained some control and believes he is getting up to 99% control, but admits it needs to be better to see further progress.

""It wasn't getting worse, but we also didn't seem to be improving.""

Luximo trials

Over the past three years, he has been involved in trials looking at BASF's new herbicide Luximo, to see if this could help improve control by beefing up his herbicide success.

Trials proved successful and this season, all his wheat received Luximo.

His wheat was drilled last autumn with a 6m Horsch Sprinter on 25-31 October.

Within two days of drilling, his wheat received a pre-emergence stack of 500g/ha of Luxinum (cinmethylin), 50g/ha diflufenican, 1,000g/ha pendimethalin plus Avadex Factor (tri-allate).

Then on 12 November, the worst bits received 120g/ha of flufenacet. Ideally, Niab’s John Cussans says best practice would be to include another mode-of-action active, such as Defy (prosulfocarb).

Previously Daniel's herbicide programme was Crystal (flufenacet + pendimethalin) plus diflufenican and Avadex (tri-allate).

Commenting on this year, he says: ""Crops are cleaner than ever.""

BASF business development manager Stuart Kevis explains that in 56 trials over three years, they saw an average 12.5 percentage points improvement when using a mix of Luxinum and pendimethalin plus diflufenican, compared with a comparable mix of Liberator (diflufenican + flufenacet) plus aclonifen.

But is not just the average: it is also more consistent, while the alternative mix saw years where it underperformed and others where it matched the Luxinum mix.

In 29 out of 56 trials (52%), the Luxinum stack saw 90% or greater control. However, it was only 17 trials out of 56 where Liberator plus aclonifen gave 90% or greater control, he explains.

Looking at two years of trials under relatively high blackgrass pressure (average blackgrass head count of 187/sq m), results show that it is a step on from existing options, even outperforming some mixes.

Luxinum on its own gave 90% control while a mix of Crystal + diflufenican gave 82% control and Liberator plus aclonifen averaged 80% control.

This compares with flufenacet alone at 66% and straight aclonifen at 52%.

Based on this, BASF sees it as the best building block in a pre-emergence stack, and says it should be used within an integrated approach like the one adopted by Daniel.

Stale seed-beds

There is a belief that cultivating after the combine, getting a good blackgrass flush and spraying it off will always mean less will emerge in the following crop.

While that is true in wet conditions, work by Niab suggests it isn't necessarily the case in very dry conditions.

That is because leaving seed exposed results in its degradation, while burying it just protects it.

So last year, the best approach in the bone-dry conditions was to do nothing until there was enough moisture to trigger germination.

Some fields are unsuitable for winter cropping next season because of the surge in blackgrass seed return from the higher number of blackgrass heads in winter wheat crops.

And it may also be the year for farmers to hit the reset button, with ploughs being dragged out of the nettles to fully bury seed in badly infested areas.

This is according to Niab weed biologist John Cussans, who believes drastic action will be needed to get blackgrass back to manageable levels.

See also: Expert advice on using rotations to tackle blackgrass hotspots

As the post-mortem starts on a disappointing season, he says one notable observation was the very variable levels of success, sometimes seeing good and poor control on the same farm.

To understand why, he points to the extreme conditions last autumn and this spring.

The autumn

Last autumn, it came down to the conditions when the crop was drilled.

Looking at the experience at Niab's Morley Farm in Norfolk, in the first half of October there was a prolonged period of low or no rainfall and limited sunshine.

It meant achieving a weed seed chit and effective stale seed-bed was difficult before drilling in many earlier sown crops.

Some crops were drilled at the start of this dry period and poor pre-emergence herbicide efficacy was seen.

""A lack of chit pre-drilling also meant more blackgrass plants were germinating into the sown crops,"" John says.

When the rain did arrive in the second half of October, the higher soil moisture did mean high herbicide efficacy and relatively low weed plant numbers for many of the late drillers.

That's why it is a very mixed picture in the autumn, he says.

The spring

Unseasonal conditions at the start of this year meant it was all about the development of the crop canopy, says John.

Relatively warm and dry conditions at the start of the year influenced crop canopy, resulting in reduced crop competition.

""You want canopies to take off and, with the later-drilled crops, the size of plants and surviving weeds meant they didn't get much competition.""

Then around the optimum timing for spring graminicides, higher-than-normal rainfall saw fewer opportunities to spray.

This all means a very mixed picture in the spring.

So where next? He believes the focus needs to be on risk management.

""Because of the incredible variability in the level of fresh seed return between farms and fields, a real assessment of the risk (weed pressure/conditions) in following crops is needed.""

If no ploughing has been carried out in a field, maybe this is the year to think about a reset, he says, especially if bromes are also an issue.

Where is the weed pressure greatest? Then the farmer can tailor sowing date and herbicide programme according to risk.

In some cases, he believes some fields are simply not suitable for winter cropping.

Longer term

In the longer term, John believes farmers need to have more of a focus on the crop itself, especially the period of rapid growth in the spring.

""There is an increasing frequency of springs where crops are subject to stress when they should be making rapid growth and finish the work of the pre-emergence herbicides.""

Case study: Pasture Hill Farm, Lincolnshire

Lincolnshire farmer Daniel King © MAG/Richard Allison

A brand new herbicide has helped one Lincolnshire farmer buck the trend this year, with fields being the cleanest he has seen for some time.

And the only difference to his approach at Pasture Hill Farm near Bourne is the inclusion of Luximo (cinmethylin) in his pre-emergence herbicide stack.

Farm Facts

Blackgrass has been Daniel King's biggest weed problem on his heavy soils in south Lincolnshire in the past 20 years.

In response, he widened his rotation, incorporated spring crops, and now grows competitive, fast growing wheat varieties such as Cranium and Champion.

These are drilled at high seed rates of 550-600/sq m with the aim of having a minimum of 300-350 plants/sq m in spring.

Daniel also applies a robust herbicide programme and hand-rogues blackgrass, depending on labour availability.

Delayed drilling

But he says the single most successful technique for reducing blackgrass numbers is delayed drilling until mid-October.

""In the past 10-15 years, we have gone as far as we can with delayed drilling in the last few days of October,"" he says.

""Drilling late is a nightmare on heavy soils like ours. We would love to drill earlier on our soils and the temptation is there, but the blackgrass will come back and bite you.""

Stale seed-beds are also part of his strategy. Where possible, a Horsch Terrano follows the combine to create a stale seed-bed. This is sprayed off at least once, if not twice, before drilling.

He has regained some control and believes he is getting up to 99% control, but admits it needs to be better to see further progress.

""It wasn't getting worse, but we also didn't seem to be improving.""

Luximo trials

Over the past three years, he has been involved in trials looking at BASF's new herbicide Luximo, to see if this could help improve control by beefing up his herbicide success.

Trials proved successful and this season, all his wheat received Luximo.

His wheat was drilled last autumn with a 6m Horsch Sprinter on 25-31 October.

Within two days of drilling, his wheat received a pre-emergence stack of 500g/ha of Luxinum (cinmethylin), 50g/ha diflufenican, 1,000g/ha pendimethalin plus Avadex Factor (tri-allate).

Then on 12 November, the worst bits received 120g/ha of flufenacet. Ideally, Niab’s John Cussans says best practice would be to include another mode-of-action active, such as Defy (prosulfocarb).

Previously Daniel's herbicide programme was Crystal (flufenacet + pendimethalin) plus diflufenican and Avadex (tri-allate).

Commenting on this year, he says: ""Crops are cleaner than ever.""

BASF business development manager Stuart Kevis explains that in 56 trials over three years, they saw an average 12.5 percentage points improvement when using a mix of Luxinum and pendimethalin plus diflufenican, compared with a comparable mix of Liberator (diflufenican + flufenacet) plus aclonifen.

But is not just the average: it is also more consistent, while the alternative mix saw years where it underperformed and others where it matched the Luxinum mix.

In 29 out of 56 trials (52%), the Luxinum stack saw 90% or greater control. However, it was only 17 trials out of 56 where Liberator plus aclonifen gave 90% or greater control, he explains.

Looking at two years of trials under relatively high blackgrass pressure (average blackgrass head count of 187/sq m), results show that it is a step on from existing options, even outperforming some mixes.

Luxinum on its own gave 90% control while a mix of Crystal + diflufenican gave 82% control and Liberator plus aclonifen averaged 80% control.

That is because leaving seed exposed results in its degradation, while burying it just protects it.

So last year, the best approach in the bone-dry conditions was to do nothing until there was enough moisture to trigger germination.

After another delay, applications for the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) 2023 are due to finally open in mid-September, with the new no use of insecticide action being one of the most welcomed. 

Changing the way a crop is grown to enhance its environmental benefits and address biodiversity decline is the basis behind some of the new SFI 2023 actions.

The no insecticide option, IPM4, is one of these actions - offering farmers £45/ha for land managed without the use of insecticides.

See also: Why wheat drill dates should be delayed this autumn

It can be used on its own, or together with the three other actions under the IPM offer, as part of the SFI's more flexible, less-prescriptive approach.

IPM1 (produce an IPM plan), IPM2 (flower-rich margins) and IPM3 (companion crop) are all intended to help build natural predator numbers and provide protection, easing the pain of going chemical-free.

Added to cultural control techniques, such as delayed drilling, their implementation should help with the eventual goal of eliminating the use of sprays, by tipping the balance in favour of natural enemies.

On some farms, insecticides have already been confined to history.

On others, the transition is about to get under way, with growers keen to understand how to reduce the risk associated with not spraying for pests.

Farmers Weekly spoke to experts about how to approach this action.

Nick Wall, independent agronomist, Crop Management Partners and Groundswell Agronomy

Nick Wall © MAG/David Jones

The key consideration with an action like IPM4 is to do all the things you can to reduce the risk of pest attack before insecticides are removed, points out Nick Wall. 

""You need to work with an IPM approach,"" he says.

""If you have other measures in place, such as flower-rich margins, crop diversity and healthy soil, you are more likely to be successful, as beneficial and predator numbers should be higher.""

Risk level

Deciding what level of risk you are prepared to take is another important step, he adds, as simply not using an insecticide in a monoculture situation often works in the pest's favour – pest populations can build quickly, so with a low natural predator population there will be a lag before they catch up to save potential crop loss.

""Aphids are attracted to unhealthy crops and those with high levels of nitrate, so it's important to get plants photosynthesising to their maximum potential.

“Growers who use Brix measurements as part of their agronomy should be aiming for a reading above 9/10 - at this level crops are less susceptible to attack."" 

There is usually groundwork to be done before inputs can be eliminated and patience is required, advises Nick.

""It might take a couple of years to get to where you want to be. Going cold turkey seldom works in the way you want it to.""

Barley yellow dwarf virus

With problems such as barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), there are cultural control techniques such as later drilling and genetic resistance bred into new wheat varieties that can reduce its incidence. Monitoring for aphids also helps.

There are also a number of useful decision support tools, such as the Rothamsted Insect Survey and the updated Adas/AHDB T-sum predictor model, he adds.

""Good agronomic practice is essential. There's no doubt that milder autumns and winters increase the threat, as the virus-carrying aphids remain active for longer.""

He adds that while the SFI payment is not enough to cover the cost of BYDV damage - where 20-25% yield loss is typical - being aware of the risk is important.

Even farms that made two applications of insecticide last autumn didn't necessarily escape crop damage.

Not all agronomic challenges related to pests have the same solutions, he warns.

Cabbage stem flea beetle

Oilseed rape drilling, for example, can't be delayed for long, so the cabbage stem flea beetle threat is harder to avoid unless the whole farming system is working well and there are good numbers of natural predators.

He advises growers to map their farms to identify the high-risk fields, where there have previously been pest issues.

""They tend to be the more sheltered ones."" These may not be the right sites to enter land into the IPM4 action, he cautions.

In the same way, wheat following oats can be susceptible to frit fly attack, so may not be suitable.

Sam Cook, behavourial ecologist, Rothamsted Research

MAG/David Jones

Oilseed rape

There is no point in using an insecticide on oilseed rape, as all of the insect pests associated with the crop have high levels of resistance to pyrethroids, reports Dr Sam Cook.

For this reason, the oilseed rape crop could be a good place to start with the new SFI action, as chemical pest control is already difficult following the revocation of some products and the ineffectiveness of others.

IPM approaches have been shown to help with pest regulation, she advises.

Beneficials

""Growers need to have confidence in beneficials and must manage the agri-environment in such a way that allows these predators to do the job of an insecticide.""

For most, a combination of agronomic and habitat management techniques will support beneficial populations and increase the probability of pest kill, she adds.

In practice, that means reducing or eliminating tillage in most situations, increasing plant diversity throughout the rotation and around the farm, as well as cutting insecticide use on crops as far as possible.

""There's no safe spray window for parasitoids, for example,"" Sam points out.

""These are specialist predators and they need to be present in fields before the exponential increase in pest numbers. Spraying doesn't help their cause.""

While there are still knowledge gaps in the identification and effectiveness of natural enemies, there has been work done on both generalist and specialist insects that are found in oilseed rape.

The one that has created the most excitement is a parasitoid known as Microtonus brassicae, which attacks the adult cabbage stem flea beetle, reports Sam.

""Up to 33% parasitisation rates have been detected in Rothamsted work,"" she says.

""This particular parasitoid attacks flea beetles at the end of the summer, with the larvae then developing inside the beetle. None of the parasitised beetles lay eggs.""

Another parasitoid, Tersilochus microgaster, attacks flea beetle larvae, so helps to reduce populations for the following year, she adds.

Boosting the numbers of these beneficials can be done by reducing tillage - parasitoids pupate in the soil as cocoons, so ploughing buries them.

In the same way, carabid beetle numbers - some of which may help with flea beetle control by eating their eggs - are affected by tillage.

Plant diversity

Greater plant diversity both in and around fields will also help, with semi-natural habitats adjacent to fields helping to support natural enemies.

The use of trap crops, companion plants and extended rotations is encouraged, as are field margins.

""Remember that you need brassicas in these margins if you want to build up populations of brassica specialists. Forage rape is a good all-rounder.""  

Companion plants are useful with early sown oilseed rape crops, but there is less need for them with later sowings, advises Sam.

""In the absence of insecticides, you need the basics of a good seed-bed and moisture at drilling.

""The problems that were seen with stem weevil last year resulted because neonicotinoid seed treatments have gone and there is already resistance to pyrethroids. So think of all the things you can do to support predators and beneficials.""

Case study: Costow Farms, Northamptonshire

Insecticides haven't been used in either cereals or oilseed rape for the past seven years by grower Stephen Goodwin, vice-chairman of Base-UK.

He acknowledges that the farm has never had a bad barley yellow dwarf virus problem.

While that made his decision to stop spraying for aphids easier, his belief that insecticides were doing more harm than good was the main reason for eliminating them from his very diverse, mixed farming system.

Cultural controls

Stephen has also used cultural control techniques to manage any risk and pushed wheat drilling back to the end of September, pointing out that nothing is up before October.

""That's helped with any pressure,"" he says. ""We haven't seen any major issues, so fingers crossed that it remains that way. The changing climate does make it all much more of a lottery.""

He adds that beneficial numbers have increased in his regenerative system, also helped by his use of direct drilling, so he can see the biodiversity benefits of changing his approach.

Oilseed rape crops haven't received an insecticide since testing confirmed there was 80% resistance to pyrethroids in the cabbage stem flea beetle population.

""They may be cheap and cheerful, but they wouldn't work,"" he stresses.

The Sustainable Farming Incentive 2023 payment of £45/ha is appealing to Stephen, who continues to look at what the scheme has to offer and whether it would work on his farm.

""In the meantime, we are going ahead with a new Mid-Tier Countryside Stewardship agreement.""

With problems such as barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), there are cultural control techniques such as later drilling and genetic resistance bred into new wheat varieties that can reduce its incidence. Monitoring for aphids also helps.

There are also a number of useful decision support tools, such as the Rothamsted Insect Survey and the updated Adas/AHDB T-sum predictor model, he adds.

""Good agronomic practice is essential. There's no doubt that milder autumns and winters increase the threat, as the virus-carrying aphids remain active for longer.""

He adds that while the SFI payment is not enough to cover the cost of BYDV damage - where 20-25% yield loss is typical - being aware of the risk is important.

Even farms that made two applications of insecticide last autumn didn't necessarily escape crop damage.

Not all agronomic challenges related to pests have the same solutions, he warns.

Cabbage stem flea beetle

Oilseed rape drilling, for example, can't be delayed for long, so the cabbage stem flea beetle threat is harder to avoid unless the whole farming system is working well and there are good numbers of natural predators.

He advises growers to map their farms to identify the high-risk fields, where there have previously been pest issues.

""They tend to be the more sheltered ones."" These may not be the right sites to enter land into the IPM4 action, he cautions.

In the same way, wheat following oats can be susceptible to frit fly attack, so may not be suitable.

Oilseed rape

There is no point in using an insecticide on oilseed rape, as all of the insect pests associated with the crop have high levels of resistance to pyrethroids, reports Dr Sam Cook.

For this reason, the oilseed rape crop could be a good place to start with the new SFI action, as chemical pest control is already difficult following the revocation of some products and the ineffectiveness of others.

IPM approaches have been shown to help with pest regulation, she advises.

Beneficials

""Growers need to have confidence in beneficials and must manage the agri-environment in such a way that allows these predators to do the job of an insecticide.""

For most, a combination of agronomic and habitat management techniques will support beneficial populations and increase the probability of pest kill, she adds.

In practice, that means reducing or eliminating tillage in most situations, increasing plant diversity throughout the rotation and around the farm, as well as cutting insecticide use on crops as far as possible.

""There's no safe spray window for parasitoids, for example,"" Sam points out.

""These are specialist predators and they need to be present in fields before the exponential increase in pest numbers. Spraying doesn't help their cause.""

While there are still knowledge gaps in the identification and effectiveness of natural enemies, there has been work done on both generalist and specialist insects that are found in oilseed rape.

The one that has created the most excitement is a parasitoid known as Microtonus brassicae, which attacks the adult cabbage stem flea beetle, reports Sam.

""Up to 33% parasitisation rates have been detected in Rothamsted work,"" she says.

""This particular parasitoid attacks flea beetles at the end of the summer, with the larvae then developing inside the beetle. None of the parasitised beetles lay eggs.""

Another parasitoid, Tersilochus microgaster, attacks flea beetle larvae, so helps to reduce populations for the following year, she adds.

Boosting the numbers of these beneficials can be done by reducing tillage - parasitoids pupate in the soil as cocoons, so ploughing buries them.

In the same way, carabid beetle numbers - some of which may help with flea beetle control by eating their eggs - are affected by tillage.

Plant diversity

Greater plant diversity both in and around fields will also help, with semi-natural habitats adjacent to fields helping to support natural enemies.

The use of trap crops, companion plants and extended rotations is encouraged, as are field margins.

""Remember that you need brassicas in these margins if you want to build up populations of brassica specialists. Forage rape is a good all-rounder.""  

Companion plants are useful with early sown oilseed rape crops, but there is less need for them with later sowings, advises Sam.

""In the absence of insecticides, you need the basics of a good seed-bed and moisture at drilling.

""The problems that were seen with stem weevil last year resulted because neonicotinoid seed treatments have gone and there is already resistance to pyrethroids. So think of all the things you can do to support predators and beneficials.""

Case study: Costow Farms, Northamptonshire

Insecticides haven't been used in either cereals or oilseed rape for the past seven years by grower Stephen Goodwin, vice-chairman of Base-UK.

He acknowledges that the farm has never had a bad barley yellow dwarf virus problem.

While that made his decision to stop spraying for aphids easier, his belief that insecticides were doing more harm than good was the main reason for eliminating them from his very diverse, mixed farming system.

Cultural controls

Stephen has also used cultural control techniques to manage any risk and pushed wheat drilling back to the end of September, pointing out that nothing is up before October.

""That's helped with any pressure,"" he says. ""We haven't seen any major issues, so fingers crossed that it remains that way. The changing climate does make it all much more of a lottery.""

He adds that beneficial numbers have increased in his regenerative system, also helped by his use of direct drilling, so he can see the biodiversity benefits of changing his approach.

Oilseed rape crops haven't received an insecticide since testing confirmed there was 80% resistance to pyrethroids in the cabbage stem flea beetle population.

""They may be cheap and cheerful, but they wouldn't work,"" he stresses.

The Sustainable Farming Incentive 2023 payment of £45/ha is appealing to Stephen, who continues to look at what the scheme has to offer and whether it would work on his farm.

""In the meantime, we are going ahead with a new Mid-Tier Countryside Stewardship agreement.""

After another delay, applications for the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) 2023 are due to finally open in mid-September, with the new no use of insecticide action being one of the most welcomed. 

Changing the way a crop is grown to enhance its environmental benefits and address biodiversity decline is the basis behind some of the new SFI 2023 actions.

The no insecticide option, IPM4, is one of these actions - offering farmers £45/ha for land managed without the use of insecticides.

See also: Why wheat drill dates should be delayed this autumn

It can be used on its own, or together with the three other actions under the IPM offer, as part of the SFI's more flexible, less-prescriptive approach.

IPM1 (produce an IPM plan), IPM2 (flower-rich margins) and IPM3 (companion crop) are all intended to help build natural predator numbers and provide protection, easing the pain of going chemical-free.

Added to cultural control techniques, such as delayed drilling, their implementation should help with the eventual goal of eliminating the use of sprays, by tipping the balance in favour of natural enemies.

On some farms, insecticides have already been confined to history.

On others, the transition is about to get under way, with growers keen to understand how to reduce the risk associated with not spraying for pests.

Farmers Weekly spoke to experts about how to approach this action.

Nick Wall, independent agronomist, Crop Management Partners and Groundswell Agronomy

The key consideration with an action like IPM4 is to do all the things you can to reduce the risk of pest attack before insecticides are removed, points out Nick Wall. 

""You need to work with an IPM approach,"" he says.

""If you have other measures in place, such as flower-rich margins, crop diversity and healthy soil, you are more likely to be successful, as beneficial and predator numbers should be higher.""

Risk level

Deciding what level of risk you are prepared to take is another important step, he adds, as simply not using an insecticide in a monoculture situation often works in the pest's favour – pest populations can build quickly, so with a low natural predator population there will be a lag before they catch up to save potential crop loss.

""Aphids are attracted to unhealthy crops and those with high levels of nitrate, so it's important to get plants photosynthesising to their maximum potential.

“Growers who use Brix measurements as part of their agronomy should be aiming for a reading above 9/10 - at this level crops are less susceptible to attack."" 

There is usually groundwork to be done before inputs can be eliminated and patience is required, advises Nick.

""It might take a couple of years to get to where you want to be. Going cold turkey seldom works in the way you want it to.""

Barley yellow dwarf virus

With problems such as barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), there are cultural control techniques such as later drilling and genetic resistance bred into new wheat varieties that can reduce its incidence. Monitoring for aphids also helps.

There are also a number of useful decision support tools, such as the Rothamsted Insect Survey and the updated Adas/AHDB T-sum predictor model, he adds.

He adds that while the SFI payment is not enough to cover the cost of BYDV damage - where 20-25% yield loss is typical - being aware of the risk is important.

Even farms that made two applications of insecticide last autumn didn't necessarily escape crop damage.

After winning a net-zero food and farming competition, Oxfordshire farmer Ben Adams is conducting a field-scale intercropping trial to assess which crop combinations perform best in terms of yield, quality and harvest ease.

Intercropping with legumes has so far completely eliminated artificial fertiliser and fungicide requirements, says Ben.

""No inputs have been applied or will be applied apart from the glyphosate desiccation of the prior cover crop.""

Now he hopes to increase land output.

See also: Farmers to reap slice of £5.9m Defra-funded pulse project

Already an enthusiast for field trials at Lower Farm, near Bicester, Ben entered the School of Sustainable Food and Farming net-zero competition which offers funding to farmers with a sustainable farming idea, system or process.

His three-year study project focuses on finding the value of intercropping with legumes across field-scale trials and was awarded more than £11,000.

Intercropping trial

A mix of peas, beans, vetch, oilseed rape, mustard, oats and barley were put to the test this spring in nine different cropping combinations across a 16ha area on the 380ha family farm.

The range of crop combinations will trial how best to maximise yield and quality while monitoring any issues with pests, weeds or disease.

Subsequent trial seasons will see him scale up the best-performing plots.

He hopes to not only cut inputs, but increase land output. Aiming for a 60% target yield of a monoculture crop, he sets his sight on a total land output of 120% where a bi-crop is grown.

This season saw him establish:

Intercropping trial © MAG/Emma Gillbard

Crop establishment

Crops were drilled on the 18 and 19 April, and sown in the same row with a 6m Horsch Avatar drill following an autumn-sown multispecies cover crop, which preceded a crop of winter wheat.

The cover crop was grazed by sheep and then sprayed off with 3 litres/ha of glyphosate.

A variety blend of beans, oats, barley and peas were used to increase the genetic diversity of crops on-farm, to better withstand pest and disease attack.

The varieties grown were:

End use

When it comes to harvest, Ben will use his conventional combine, but a compromise will need to be made to ensure optimum harvest for both crops.

""For example, with beans and oats, the concave will need to be set wide enough to not crack the beans but have the fan speed set low enough to not blow oats out the back of the combine,"" says Ben.

The mix will be run through the farm's three-screen rotary seed cleaner to separate the seed.

For the three-way intercrop, Ben predicts the grain will have to be run through the cleaner at least twice, which means a greater energy cost.

However, the input-cost saving through fertiliser and fungicides will outweigh the extra energy costs associated with seed separation.

Crops will be destined for the human consumption market if they meet the required grade; otherwise they will be sold for livestock feed.

A proportion of farm-saved seed will be kept to help cut seed costs for next season.

All straw will be chopped to return essential phosphorus, potassium and organic matter back to the soil.

After harvest, Ben plans to run through with a light set of discs to encourage a catch crop of volunteers, before planting a variety blend of winter wheat. 

This will, hopefully, benefit from the nitrogen reserves in the soil from the range of leguminous crops previously grown.

If you are interested in visiting Ben's intercropping trials, you can follow his video blog journey.

Industry partners for the project include: Morrisons, McDonald’s, Trinity Ag Tech, Trinity Global Farm Pioneers and Bradford Estates.

The cover crop was grazed by sheep and then sprayed off with 3 litres/ha of glyphosate.

A variety blend of beans, oats, barley and peas were used to increase the genetic diversity of crops on-farm, to better withstand pest and disease attack.

The varieties grown were:

End use

When it comes to harvest, Ben will use his conventional combine, but a compromise will need to be made to ensure optimum harvest for both crops.

""For example, with beans and oats, the concave will need to be set wide enough to not crack the beans but have the fan speed set low enough to not blow oats out the back of the combine,"" says Ben.

The mix will be run through the farm's three-screen rotary seed cleaner to separate the seed.

For the three-way intercrop, Ben predicts the grain will have to be run through the cleaner at least twice, which means a greater energy cost.

However, the input-cost saving through fertiliser and fungicides will outweigh the extra energy costs associated with seed separation.

Crops will be destined for the human consumption market if they meet the required grade; otherwise they will be sold for livestock feed.

A proportion of farm-saved seed will be kept to help cut seed costs for next season.

All straw will be chopped to return essential phosphorus, potassium and organic matter back to the soil.

After harvest, Ben plans to run through with a light set of discs to encourage a catch crop of volunteers, before planting a variety blend of winter wheat. 

This will, hopefully, benefit from the nitrogen reserves in the soil from the range of leguminous crops previously grown.

Industry partners for the project include: Morrisons, McDonald’s, Trinity Ag Tech, Trinity Global Farm Pioneers and Bradford Estates.

Heavily pregnant ewes and young lambs are being put at risk daily, according to a new NFU Mutual survey, with almost two-thirds of dog owners letting their pets run off the lead in the countryside.

The survey of more than 1,100 dog owners also found 39% acknowledged their pets don't always return when called, while 64% admitted their dogs will chase animals.

Almost half of respondents believed their own dog would not injure or kill livestock, but many were unaware that the distress of being chased, even if an attack doesn't take place, can still lead to in-lamb ewes aborting.

See also: What to do if you're a victim of""¦ sheep worrying

The findings have prompted NFU Mutual to launch a new campaign, to encourage dog owners to keep their pets under control in the countryside.

NFU Mutual is urging dog owners to prevent issues by:

Hannah Binns, rural affairs specialist at NFU Mutual, said: ""It's clear that a significant number of dog owners are blinded by their love for their pets and believe they would never chase, attack or kill livestock.

""We've heard reports from farmers that dog walkers are becoming more distracted, often on their mobile phones with their pets out of sight, and are seemingly unaware of the carnage their dog could cause.""

Ms Binns said the Covid-19 pandemic saw a boom in dog ownership, but many of these pets may not have been trained properly or be familiar with farm animals.

In 2022, industry figures found £1.8m worth of farm animals were either killed or severely injured by dogs, with the Midlands and the South West the two most affected areas.

Case study - Devon dog attack

In May 2022, 18 lambs were killed by two dogs that had managed to get into a shed and surrounding fields at a farm near Holsworthy, Devon.

A further 25 lambs survived the attack, but struggled to improve condition afterwards.

Sheep farmer Terry Priest said: ""There were a couple of dead lambs in the fields, but most of them were in the sheds. It was heart breaking, particularly for my wife and daughter, as they do most of the lambing and rearing, and look after the animals if they are sick.”

Mr Priest said there is not much you can do to stop other animals like dogs getting into the fields.

""I just wish people would keep their animals under control, using muzzles if need be, to keep them well away from livestock,"" he said.

The insurance company settled the claim for the 18 lambs lost in the attack and also paid out for a previous incident at the farm when five ewes and six lambs were killed in a separate dog attack.

Findings from a recent trial in Devon have concluded that outwintering cattle on a diverse mix of forages can help improve both animal and soil health, while also benefiting the wider environment.

The study, facilitated by Innovative Farmers and supported by the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group (FWAG), came about as the result of a ""field lab"".

See also: How multispecies swards can improve production efficiency

This sought to explore the relatively untapped area of using diverse forage mixtures for outwintering livestock, rather than monoculture brassicas, explains FWAG's Sarah Whaley, who led the research.

""In a standard monocropping brassica system, we're hammering our soils really hard,"" says Ms Whaley.

""We're trying to move away from this poached, muddy mess that sits there bare and is exposed to wind, rain and sediment loss. That sediment is your most valuable asset on farm because that's your topsoil.

""Topsoil is something that you can't just buy in in a bag - it's really valuable and we need to protect it.""

Monocultures also offer relatively little in the way of environmental benefits, she adds.

The objectives of the study were multifaceted and included determining suitable plant species and varieties for winter grazing.

These would need to maintain green leaf area and ground cover year-round, as well as providing suitable nutrition to animals for rumination. They would also need to maintain, or increase, daily liveweight gain.

In addition, the trial looked at whether these crops could help extend winter grazing and produce a ""second bite"" for cattle - something that monocrops such as kale do not allow.

Researchers were also keen to explore the benefits of diverse mixtures to the soil and wider environment, as well as how they stack up financially when compared with current outwintering systems.

Trial design

© Innovative Farmers

The trial compared the performance of monoculture kale with a diverse forage mix at four beef farms across Devon and Somerset (see ""Diverse forage trialist farms"") - two organic and two conventional - with every farm establishing 4ha (10 acres) of each crop.

The 16 species in the diverse mix were selected by the farmers for their soil health and ecological benefits, winter hardiness and fodder potential.

They comprised legumes, forbs (herbaceous flowering plants other than grasses), herbs, grasses and brassicas:

Cattle strip- or cell-grazed both plots, according to each farm's grazing system, moving once or twice a day, depending on performance.

Grazing period ranged from November to January. Cattle were weighed and body condition scored at the beginning and end of the grazing, and crop quality, yield and utilisation were calculated.

Researchers also carried out soil analysis and earthworm counts, and adviser Mike Ingram from FWAG SW's ecology team was brought in to carry out a bird survey to better understand if there was any impact on biodiversity.

Trial findings

Results varied from farm to farm, with all four trial sites observing significant differences in establishment and yields, as well as the timing and availability of the feed.

Cattle moved through the diverse forage mix more quickly. ""This requires greater land area, but potentially less supplementary feed. This could be improved with more winter-hardy species within the mix,"" suggests Ms Whaley.

Cattle grazing the diverse forage mix had consistently better dung scores.

There were also soil and environment benefits:

Next steps

The findings are drawn from one year's data, so further research is needed to perfect the mix and better understand how diverse species could offer advantages over traditional monocropping, explains Ms Whaley.

More work is expected to take place over the coming months and will focus on five key areas:

View from the field - Tom Armitage, Lower Brown Farm

Tom Armitage and Sarah Whaley © Innovative Farmers

Tom Armitage has seen positive results during the first year of trials at his 567ha (1,400-acre) organic upland farm near Huish Champflower, Somerset.

The farm is home to more than 900-head of cattle, including a 200-head suckler herd of Stabilisers. Outwintering is a long-standing part of the system and everything on farm is finished off forage.

Mr Armitage's outwintering system is based on a combination of diverse winter mixtures, kale and bale grazing. He got involved in the trial to further explore the potential of the diverse mixes.

The kale plot was drilled on 7 May 2022, following a three-year clover ley, at a seed rate of 5kg/ha and a cost of £62.50/ha. The diverse mix was sown on 10 May, following fodder beet, at a seed rate of 33kg/ha, and cost £88.50/ha.

Both plots were ploughed, rolled, power-harrowed, drilled, then rolled again. Neither received any inputs.

A cow group and a calf group strip-grazed the diverse forage plot from mid-November, moving twice daily, with the crop providing 48 head of cattle with 48 days of grazing.

Yields and costs

At the time of grazing, yield analysis was calculated at 6.17t dry matter (DM)/ha in the kale plot and 6.04t DM/ha in the trial plot.

These yields were calculated by consultants at Precision Grazing, using animal energy requirements for the grazing period.

Based on grazing 48 animals for 48 days, the total cost a head a day was 76p for the kale and 70p for the diverse forage mix.

Average daily liveweight gain for the calf group was higher on kale, at 900g, compared with 530g on the diverse forage mix.

Supplementary feed was needed with both crops, but more had to be fed with the kale, resulting in a higher cost overall.

Mr Armitage says he would reconsider including tillage radish as it came through early and dominated the diverse forage mix, before dying off. This impacted feed availability and subsequent animal performance.

He plans to add oats, peas, beans and barley into the mix for next year and is aiming to direct drill it in July.

UK agriculture faces a period of uncertainty, with the removal of direct support payments, volatile markets and tight margins leaving many farmers out of pocket.

At the same time, food production will need to increase to support an ever-growing population.

FW's business reporter Charlie Reeve looks at a range of innovations being developed that could support the farming industry in the face of these challenges.

Epiherd: Testing gene make-up to improve breeding

© Antler Bio

Epiherd, being developed by Irish company Antler Bio, tests which genes are active in a specific animal and uses this knowledge to inform breeding decisions.

It is currently being used in dairy herds to study each animal's genetics, looking at different genomic expressions to see which animals have the most useful active genes.

Farmers will then be able to view the Epiherd platform to compare cows and see top producing animals, viewing the different scores related to traits such as milk yield, fat and protein content, immunity, and environmental impact.

The current system requires a blood sample from each animal to be tested. In the future, tests should also be possible using milk samples, providing a more cost-effective and non-invasive approach.

Antler Bio is working with the Centre for Innovation Excellence in Livestock (Ciel) to test the Epiherd platform on farms in the UK and provide actionable insights for farmers based on the results.

© Antler Bio

Maria Jensen, Antler Bio's founder and chief executive, says: ""There is nothing like this yet in the livestock sector and we are the first company to bring this data on gene expressions to the farmer.""

The plan is to expand the current platform to beef cattle and to other species such as pigs in the coming years, according to Ms Jensen.

""For the next two years, we are going to be doing research and product development, and we then will be ready to launch Epiherd for any farmer to buy,"" she adds.

""However, the farms we are working with now are already getting advantages from the data. We are looking at expanding the number of farms we are working with in Finland, the UK and Ireland.""

LettUs Grow: Producing crops without soil

© LettUs Grow

Bristol-based startup LettUs Grow designs and builds aeroponic technology for vertical farms and greenhouses.

In aeroponics, the growing plants are suspended in the air, giving the roots more access to oxygen. The plants are irrigated using a nutrient-dense mist.

By allowing the plants' roots to access more oxygen, crops are able to achieve faster growth rates and improved yields.

The mist is created using ultrasonic waves, which produce much finer droplets than a standard spray nozzle.

The technology has the ability to be rolled out to larger growers such as large vertical farms, greenhouses and polytunnels using aeroponic rolling benches. 

Ben Crowther, the company's co-founder and chief technical officer, says: ""Aeroponic systems improve productivity and reduce water consumption per kilogram of produce grown.

""So it made sense for us to apply this in the environment where these enhancements can have the most impact - and that's in hectare-scale greenhouse and vertical farm production.

""Aeroponic rolling benches allow us to do this without re-designing the farm, so we can bring these benefits to new projects and existing facilities.""

Mr Crowther adds: ""By using aeroponics, growers are able to produce crops such as leafy greens and herbs, and propagate different crops such as fruits, all year round with a greatly reduced risk of damage by pests or disease.

""Although more energy is required compared to outdoor agriculture, aeroponic farmers can use a combination of renewable energy sources to mitigate rising energy costs.""

CattleEye: Watching out for lameness in cattle

© CattleEye

Designed to spot lameness in cattle as early as possible, CattleEye uses cameras and artificial intelligence to constantly monitor and analyse animal movements.

A camera is mounted to the roof or wall of a passage where cattle frequently walk, such as at the entry or exit of a milking parlour.

The camera is constantly recording, using electronic identification tags to film individual cows as they walk under the camera, and footage is then uploaded to the cloud.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is used to build up a profile of each cow by looking at key points on the animal over time to detect changes in its mobility.

As soon as the algorithm notices a change in the way a cow is walking, it can be reported to the farmer, often detecting lameness days or even weeks before it would normally be noticeable.

The software is also able to create a mobility score and a body condition score for each animal, allowing it to spot other issues such as changes in conformation.

CattleEye, which was founded in 2019 by Terry Canning, the son of a dairy farmer from Northern Ireland, and architect Adam Askew, is piloting the system on about 20 farms in the UK and a further 15 across Europe and America, focusing on larger dairy units in particular.

It is also working with major retailers including Tesco, Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer to help improve animal welfare on farm by reducing lameness, and has recently signed up a number of paying customers.

Ekogea: Seaweed extract to boost daily liveweight gains

Agri-tech business Ekogea has developed a feed ingredient that is said to produce noticeable productivity gains for poultry and pig producers.

BioComplex contains polyuronic acid and oligosaccharides (basic sugars) extracted from raw seaweed sourced from the Outer Hebrides. It is added to feed at a rate of about 500g to 1kg a tonne.

On-farm studies for poultry and pigs have found that it can increase daily liveweight gains, improve feed conversion efficiency and improve overall animal health.

Mike Clarke, head of animal health at Ekogea, says: ""If you were to feed that to a pig, cow, or chicken, it works as a pre-biotic, working in the lower intestine.

""The sugars feed bugs generically, so you have a huge increase in the number and diversity of organisms in the lower gut, while the polyuronic acid has lots of negative ions.

""That does two things: first, it alters which of those bugs get the benefit; second, it swings the balance of the bugs in the lower gut by competitive exclusion, towards the ones you want to be there.

""Those beneficial bugs improve the availability of nutrients in the lower gut, so more nutrients are available to be absorbed. That means there is extra energy available from a normal kilo of food.""

Mr Clarke says the product also helps to reduce ammonia emissions, creating a healthier environment for the animals and producing a more environment-friendly slurry.

Pig farmers have also reported reduced aggression in pigs being fed the product, he says, and increased nitrogen levels in muck.

Ongoing work is being carried out to establish benefits for other sectors from using the feed ingredient, such as better growth rates in beef and improved milk yields in dairy.

Agrointelli Robotti: Autonomous lightweight tractors

Danish manufacturer Agrointelli has developed its Robotti range of autonomous tractors that can reduce labour, limit soil compaction and lower operating costs.

Robotti tractors have been trialled with a range of crops, including potatoes, onions, oilseed rape and vegetables.

They have two diesel engines, four-wheel drive and a standard three-point linkage. Fuel consumption is low at three to six litres/hour.

The Robotti weighs roughly 3t, making it lighter than a conventional tractor.

The company has been focusing initially on sales in Europe and North America, although has begun expanding into the UK market and is working with Warwickshire-based sales and service provider Autonomous Agri Solutions.

Bennamann: Capturing methane to power the farm

© Bennamann

Cornish biofuels company Bennamann is delivering a solution to reduce methane emissions on farm and repurpose it for energy use.

The technology works by capturing methane from manure slurry lagoons using impermeable covers, predominantly on dairy farms.

Pollutants are filtered out using a fixed on-site plant room, and a mobile processing unit then converts the remaining biogas to biomethane in liquid or compressed gas form.

This product can then be used as an alternative fuel for vehicles, electricity generation and heating.

CNH Industrial, which includes brands such as Case IH and New Holland, has been investing in Bennamann since 2019 and recently acquired a controlling stake.

Derek Neilson, president of agriculture at CNH Industrial, says that by consolidating its share in Bennamann, it can offer customers a full energy production, storage and distribution service.

""This solution can transform farms into mini energy hubs that can satisfy their own energy needs, produce their own natural fertiliser, and sell any excess gas on the open market,"" he says.

""It also enables them to generate their own electricity. This makes us a true alternative energy enabler, able to serve myriad applications and contribute to a carbon-negative future.""

CNH Industrial recently released a prototype of its New Holland T7 Methane Power tractor.

CropLens AI: Crop management from space

UK-based Agrimetrics has launched an artificial intelligence service called CropLens AI that can identify and analyse crops using satellite imaging.

It has been found to provide up to 90% accuracy, depending on the time of year, and can identify five crop types: winter wheat, winter barley, oilseed rape, grass and ""other"".

With data updated every six days, farmers can use the data to know where to irrigate, when to apply nitrogen, predict yields, and predict pest and disease damage.

Matthew Smith, Agrimetrics' chief product officer, says: ""Real-time, accurate and reliable knowledge of what's happening on the ground and why, is now a critical success factor for actors across the agrifood value chain.

""Agrimetrics CropLens AI and the Agrifood Data Marketplace are making it easier, faster, and more affordable to generate actionable insights earlier in the season.""

Agri-tech hubs driving the future of farming

The UK agri-tech industry is estimated to be worth £14bn, according to industry figures, and it continues to grow.

Funding of £90m was provided by Innovate UK to help four dedicated agri-tech centres harness UK research expertise, as well as build new infrastructure and encourage innovation. These are:

The centres have been involved with more than 500 projects to date with a combined value of more than £80m, and have a projected return on investment to the UK economy of 13:1.

Ciel is helping to support industry-led research into new agri-tech solutions for the livestock sector.

Phil Bicknell, Ciel's head of business development, says: ""We have done a couple of rounds of seed funding, providing small amounts of money that businesses can tap in to, that we'll match fund for them to carry out research, typically around the £50,000 mark.""

Growth area

South-west England is proving to be a key growth area, with agri-tech businesses in the region having an estimated combined turnover of about £371m a year.

Joanna Rufus, chair of South West Agri-tech, said: ""We have over 200 small- to medium-sized agri-tech companies and 64 business support organisations, including centres of excellence.""

An event is taking place on 20 April at Exeter Racecourse, showcasing agri-tech start-ups in the region.

Another agribusiness incubator is Farm 491, based at the Royal Agricultural University in Gloucestershire, which is home to a number of start-ups and regularly runs networking events for the industry.

Would-be apprentices keen to work in nature-friendly farming have just a few days left to apply for what is a unique scheme operating in Cumbria. 

The course is run by Cumbria Connect, and offers two positions for a Level 3 Apprenticeship leading to the Level 3 Livestock Technician qualification, with applications due to close on Monday 11 December. 

Successful applicants will gain valuable on-farm employment experience across three sites - the RSPB at Haweswater, Lowther Estate and Low Beckside Farm with the Ernest Cook Trust.

See also: What does the future hold for agricultural apprenticeships?

The organisers say this will yield a wealth of practical knowledge for apprentices, allowing them to build skills in sustainable land management practices, including nature-friendly farming, the creation of new habitats and the restoration of existing ones. 

At the end of the 18 months, apprentices will have become qualified and proficient in working with livestock, using farm machinery, and brush cutting.

Bill Kenmir, conservation manager at Cumbria Connect, said: ""A key part of the programme is to encourage farming and conservation communities to work together, to pool our collective knowledge, skills and resources to work through this time of change in farming and land management.

""This apprenticeship scheme is specifically designed to do this, and it will also provide the participants with a broad range of skills and understanding to launch successful careers in sustainable farming and nature restoration.""

Case study 

At just 20 years old, Elli Foxton became the first nature-friendly farming apprentice on the Cumbria Connect scheme earlier this year.

She is now six weeks into the new course. 

""There are three farms within the apprenticeship, so I'm gaining valuable work experience and learning three completely different approaches to doing things,"" Ms Foxton explains. 

""I've loved spending time on the Lowther Estate with their Longhorn cattle, water buffalo and pigs.

""Coming up in the next couple of weeks I have the opportunity to learn hedge laying and dry stone walling at Low Beckside Farm with the Ernest Cook Trust.

""This apprenticeship is an amazing opportunity - a once in a lifetime thing. It pays a good wage and all the training is fully funded.

""I also believe it gives you a head start with future job prospects from the experience it gives you working in three different workplaces.""

A 26-strong farmer network set up by Agri-EPI is a key testing bed for emerging start-up precision farming companies and researchers to evaluate and demonstrate their new technologies in a commercial farm situation.

One of these is Suffolk organic farmer John Pawsey, who is trialling two new technologies for the arable side of his 650ha mixed arable and sheep farm.

The results so far highlight both the potential and the challenges for developing and commercialising these technologies.

1. Live grain protein analysis

Retrofitted to his Claas Lexion combine, a CropScan box takes grain samples from the grain elevator every 10 seconds, providing real-time protein and nitrogen data using near infrared (NIR) analysis.

""With GPS and the grain data, you're essentially quality mapping your farm,"" Mr Pawsey says.

The first use of the data is to help segregate or blend grain by quality, off the combine and into storage.

He explains: ""Having something on the combine that tells you about the average protein by combine tank or trailer load, depending on what you select, means you can direct the trailers from the field into the correct storage bay - helping separate feed wheat from milling wheat.""

That's working well in real-time, but downloading the data into a usable format for post-harvest analysis has proved more challenging, he says. ""The product is still being developed, so there is a way to go.""

John Pawsey © Tim Scrivener

He believes it has huge potential for any farm. ""It's one of those map layers that we are wanting to build up and interrogate alongside yield and soil maps to understand where the value is in our fields at a per-square-metre level.""

Mr Pawsey admits that it has been a bit of a frustrating journey, but is confident it will get there.

Putting it together with other data will bring valuable insights. ""For example, we are also recording work rates, so if you have part of a field that yields well and has good quality, but your work rate has slowed by 25%, you need to understand what that cost is.

""We just need a platform to put all the data on and analyse it.""

2. Drone monitoring of trials

Skippy Scout is a mobile app which automatically directs drones to various points in a field, takes images, analyses them for criteria such as crop and weed coverage, crop health and pest damage, and then creates an email field report of the flight.

The system is being used for the first time this season to help analyse field trials at Shimpling Park Farm.

""In the past we haven't been particularly rigorous at collecting and disseminating data to make best use of the information, so we're hoping Skippy Scout will help with this,"" Mr Pawsey says.

One key aim on the farm is to reduce cultivations, for both cost and soil health reasons. But in an organic system, ploughing is necessary to help with weed control.

Over the past few seasons, Mr Pawsey has reduced ploughing to just once in the rotation and started using overwintered green manure crops before spring crops, using a maximum of three shallow cultivations around February to create a seed-bed to keep it economically viable.

""But because of the clay content in our soils, we are finding we are getting more cloddy seed-beds,"" he says.

Therefore, he is trialling higher seed rates to help decide whether by doing so, he can lose a cultivation.

""We would be accepting a higher level of field losses because of the cloddiness, but compensating through the higher seed rate.""

The Skippy Scout software is helping analyse the trials, which are varying seed rates from his usual 250 seeds/sq m up to 325 seed/sq m, in increments of 25 seeds/sq m. ""We're looking at seed-bed conditions, emergence and vigour at 16 different points in the trial with the drone.""

Vigour is especially important in an organic crop, as early vigour will help smother weeds, he explains.

""As well as plant numbers, we're also looking at weed numbers - broad-leaved weeds in a wheat crop, and later at disease. In higher plant populations, some diseases benefit from being in a higher or lower plant population, so what impact will that have on our propensity to get disease?""

Yield and specific weight will also be analysed.

""It's a known fact that if you have a higher plant population, your specific weight will go down. Can we still hit the market specification of 72kg/hl, while having a higher yield from a higher plant population?""

Most of those initial plant and weed count assessments can be made by a drone in less than an hour, compared with perhaps a whole day doing it manually, Mr Pawsey explains.

While the time saving has been excellent, the initial trials have shown the Skippy Scout weed identification algorithm needs some tweaking, with some incorrect identification, and not returning to exactly the same square metre in the field to take pictures each time, he says.

""There is an error margin there, which they are addressing, so again, it is a journey.""

3. Robotics emerging to help fruit and veg growers

Robotic solutions are emerging to help solve two of the bigger challenges veg and fruit growers are facing - weed control and labour shortages.

Earth Rover is developing a solar-powered ultra-lightweight autonomous machine, which uses a concentrated beam of light to remove weeds in vegetable crops.

Initial trials have been conducted in organic broccoli and lettuce.

""We wanted a solution that didn't till the soil so we could build organic matter,"" says James Brown, co-founder and chief executive of Earth Rover.

The Claws-6 (Concentrated Light Autonomous Weeding and Scouting) robot kills weeds by focusing light on the meristem of the plant, increasing its temperature from 15C to 80C, bursting or disrupting the cells and killing the weed, he explains.

The lightweight platform means it can work in most conditions, even after rain or irrigation when weeds grow the most. The camera system can identify weeds down to 1mm in size.

Weeding is slow, but part of that is by design. ""We could weed continuously, but that requires huge extra capacity or alternatively will miss weeds. Our idea is to take out all weeds, with the smaller the weed the less energy it requires.""

Weeding costs are currently higher than chemical, although Mr Brown suggests that when the full cost is calculated, including environmental and greenhouse gas impacts of spraying, it is a different argument.

Another robot developer, Antobot, is developing scouting machines for high-value fruit crops, such as strawberries and apples.

""The robot can first map the field, so we know where all the plants are,"" explains Howard Wu, founder and chief executive officer of Antobot. ""Secondly, we have developed imaging technology that can characterise fruits.""

In strawberries and apples, that will help growers know how many fruits are growing, their size and weight, and whether they are ripe, Dr Wu says.

""With that information growers can make more optimised logistical decisions around labour and delivery to customers.""

A second robot has been designed to help with the heavy lifting at harvest, but ultimately the firm wants to develop robots that will be able to harvest crops.

A 26-strong farmer network set up by Agri-EPI is a key testing bed for emerging start-up precision farming companies and researchers to evaluate and demonstrate their new technologies in a commercial farm situation.

One of these is Suffolk organic farmer John Pawsey, who is trialling two new technologies for the arable side of his 650ha mixed arable and sheep farm.

The results so far highlight both the potential and the challenges for developing and commercialising these technologies.

1. Live grain protein analysis

Retrofitted to his Claas Lexion combine, a CropScan box takes grain samples from the grain elevator every 10 seconds, providing real-time protein and nitrogen data using near infrared (NIR) analysis.

""With GPS and the grain data, you're essentially quality mapping your farm,"" Mr Pawsey says.

The first use of the data is to help segregate or blend grain by quality, off the combine and into storage.

He explains: ""Having something on the combine that tells you about the average protein by combine tank or trailer load, depending on what you select, means you can direct the trailers from the field into the correct storage bay - helping separate feed wheat from milling wheat.""

That's working well in real-time, but downloading the data into a usable format for post-harvest analysis has proved more challenging, he says. ""The product is still being developed, so there is a way to go.""

He believes it has huge potential for any farm. ""It's one of those map layers that we are wanting to build up and interrogate alongside yield and soil maps to understand where the value is in our fields at a per-square-metre level.""

Growing cereals using regenerative farming techniques has been shown to reduce yield by about 10% compared with ploughing the soil, at least in the initial years of transition, a major new study run by Rothamsted Research has shown.

The first set of results from 24 trials first set up at Brooms Barn, Suffolk, and Harpenden, Hertfordshire, in 2017-18 have been published this week and confirm that reduced tillage resulted in lower crop yields – 7.4t/ha compared with 8.3t/ha at Brooms Barn, and 6.3t/ha compared with 6.9t/ha at Harpenden.

See also: Regenerative farming – the theory and the farmers doing it

The reduction varied according to the site, the crop previously grown in the field and the crop rotation, but overall the ploughed plots produced a higher caloric yield than systems under reduced tillage, the researchers found.

At 7.9t/ha, average wheat yields were higher at Brooms Barn than at Harpenden, where yields averaged 6.6t/ha, but part of the reason was because some plots were resown with spring wheat due to establishment failures at Harpenden.

Adding organic matter to the soil in the regenerative plots made a significant difference - spring barley yield increased by 8% on average.

No quick fix

Study team leader Prof Jon Storkey said the results so far suggest that regenerative farming is not a ""quick-fix"", with time needed to restore soil health and the ecosystem before benefits kick in.

But that could change as the system transitions to a more sustainable state.

""With so many variables in play, only a long-term, integrated approach will be able to tell us what really works in regenerative farming,"" said Prof Storkey.

The trial sites have contrasting soil types – Brooms Barn a sandy loam and Harpenden a silty clay loam.

Among the growing techniques used were no-till and diversified cropping.

In the long term, the trial will look at how different approaches to crop rotation, tillage, nutrition and crop protection might reduce inputs of pesticides and fertilisers, greenhouse gas emissions and support biodiversity, to investigate the synergies and trade-offs of each approach.

The team hopes the research will prompt similar experiments in other countries.

Prof Storkey said it was inevitable that trade-offs would be needed between maximising crop yield and protecting the environment.

""We need to better understand cropping as a complex system. That way we can create models for predicting the system response to the multiple factors that will affect farming as our climate and food demands change,"" he said.

The course runs for five days and is carried out on a monthly basis where participants will become accredited on a Civil Aviation Authority-approved remote-pilot and drone-spraying certification.

Rob Pearson, CEO of UK drone importer Autospray Systems, explains: ""According to the forecasts by PwC's Skies Without Limits report, by the turn of the decade the UK could have 900,000 drones in operation - contributing £45 billion to the UK economy and creating 650,000 high-tech jobs. 

""However, for these operations to go ahead, we need to equip people with the correct skills to manage this technology - which is why courses like this are so important,"" he says.

Ian Pryce, business development officer at Harper Adams University, said: ""This course will help equip the drone operators of the future with the knowledge and skills they need - and the possibilities it can unlock, for both drone operators and for farmers, have the potential to be truly revolutionary.""

The course costs £3,000 plus VAT and will next run:

A new route to market for cereals grown with regenerative farming practices is on offer from Wildfarmed, giving consumers the chance to support the restoration of soil and biodiversity.

In a challenge to the status quo and putting nature at the heart of food production, Wildfarmed will reward farmers with a premium for crops grown on dedicated blocks of land with greater plant diversity, such as in bicrops, polycrops or with companion cropping.

See also: Regenerative agriculture: What to avoid and how to start

The company has developed a set of robust standards that will be audited independently and are being observed by its community of arable farmers.

In return, the collaborative supply chain business gives growers the choice on whether to fix the price or take the premium on a floating basis at harvest.

This year's fixed wheat price is £310/t - last year Wildfarmed paid a premium of more than 25%.

What are the Wildfarmed standards?

Climate and biodiversity

By producing grain according to defined standards and operating a field-to-plate system, farmers get price stability and consumers get traceability, the company claims.

Founded in 2018 by Grammy Award-winning DJ-turned-farmer Andy Cato and two colleagues, the driver behind Wildfarmed is to give farmers, food businesses and consumers an opportunity to be part of the solution to the biodiversity and climate crises.

The company is already producing flour and bread, working with 400 restaurants, retailers and bakeries - including loaves made with Wildfarmed flour on the shelves at M&S.

Future plans include a beer made from barley grown in the system, and market development work on pulse crops is also under way with partners such as Hodmedods.

What's on offer?

Food choices

The message to consumers, retailers and buyers is that food choices can help to change landscapes, says Mr Cato.

""We are trying to break down barriers,"" he stresses.

""It's about demonstrating that making the right food choices is good for health and the environment - and that food from farming systems that are making a difference is available on the high street at a price that most can afford.""

Crucially, he says it's also about supporting growers who choose to farm in this way. That support is financial, technical and social.

""We pay more for the grain and we also provide access to agronomic expertise, monitoring tools and our community.""

Cereals produced for Wildfarmed are grown with legume companions.

They may also be grown in strips drilled into perennials, sometimes referred to as pasture cropping, with inter-row mowers used to regulate competition and allow the wheat to yield.

Variety blends

Wildfarmed works with blends of varieties that are suited to low-input, biodiverse farming systems.

These are based on competitive varieties that can achieve milling specification, while also having a strong disease package and reliable yield.

Wildfarmed growers can buy pre-blended seed mixes from Cope Seeds, most of which include organic varieties.

Any farmer wishing to work with milling varieties that they have farm-saved, or wanting to blend their own mix, can do so.  

Farm system

Whatever the individual choice, soil health and diversity are central components of the system, so that it works in balance with nature, brings in greater diversity of habitat and supports ecosystems.

With 52 farmers already signed up and growing blends of wheat varieties, pesticides are prohibited and nitrogen is limited to 80kg/ha, with sap testing to guide crop need.

Growers will be supported by specialist agronomists such as Mike Harrington of Edaphos, Charlie Curtis of Progressive Agriculture and Ben Taylor-Davies (RegenBen).

They will also be encouraged to buffer nitrogen with a carbon source and apply just 40kg/ha in a granular form, with the remainder as foliar.

In addition, livestock must be integrated into the system in one of the three years.

Tillage/glyphosate

Well-managed tillage is allowed in the diverse system, as it is seen as compatible with building soil health and provides a weed control function.

Glyphosate applications are not permitted, due to concerns about the rapid rise in its use and consumer unease about its safety.

To this end, Wildfarmed has engaged Rothamsted Research to investigate the effects of glyphosate applications on soil and grain quality.

Described by Mr Cato as observation-based farming, Wildfarmed currently has a winter wheat, spring wheat and spring barley offer, which include heritage and modern varieties.

Farmers are encouraged to plan for a three-year collaboration, but contracts are annual and they may leave if the system doesn't suit them.

Independent certification body Control Union will audit Wildfarmed crops and contract terms have been kept as simple as possible.

The priority is making success as easy as possible by reducing administration and encouraging and developing collaboration, stresses the company.

Case study - I&B Metson, Ongar, Essex

Essex farmer Ian Metson grew a blend of four winter milling varieties for Wildfarmed last year, with volunteer beans providing the bicrop element.

With half of his farm in herbal leys and the rest growing cereals, Mr Metson bases his farming decisions on three factors - the need for them to be profitable, improve the farm and be enjoyable.

Having identified a suitable field, the Wildfarmed proposition looked interesting and he was keen to learn more, so he took the plunge.

© Ian Metson

""The numbers stacked up,"" he recalls. ""Last year's grain price was £400/t and I calculated that the variable costs would be £700/ha lower than my conventionally grown wheat.""

Given market volatility and uncertainty at the time, it also appeared to be a lower-risk option for the farm with its reduced working capital requirement.

He accepts that disease control was easy last year, given the hot and dry conditions, and acknowledges that weed control might become tricky without herbicides - although he is confident it can be managed.

Slug grazing in the autumn after drilling meant that he had some early doubts. ""At the start, it didn't look that clever.

""However, the beans filled in the grazed patches, which helped to keep blackgrass out.""

No nitrogen was applied, so, not surprisingly, the sap test did show that it was low in nitrogen. ""By the time we had a recommendation, it was too hot and dry to apply any.""

The crop, which was 80% wheat and 20% beans, yielded 5.5t/ha, some way below the 9.5t/ha he usually sees.

""At that level, I needed to sell the rest of my wheat for an average of £260/t to give me the same margin as Wildfarmed.""

Bicrop © Ian Metson

Harvesting was straightforward and took place on 24 July, with the high temperatures helping with even crop ripening.

He has increased the area of Wildfarmed this year to 22ha and is growing a spring wheat blend, half of which is already in the ground.

It is following a multispecies cover crop which was grazed by sheep and has a spring bean companion crop, drilled at the same time as the wheat.

The ratio at drilling was a full seed rate of spring wheat, or 160kg/ha, and one-third of the normal seed rate of spring beans.

""One of the beauties for me is that Wildfarmed takes the whole crop,"" he reveals. ""I don't have to worry about separating them out or meeting a very tight specification.""

Mr Metson is pleased that the Wildfarmed standards allow the use of some nitrogen, pointing out that going cold turkey can have significant implications.

""With a spring crop, we would normally put all of the nitrogen on at drilling. With this crop, we will use tissue testing and see what it tells us.""

The organisers received more than 120 nominations across 10 categories, including agriculture and horticulture, forestry, environmental conservation, landscaping, and equine, and a panel of industry professionals picked an outstanding apprentice and an outstanding learner in each category.

Former student of Reaseheath College Cerys Fairclough scooped the Agriculture Learner award, and was also named the overall Learner of the Year 2023.

She said: ""I'm absolutely delighted that my skills and achievements in agriculture have been recognised by the highly experienced judges on the panel.

""Having the opportunity to celebrate with my peers and demonstrate to the industry professionals in the audience that the future of the sector is in good hands has been invaluable.""

The two agricultural awards were sponsored by Farmers Weekly and presented by Countryfile presenter Adam Henson.

Millie Francis, an apprentice with Askham Bryan college, was the winner of the Agricultural Apprenticeship category.

Pulse growers are being invited to join a new knowledge exchange platform launched by Adas, aimed at helping them grow profitable and resilient crops.

As part of the Nitrogen Climate Smart (NCS) project, Adas has created the Pulse PEP platform, which will host trial results, data and supporting information from experts in the project.

See also: Farmers to reap slice of £5.9m Defra-funded pulse project
 
NCS is a £5.9m project funded by Defra's Farming Futures research and development fund, delivered by Innovate UK. The project aims to increase the UK area of pulses from 5% to 20% and cut agricultural emissions.

Dr Thomas Wilkinson, senior research consultant in crop physiology at Adas, says farmers taking part in trials for the NCS project will share data that it is hoped will demonstrate the benefits of growing pulses in rotations.

More than 200 farmers will be involved in either trials, carbon baselining or sharing information, while 17 industry partners will also be contributing their expertise. All of this knowledge will come together on PulsePEP.

The PulsePEP is part of the wider FarmPEP digital platform. It is free to use and anyone can log in to view the content.

Also being launched is a PulsePEP forum area on The Farming Forum, where more in-depth discussions can take place.

Only members will be able to contribute and it gives growers an opportunity to share knowledge and thoughts, says Tom Allen Stevens, founder of the British On-Farm Innovation Network (Bofin), one of the partner organisations.

Guide to patch treating slugs

A new guide is offering farmers up-to-date information on slug behaviour, enabling them to develop cost-effective ways of patch treating slugs.

The Patch-treatment Guide, published by the British On-Farm Innovation Network, provides an overview of research so far and shares practical tips regarding how and why slugs gather in patches.

Keith Walters, professor of invertebrate biology and integrated pest management at Harper Adams University, says there is increasing interest in the potential for targeting pellet applications to hot-spot areas.

""Doing so can deliver benefits to both the environment, wildlife and bottom line.

""However, applying only to certain parts of fields or, more importantly, not treating some areas of the crop, is understandably a bit of a leap of faith and they need confidence in the science behind it to ensure crops are not exposed to unnecessary risk,” he says.

DeCyst open day 2023 showcases herbicide trials progress

Provided by

CHAP is one of the four UK Agri-Tech Centres of Innovation. We bring together scientists, farmers, advisors, and pioneers to advance crop productivity and yield in the UK and beyond.

Attendees were greeted by bumper crops of DeCystâ„¢ Prickly and Broadleaf, two potato cyst nematode (PCN) trap crops grown by host Neil Furniss and the team at Produce Solutions, showcasing impressive project progress to date.

The open day event hosted near Newport in Shropshire attracted potato growers, agronomists and stakeholders from across the supply chain, who were shown the latest progress made by the Innovate UK-funded project in their second year of on-farm trials.

This year, in particular, has seen remarkable progress, thanks to promising findings regarding suitable pre- and post-emergence herbicides that can be used with trap crops to enhance their early competitive abilities, with the possibility of extended usage in the future pending extensions for use.

© Chap

Dr Bill Watts, Project Lead and Trials Manager at Produce Solutions summarised the project work: ""Our project focuses on understanding the factors affecting trap crop success.

""Ensuring the DeCystâ„¢ seed is shallow-drilled into moist soil with some consolidation for seed-soil contact is critical to success; a follow-up residual herbicide such as aclonifen (Emerger®, Bayer) guarantees low weed competition until full groundcover (extension of authorisation pending).""

Part of the consortium, growers J.M. Bubb, J. Foskett Farms and T.C. & N. Taylor, have been focusing on optimising the best drilling practices to ensure the successful establishment of these challenging crops.

Field-scale trials have demonstrated that, despite being a small-sized seed, common combi-drills offer an excellent option for drilling the trap crop seed; possibly by raising moisture levels in the seed-bed thus encouraging germination.

Another option is using precision vegetable drills where available, with Nick Taylor reporting favourable results with a precision-drilled seed mix of DeCystâ„¢ Prickly & Broadleaf.

As an organic grower, the lower level of soil disturbance with this technique also limits weed seed germination, keeping the crops clean.

Alternatively, Shropshire-based grower John Bubb, has seen promising results with inter-row planting of DeCystâ„¢ combined with clover and buckwheat in a standing crop of wheat, which flourished after combining, giving complete ground cover.

Collectively, these efforts have accumulated compelling evidence on optimising the performance of trap crops and their integration into current farming systems.

But getting the crop drilled is only half the challenge – next is ensuring good seed-soil contact, due to the smaller seed size and the drier conditions frequently experienced during the typical sowing window of May to June.

Depending on the conditions, this might involve some consolidation to optimise germination and subsequent biomass growth.

Dr Ivan Grove of Curious Raven Ltd., who has been using unmanned aerial vehicles to record biomass in the trials, reported: ""Ground cover and crop volume has benefited little from using additional heavy flat rolls post-sowing this year due to sufficient early rain after sowing.""

""However, using Cambridge rolls post-sowing is always recommended to consolidate the seed-bed for good soil-to-seed contact and reduce moisture loss.""

Once establishment has been achieved and the weeds under control, the goal is to maximise crop biomass to ensure high trap cropping potential.

Additional management is needed to help reach the ideal target of >700 g/m sq or >7 t/ha for DeCystâ„¢ Prickly ensuring a high root density and sufficient exudate release to stimulate PCN hatch; work is ongoing to identify ideal biomass requirement for DeCystâ„¢ Broadleaf and other species.

© Chap

Graham Tomalin of VCS Potatoes Ltd. commented on the nutrition trials undertaken in the East of England this season: ""We've been looking at the canopy development across the three DeCystâ„¢ species following applications of potash and phosphate at drilling, whilst also experimenting with the use of poly ammonium phosphate in comparison to standard granular Triple Super Phosphate (TSP).

""Although not yet complete, preliminary observations indicate that phosphate is important to maximise crop biomass.""

In parallel with the trial and current efforts to optimise the existing commercial products, DeCystâ„¢ Prickly and Broadleaf, the consortium has also been working on a new trap crop product known as DeCystâ„¢ Podium (Solanum chenopodioides - tall nightshade).

Researchers, Dr Matthew Back and Dr Kasia Dybal, have been delving into the efficacy of this new upcoming product, while the wider consortium has been exploring how best to grow in the field.

Dr Matthew Back, reader in Nematology, and Dr Kasia Dybal, researcher in Nematology, from Harper Adams University added: ""To date we've examined PCN (Globodera pallida) multiplication within two glasshouse experiments when grown with and without the DeCystâ„¢ Prickly, Broadleaf, and Podium along with potato and fallow controls.

""So far, this has shown how higher biomass led to a greater reduction in PCN, with Broadleaf resulting in >75% reduction and 50% for Podium.

“We're now moving on to see if this is also true for the other PCN species (G. rostochiensis).""

Ideas for the future

Overall, the open day proved to be a resounding success, with attendees engaging in discussions around their experiences with trap crops as well as thoughts on the project.

For those who were new to trap crops, the event offered a great introduction into the topic area and left them with some interesting thoughts and ideas for the future.

Together, the event and project highlight the role of trap crops as part of an integrated pest management (IPM) approach to PCN, particularly when stacked with other tools such as rotations and conventional management practices.

Dr Alex McCormack, Innovation Sector Lead in Agronomy for project partner CHAP, said: ""This is a great example of how public funding enables true cross-sector collaboration and synergy by combining the skills, expertise and experiences of growers, agronomists, consultants and researchers to accelerate on-farm innovation.

""I'm eagerly looking forward to the next steps, where we will be working on creating a comprehensive grower agronomy guide and producing high-quality video materials to broadcast the message to growers and agronomists.

""So, stay tuned and keep an eye out for upcoming developments.""

John Ritchie of Montalt Farm, Perthshire, is the 2023 Farmers Weekly Grassland Manager of the Year.

Improved grassland management has helped lift stocking rates at Montalt Farm by 40%, as well as deliver large reductions in feed and fertiliser.

This has resulted in the business bucking the trend for upland beef and sheep farms by achieving 22% gross profits as a percentage of turnover, without accounting for subsidy.

John has created a rotational grazing system that is now growing 2t more grass - at 8.2t/ha dry matter (DM), on average - compared to when animals were set stocked.

Farm facts

Management strategy

Sheep are given priority access to fresh grass, followed by cattle. John runs two-day shifts on the grazing platform, which has been subdivided into 90 paddocks, averaging 1.3ha.

This practice has extended the grazing season by eight weeks in recent years.

In the summer, sheep enter grass covers of 2,800kg DM/ha and will graze down to 2,100kg, with cattle expected to clean out paddocks to 1,700kg. John says this leader-

follower system has been a ""revelation"", improving grass utilisation and maintaining animal growth rates.

Lambs achieved daily growth rates of 295g/day up to weaning this year and were sold off grass by September.

More impressively, he has saved 20t of concentrate by no longer supplementing ewes. Instead, pasture is rested for 100-120 days over the winter and grazed on pre-lambing rotation.

Scanning rates averaged 210% in 2022, although John concedes this is too high for outdoor lambing and wants to cut back.

The herd of 95 Saler-cross cows is body condition scored with cows below 3 outwintered on deferred hill ground, and those scoring above 3 are put on forage rape and oat straw to reduce winter housing costs.

Only youngstock are housed and fed quality silage over winter. Growing cattle average 1.1kg during spring and summer grazing, despite the fact they never get the first bite of grass, and will average 0.8kg while indoors.

Breeding selection pressure has resulted in exceptional levels of cow fertility. Cows calve for eight weeks in March with just 2.5% empty last year.

On average, 75% of heifers were in calf after a three-week bulling period in 2022, with suckler herdlife averaging 7.9 years.

John is getting good persistence from leys too, with reseeds lasting 10 years on average.

The poorest yielding pastures are burnt off and direct-drilled with forage rape, then reseeded in spring with red clover and ryegrasses using min-till.

Ground is soil sampled annually with 120t/year of lime applied to achieve a target pH 6.5.

Only 37kg N/ha is applied to silage fields and 62kg N/ha to forage crops, and no fertiliser is used on the grazing platform.

The future 

John believes contentment breeds complacency. He intends to start experimenting with new breeds, and wants to lift cattle numbers but cut back on ewes to reduce workload and improve grass utilisation further.

Together with wife Alix, John shares his knowledge by hosting pupils from local high schools who are studying rural skills.

He is also a mentor to four fellow grassland farmers through the British Grassland Society.

A word from our independent judge

""John has developed a grazing system that is delivering personal and financial goals.

“By matching pastures to stock classes and focusing on key success factors, he is successfully navigating that fine line between maximising utilisation and maintaining animal performance with minimal inputs.""

Emily Grant, independent beef and sheep consultant

266,"Advice on hosting vet students on your dairy farm","https://www.fwi.co.uk/livestock/advice-on-hosting-vet-students-on-your-dairy-farm","Advice on hosting vet students on your dairy farm

Sophie and Tom Gregory hosted 15 vet students at Home Farm, Chard, last year and they are already fully booked with student placements for 2023.

The Gregorys calve 360 cows in two blocks, producing organic milk for Arla, and host students during these busy times to benefit from extra pairs of hands.

But the benefits are mutual, with the students offered a broad experience of dairy farming in return.

See also: Why student vets are not going into the industry

Mrs Gregory believes there are a couple of factors that are key to making it successful:

Students are not paid, but a lot of time is invested in them and they leave with skills that can get them well-paid relief milking jobs throughout their university years.

Students are provided with accommodation in a mobile home and offered breakfast in the farmhouse with the rest of the team.

""It is a massive benefit to us as an industry to get more good vets - I see it as part of our role to influence them to come into agriculture,"" says Mrs Gregory.

Strict rules for success

The couple began hosting vet students after emailing all the veterinary schools with a farm profile and their contact details for students that were interested.

They have a few strict rules to make it work for everyone - students must:

Health and safety are important  

All students have an induction on day one. This includes a briefing on the farm's health and safety policy, as well as ensuring everyone has the team's phone numbers in their mobiles.

Because of insurance, students are not able to drive any farm vehicles or machinery. But Mrs Gregory ensures they experience all aspects of other farm work.

This will include calf feeding, milking, bedding, and helping with routine jobs such as weighing and vaccinating animals and carrying out fresh cow checks and foot trimming.

Students do rotations so they are not always on early morning duties.  

""We don't get them to do night checks because half the time if there is something wrong, they have to come and get us anyway,"" she says.

Why it is a valuable experience for students

Emma Cossey, a second-year student at Nottingham University, spent three weeks in total with the Gregorys last year and says the experience was hugely valuable.

""I think so much of building a career as a farm vet is about good connections, and placement is a key part of that. I know that Sophie is always there if I have a question or need a hand finding another placement,"" she says.

In her experience, two weeks is a good placement length because, by the end of the first week, you feel like you can start adding value to the farm.

""I think a couple of days shadowing is really useful - the farmer can find it a bit awkward with you following them all day, but it really does help you settle in.

""Then, I think it is important to have some freedom. With good instructions, you can learn so much doing a job on your own and you feel able to help too,"" she explains.

Mrs Gregory says she would be happy to give all the students she has hosted a job on the farm.

Although mistakes happen, these are often easy to rectify.

One student did bed up the calves using the muck heap instead of fresh straw on day two of his placement, says Mrs Gregory, but by week two he “blew her out of the water” with his ideas for improving youngstock management.

How to become a placement provider

All vet students must complete extra-mural studies (EMS) throughout their course.

In the first two years of their study, they are required to do 12 weeks of animal handling and husbandry.

Viki Weigh, placements manager for Harper and Keele Veterinary School, explains that requirements are different for all universities. For example, Harper and Keele requires at least one week of cattle handling.

Ms Weigh says that most students source their own placements and then ask farmers to complete a provider form, which enables them to sign up to be on the placement portal for other students to find them.

Any provider must have public liability insurance and can get in touch with the university to ask any questions or reference check the student.

Farmers are asked to complete a digital form to provide feedback on the student's placement at the end of the period.

Farmers interested in signing up to be a placement provider can email ems@hkvets.ac.uk.

268,"Why genetics are critical for improving dairy cow fertility","https://www.fwi.co.uk/livestock/livestock-breeding/why-genetics-are-critical-for-improving-dairy-cow-fertility","Why genetics are critical for improving dairy cow fertility

Dairy cow fertility is at the heart of herd profitability, driving milk yields, cutting interventions and improving cow lifespans.

Evidence supporting the role of genetics in improving fertility has accumulated every year, and new data from AHDB are now strengthening this link (see graph below).

Since the introduction of the female fertility index (FI) in 2005, the genetics of fertility have shown massive improvement across the national dairy herd.

This is also reflected in actual performance, or phenotype, as well as the genetic prediction of calving index (also shown on the graph).

See also: Leeds leads latest bull rankings with £914 PLI

But today's improvements follow years of decline when producers had little idea of a bull's ability to transmit female fertility and were largely selecting for milk production.

This had the effect of not simply ignoring cow fertility, but positively selecting against it.

This was driven by the moderate negative correlation between milk production and fertility, which was known at the time, but was difficult to address.

However, today's sophisticated computing power and genetic indexing system have turned this situation on its head.

And through the development of more holistic indexes, such as profitable lifetime index (PLI), which includes an element of fertility alongside other traits, it has been easy for producers to include fertility in their genetic selection criteria.

These indexes have also made it possible to ensure genetic choices made today do not have unintended consequences through correlations between desirable and undesirable traits, as was the case in the past.

Marco Winters, head of animal breeding for AHDB, says producers should be congratulated on achieving this turnaround.

Cut in calving interval

He says: ""Their efforts have effectively cut average calving interval from a high of almost 425 days in the mid-2000s to nearer 395 days today.""

This progress was, in fact, predicted in an earlier genetic study about five years ago.

At that time AHDB forecast, from genetic trends, that the UK's average calving interval would reach 390 days by 2024.

""With this projection still on target, it's possible to confidently predict even more improvement ahead,"" he says.

""This improvement will be slower, as we've taken the low-hanging fruit, but we expect to continue to cut calving interval by about one day every year over the next five years.""

This puts the national dairy herd on target for a calving interval of 385 days by 2029.

""This will bring us back to the fertility levels of the mid-1990s,"" continues Marco. ""But impressively, this has been achieved at the same time as milk yields have significantly climbed.""

Heritability of fertility

This achievement shows the power of genetics as a force for improvement. And it proves it is worth selecting even low-heritability traits.

""Fertility has a heritability of about 3% [or 0.03], which is considered to be low,"" he says.

""However, heritability is the degree to which a trait is observed to be passed down the generations, and female fertility is highly influenced by environmental factors - ranging from nutrition and housing to the timing of insemination and the fertility of semen.""

The genetic indexing system is effective in filtering out this external “noise”, and pinpointing cows with an innate fertility.

""If we can measure cows' inherent ability to get in-calf, it's clear we can have a dramatic impact on animal performance,"" he says.

Strongly urging every producer to consider FI, Marco says it should be a key part of all dairy breeding strategies.

""We need cows to get in-calf and we need them to last, and this index will help us achieve these goals.

“But fertility is also good for profit, welfare and the environment and for this reason, it's included in all our major indexes including HealthyCow, EnviroCow and PLI, as well as both of the seasonal calving indexes.

""Of course, improved management can have a more immediate effect on dairy cow fertility, but improvements made through breeding will be sustained over the long term, and accumulate over generations,"" he says.

""As with all traits, it's important to consider both genetics and management, and to remember that having better genetics will make management easier.""

How to rank your herd for fertility

To check your own herd's genetic merit for fertility, sign up for the AHDB Herd Genetic Report.

Most producers use this service through the AHDB website, where - as long as they are milk recorded - they can rank their own herd for many genetic traits, including fertility index.

This allows them to track progress over the generations and pick out animals that should have the best innate fertility and the ability to pass this on to the next generation.

To sign up, visit: ahdb.org.uk/herd-genetic-report-sign-up

Genetic workshops

Workshops are being held by AHDB across Britain through to 9 November, where dairy farmers and managers can learn more about unlocking their herd's breeding potential.

They will help producers:

Essex dairy cuts calving index by 40 days

Farm facts: Battles Hall Farm, Essex

Rory, Robert and John Torrance © Jack Hill/the Times

Essex farmer and NMR/RABDF Gold Cup winner John Torrance was quick on the uptake when AHDB's fertility index was introduced in 2005 and has been using it as a breeding tool ever since.

He says the index has transformed performance of his 700 cows, whose fertility has steadily improved for about 15 years, alongside greater production.

Calving index today is 40 days lower than it was at the outset, dropping from 420 to 380 days.

He says: ""We've made giant strides since we began using the health indexes, and Oman bloodlines in particular have transformed health and fertility.""

He has complete confidence in the data and the choice of high daughter fertility bulls within the Holstein breed, adding: ""The data doesn't lie - before we had it, we were just choosing bulls on a whim.""

Also acknowledging the importance of activity monitors, he says they have played an important part, working in tandem with genetics.

Together, they have allowed the herd's voluntary waiting period to be increased to 55 days, as John is more confident than ever of getting his cows in-calf.

Pregnancy rate bears out the success of the policy and now runs at a rolling average of 29.5%.

Dr Jackie Stroud

Soil Scientist, School of Life Sciences, Warwick University

Dr Jackie Stroud is a soil scientist based at the School of Life Sciences, Warwick University. She is widely regarded as the go-to source on farmland earthworm science. 

 She offers an accessible, inspiring perspective on soil management based on her studies working with farmers on their fields and from her own research field trials. 

 She is best known for the farmland earthworm survey which was co-developed with 100 farmers over 18 months to check that earthworms are widespread and the earthworm population is functionally intact. 

 The main practical challenges were confidence in earthworm identification and labour (30 - 60 mins per field). People reported that the outcomes were very useful, and the results showed that litter-feeding earthworms were absent in many fields. 

 Over the past few years she has been rethinking soil ecological monitoring to overcome the practical challenges reported by farmers. She has partnered with bio-acoustics experts to develop soil acoustic monitoring. 

 Using a soil microphone, they have found indications that a noisy soil is a healthy soil. During Transition Live, Dr Stroud will be talking about soil health and biology and share the latest advances in soil monitoring.

278,"Farmers Weekly Awards 2023: Ag Student of the Year","https://www.fwi.co.uk/farm-life/young-farmers/farmers-weekly-awards-2023-ag-student-of-the-year","Farmers Weekly Awards 2023: Ag Student of the Year

Harry Davies of Hopes Ash Farm, Herefordshire, is Farmers Weekly's 2023 Ag Student of the Year.

You can tell within a short time of speaking to Harry that he will be a leader in our industry. He has a brilliant mix of skill, knowledge, charisma and real humility.

Not only is he hugely committed to his own family farm's future, but he is also passionate about progress in the agricultural sector.

He has a sound understanding of the industry, reflected in good grades and outstanding references from lecturers and employers.

See also: The 2023 Farmers Weekly Awards shortlist

Harry has demonstrated huge adaptability throughout his university years.

Just as readily as he gets stuck in at the home farm in Herefordshire - which has 100ha of arable alongside dairy, beef, sheep, fruit and poultry enterprises - he turned his hand to working on an 11,300ha arable unit in Western Australia during his placement.

Instead of focusing that year on the livestock sectors he knows best, he identified that arable was where he had less experience, so applied for specific placements to ""fill that knowledge gap.""

Striking a balance

The successful juggling of his studies and high levels of responsibility at his home farm is evidence of Harry's work ethic.

He has been the key decision-maker for the 150-head dairy herd throughout his university years and managed the installation of a slurry-only anaerobic digestion plant this year.

Along with a solar array, it will make the farm 95-100% self-sufficient in renewable electricity.

Harry says that without the skills learned at Harper Adams, such as building design, partial budgeting, project organisation and people management, the project would have been significantly more challenging.

As well as the academic learnings at university, he says exposure to different people and systems has also broadened his awareness and led him to re-evaluate everything on the home farm.

Progressive thinking

Harry is willing to tackle thorny issues, especially when considering the environmental impact of increasing food production. One example local to home is the elevated phosphate levels in the River Wye.

""The fact is that agriculture makes a significant contribution to phosphate pollution within the catchment.

""We, as farmers, must not bury our heads in the sand, and must face this problem as a united community on our own terms.

""Otherwise change will be forced by legislators, which may be to the detriment of the ag industry and community within the catchment,"" Harry says, demonstrating his proactive attitude to finding sustainable solutions.

He focused his Honours research project on the stripping of phosphate from animal manures, a technology he believes will play a huge part in solving the problem.

Consumer engagement

One of Harry's university lecturers told the FW judges: ""Harry possesses a wide working knowledge of both UK and global farming issues but is not at all arrogant or condescending when talking to someone less informed or others outside the industry.""

This approachability and ability to engage with all points of view undoubtedly helps Harry lead the bimonthly ""walk and talk"" sessions that he has introduced at the home farm.

Welcoming people from the nearby town, he aims to give them an insight into farming and dispel any misconceptions they may have. Harry hopes to expand his consumer engagement efforts when full-time on the farm.

Winning ways

Student notes

A word from our independent judge 

""Harry is passionate and driven with a strong knowledge of local and global agricultural issues. He has stepped out of his comfort zone to broaden his skill set throughout university years and, as an engaging communicator, he is a fantastic role model for other ag students.""

Farmer interest in trading natural capital is in the ascendancy.

Legislation has just been passed requiring house builders and commercial developers to deliver at least a 10% improvement in biodiversity in relation to their activities from January 2024.

And last week Defra launched the third round of the Natural Environment Investment Readiness Fund, offering grants of up to £100,000 to help farmers prepare nature projects that will attract private sector investment.

Co-operatives

It is therefore little surprise that the Environmental Farmers Group (EFG) has enjoyed sustained growth since it was launched in May 2022, to the extent that it now comprises of 268 farmers covering 146,800ha in Hampshire, Wiltshire, Dorset, Northamptonshire and north Lincolnshire.

A sister co-operative, Peakland Environmental Farmers, also launched earlier this year, and another, Swaledale and Wensleydale Environmental Farmers, is being set up in Yorkshire.

Combined, they represent 469 landowners and tenants, all with an interest in delivering for the environment and potentially trading natural capital.

Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust (GWCT) chief executive Teresa Dent, who helped establish the groups, says: ""These new co-operatives are mobilising the sector to achieve nature recovery on farmland.

""By proving it is possible to combine profitable agriculture with thriving biodiversity on a grand scale, this model shows that farmers are not the problem, but the essential solution to hitting the government's environmental targets.""

Offset trades

So far, about 45 EFG farmers have commissioned Natural Capital Advisory (NCA) - a subsidiary of the GWCT - to undertake ecological baseline assessments of their biodiversity, as well as potential nutrient reduction in watercourses, in order to engage in offset trades.

EFG chairman and Wiltshire arable farmer Rob Shepherd says: ""The EFG has already agreed nutrient mitigation projects with developers, worth more than £1m.

""We are currently working with NCA in four catchments to deliver over 15 nutrient trades, and nine biodiversity trades, worth about £27m.""

An ""equalisation"" model means all farmers in the group will make something out of every trade.

Three types of natural capital

Case study: Turning care for the environment into profit

Creating biodiversity net gain (BNG) has become part of the farming psyche at Bisterne Estate in Hampshire, as owner Hallam Mills tries to do the right thing for nature while putting the whole business on a financially stable footing.

Bisterne has been in Mr Mills' family for more than 200 years, and he has been running the estate for the past 20 years, following a previous career in the energy sector.

The land stretches from the New Forest in the East to Dorset in the West, straddling the River Avon and covering 1,620ha.

Of this, just over 1,000ha is agricultural land, mostly farmed in-hand and down to pasture for a 600-strong milking herd, though there is about 300ha of arable ground too.

With a background in commerce, Mr Mills has been very aware of the threat to farm support payments and the financial potential of natural capital, and has set about developing ""net gains"" on the estate in a number of ways.

BNG projects

One example is a woodland water project - which also enjoys Countryside Stewardship and Wessex Rivers Trust support - designed to reduce the flood risk to cottages downstream of a forest brook.

It also aims to improve habitat for both aquatic species, such as sea trout, and woodland species, such as woodcock and nightjars.

Large areas of rhododendron have been cleared and overflow pipes have been slotted into the riverbank, ensuring that any excess water spills through into the surrounding woodland, rather than rushing headlong downstream.

Natural obstacles have also been left in the water to slow the flow and encourage spawning grounds.

Another project is being undertaken on the River Avon, to reintroduce water voles. Initially, these creatures were relocated from upstream Salisbury, when a car park was being built.

To encourage successful breeding, captive water voles were also brought in, and the river banks and surrounding ditches managed to provide an ideal environment.

Working closely with farm manager Martin Button, the plan is to extend this work to other water meadows.

A third BNG project involves the clearing out of old irrigation ponds on the estate, reprofiling the banks in a way that will encourage wildlife.

Crucially, with all these projects, a baseline audit has been made and habitat improvements will be measured over time to calculate any net gains, which will then be tradeable.

""It's a very young market, but I am convinced there is an awful lot of private money out there from people and companies who need to show they are caring for the environment and will pay us to do it for them,"" says Mr Mills.

Environmental Farmers Group

While this is work he would probably be doing anyway, Mr Mills is an enthusiastic director of the Environmental Farmers Group (EFG), seeing several advantages to working with other like-minded farmers as part of a co-operative.

""The large and complex projects necessary to make the most of the new environmental schemes demand very careful contractual arrangements, a proper scientific base, and the ability to manage 30- to 80-year obligations,"" he says.

As well as reducing risk, being part of a much larger group also provides trading opportunities that would not be so readily available to an individual.

""As part of the group, I feel like I am travelling with my headlights on full, rather than dipped,"" he says. ""Two years ago, I was travelling with no lights at all.""

Q&A - All you need to know about trading natural capital

Chartered surveyor Christopher Sparrow set up Recce Rural in 2020, and has since created Natural Capital Advisory, a joint venture with the Game and Conservation Wildlife Trust specialising in biodiversity.

The Environmental Farmers Group (EFG) is a key client.

How do you actually calculate biodiversity units?

We have a team of eight ecologists who use Natural England's biodiversity metric to assess how many biodiversity net gain (BNG) units exist currently over a parcel of land.

The farmer or landowner then decides with the ecologist what sort of project they want to either improve the condition of that habitat, or create new habitat - for example, a new field margin.

This will be framed in a habitat management plan, quantifying the number of BNG units gained by the intervention, and setting out how the habitat is to be managed over a 30-year period.

An agreement is then signed with the local planning authority, and the project registered with Natural England. The BNG units are then tradeable.

Some farmers are wary of these new markets. Should they be?

In terms of nutrient neutrality and BNG, the plus side is we know that farmers have been executing the practical work necessary for years.

Farmers all know how to create a 12m or 24m margin, and they know how to convert a temporary pasture into a permanent one. Now it's just a question of being properly paid for it.

Yes, the consultants employed to do the baseline and subsequent surveys need to be qualified and capable, but ultimately the local authority is signing off the calculation, so I'm entirely comfortable that BNG as a product for sale is sound.

How do you reward EFG members for any trades?

Membership is split into ""cells"", which correspond to the Environment Agency's ""management catchment"" boundaries. 

We know that the trades are going to be fairly ""lumpy"", so we wanted a mechanism that would reward all within that ""cell"" for the seller - power created by agreeing to work together.

In summary, the member undertaking the actual trade will get 88% of the revenue, 9% will go to all the farmers in that cell, with the final 3% going into the wider EFG, to help increase its capability.

How many trades have you done so far?

We have completed one nutrient neutrality deal, which secured £1.1m for Environmental Farmers Group, and have since agreed terms for a further four trades with a total value of £4.3m.

In the past three months, despite the rollout delays, we have begun trading BNG and have terms agreed for an initial £800,000 across two trades.

The EFG's forward enquiry and trading pipeline is significant. 

Is there more interest in BNG or nutrient neutrality?

In the south of England, nutrient neutrality is leading the charge, but with BNG formally activating in 2024, then I believe this will quickly catch up.

Most interesting to me is where we can provide both goods on the same parcel of land.

Is it better to trade natural capital independently, or lease your land to another operator?

It depends on your appetite for risk. A third-party intermediary does reduce risk, but it may result in a disproportionate discount from what you could be earning if you undertook the work yourself.

In the cases of BNG and nutrient neutrality, where the statutory authorities are hardwired into the trades and the goods themselves are relatively easy to create and maintain, there seems less incentive to give away significant value to a third party.

Renewed calls for greater support for black and people of colour (BPOC) within UK agriculture have been heard this week, in a Nuffield Farming report by farm vet Dr Navaratnam Partheeban.

The report, titled “Encouraging and supporting black and people of colour in agriculture”, has called for greater support of ethnic minorities, stating that agriculture is the least diverse of any industry in the UK.

See also: Young Farmers Week: Q&A with Defra and NFYFC

In his study, Dr Partheeban, who is known in the industry as Theeb, says ""creating equity and inclusion is crucial"" and in order to achieve this, the sector would need to create a ""level playing field and make people feel like they belong"".

He explains: ""Acknowledging and accepting the past, creating positive opportunities for marginalised people, platforming and promoting BPOC people, and creating support networks and systems to help BPOC people be an equal part of the sector is key to making any programme a success.

""By increasing the diversity of people in our sector and inspiring the next generation, we will help create ideas, innovation and talent plus making the sector more representative of the country we serve.""

To achieve this, Dr Partheeban explains that the sector must ""start investing more time, money and effort into working for positive change”.

His full report is available to read online at the Nuffield Farming library.

Catchment areas in the UK are largely dominated by land put to agricultural use, which makes collaboration between water companies and farmers essential for preserving raw water quality.

Water companies across the country operate various schemes that work closely with farmers to not only help meet water quality goals but also improve the farm's bottom line.

Affinity Water

Areas covered:

Key concerns include nitrates, pesticides and other biologicals entering watercourses. Affinity Water offers a number of incentives to work alongside farmers to address these issues at source.

Among these is Affinity's own Soil Innovation Fund, which is designed to improve soils to the advantage of both farm productivity and preventing run-off and other water-related issues associated with poor soils.

Danny Coffey is an agricultural adviser at Affinity. ""The scheme allows farmers access to anything that they see will improve their soils - it's a very flexible scheme,"" he says.

The ideas pitched are then put to a panel - which includes soil scientists, regenerative agriculture specialists and representatives from the water industry - and are assessed based on the merits and awarded grant funding accordingly.

Funding can cover up to 75% of project costs, to a maximum value of £15,000. Previous projects have included machinery modifications, precision injection of fertiliser and support for undersowing maize.

This funding is supplementary to other schemes run by Affinity, which include grants for cover cropping, oilseed rape companion cropping and alternative cropping to oilseed rape, with the overall aim of targeting pesticide and nitrate issues.

Anglian Water

Areas covered: East of England and Hartlepool

Protecting resources in one of the driest regions of the UK is a priority for Anglian Water.

The firm has a dedicated team of agricultural and catchment advisers who work with and alongside farmers, landowners and agronomists to ensure pollution does not enter watercourses.

Leaching nitrate and phosphorus fertilisers causes some of the biggest issues in the area.

The company has run a number of projects with local farmers, providing advice and support on everything from slug control to using drip trays with pesticides - and even a pesticide amnesty.

Richard Reynolds © Anglian Water

In terms of grant support, Anglian Water's Farming Innovation Grant has now provided two rounds of funding to develop innovation solutions that tackle local water quality challenges in priority areas across the catchment.

In its first year, the grant programme gave farms in the area access to more than £250,000 worth of funding, which was split across 19 projects.

The application window for this year's funding is now closed, but Anglian Water is keen to continue hearing ideas from farmers.

Last year, the company also offered a training grant and cover crops grant, which provided funding for more than 120 farmers in the region.

Senior agronomy adviser Richard Reynolds says: ""Ultimately, we believe local farmers are best placed to understand their local needs and challenges so try avoiding generic funding programmes that pay a fixed rate for a specified item.

""We want to put farmers as part of the solution, not the problem.""

Bristol Water

Areas covered: Bristol city and north Somerset, as well as parts of Bath, north-east Somerset and South Gloucestershire

A large proportion of dairy farms in the area mean Bristol Water's work with farmers centres on controlling nutrient concentration levels.

Matthew Pitts is the firm's catchment strategy manager. ""My main focus is on the Mendips. We have three big reservoirs there - Chew Valley, Blagdon and Cheddar,"" he says.

""In these areas we're trying to maintain nutrient concentration at a lower level so that we don't get algal blooms. The algal blooms are what makes the water difficult for us to treat.""

Farmers can get a free specialist consultation on how they can protect local resources through the long-standing Mendip Lakes Partnership - a collaboration between Bristol Water, Catchment Sensitive Farming, Avon Wildlife Trust, Natural England and the Environment Agency.

This partnership gives farmers access to a number of other free tools including:

Bristol Water also offers a grant scheme.

""We have a pot of money set aside for farmers to apply for to make improvements to their farm that will reduce the risk of pollution or enable them to manage their nutrients better, for example,"" explains Mr Pitts.

This funding in general covers up to 50% of an investment up to a maximum value of £10,000.

Cambridge Water

Areas covered: Cambridge, extending as far north as Ramsey, west to Gamlingay, down to Melbourn in the south and over to Balsham in the east

Last year saw the extension of the Slug Pesticide Rethink - Ideas for Nurturing Growth (Spring) grant to farmers in Cambridge Water catchment areas, after continued success since its launch in 2016 by South Staffs Water. Both companies are part of South Staffordshire Plc.

The grant is designed to help farmers improve practices to prevent pesticides and fertilisers entering watercourses.

It offers up to £10,000/year a farm, with the funding going towards voluntary on-farm infrastructural improvements and land management options, or a mixture of both.

Applications can include cover crops, buffer strips, nectar pollen and wild bird mixes, as well as concrete yard renewal and funding for chemical handling and/or storage areas.

Most recently, a range of options to improve biodiversity have been added. These include funding towards soil testing, spreader and sprayer calibration and rainwater harvesting.

Senior catchment adviser Nina Yiannoukos-Benton says she is particularly keen to speak to farmers in priority catchment areas, which includes Babraham, Fleam Dyke, Fulbourn, Linton and Sawston, Euston and Brettenham, and Fowlmere.

In addition to the Spring scheme, Cambridge Water also runs a number of collaborative initiatives that farmers can get involved with.

One of these is the Granta project, which revolves around the River Granta in south Cambridgeshire.

 It aims to identify and implement nature-based solutions to minimise flood risk while maximising both the water quantity and quality in this chalk stream.

Dwr Cymru (Welsh Water)

Areas covered: Most of Wales and Herefordshire, as well as parts of Deeside

Dwr Cymru's package for collaboration with farmers and landowners is known as WaterSource and comprises a number of measures to protect raw water sources.

""These programmes are specific to each catchment, and feature farmer-led discussion groups supporting innovations and novel approaches to land management, developing decision support tools - such as weather stations - and peatland restoration,"" explains project manager Nigel Elgar.

Richard Roderick, John Owen, Iwan Jones and Nigel Elgar © Dwr Cymru

The Pendine Catchment Project is one such programme.

Working with farm consultants at Adas, it enables farmers to claim a farm health check, which can provide free advice such as identifying risk areas in fields, or options for slurry and silage storage, and clean and dirty water separation systems.

Last year, the water company also partnered with the Wales Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs to facilitate knowledge exchange on protecting raw water with the next generation.

Northern Ireland Water

Areas covered: Sole provider of water services in Northern Ireland

A new farm chemical disposal scheme was launched by Northern Ireland Water last year for farmers in the River Derg catchment area of County Tyrone.

This scheme gave farmers free access to farm-to-farm collection of any unwanted chemicals and pesticides such as fungicides, sheep dip and veterinary medicines.

The scheme was relaunched again in December in the same area with plans to roll it out across the country in the future.

Also in the Derg catchment area, the recently concluded five-year Source To Tap project involved a pilot scheme to provide 100% grants to farmers looking to reduce pesticide and sediment loss through changes to management practices.

Alongside other water companies last year, Northern Ireland Water helped develop an online water quality training module for the national Basis classroom - a web-based resource for farmers across the UK - to advise on sustainable land management.

Northumbria Water/Essex and Suffolk Water

Areas covered: Northumbria Water - Tyneside, Wearside, Teesside, Northumberland and County Durham; Essex and Suffolk Water - Chelmsford, Brentwood, Romford, Tilbury, Basildon, Southend, Havering, Redbridge, Hanningfield, Langford and the London Boroughs of Barking and Dagenham; in Suffolk, supply is available to Barsham, Walpole, Southwold, Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth

Catchment advisers in the Northumbria Water/Essex and Suffolk Water areas work with farmers on a one-to-one basis.

Through farm audits they can help identify measures in the farmyard or the field that could improve raw water quality.

""Catchment management is really important if we're to try to at least maintain raw water quality, but ultimately improve it,"" explains company spokesperson William Robinson.

The implementation of eligible improvements can be funded with capital grants from the company as part of its Field to Tap scheme, which is focused on minimising risk of key polluters such as nitrates, pesticides and cryptosporidium.

Money available for up to 50% of investment and grants to date have funded measures such as concrete hardstanding in yards, biobeds and precision fertiliser application equipment.

Where and how this funding is spent can be flexible, adds Mr Robinson, who says farmers with ideas that could have a benefit to water quality are encouraged to get in touch.

The company also carries out trial work on areas such as reducing nitrogen losses from soil to groundwater and are keen to work alongside farmers to test technology such as nitrogen inhibitors and cover crops.

Scottish Water

Areas covered: All of Scotland

Scottish Water works with land managers through its sustainable land management team to assess and make recommendations about land activities that take place near drinking water sources.

To safeguard these areas further, the organisation also has a Drinking Water Protection scheme, which covers specific areas within drinking water catchments.

Farmers can ask for an on-site visit from advisers to identify potential improvements that could enhance water quality.

Where applicable, the scheme will finance the investment at up to 100% of the cost.

Measures available cover a range of capital and management options including biobeds, stock fencing and the resurfacing of gateways.

SES Water

Areas covered: Surrey, Kent and south London, from Morden and south Croydon to Gatwick airport and spanning from Dorking to Edenbridge

Though it does not have a formal grant scheme, SES Water is keen to hear from farmers who are interested in investing in mutually beneficial, sustainable, catchment-based solutions to prevent pollution entering watercourses.

The company has a dedicated catchment team, which includes a scientist and a consultant, who work closely with farmers in the area and host on-farm walks and visits.

© SES Water

Catchment manager Ria Woodfield says: ""Our key concerns in the catchment are primarily around autumn-applied herbicides - things like propyzamide and flufenacet.

""The other area we have a lot of issues with is nitrates in the water. These are our two key water qualities that we want to address [through funding].""

Past solutions have included funding the installation of biobeds on farm.

Severn Trent Water

Areas covered: Bristol Channel to the Humber and from mid-Wales to the East Midlands

Over recent years, Severn Trent Water has launched a plethora of schemes, workshops and grant funding in a bid to work more closely with farmers in its catchment areas.

All of these come under the firm's Regenerative Pathway Package, which is designed to help farmers protect and improve rivers.

Set to close on 31 January, the Severn Trent Environmental Scheme is offering farmers and landowners grants of up to £30,000 to put towards farm improvements that will help reduce water quality issues.

Priority funding is reserved for farms in catchment areas where pesticide reduction is paramount and is designed to go towards washdown and disposal areas.

For farmers outside catchments where pesticide reduction is a priority, maximum funding of £10,000 is up for grabs.

Over December and January, Severn Trent also held free virtual training workshops on improving spray efficiencies - with participating farmers able to claim a set of low-drift spray nozzles upon completion of the course.

One final Swap Your Nozzles session will be held on 24 February and is open to all farmers in Severn Trent pesticide priority catchment areas.

Training covers a variety of topics from legislation, buffer zones and local environment risk assessments for pesticides, to nozzle selection and application decision-making.

Southern Water

Areas covered: Kent, Sussex, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight

Southern Water offers a number of support options for farmers as part of its Catchment First commitment to improve and protect water and the surrounding environment.

For eligible catchments, Southern Water runs a farm capital grant scheme as part of its Water for Life programme.

Funding can cover up to 50% of the purchase cost, up to a maximum value of £10,000, and is targeted at reducing nitrate and pesticide risks to water quality by investment in more sustainable land management practices.

Southern Water also funded the soil health monitoring of eight farms over five years in one of its catchment areas - an initiative that in ended 2021.

Findings were used to better understand the impact of different cropping and management strategies on both soil health and nutrient availability and the influence this may or may not have on water quality.

Case study: Partnership bolsters farm business resilience

Farmers working with Anglian Water are being encouraged to build their business resilience by managing and monetising their natural capital.

The water company has joined forces with Trinity AgTech to offer farmers a trusted and scientific solution to optimising soil health.

""Farmers can monitor and, where necessary, make informed decisions to improve their soil health and keep inputs on the field.

""That inevitably improves drinking water quality and farmers gain from a business productivity perspective,"" says Anglian Water catchment adviser Chris Hewis.

Trinity AgTech's natural capital navigator Sandy is a software package that shows how changing farm management practices affects on-farm carbon sequestration, biodiversity and water quality so farmers can profit from their decisions.

This can benefit farm businesses as well as the environment, says Anglian Water senior agronomy adviser Richard Reynolds.

""The more productive and more economically sustainable farmers are, the better end result for water quality.

""Farmers are coming up against challenging times financially, so supporting them in making the most of their inputs is crucial to making sure their businesses stand the test of time,"" adds Mr Reynolds.

Using Sandy to optimise soil health can increase both farm productivity and the soil's water holding capacity, allowing better nutrient retention and reducing the risk of run-off.

""As a result, business resilience for both parties will be bolstered and everyone gains from a water quality and environmental perspective,"" he says.

284,"What opportunities does new biomass strategy offer farmers?","https://www.fwi.co.uk/business/what-opportunities-does-new-biomass-strategy-offer-farmers","What opportunities does new biomass strategy offer farmers?

The area of land devoted to perennial biomass crops has remained stubbornly low, despite an aspiration to increase the use of home-grown biomass in the power, heat and transport sectors over the past two decades.

According to government statistics, in 2020 around 121,000ha of land - or just over 2% of the agricultural area - was used to grow biomass crops for energy, with the majority of this used for biofuels and biogas.

See also: Grants to improve biomass crops efficiency

Of this, 29,000ha of wheat and 7,000ha of sugar beet were used for biofuels, 85,000ha of crops used for anaerobic digestion, with just 8,000ha of miscanthus and 2,000ha of short rotation coppice used in biomass.

Domestic crops exported for bioenergy are excluded from this data.

The Climate Change Committee has previously proposed that there needs to be more than 700,000ha of perennial biomass crops by 2050 to help the UK meet its net-zero targets.

In August 2023, the government published a new Biomass Strategy, which set out its vision for the use of biomass in the UK.

The 200-page document highlights that, in 2022, 11% of the total electricity supply was generated from bioenergy, adding ""its future potential is extraordinary"".

However, Dr Jonathan Scurlock, NFU chief adviser on renewable energy and climate change, says despite some welcome statements about the potential for biomass to play a significant role in decarbonising nearly all sectors of the economy, the strategy is underwhelming.

Warm words - no policy action

""It's a bit of a sham,"" says Jonathan. ""There are warm words in the forewords by the energy minister and the departmental chief scientific adviser, Professor Paul Monks, but there is a very poor resource assessment and no proper policy action recommendations.""

Government figures estimate that, in 2022, 66% of biomass feedstocks used in renewable energy supply was from domestic sources.

However, this figure is described as ""questionable"" by a number of independent commentators, who believe the percentage has been inflated significantly by a guesstimate of how much wood fuel is burned domestically in open fires and stoves.

The document talks about the need to reduce barriers to increase domestic production of biomass, but there is little policy detail given of how this might be achieved sustainably.

Indeed, the report says the UK will take an ""agnostic approach"" to where biomass feedstocks are sourced from, as long as they comply with the relevant sustainability criteria.

Miscanthus returns

Miscanthus growers could currently achieve a net margin of up to £500/ha if growing the crops on the right land in the right way, according to Kevin Lindegaard, director of consultancy Crops for Energy.

""It is like anything: if you plant a crop on your worst land then you are not going to get the yields [and the margin will be lower]. But if you plant it on good land, you will get a good yield.""

It is a crop that can take seven years to pay back the initial investment, so is not going to suit everyone and does come with a higher level of risk than some alternatives.

Growers who are entering the market tend to have a very specific ""market pull"".

For example, they might be very close to a power station or other buyer offering a decent contract price, and they know it is not going to cost much to deliver it in.

Others might already have a biomass boiler and want to grow their own supply of fuel.

""Domestically produced feedstocks are not inherently more sustainable than imported feedstocks,"" says the strategy.

Jonathan says this lack of endorsement is disappointing at a time when farmers are looking for alternative sources on income, in response to Basic Payment Scheme payments being phased out.

""Perennial energy crops won't appeal to every farmer - notably those without long-term land tenure, under farm tenancies or contract farming agreements - but they offer potentially stable diversification of farm income, together with multipurpose land use that can provide game cover, harbour biodiversity and perform other ecosystem services such as slowing floodwaters or capturing diffuse pollution.""

The biomass strategy acknowledges that any increase in the production of energy crops must not undermine the commitment made in the government's Food Strategy to maintain current levels of food production.

Land Use Framework awaited

Finding the right balance between different land use priorities will be one of the objectives of the Land Use Framework for England, which has been promised later in 2023.

Jonathan says the NFU will be looking for the government to implement further measures to show its commitment to maintaining food security.

However, the union does believe that biomass crops, when located on less productive land, can be managed in a sustainable fashion that works alongside rather than competing against food production or other environmental targets.

""In many cases, land can be multifunctional,"" he points out.

Kevin agrees there is frustration within the sector that the strategy downplays the role of home-grown biomass despite the environmental benefits offered by the crops.

Opposition from environmental groups to large-scale imported biomass had cast a shadow over locally produced biomass crops and led to the strange situation where organisations that should be a natural ally to the biomass sector are lobbying against it.

Their concerns tend to be around the planting of non-native crops and the fear of replacing one monoculture with another.

Planting 700,000ha of biomass by 2050 is a large area that will take decades to achieve. This means that checks and balances can be put in place to make sure any detrimental effects are minimised, says Kevin.

""The whole idea of the climate emergency is that we need to be cracking on with implementing measures that make a difference, and crops like miscanthus and willow can make a quick and rapid difference,"" he says.

Flood mitigation

""I am all for planting trees, but when it comes to flood mitigation, trees are not going to help in two or three years, whereas willow and miscanthus can.""

The government has recently invested £36m in a Biomass Feedstocks Innovation (BFI) programme, which ends in March 2025.

All the projects that have been funded under this scheme are required to have a commercialisation strategy in place to take their innovations to market.

However, if farmers do not have enough confidence to put biomass crops in the ground, then any momentum that has been gained will be lost, says Kevin.

This would be disappointing given there are some groundbreaking innovations coming out of the BFI.

He - along with a collection of other industry stakeholders - says the solution is to design and implement a long-term scheme that will convince farmers they can make a viable income from biomass crops.

This could involve a tiered approach with the highest payments available for biomass crops planted in a way that maximises biodiversity and environmental protection.

""Farmers are not going change what they have done for their entire lives if it offers only a 5% increase in return, it needs to be enough for them to become a no-brainer.

£40/t gap

""I would say there is still a gap of about £40/t between what the end user is prepared to pay and what a farmer needs in order to convince them to grow it.

""If we had a scheme that offered at least the equivalent of that, it would probably be enough to stimulate extra supply, which would mean the innovations from the BFI would have a market.""

Kevin argues that a scheme could be rolled out on a trial basis in 2025, involving a limited number of growers or land area, and then given a full launch in 2027.

""These timescales are considered to be realistic and will provide the assurance required by biomass crops companies to invest and scale up capacity with confidence.""

Another concern is that biomass crops have become synonymous with bioenergy, but there is considerable potential for farmers to derive new revenue streams by looking at different aspects of the crop.

This may be the ecosystem services they provide while the crop is growing.

However, there are also current and planned R&D projects looking at biomass crops for use as pharmaceuticals, biopolymers, bio-packaging, insulation, cement replacements, biochar, mulches, composts and animal fodders.

""All of these are potentially more lucrative for a farmer than selling into large-scale bioenergy facilities,"" says Kevin.

Case study: James Mutton, Burlerrow Farm, Bodmin

James Mutton has been growing miscanthus since 2002.

Initially, the crop was grown to produce miscanthus rhizomes for Bical, but when that business ended, he started exploring opportunities to use miscanthus as a premium equine animal bedding.

The business processes miscanthus for its bedding products line (Burlybed), heating briquettes (Burlyburn), and forage products (Burlybale) based on grass, hay or haylage.

The farm produces about 600t of miscanthus a year from about 55ha of its own land and buys in 3,000t-plus from 20 other growers.

James achieves yields of about 12t/ha (at 15% moisture content on his own land) and has established a wide wildlife margin around the outside of the crop under Countryside Stewardship to further increase the farm's margins.

In 2022, Burlerrow Farm produced 170,000 premium-grade equine bales, each weighing 19kg and retailing for £8-£10/bale.

The heating briquettes are made from the fine material left after the crop has been processed for animal bedding.

""We plan to lift some of our own rhizomes in 2025 to multiply our total miscanthus acreage here in Cornwall by at least another 200 acres,"" says James.

""We are actively looking for new growers in the South West and offer competitive rates.""

Much of the information for this case study was provided by Biomass Connect, which is an independent online platform, funded by the BFI, showcasing best-practice and innovations in the biomass sector.

An aphid-spread virus, known to affect oilseed rape crops, is now being seen hitting combine pea yields by as much as 40%. This may explain why pea yields have not shown significant increases in recent years.

Turnip Yellows Virus (TuYV) was detected in all 20 pea fields looked at in 2022 - from Aberdeenshire down to Kent and across to Hampshire.

They were assessed following a mild winter, which allowed aphids carrying the virus to thrive. However, the virus did not cause signs of visual damage to crops.

Adrian Fox, lead plant virologist at science group Fera, who conducted the field testing set out to discover the prevalence of two well-documented pea viruses in crops, but soon discovered that TuYV was the most damaging to pea crops.

""We found a high incidence of the virus in all the 20 fields which had passed unnoticed before and was leading to a big suppression of yield,"" he told a pulses roadshow organised by seed and agrochemicals group Syngenta and the Processors and Growers Research Organisation (PGRO).

Aphids control

To minimise the effect of the virus, he advised growers to follow good aphid management practices - whether that is with insecticide sprays or by encouraging aphid predators - while more research work is undertaken to investigate control methods.

Dr Fox's three-year study into pea viruses covered 2020, 2021 and 2022, and was funded by the AHDB along with the PGRO. 

It aimed to find the incidence level of two well-known viruses - the pea enation mosaic virus and pea seed-borne mosaic virus. These two were found to a limited level, but by far the most serious virus found was TuYV.

PGRO chief executive Roger Vickers added that perhaps the widespread incidence of the virus could well be the reason why pea yields have not progressed in recent years.

In 2020, only about half the pea fields sampled showed the virus, but following a mild winter in 2021-22, all the 20 fields tested in 2022 exhibited the virus, which led to low pea grain size and a low number of pods in crops.

""It was not surprising we found a high level of virus after the mild winter and then the warm spring, which favoured high aphid numbers,"" said Dr Fox.

Two key aphids

The virus is spread by two aphids - the peach-potato aphid (Myzus persicae), which spreads TuVY in oilseed rape; and the pea aphid. They have a wide host crop range, such as oilseed rape and brassica weeds.

The potential yield loss from the virus was shown to be of the same magnitude in the state of Victoria, south-eastern Australia, where it caused yield losses of 40% in field peas.

TuYV is the most important viral disease of oilseed rape and can cut yields by up to 30%.

Symptoms usually show in late spring and early summer, appearing as purple tingeing of leaf edges, with pods that can easily be mistaken for frost damage, nutrient deficiency or other stresses.

Peach-potato aphids are resistant to a number of active ingredients.

Therefore, control in oilseed rape is based on management techniques such as using resistant varieties, encouraging natural enemies of aphids and destroying ""green bridges"" of weeds, forage brassicas and volunteer plants where aphids can survive.

The emergence of TuYV-resistant oilseed rape varieties has helped control the virus in rapeseed.

Dr Fox said further work is needed to see if there are any virus-resistant pea varieties, and it was clear that early virus infection was seen to be more severe compared with later infection.

Merseyside arable farmer and agricultural YouTuber Olly Harrison planted a 1ha segment of oilseed rape via aerial application with a quadcopter drone.

The P40 XAG drone also broadcast a cover crop of phacelia and mustard into a standing crop of winter wheat, before the cereal was even harvested.

Operating at an average speed of 7.7m/second, with a 25kg hold capacity, the drone was supplied by Agricultural drone service company Quadrotor Services.

""We did three passes spreading the oilseed rape at a width of 8m and flew 6-7m above the ground. This took just under three minutes to complete,"" says Olly.

Sow 20ha in one hour

Peter Johnson co-founder of the firm explains that under optimum conditions dependent on wind speed, width of spread and drone weight, the device can fly up to an impressive 12m/sec. This is the equivalent of 20ha/hour which includes recharge time.

""Users can expect a battery life of about 10 minutes and a full recharge time of 8 minutes.

""The drone will fly back to base at 25% battery life, where we rotate a number of batteries and fit a new one in less than 60 seconds - it's like a Formula One pitstop,"" says Peter.

The machine is simple to use and is controlled via an app on a mobile phone or tablet. The drone costs about £27,000 plus VAT, which means you could get a fleet of drones for a fraction of the cost of a tractor and drill.

A larger 55kg hold capacity drone is also available, costing about £35,000 plus VAT.

The dos and don'ts of drones

Current UK legislation prohibits aerial application of any product which comes with a map number, which includes all herbicide, fungicide and insecticide sprays.

Fungicide seed treatments are also prohibited so undressed seed was sourced. 

As the drone spreads at a rate of 10kg/ha and the OSR was spread at 2.1kg/ha, the rate was made up with 7.9kg/ha of urea starter fertiliser.

Furthermore, drones are not permitted to fly within 50m of uninvolved participants or fly as a swarm, hence Olly used the drone to plant a segment in the middle of the field.

Furthermore, only one drone is permitted to be flown per operator.

""I can really see the advantages of planting crops with drones, as it's a better use of time and can avoid soil compaction but the legislation is too far behind the technology. This really needs to catch up if we are to scale-up,"" says Olly.

If aerial establishment proves successful, Olly's next step will be establishing a crop of millet into a standing crop of winter barley with the drone next June in order to gain an extra crop from the rotation.

Plans for slug pellets and glyphosate aerial applications

Aerial application of slug pellets and glyphosate sprays for control of bracken, blackgrass and Japanese knot weed control are nearing UK approval.

Agricultural drone service company Quadrotor Services and UK drone importer Autospray Systems are currently seeking licence approval from the CRD for a number of drone-use extensions.

Rob Pearson, chief executive officer of Autospray Systems explains that drone legislation is gaining momentum.

""We first imported drones into the UK in 2019, working closely with Chinese drone manufacturer XAG. Since then, we've made incredibly slow progress - but now we have government on our side, we're gaining momentum.

""We've successfully got drones legal to fly here in the UK, so the next step is getting pesticides approved which we are well advanced on.

""It is no longer a question of will we able to make aerial glyphosate applications, but more of a question of when and what will the buffer zone requirements be?"" he says.

Quadrotor Services’ Peter Johnson is hopeful the slug pellet licence will be approved within the next four weeks, with movement on glyphosate spraying by the end of this year.

Seed technology firm Nuseed is hoping successful UK trials of new Brassica carinata varieties over the next two years will offer growers a new combinable crop opportunity to help boost farm income and contribute to sustainability targets.

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is now at the top of every industry's agenda, and one sector that will find it particularly tough is aviation, with electric passenger flights a long way from take-off.

Hydrogen-powered aircraft could be a reality as early as the mid-2030s, but there are many hurdles to overcome and the fuel is likely to be restricted initially to short- and medium-haul flights.

Kerosene reliant

That leaves airlines reliant for now on carbon dioxide-emitting kerosene, and to offset some of the emissions created burning the fossil fuel, governments are setting targets for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use.

SAF is blended with kerosene at different levels, depending on the feedstock - coming from sugar crops, oilseed crops and animal fats - and how it is produced.

In the UK, the government has committed to 10% SAF use by 2030 and that will continue to grow until 2050, when the industry aims to reach net zero.

Similarly, the European Parliament and Council recently reached political agreement on the ReFuelEU Aviation proposal, which aims to decarbonise the aviation sector in the 27 EU member countries with increasing amounts of SAF from 2025.

It will start with 2% of overall fuel supplied at EU airports by 2025, before ratcheting up to 70% by 2050.

Growing opportunity

One oilseed species that can be used as an SAF feedstock is Brassica carinata, as its high erucic and linoleic acid content, combined with less than 7% saturated fatty acids, requires minimal processing to make high-quality biofuel.

Nuseed - a sister company to crop protection company Nufarm - acquired Canadian firm Agrisoma in 2019, which had a strong carinata breeding programme and last year produced its first hybrid for the Americas: Nujet 400.

Until now, Nuseed's carinata varieties have only been commercialised in South America and the southern US, but development programmes are advancing quickly in Australia and Europe.

Nuseed is involved in Carina, a European Union supported project - within the Horizon Europe research programme - which focuses on two new oilseed crops, namely carinata and camelina for use in the bio-based economy.

Carina trials in 2023 have or will be established on marginal sites, or in intercropping or relay cropping systems, with drill dates ranging from spring (April/May) to autumn (September-November).

There are sites in several European countries including Italy, France, Spain, Serbia, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Greece, along with Morocco and Turkey.

Testing partners

Nuseed European sales and marketing director Damien Grundy tells Farmers Weekly that the firm is also looking for testing partners in the UK, as it believes there is potential for it to be produced here.

It's hoped that after two to three years of small plot and commercial scale research, the company will be able to offer closed-loop growing contracts to UK farmers.

Harvested oilseed will be transported straight to one of oilseed processing giant Saipol's crushing sites in France. It is expected that Saipol will take care of all logistics.

The project is being turbocharged by a 10-year co-operation agreement with oil giant BP, which aims to accelerate market adoption of carinata. BP will also purchase all carinata oil produced over the duration of the agreement.

""We need to do the work and need some time to get it right. Nuseed has a responsibility to ensure farmers can grow it successfully and can offer the correct advice on growing processes and procedures.

""But it's really exciting to potentially have a new opportunity to bring to the industry,"" says Damien.

Cover crop

So, where does Nuseed see it fitting into crop rotations?

In Argentina and other areas where it is being grown successfully, carinata is drilled on marginal land out of food crop production, or in between main cash crops as a cover crop, says Nuseed's carinata R&D agronomist Augustina Sans.

Used in this way, where it doesn't take the place of any food crops, it is estimated that there are some 170m hectares of accessible land across North America and Europe for carinata production.

Yields are typically 1-2t/ha. Nuseed says it will structure contracts in a way that ensures a return on investment and claims growers will get all the benefits of catch or cover crop, including moisture and nutrient retention, and biodiversity improvements.

""It has a very big tap root, so it allows us to improve the structure of the soil, and its canopy - with a high green leaf area - is good at capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and fixing it in the soil through the root system.

""Carinata is quite resistant to diseases and up to this point we have not experienced any issues in our trials so far,"" adds Augustina.

Low input

Damien adds that because the objective of carinata-derived aviation fuel is reducing carbon emissions, carinata growing protocols for contracts will encourage farmers to use as little fossil fuel or synthetic crop inputs as possible.

In practical terms, that means little or no cultivation during establishment, more reliance on organic fertiliser rather than bagged, and as few crop protection sprays as possible to ensure a reasonable yield.

""Payments will be linked to carbon emissions. You must record all inputs into the crop and the more fertiliser or sprays you use, the less the farmer will receive.

""It's about producing sustainable fuel and that means using sustainable farming practices, so the less artificial input, the better.""

The most significant concern when growing carinata in the UK is cold temperature, with prolonged lows of about -7C having the potential to kill off crops in the winter.

""That's why we are keen to try different establishment dates in our development work. We also hope to look at broadcasting into cereal crops in June to harvest in late Autumn, which would avoid any frost problems. We are thinking that is the best window for the UK.""

Industry view - carinata potential to be trialled by Hutchinsons

Crop production specialists Hutchinsons is one company that will investigate the potential of carinata in UK conditions after catching the eye of commercial director David Crossman on a recent Nufarm and Nuseed demonstration day in Serbia.

He says the Hutchinsons technical team hopes to establish small plot and field scale trials this autumn and next spring, depending on the availability of seed.

""I think it is more suited to Mediterranean areas than the UK. One thing we'll look at is whether it will survive the winter with us, because of its lower frost tolerance compared with other brassicas.

 ""We don't get three or four weeks of freezing temperatures like some parts of continental Europe, but we get the odd night of -5C or -10C, so we'd need to know it can survive that if sowing in the autumn,"" explains David.

The company is involved with the supply of mustard to Coleman's and with carinata being a mustard relative, it is hoping to lean on its experience to help explore its potential and make it a success.

Environmental schemes

Hutchinsons agronomist and services leader Matt Ward says that grown as a single species cover crop, rather than a multispecies mix, growing carinata wouldn't be eligible for payments through the Sustainable Farming Incentive.

""We desperately need alternative break crops that are a success in their own right, but the worry is that it'll suffer from similar problems as oilseed rape, like flea beetle, as it is a brassica.

""Clubroot is another issue, so if there is already a significant area of brassicas in the rotation, you certainly wouldn't want to grow another one,"" notes Matt.

Asked about the potential of growing carinata in between cash crops, he sees it as unlikely with the broadacre rotations that presently dominate the UK.

He is also sceptical about broadcasting carinata seed into standing crops in the summer, with experience suggesting small-seeded species need to be drilled like any cash crop would be.

A possibility could be drilling immediately after an early harvested crop like vining peas in May, with the fast-developing carinata harvested in October before establishing a winter wheat crop.

On farms producing feedstock for an anaerobic digestion plant, another slot might be in May or June immediately after whole crop forage rye. It could then be followed by another wheat or AD that autumn or the following spring.

""There would be soil health benefits and if you could make double cropping work it would be quite exciting for the grower.

""But would many want to be harvesting an oilseed crop and drilling so late? Perhaps if you were in southeast England with lighter soils, it would work. That is what our research will aim to find out.""

294,"Farmers prefer mandatory cattle TB vaccination, study finds","https://www.fwi.co.uk/livestock/health-welfare/livestock-diseases/bovine-tb/__trashed-4","Farmers prefer mandatory cattle TB vaccination, study finds

A mandatory, government-led approach paid for by the Treasury is the preferred option among farmers for cattle TB vaccination, according to new research.

The findings of the Defra-commissioned study (pdf), published in Veterinary Record, reveal that farmers do not want a repeat of the farmer-led, collective approach which has been used to deliver badger culling across England.

Three scenarios representing possible policies for the deployment of the CattleBCG vaccination were developed: government-led, individual (voluntary) and a farmer-led, collective approach. Vaccine efficacy was set at 85% for all three scenarios.

See also: Bovine TB cattle vaccine field trials move to next phase

Researchers explored the attitudes towards all three scenarios in five farmer workshops involving 82 farmers across England and Wales, and also with 35 industry stakeholders.

Making TB vaccination of cattle mandatory was chosen as the best option, as it was thought a voluntary approach might not result in sufficient take-up. The collective approach was the least popular of the three options.

Asking farmers to pay for vaccination was also not popular. However, in general there was support for a low-cost vaccine - such as £6 per dose - provided that vaccinating was voluntary.

Trust in those delivering the vaccination and in the efficacy of the vaccine itself was ""crucial"". Private vets were seen as most trusted to administer the vaccines, the study found.

Farmers also said they needed to trust the associated detecting infected among vaccinated animals (Diva) diagnostic test. Any potential implications for trade of cattle must also be addressed, they added.

No ""˜silver bullet'

But farmers stressed that cattle vaccination should not be seen as a ""silver bullet"" and wildlife control would still be needed to eradicate the disease.

The research team included Kingshay farm vet Sarah Tomlinson, a member of Defra's bovine TB partnership board.

She said: ""This research is an opportunity for Defra to understand farmers' views on cattle vaccination so they can work out what the barriers are and how to overcome them.

""For example, farmers do not want farmer-led vaccination companies. Most importantly, farmers have got to trust the policy and ensure the science and evidence they have to deliver it is thoroughly tested.""

Defra aims to have a deployable CattleBCG vaccine and Diva test available for commercial use from 2025.

Bovine TB is a devastating disease affecting cattle, causing significant trauma for livestock farmers and rural communities.

It is the most challenging animal health disease the UK faces, costing taxpayers tens of millions of pounds each year.

In 2011, Defra spent £95m battling it - almost 40% of its entire animal health and welfare budget of £220m.

There was a stark realisation from within government and the industry that something needed be done.

In July 2013, under the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government, then-Defra secretary Owen Paterson set out his plan to rid England of bovine TB in 25 years.

Launching the strategy, Mr Paterson said 28,000 otherwise healthy cattle had been slaughtered in the UK in the previous year because of TB.

The minister explained he had visited Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and the US, and the country ""must learn from their successful eradication programmes"".

The strategy was developed by the Animal Health and Welfare Board for England (AHWBE) and the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Advisory Group for England (TBEAG).

It drew extensively on experiences in the four countries visited by Mr Paterson, all of which successfully tackled bovine TB by addressing the disease in cattle and in wildlife.

Michael Seals, then chairman of the AHWBE, recalls being asked by farming minister Jim Paice to create the consultation document that led to the policy.

""The biggest impact was the realisation something dramatic had to be done,"" says Mr Seals.

""We just couldn't go on as we were - testing and removing cattle was not an option. There had to be action on wildlife.""

Various workshops involving many people affected by the disease were held across the country.

The work within Defra was taken up by TBEAG, led by John Cross, who brought together the experts necessary to achieve a good co-design policy proposal.

Multi-pronged approach

Behind the scenes, there was a lot of interest in developing the policy beyond the badger cull, including exploring the possibility of cattle vaccination and the requirement for an associated detecting infected among vaccinated animals (Diva) diagnostic test.

World-renowned bovine TB expert Prof Glyn Hewinson and a team from the Animal and Plant Health Agency were looking at the science of TB, including badger and cattle vaccination, PCR testing of badger faeces and the desire to find a more reliable and accurate cattle test.

Oral BCG vaccination of badgers was considered to be the ""holy grail"", but despite many trials, this remains unachievable.

Defra devised the badger culling policy in conjunction with stakeholders including the NFU, which paid for a lot of the administrative costs and the setting up of the culling companies.

""It was a joint enterprise - working to achieve a common good,"" says Mr Seals.

Badger culling was supposed to start in England in autumn 2012, but it was delayed after the Badger Trust launched a legal challenge at the High Court in London.

This was unsuccessful and the policy was introduced in two pilot counties in the summer of 2013 - Gloucestershire and Somerset.

Licensed culls carried out by trained marksmen have since been rolled out to 72 areas of England.

In the long term, however, government policy seeks to replace culling with vaccination, both of cattle and badgers.

Cattle vaccination trials

Sarah Tomlinson is a Derbyshire-based farm vet and technical director of the Defra-funded TB Advisory Service (Tbas), which since 2017 has delivered more than 3,000 farm visits to livestock farms in England to tackle TB.

She says: ""I believe that the success of the first 10 years of the eradication stage is down to a combination of policies.

""In order to achieve TB freedom by 2038, we need to embrace the new science and technology that is advancing all the time.

""For example, the current trials to allow the delivery of a cattle BCG vaccination programme and the associated Diva skin test. Hopefully, one day, there will be a TB-free future for wildlife, cattle and our farmers.""

Bovine TB strategy in the devolved regions

Agricultural policy is devolved, which explains why each nation has a different eradication strategy and target.

In Wales, the Welsh government has a goal of eradicating bovine TB by 2041.

The Labour minority administration announced a ""refreshed"" five-year plan in March, with a policy focused on cattle measures.

NFU Cymru has criticised the plan for its lack of focus on tackling the disease in wildlife, in particular badgers.

In Northern Ireland, former farm minister Edwin Poots launched a long-term Bovine TB Eradication Strategy in March 2022 in collaboration with the TB Eradication partnership, industry and stakeholders.

The wildlife intervention part of the strategy is subject to legal challenge, with the outcome of a judicial review expected soon.

Scotland is officially TB-free and its control measures are centred around trade.

Sir Jim, who farms a small fold of pedigree Highland cattle in the Newmarket area, says there is still a long way to go to achieve TB-free status.

""I'm a bit concerned about the direction of the strategy. I think Defra should leave the option open [of badger culling]. Although there may well be a change in government with a different policy,"" he adds.

Cheshire-based dairy farmer Phil Latham, who is also a member of the Bovine TB Partnership, says whichever government is in power must ensure future TB policy is ""based on the science and evidence, and not politics"".

""My concern would be allowing the regrowth of the badger population in the absence of proven new tools,"" he adds.

""There is no evidence to prove that vaccination of badgers or cattle reduces cattle TB. It appears that politics, not evidence, is driving future policy.""

View from experts

Prof Hewinson, who is now SÃªr Cymru research chairman in the Centre of Excellence for Bovine Tuberculosis for Wales at Aberystwyth University, says good progress has been made in England by addressing all the sources of TB infection.

He believes further progress will require more focus on understanding the local drivers of TB transmission and applying the most appropriate interventions at a local level.

""What we are really trying to do is reduce the basic reproduction rate for TB, R0, below one so that it dies out,"" Prof Hewinson says.

""This is best achieved through a multi-pronged approach, using the best tools at our disposal in the right place at the right time, making marginal gains along the way. Sadly, there is no magic bullet.""

James Wood is an experienced veterinary epidemiologist at the University of Cambridge who works on bovine TB in the UK, Ethiopia and India.

He says scientists now have a much better understanding of TB than they did 10 years ago, which is helping to formulate better evidence-based policy.

""Fifteen years ago, people were focusing on badgers, but it's really good to see cattle measures are being recognised as important.

""Likewise, it is important to recognise there are big changes associated with badger culling. We're moving away from the concept of there being one silver bullet. We are trying to tackle TB on all fronts.""

Government response

Defra says there are signs its strategy is working. Latest data shows the percentage of cattle herds under TB restrictions in England (prevalence) is, at 4.3%, one of the lowest since October 2010, having peaked at 6.4% in March 2018.

But the department insists now is the right time to transition its policy from blanket approaches to more targeted interventions across England.

UK chief vet Christine Middlemiss says: ""We have always been clear that we do not want to continue the current badger cull longer than necessary.

""Our bovine TB eradication strategy has led to a significant reduction in this insidious disease and building on the progress made, we are now able to move onto the next phase, including wider badger vaccination, alongside improved cattle testing and working towards deployment of a cattle vaccine.""

TB conferences round-up

The TB Advisory Service (Tbas) is hosting the second National TB Conference at Sixways Stadium, Worcester, on 29 November 2023.

The Defra-backed event aims to reflect on the 10 years of the TB Eradication Scheme for England, and look forward to what the next 15 years may bring, asking: ""Is TB freedom really a possibility by 2038?""

Hosted by Tbas technical director Sarah Tomlinson, it will include five technical presentations and two question-and-answer panel sessions.

There will be exhibitor stands and opportunities for delegates to network, discuss topics with speakers and catch up on the latest TB updates. For further information and ticketing, visit www.tbas.org.uk.

Meanwhile, the annual AberTB conference will take place on 13 September at Aberystwyth University. This year's topic is TB in wildlife. Tickets are available at shop.aber.ac.uk.

Simon Cutter is confident his forage-based, easy-care system of producing beef and lamb will put him on a competitive footing with low-cost producers in New Zealand, Australia, and other nations where the UK has forged free-trade agreements.

At 64, the 2022 Farmers Weekly Beef Farmer of the Year has recently scaled back his farming operation, giving two young farmers the chance to take on some of the land and stock.

He is also mentoring them in the pasture-based methods he has used at Model Farm, Herefordshire.

See also: How multispecies swards can improve production efficiency

Farm facts: Model Farm, Hildersley, Herefordshire

Mr Cutter reckons it is this system that will make new entrants like them competitive with low-cost producers overseas.

""I wish that when I started out in farming, I had known then what I know now,"" he admits.

""Although raising ruminant livestock on a pasture-based system doesn't suit every farm or set of circumstances, we now know that the methods used by our grandfathers were correct.""

Mr Cutter offers this advice to farmers considering adopting a grass-based approach to livestock production:

1. Consider global research

A lot of the knowledge I have gained has not come from UK research but from trials in New Zealand.

Here, farmers, researchers and geneticists work together as a team, using estimated breeding values (EBVs) and other progressive approaches, along with crowd-funding research of specialist topics.

The style of livestock farming in New Zealand is mostly less intensive because farmers have the benefit of large areas of land.

For that reason, research on pasture-based methods is way ahead of what we have here in the UK.

We need to capitalise on that research and consider how it can be applied to individual systems here.

2. Maximise plant diversity

We have grown lucerne for many years; it does not need any chemical herbicides or artificial fertiliser and the yield is very high - it grows thigh-high three times a year and we get a smaller fourth cut or grazing for lambs.

It is important to let it flower at least once during the season, which we do at third cut.

Lucerne is 20% protein, so it removes the need to buy soya - we analyse it for nutrient values and this shows that it is high in calcium too, way off the scale.

In the exceptionally dry conditions we experienced last summer, the lucerne fields remained green. The plant is deep rooting - at least 2m in our red sandstone soils - so it did not suffer from the lack of rainfall.

We have been so pleased with it that this year we will increase the area grown from 8ha to 12ha (20 acres to 30 acres).

3. Be willing to experiment

Approach pasture-based farming with an open mind and be willing to try new things.

We have experimented by adding cocksfoot to the lucerne mix for the first time, trialling it in one half of a field; it is way ahead on growth compared with the half without it.

If we had listened to the seed companies, we might have used timothy or meadow fescue instead. However, we looked at independent research, again from New Zealand, and this showed good results from incorporating cocksfoot.

We are only in our first year of growing it, so we don't know if it will shorten the life of the ley; only time will tell. But unless we try these things, we will never know what works, and what doesn't.

4. It all starts with the soil

We protect soils from poaching by never outwintering on the same field two years in a row.

Getting a good cover of deferred grass protects the soil and makes it healthier.

Round feeders are moved every single day; there is never an excuse not to do that, even on Christmas Day.

5. Suckler cows do not need high-quality grazing

We have found that our Herefords are best suited to cheap ground and bale grazing on poorer land.

By strip-grazing during the winter, our wintering costs are only 80p a head a day. It is the winter costs that have most influence over suckler cow profitability.

The fence is moved daily, to provide fresh grazing, along with two bales of hay allocated to 50 cows.

Our cows still have plenty of milk on them when we wean the calves at 11 months old.

6. Collaborate with like-minded farmers

There can be a tendency in farming to hope that your neighbour fails at something, but as a founder member of the Pasture-Fed Livestock Association (PFLA), I am privileged to be part of a network of farmers who want each other to succeed.

If a farmer needs help, they post a message on the PFLA forum asking for advice. PFLA has local groups, too, to bring together people to discuss different subjects.

7. Have a back-up plan

Every farm needs a plan A, B and C, so if the first plan doesn't work, they can default to the second and so on.

For instance, in a pasture-based system, although the ethos is to keep stock at grass come what may, there might be a reason why the animals need to be housed.

If we were to stick to the original plan of keeping them at grass regardless, we would not be considering the needs of those animals. Their welfare should always have priority, first and foremost.

Three of the UK's four agri-tech centres are to merge into a single entity to drive a more joined-up approach towards new farming technologies and innovations.

The three to merge are Crop Health and Protection (Chap), the Centre for Innovation Excellence in Livestock (Ciel) and the Agricultural Engineering, Precision and Innovation (Agri-EPI) Centre.

This new single entity aims to facilitate a stronger cross-sectoral approach and drive better outcomes for the agri-tech sector across innovation, commercialisation and adoption, as well as research.

See also: Analysis: How farming will gain from new agri-tech solutions

Together they are being invited to develop a proposal to establish an agri-tech Catapult, to complement the work of the existing nine Catapults.

Established by the UK's innovation agency, Innovate UK, Catapults are world-leading technology and innovation centres spanning over 50 locations across the UK, transforming the nation’s capability for innovation in sectors of strength.

Innovate UK will offer additional support to UK businesses in the agri-tech sector, aligning with a key strategic priority in its healthy living and agriculture domain.

Agrimetrics, the fourth of the UK's agri-tech centres, will remain a separate entity.

George Freeman, the current minister for science, innovation and technology, launched the first Agri-Tech Industrial Strategy in 2013.

Clearer frameworks

Mr Freeman said he was delighted to be back driving the next wave of investment with much clearer frameworks, and an offer for global investors to back UK agri-tech.

""With the global population set to hit nine billion within the next 25 years, scientists have been clear that we need to double global food production using the same land with half as much energy and water,"" he said.

""That is the challenge driving global demand for agri-tech - the technologies that allow us to produce more with less.""

Prof Tina Barsby, a plant geneticist and a former chief executive of Niab, said merging three of the four UK agri-tech centres into a single entity ""makes sense"".

But she added: ""There are significant lessons to be learned from the past 10 years if it is to deliver meaningful improvements in the translation and uptake of new farming technologies and innovations.""

Chuck Baresich has been on a recruitment drive - but not in the conventional sense.

Over the past three years he has amassed a barnful of agricultural robots of all shapes and sizes, and hired a gang of technicians tasked with keeping them running.

Though initially employed purely on his own farm, they are now lent, leased and, in some cases, sold, to other agrarian technophiles within eight hours' drive of his Haggerty Ag Robotics business, based near Bothwell, south-west Ontario.

In most cases, interested parties are suffering from chronic labour shortages due to the diminishing appeal of seasonal, long-hour Canadian farm work combined with the shrinking and ageing of rural populations.

""Monotonous fieldwork is perfectly suited to a robot, which will work long hours without complaint or fatigue,"" says Mr Baresich, who farms 1,400ha and manages a 1.2m bushel grain storage business in partnership with his brother, Justin.

""We're always thinking about how we can operate more efficiently. The North American solution to improving productivity has traditionally been to make machinery bigger, faster and heavier, but we've now reached a plateau.

""Robots are already working in greenhouses and milking parlours, yet there has been little advancement in the arable sector. We've got cameras, autosteer and rate control on the sprayer, so I've often wondered why I need to be in the cab at all.""

According to Mr Baresich, the best way to manage the dwindling labour pool is to allow farmers more time to manage several tasks simultaneously and spend fewer vegetative hours piloting a tractor.

This has already been demonstrated by the likes of Iowan start-up Sabanto, with its fleet of small, autonomous Kubota tractors, and Australian firm Swarm Farm Robotics, which has a dedicated driverless platform.

Both have successfully matched the output of one monster outfit with several modestly sized machines, to the benefit of soil health and yield.

Gold rush

Dozens of autonomous tractors and tool carriers - concepts, prototypes and full production models - have appeared in the past decade.

Most of these come from start-up companies and research institutes, often basing their designs on widely available, and relatively cheap, components from the automotive sector.

Their aim is to develop a platform, or associated software, that will attract multimillion-dollar investments from the biggest names in the world of farm machinery.

Some are well designed and built, says Mr Baresich, while others are completely unsuitable for agriculture, making it a minefield for would-be buyers.

""The market for agricultural robots is like that of automobiles in 1910 Detroit. There might have been 200 manufacturers, but many of them were terrible and people ended up keeping the horse and cart.

""Over the following decade the few decent ones consolidated, and the rest went bankrupt.

""In the case of robots, you can quickly thin out the options by offering them a cheque to purchase one. These companies don't have the resources to build multiple prototypes, so I sometimes discover that there isn't actually anything to buy.""

One of the first mainstream models to go into production was the Raven Omnipower (nÃ©e Seedmaster Dot) that, based on its sheer size, remains one of the most obvious like-for-like alternatives to a mainstream tractor - at least for broadacre agriculture.

It is now under the CNHi umbrella following its $2.1bn acquisition of guidance specialist Raven in 2021.

That puts it in direct competition with another, more conventional, CNHi offering, in the form of Case IH's driverless but cabbed Magnum.

""Making the Magnum, or any conventional tractor, autonomous might sound inexpensive compared with developing a whole new platform such as the Omnipower, but it doesn't necessarily solve the problem,"" says Mr Baresich.

""Tractors with trailed implements are more difficult to control than self-propelled tool carriers, particularly when it comes to backing into corners, spotting implement blockages or detecting broken bearings.""

The same, he says, applies to so-called ""crossover autonomy"", where third-party systems from the likes of Mojow, Sabanto or Tel Aviv-based Blue White Robotics are retrofitted to conventional tractors, allowing them to operate autonomously in the field.

However, they do have advantages, not least that the machine can still be driven conventionally between field and yard, and there is an abundance of tractors on which the kits can be fitted.

Developing implements

As well as selling, servicing and leasing autonomous tractors, Mr Baresich is busy designing specialist implements for them.

These include drills, sprayers and cultivators, which are being produced in collaboration with existing manufacturers.

""Drills are the hardest to develop because everyone wants something slightly different and there is no economy of scale when the market for them is so small and specialist.""

But he expects to have a prototype 12-row maize planter by the end of the year and an umbilical slurry spreading system is in the works, developed with Ontario-based Cadman Power Equipment.

Why an Omnipower?

Mr Baresich runs two of the 25 Omnipower models now operating in North America, the first having arrived three years ago.

Many elements of the platform are eminently conventional, such as the 175hp six-cylinder Cummins diesel engine and two-range hydrostatic transmission.

In Mr Baresich's case, it carries a regular New Leader fertiliser spreader, albeit adapted with specialist mounting brackets.

Four-wheel steering provides telehandler-like manoeuvrability and, with a motor on each wheel, it can reach a top speed of 20kph. Maximum payload is roughly 12t, and implements are coupled via a standard hydraulic quick-connect.

Replacing the driver's eyes are eight high-definition stereo cameras, combined with ultrasonic radars, that constantly observe the surroundings.

The ability of the software to spot obstacles is a work in progress to ensure the system can differentiate between maize stalks and people, pylons and trees.

""Safety perception systems aren't ready yet,"" says Mr Baresich. ""And no one in the robotics space wants to be first on Twitter with a crashed robot.""

Transportation is the biggest logistical headache, with a purpose-built low-loader towed behind a telehandler or pickup to shift it between sites; loading/unloading takes about five minutes using a remote control.

""Moving it from field to field has to be a one-person job, otherwise it defeats the objective of autonomy. That same person can then start, monitor and refill the Omnipower as it works.""

For this reason, the platform is for now limited to spreading fertiliser, lime and compost, which also avoids the risk of inadvertently wrapping a sprayer boom around a telegraph pole or worrying about spotting a blocked nozzle from hundreds of metres away.

""It did 600ha in its first season [2020], though it wasn't without its challenges. We had a big audience for its debut run but by the time we'd overcome connectivity issues, most of the visitors had gone home.""

It culminated in the completion of just 20ha of the 100ha first-day goal - a total that wasn't achieved until well into week three.

""That sums up what it's like being at the bleeding edge of technology. What you don't necessarily think about is how much information and knowledge a driver has - and a robot doesn't - when it comes to doing a job.

""The mission planning software needs to know everything - where to start and stop, which direction to drive, spreading speed, turning speed, the size of the headland, how close to get to an obstacle, what to do when the hopper is empty, and so on.

""Then there are all the subjective decisions on the part of the manager; can I trust it to stay 10ft away from an obstacle? Will it stop when I ask it to?""

This makes the investment in an autonomous tractor all the more daunting, even before the price has been factored in.

Raven charges roughly C$600,000 (£365,000) for the Omnipower with an implement which, as it stands, is limited to relatively few tasks given the shortage of attachments available.

""We're hoping Raven develops a scaled-down version that is physically smaller and better suited to busy roads and smaller fields than those on the prairies of Saskatchewan where it was first developed.

""That will hopefully encourage more widescale adoption and, in turn, make it more attractive for manufacturers to develop specific implements for the machine - both in North America and Europe.""

Haggerty Ag Robotics now owns a ruck of smaller autonomous machines which are trialled on Mr Baresich's own farm and others within 400 miles of his base.

They are also offered as part of a contract planting and weeding service.

""We realised the potential business was bigger than just applying a couple of systems on our farm so, last year, we hired five staff to support other agricultural and horticultural growers that want to use them.""

Machines on the Haggerty books include the Montreal-made weed-pulling Nexus, Naio's Oz, Dino and Orio, and the tracked Korechi RoamIO.

There are also a handful of models that might be more familiar to European growers, such as the solar-powered Farmdroid FD20 now distributed in the UK by Opico, the diesel Agrointelli Robotti - one of which went to Home Farm Nacton near Ipswich - and a DJI drone with 40-litre/50kg capacity for spraying and spreading seed.

Research focuses on soil health and yield benefits, input savings and running costs.

""We've found that one robot is unlikely to do everything, and their suitability varies significantly depending on the farm type.

""A good example of this is the Farmdroid - it's brilliant in that it can both plant and hoe, so is involved in more parts of the growing season, but it can struggle to handle the big weeds and heavy trash conditions that we often have in Ontario,"" says Mr Baresich.

""There's also the means of propulsion to consider. Battery power is appealing, but there are huge logistical issues to contend with in Canada - not least that the Naio Dino needs recharging after 4ha.

""By comparison, existing farm machinery is so efficient - it's been developed to be that way for 50 years - so any widescale move to robotics won't happen overnight.""

Either way, Mr Baresich expects exponential growth in horticultural robotics in the next five years, and broadacre agriculture to follow in the next decade or so.

One of the first mainstream models to go into production was the Raven Omnipower (nÃ©e Seedmaster Dot) that, based on its sheer size, remains one of the most obvious like-for-like alternatives to a mainstream tractor - at least for broadacre agriculture.

It is now under the CNHi umbrella following its $2.1bn acquisition of guidance specialist Raven in 2021.

That puts it in direct competition with another, more conventional, CNHi offering, in the form of Case IH's driverless but cabbed Magnum.

""Making the Magnum, or any conventional tractor, autonomous might sound inexpensive compared with developing a whole new platform such as the Omnipower, but it doesn't necessarily solve the problem,"" says Mr Baresich.

""Tractors with trailed implements are more difficult to control than self-propelled tool carriers, particularly when it comes to backing into corners, spotting implement blockages or detecting broken bearings.""

The same, he says, applies to so-called ""crossover autonomy"", where third-party systems from the likes of Mojow, Sabanto or Tel Aviv-based Blue White Robotics are retrofitted to conventional tractors, allowing them to operate autonomously in the field.

However, they do have advantages, not least that the machine can still be driven conventionally between field and yard, and there is an abundance of tractors on which the kits can be fitted.

Developing implements

As well as selling, servicing and leasing autonomous tractors, Mr Baresich is busy designing specialist implements for them.

These include drills, sprayers and cultivators, which are being produced in collaboration with existing manufacturers.

""Drills are the hardest to develop because everyone wants something slightly different and there is no economy of scale when the market for them is so small and specialist.""

But he expects to have a prototype 12-row maize planter by the end of the year and an umbilical slurry spreading system is in the works, developed with Ontario-based Cadman Power Equipment.

Why an Omnipower?

Mr Baresich runs two of the 25 Omnipower models now operating in North America, the first having arrived three years ago.

Many elements of the platform are eminently conventional, such as the 175hp six-cylinder Cummins diesel engine and two-range hydrostatic transmission.

In Mr Baresich's case, it carries a regular New Leader fertiliser spreader, albeit adapted with specialist mounting brackets.

Four-wheel steering provides telehandler-like manoeuvrability and, with a motor on each wheel, it can reach a top speed of 20kph. Maximum payload is roughly 12t, and implements are coupled via a standard hydraulic quick-connect.

Replacing the driver's eyes are eight high-definition stereo cameras, combined with ultrasonic radars, that constantly observe the surroundings.

The ability of the software to spot obstacles is a work in progress to ensure the system can differentiate between maize stalks and people, pylons and trees.

""Safety perception systems aren't ready yet,"" says Mr Baresich. ""And no one in the robotics space wants to be first on Twitter with a crashed robot.""

Transportation is the biggest logistical headache, with a purpose-built low-loader towed behind a telehandler or pickup to shift it between sites; loading/unloading takes about five minutes using a remote control.

""Moving it from field to field has to be a one-person job, otherwise it defeats the objective of autonomy. That same person can then start, monitor and refill the Omnipower as it works.""

For this reason, the platform is for now limited to spreading fertiliser, lime and compost, which also avoids the risk of inadvertently wrapping a sprayer boom around a telegraph pole or worrying about spotting a blocked nozzle from hundreds of metres away.

""It did 600ha in its first season [2020], though it wasn't without its challenges. We had a big audience for its debut run but by the time we'd overcome connectivity issues, most of the visitors had gone home.""

It culminated in the completion of just 20ha of the 100ha first-day goal - a total that wasn't achieved until well into week three.

""That sums up what it's like being at the bleeding edge of technology. What you don't necessarily think about is how much information and knowledge a driver has - and a robot doesn't - when it comes to doing a job.

""The mission planning software needs to know everything - where to start and stop, which direction to drive, spreading speed, turning speed, the size of the headland, how close to get to an obstacle, what to do when the hopper is empty, and so on.

""Then there are all the subjective decisions on the part of the manager; can I trust it to stay 10ft away from an obstacle? Will it stop when I ask it to?""

This makes the investment in an autonomous tractor all the more daunting, even before the price has been factored in.

Raven charges roughly C$600,000 (£365,000) for the Omnipower with an implement which, as it stands, is limited to relatively few tasks given the shortage of attachments available.

""We're hoping Raven develops a scaled-down version that is physically smaller and better suited to busy roads and smaller fields than those on the prairies of Saskatchewan where it was first developed.

""That will hopefully encourage more widescale adoption and, in turn, make it more attractive for manufacturers to develop specific implements for the machine - both in North America and Europe.""

Haggerty Ag Robotics now owns a ruck of smaller autonomous machines which are trialled on Mr Baresich's own farm and others within 400 miles of his base.

They are also offered as part of a contract planting and weeding service.

""We realised the potential business was bigger than just applying a couple of systems on our farm so, last year, we hired five staff to support other agricultural and horticultural growers that want to use them.""

Machines on the Haggerty books include the Montreal-made weed-pulling Nexus, Naio's Oz, Dino and Orio, and the tracked Korechi RoamIO.

There are also a handful of models that might be more familiar to European growers, such as the solar-powered Farmdroid FD20 now distributed in the UK by Opico, the diesel Agrointelli Robotti - one of which went to Home Farm Nacton near Ipswich - and a DJI drone with 40-litre/50kg capacity for spraying and spreading seed.

Research focuses on soil health and yield benefits, input savings and running costs.

""We've found that one robot is unlikely to do everything, and their suitability varies significantly depending on the farm type.

""A good example of this is the Farmdroid - it's brilliant in that it can both plant and hoe, so is involved in more parts of the growing season, but it can struggle to handle the big weeds and heavy trash conditions that we often have in Ontario,"" says Mr Baresich.

""There's also the means of propulsion to consider. Battery power is appealing, but there are huge logistical issues to contend with in Canada - not least that the Naio Dino needs recharging after 4ha.

""By comparison, existing farm machinery is so efficient - it's been developed to be that way for 50 years - so any widescale move to robotics won't happen overnight.""

Either way, Mr Baresich expects exponential growth in horticultural robotics in the next five years, and broadacre agriculture to follow in the next decade or so.

Chuck Baresich has been on a recruitment drive - but not in the conventional sense.

Over the past three years he has amassed a barnful of agricultural robots of all shapes and sizes, and hired a gang of technicians tasked with keeping them running.

Though initially employed purely on his own farm, they are now lent, leased and, in some cases, sold, to other agrarian technophiles within eight hours' drive of his Haggerty Ag Robotics business, based near Bothwell, south-west Ontario.

In most cases, interested parties are suffering from chronic labour shortages due to the diminishing appeal of seasonal, long-hour Canadian farm work combined with the shrinking and ageing of rural populations.

""Monotonous fieldwork is perfectly suited to a robot, which will work long hours without complaint or fatigue,"" says Mr Baresich, who farms 1,400ha and manages a 1.2m bushel grain storage business in partnership with his brother, Justin.

""We're always thinking about how we can operate more efficiently. The North American solution to improving productivity has traditionally been to make machinery bigger, faster and heavier, but we've now reached a plateau.

""Robots are already working in greenhouses and milking parlours, yet there has been little advancement in the arable sector. We've got cameras, autosteer and rate control on the sprayer, so I've often wondered why I need to be in the cab at all.""

According to Mr Baresich, the best way to manage the dwindling labour pool is to allow farmers more time to manage several tasks simultaneously and spend fewer vegetative hours piloting a tractor.

This has already been demonstrated by the likes of Iowan start-up Sabanto, with its fleet of small, autonomous Kubota tractors, and Australian firm Swarm Farm Robotics, which has a dedicated driverless platform.

Both have successfully matched the output of one monster outfit with several modestly sized machines, to the benefit of soil health and yield.

Gold rush

Dozens of autonomous tractors and tool carriers - concepts, prototypes and full production models - have appeared in the past decade.

Most of these come from start-up companies and research institutes, often basing their designs on widely available, and relatively cheap, components from the automotive sector.

Their aim is to develop a platform, or associated software, that will attract multimillion-dollar investments from the biggest names in the world of farm machinery.

Some are well designed and built, says Mr Baresich, while others are completely unsuitable for agriculture, making it a minefield for would-be buyers.

""The market for agricultural robots is like that of automobiles in 1910 Detroit. There might have been 200 manufacturers, but many of them were terrible and people ended up keeping the horse and cart.

""Over the following decade the few decent ones consolidated, and the rest went bankrupt.

""In the case of robots, you can quickly thin out the options by offering them a cheque to purchase one. These companies don't have the resources to build multiple prototypes, so I sometimes discover that there isn't actually anything to buy.""

Could apprenticeships solve UK farming's labour challenges?

Provided by

Lantra is a skills charity, committed to supporting workforce development in the environmental and land-based sector by providing comprehensive careers information, robust industry intelligence, and nationally recognised training and qualifications.

Lantra, the largest provider of end-point assessments for apprenticeships in the agriculture sectorv has carried out a new survey of employers. Reporter Debbie James examines the results.

The skills shortage on UK farms is real with many farms across all sectors struggling to recruit and retain staff.

A new survey of 555 farmers and growers reveals that 50% anticipate a requirement to hire new employees in the foreseeable future.

The survey, carried out by Farmers Weekly on behalf of Lantra involved owner occupiers, tenants, farm managers and others.

It shows that 24% need to hire staff now or in the next six months and a further 26% expect to be recruiting in six to 12 months.

Fifty three per cent are confident that those jobs would be suitable for an apprentice.

For more than half of respondents, apprenticeships are considered a key route to filling vacancies.

Fifty three percent stated that they would use an apprentice in the future to bring in a new member of staff while 18% would use this option to train and upskill an existing member of staff.

Benefits to employers

They saw multiple benefits from apprenticeships, from providing skilled workers in the business and increasing staff loyalty and retention to bringing new thinking and ideas to their enterprise.

For the apprentice, this route into employment is an opportunity to learn while they earn.

!function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"");

Lantra Chief Executive Marcus Potter said the survey results were very encouraging.

""The incredible response to Lantra's survey shows a strong appetite from farm employers for apprenticeships,'' says Mr Potter.

Lantra works with over 700 employers to enable apprentices to achieve the final stage of their apprenticeship.

Benefits to apprentice

An apprenticeship is a genuine job with an accompanying assessment and skills development programme.

It is a partnership between an employer, training provider and the apprentice, open to people who are 16 and over and want to combine on-the-job training with studying.

Individuals can gain valuable skills and knowledge in a specific job role, in a real work environment.

The apprentice gets the benefits of being employed in a job, but typically does one day a week or a block release at college to top up their learning.

The farms involved in the survey ranged in scale from under 20 hectares (ha) to more than 500ha, and covered all farming enterprises.

Valued qualities

The research provides an insight into the qualities farm employers value in recruits.

Reliability is seen as the key attribute with good timekeeping and initiative highly valued too.

Twenty one per cent listed ""˜operator tickets' such as tractor driving as important and 22% previous farming experience.

Only 12% thought that it was important that staff came from a farming background, reflecting the broadening appeal of working in agriculture to people from all walks of life.

!function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"");

Barriers

Mr Potter said the insights gained through the research with Farmers Weekly provides ""clear evidence of need'' for apprenticeships and identifies the barriers that employers find problematic.

Among those flagged up in the survey are concerns about any extra supervision that an apprentice may require, the availability of local training facilities and financial constraints; for some, there is a perception that very few apprenticeships are available.

The results also show that employers need help with navigating the minefield of information on apprenticeships.

They demonstrate a requirement for clear and useful information on how the funding works, what is involved, how apprenticeships work and where to find an apprentice.

The burden of bureaucracy is also likely to be deterring farm employers from engaging with apprenticeships therefore some form of ""handholding'' through the process may help employers better understand their obligations and responsibilities when supporting an apprentice.

How Lantra can help

Mr Potter said Lantra would use the survey findings to expand its services and develop pilot programmes that help farm businesses find the right people, and train and support them in the right way.

This, he said, would allow apprenticeships and alternative development programmes ""to deliver the new talent that farming needs''. 

""This is an ambitious step for Lantra, we are grateful to everyone who participated in the survey,'' said Mr Potter.

""Going forward we will be testing our ideas with the employers who have volunteered to be part of focus groups, to ensure we are on the right track.''

As a non-for-profit organisation, Lantra is committed to growing skills in the land-based and environment sector, providing careers information, training and qualifications. 

With a 30-year track record in agricultural skills and training, the organisation is keen to support farm businesses through the transition.

Earlier this year Lantra launched a new careers information resource, showcasing the exciting range of opportunities in the farming and allied industries.

This resource signposts to relevant apprenticeships and training, with a view to bringing new entrants on board.

Next steps

As a next step after the survey, Lantra will engage with the 118 respondents who expressed an interest in taking part in focus groups to explore some of the barriers and potential solutions in more depth.

These will take place in early October, followed by a Lantra webinar for a higher number of people to attend later that month. These individuals will be contacted directly by Lantra.

At the Oxford Farming Conference in January 2023, Lantra will release a report, revealing its plans for 2024 onwards to attract new entrants through apprenticeships and alternative programmes.

319,"Wheat blends prove simple way to boost average yields","https://www.fwi.co.uk/arable/variety-selection/wheat-blends-prove-simple-way-to-boost-average-yields","Wheat blends prove simple way to boost average yields

Growing a mix of different wheat varieties, known as a ""blend"", rather than planting a single variety has proven to increase average wheat yields by nearly 0.5t/ha, reveals independent farm trial data.

For the past three years, UK farming company Velcourt trialled a four-way wheat blend which yielded on average 0.47t/ha more than the individual cultivars.

The company's head of crop production technology, Nick Anderson, explains: ""At a farm level, this means if you grow a blend of four varieties, you will grow more wheat than if you grew those varieties separately, and this is something farmers can easily do to increase average yields.”

See also: Wildflower seed diversification gives arable tenants security

While some may view the use of blends as part of a strategy to reduce inputs, our work suggests that using blends simply allows you to increase yields with the same level of crop protection inputs."" 

After promising results carried out as part of the company's independent crop research programme across various UK sites, Velcourt rolled out its findings across 40 of its arable farms last season.

We catch up with one of its farm managers to find out how he got on.

Green Drove Farm, Wiltshire

Green Drove Farm manager Jonny Kerr was one of the farmers who put a 20ha blend of Gleam, Graham, Extase and Siskin to the test last autumn.

Despite a record-breaking wet spring and high disease pressure, the wheat blend produced some of the farm's highest-performing wheat yields at JM Strong & Partners.

With an average harvest of about 9.8t/ha for conventionally grown wheat, Jonny was particularly impressed that the blend averaged 10.4t/ha - an impressive 0.6t/ha yield boost.

""Crops were hit by high levels of septoria in what was the wettest March in 40 years, with 129mm of rainfall recorded at the farm, but the wheat blend still achieved more than 10t/ha,"" says Jonny.

The blend was treated exactly the same as the conventional wheat, with a three-spray fungicide programme of T1, T2 and T3 deployed.

""Crops looked clean at the T0 timing, so I didn’t think we needed to spray, but three weeks and a lot of rain later, we were hit with high disease pressure at T1 - hindsight is a wonderful thing,"" he says. 

""Without a doubt, the blended wheat had less septoria than some of the other crops, emphasising the value of an integrated approach to disease management,"" says Jonny.

!function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js"");

Integrated disease management

For Jonny, blending varieties is now an important part of his disease-management strategy, which is why he is increasing the area of the blend to 50ha this autumn.

The precise mechanism by which blends deliver higher yields in unclear, but he believes a wider genetic package from different cultivars acts in a similar way to herd immunity.

""If one variety has particularly good resistance against yellow rust, fewer plants are available for the disease to take hold. This prevents the disease from spreading, which maintains green leaf area and results in higher yields.""

He also believes blends can help increase the longevity of genetic resistance. This means growers can hold on to varieties for longer as there is less chance of disease breakdown.

Jonny manages 1,100ha of cropping for JM Strong & Partners near the village of Pewsey.

Cropping consists of winter wheat, spring and winter barley, maize and pulses. 

Recently, he has grown the winter wheat varieties Graham and Extase, alongside one or two relative newcomers on the AHDB Recommended List.

In autumn 2022, the new additions were Dawsum and Cranium, although for 2023 the Cranium has been dropped in favour of a larger area of blended wheat. 

Next steps

Wheat bends were supplied to Velcourt by Walnes Seeds from Suffolk.

This autumn Jonny will be sowing a pre-mixed blend of Champion, Extase, Siskin and Redwald, which will also be rolled out across Velcourt's farm base.

This blend was chosen on the basis of maximum genetic diversity and the highest untreated yield of the varieties available from the merchant. 

Nick adds: ""The AHDB blending tool is a useful resource when looking at selecting a blend of varieties.” 

Army career proves its worth within agriculture

Before his farming career, Velcourt farm manager Jonny Kerr spent nine years in the British Army, serving in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan.

During his time in the military serving in the Black Watch, Jonny built up a wealth of unique leadership and management skills, which he is now applying to the agricultural world.

A military career taught Jonny the value of planning, logistics, skillful communication and people management.

It enabled him to deal with unprecedented scenarios and to successfully complete tasks with the provisions at hand.

Jonny Kerr © Alex Bramall

Transferable skills

""The skills I learned in the army are entirely transferable to agriculture. Both involve co-ordinating people and resources for specific outcomes, which require having everything in the right place at the right time.

""As a farmer, you are constantly assessing, deciding and acting on what to do. In the army, we followed the phrase: observe, orientate, decide and act, and that's relatable to agriculture as you're faced with constant changes that keep evolving.""

After leaving the army as a senior captain back in 2013, Jonny completed a graduate diploma in agriculture at the Royal Agricultural University, Cirencester.

""I had just left the army and decided to complete a graduate diploma in agriculture. I was out of uniform and back in jeans and a T-shirt as a mature student,"" he says.

Growing up in the countryside, a career in agriculture had always interested Jonny, but he thought farming was a ""born and bred"" industry - unless he won the lottery to buy his own farm, it wasn't a career for him.

However, he was pointed in the direction of Velcourt by a friend and the more he looked into it, the more it became aviable option.

""I went on to complete the Velcourt management training scheme, which included Facts and Basis qualifications, and I haven't looked back since.""

Growing a mix of different wheat varieties, known as a ""blend"", rather than planting a single variety has proven to increase average wheat yields by nearly 0.5t/ha, reveals independent farm trial data.

For the past three years, UK farming company Velcourt trialled a four-way wheat blend which yielded on average 0.47t/ha more than the individual cultivars.

The company's head of crop production technology, Nick Anderson, explains: ""At a farm level, this means if you grow a blend of four varieties, you will grow more wheat than if you grew those varieties separately, and this is something farmers can easily do to increase average yields.”

While some may view the use of blends as part of a strategy to reduce inputs, our work suggests that using blends simply allows you to increase yields with the same level of crop protection inputs."" 

After promising results carried out as part of the company's independent crop research programme across various UK sites, Velcourt rolled out its findings across 40 of its arable farms last season.

We catch up with one of its farm managers to find out how he got on.

Green Drove Farm, Wiltshire

Green Drove Farm manager Jonny Kerr was one of the farmers who put a 20ha blend of Gleam, Graham, Extase and Siskin to the test last autumn.

Despite a record-breaking wet spring and high disease pressure, the wheat blend produced some of the farm's highest-performing wheat yields at JM Strong & Partners.

With an average harvest of about 9.8t/ha for conventionally grown wheat, Jonny was particularly impressed that the blend averaged 10.4t/ha - an impressive 0.6t/ha yield boost.

""Crops were hit by high levels of septoria in what was the wettest March in 40 years, with 129mm of rainfall recorded at the farm, but the wheat blend still achieved more than 10t/ha,"" says Jonny.

The blend was treated exactly the same as the conventional wheat, with a three-spray fungicide programme of T1, T2 and T3 deployed.

""Crops looked clean at the T0 timing, so I didn’t think we needed to spray, but three weeks and a lot of rain later, we were hit with high disease pressure at T1 - hindsight is a wonderful thing,"" he says. 

""Without a doubt, the blended wheat had less septoria than some of the other crops, emphasising the value of an integrated approach to disease management,"" says Jonny.

Integrated disease management

For Jonny, blending varieties is now an important part of his disease-management strategy, which is why he is increasing the area of the blend to 50ha this autumn.

The precise mechanism by which blends deliver higher yields in unclear, but he believes a wider genetic package from different cultivars acts in a similar way to herd immunity.

""If one variety has particularly good resistance against yellow rust, fewer plants are available for the disease to take hold. This prevents the disease from spreading, which maintains green leaf area and results in higher yields.""

He also believes blends can help increase the longevity of genetic resistance. This means growers can hold on to varieties for longer as there is less chance of disease breakdown.

Jonny manages 1,100ha of cropping for JM Strong & Partners near the village of Pewsey.

Cropping consists of winter wheat, spring and winter barley, maize and pulses. 

Recently, he has grown the winter wheat varieties Graham and Extase, alongside one or two relative newcomers on the AHDB Recommended List.

In autumn 2022, the new additions were Dawsum and Cranium, although for 2023 the Cranium has been dropped in favour of a larger area of blended wheat. 

Next steps

Wheat bends were supplied to Velcourt by Walnes Seeds from Suffolk.

This autumn Jonny will be sowing a pre-mixed blend of Champion, Extase, Siskin and Redwald, which will also be rolled out across Velcourt's farm base.

This blend was chosen on the basis of maximum genetic diversity and the highest untreated yield of the varieties available from the merchant. 

Nick adds: ""The AHDB blending tool is a useful resource when looking at selecting a blend of varieties.” 

Army career proves its worth within agriculture

Before his farming career, Velcourt farm manager Jonny Kerr spent nine years in the British Army, serving in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan.

During his time in the military serving in the Black Watch, Jonny built up a wealth of unique leadership and management skills, which he is now applying to the agricultural world.

A military career taught Jonny the value of planning, logistics, skillful communication and people management.

It enabled him to deal with unprecedented scenarios and to successfully complete tasks with the provisions at hand.

Transferable skills

""The skills I learned in the army are entirely transferable to agriculture. Both involve co-ordinating people and resources for specific outcomes, which require having everything in the right place at the right time.

""As a farmer, you are constantly assessing, deciding and acting on what to do. In the army, we followed the phrase: observe, orientate, decide and act, and that's relatable to agriculture as you're faced with constant changes that keep evolving.""

After leaving the army as a senior captain back in 2013, Jonny completed a graduate diploma in agriculture at the Royal Agricultural University, Cirencester.

""I had just left the army and decided to complete a graduate diploma in agriculture. I was out of uniform and back in jeans and a T-shirt as a mature student,"" he says.

Growing up in the countryside, a career in agriculture had always interested Jonny, but he thought farming was a ""born and bred"" industry - unless he won the lottery to buy his own farm, it wasn't a career for him.

However, he was pointed in the direction of Velcourt by a friend and the more he looked into it, the more it became aviable option.

""I went on to complete the Velcourt management training scheme, which included Facts and Basis qualifications, and I haven't looked back since.""

Independent agronomist Ben Burrows of Crop Management Partners has been working closely with Hampshire farm manager David Miller to implement a number of IPM strategies and cut input costs at the AHDB Strategic Farm South.

David is farm manager of Wheatsheaf Farming, south-west of Basingstoke, where he farms 700ha of light loam soils over chalk land on both sides of the M3 motorway.

With the launch of Defra's Sustainable Farming Incentive is offering farmers a £45/ha payment for crops managed without the use of insecticides (IPM4), which is appealing to some growers.

Ben talks us through the farm's strategies, which has helped tackle barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) and wheat disease, and reduced the risk associated with growing oilseed rape.

See also: What the six additions bring to the new-look OSR Recommended List

What is integrated pest management?

Integrated pest management (IPM) is a co-ordinated strategy that controls pests, weeds and disease using cultural and nature-based solutions rather than chemical products.

The strategy could help growers overcome shrinking margins at a time when they are facing a continuous loss of plant protection products, and resistance fears build for remaining actives.

Together with the political drive for more sustainable farming practices, growers are seeking cost-effective alternatives, including IPM approaches, to provide solutions.

1. Low-risk oilseed rape

Despite the challenges associated with growing oilseed rape, David is keen to continue producing the crop for its value in the rotation.

Well aware of the increasing growing costs and risk of pest attacks, he aims to reduce input costs and thereby minimise risk.

In fact, David has more than halved oilseed rape production costs in the past 10 years, even with the chemical price rises of last year.

The figures below are David's OSR variable costs, excluding nitrogen. Not only have they fallen, but also show the big variations year to year that are out of his control. Fixed costs are also much reduced with direct drilling and fewer sprayer passes, he says.

How did he achieve this?

First, David began using home-saved conventional seed where possible to provide an initial cheaper seed source right from the get-go.

This also selected plants with a genetic predisposition to be better suited to his farm environment.

David does not apply starter or seed-bed fertilisers to keep input costs down.

However, he drills the crop with a companion of buckwheat and two types of clover, berseem and crimson, to provide shelter and nutrients to the rapeseed.

This also acts as a potential disguise from cabbage stem flea beetle and, aside from the many soil benefits companion crops deliver, if the oilseed rape fails, the pass of the drill has not been wasted and the soil is covered, explains Ben.

Zero insecticides are applied to the crop - a testament to a decade's worth of cover cropping that has seen beneficial insects thrive and soil health improve dramatically.

Usually, David does not apply an autumn fungicide either, as he opts for varieties with good phoma and light leaf spot resistance.

However, this season he is likely to apply a fungicide as phoma levels have been particularly high.

Monitoring crops closely on a season-by-season and field-by-field basis is, therefore, key.

The herbicide programme has remained largely unchanged from his traditional rapeseed and, consequently, makes up a significant proportion of production costs. Yields now average 3.5t/ha, but with minimal spend. 

Six key principles of IPM

2. Barley yellow dwarf virus control

BYDV in winter cereals was once a problem at David's farming operation and insecticide sprays were used when threshold levels were met.

However, over the years the increase in cover cropping together with the reduction in cultivations have resulted in helping beneficial insect populations to thrive, which has reduced the threat of BYDV.

David typically drills winter cereals during the third week of September through to the first week of October to provide plenty of time to get crops up and away following his zero-till establishment method.

BYDV-tolerant varieties are not used at present due to limited choice, but Ben is particularly keen for growers to look into this as a means of cutting their reliance on insecticides.

Aphids can usually be found during autumn crop inspections. Populations are monitored closely and the AHDB aphid treatment tool is used to see if threshold levels have been reached.

Most of the farm is at an elevation of 120-200m, which David and Ben believe could help reduce aphid populations.

""Although I know the goal is for little or ideally no insecticide use, I would always try to give David an honest appraisal if I felt certain fields were likely ""˜higher risk' due to early drilling date, lower elevation, or if a lot of aphids are easily found,"" says Ben.

3. Zero-fungicide winter wheat

A three-way feed variety wheat blend of Graham, Dawsum and Champion was grown last year, with the aim of using genetic diversity to reduce disease pressure, particularly from septoria.

Nitrogen rates for the wheat blend were cut back to 120kg/ha from the farm standard of 180kg/ha.

A foliar spray containing nitrogen and sulphur topped this up to a total nitrogen content of 137kg/ha.

Despite the reduced inputs of the wheat blend trial, yields were the same when compared with a single-variety crop grown on the same soil and previous cropping.

Ben notes that the farm trial provides the basis for further experimentation and discussion.

""What's more, carrying out different trial work across the farm is something different/fun to get involved with,"" he says.

Relationship between growers and advisers critical for optimum IPM implementation

There is desire for farmers and growers to reduce their reliance on artificial inputs and instead use biological products.

However, the relationship between agronomist and growers is critical for this success, says Ben Burrows, independent agronomist at Crop Management Partners.

There is little or no reliable scientific evidence available for how these practices work, so growers have to be prepared to do their own research, learn from their own successes and failures and share knowledge with other farmer and advisers, he adds.

How are agronomic decisions made? Is the risk shared between both agronomist and farmer?

""When trialling new ideas on farm, try to work out where your attitude to risk lies. Be prepared to try something different, but in a way that does not take large, unnecessary risks,"" he advises.

""You may not always completely agree with ideas from agronomists and advisers, but it's important to have the discussion.

""Try to explain the risks of doing/not doing something that is an established convention.""

For example, ask yourself ""˜What happens if we don't apply the T3 ear wash fungicide?' and use this as a way of assessing risks and thinking of new ways to overcome problems.

This also acts as a potential disguise from cabbage stem flea beetle and, aside from the many soil benefits companion crops deliver, if the oilseed rape fails, the pass of the drill has not been wasted and the soil is covered, explains Ben.

Zero insecticides are applied to the crop - a testament to a decade's worth of cover cropping that has seen beneficial insects thrive and soil health improve dramatically.

Usually, David does not apply an autumn fungicide either, as he opts for varieties with good phoma and light leaf spot resistance.

However, this season he is likely to apply a fungicide as phoma levels have been particularly high.

Monitoring crops closely on a season-by-season and field-by-field basis is, therefore, key.

The herbicide programme has remained largely unchanged from his traditional rapeseed and, consequently, makes up a significant proportion of production costs. Yields now average 3.5t/ha, but with minimal spend. 

Six key principles of IPM

2. Barley yellow dwarf virus control

BYDV in winter cereals was once a problem at David's farming operation and insecticide sprays were used when threshold levels were met.

However, over the years the increase in cover cropping together with the reduction in cultivations have resulted in helping beneficial insect populations to thrive, which has reduced the threat of BYDV.

David typically drills winter cereals during the third week of September through to the first week of October to provide plenty of time to get crops up and away following his zero-till establishment method.

BYDV-tolerant varieties are not used at present due to limited choice, but Ben is particularly keen for growers to look into this as a means of cutting their reliance on insecticides.

Aphids can usually be found during autumn crop inspections. Populations are monitored closely and the AHDB aphid treatment tool is used to see if threshold levels have been reached.

Most of the farm is at an elevation of 120-200m, which David and Ben believe could help reduce aphid populations.

""Although I know the goal is for little or ideally no insecticide use, I would always try to give David an honest appraisal if I felt certain fields were likely ""˜higher risk' due to early drilling date, lower elevation, or if a lot of aphids are easily found,"" says Ben.

3. Zero-fungicide winter wheat

A three-way feed variety wheat blend of Graham, Dawsum and Champion was grown last year, with the aim of using genetic diversity to reduce disease pressure, particularly from septoria.

Nitrogen rates for the wheat blend were cut back to 120kg/ha from the farm standard of 180kg/ha.

A foliar spray containing nitrogen and sulphur topped this up to a total nitrogen content of 137kg/ha.

Despite the reduced inputs of the wheat blend trial, yields were the same when compared with a single-variety crop grown on the same soil and previous cropping.

Ben notes that the farm trial provides the basis for further experimentation and discussion.

""What's more, carrying out different trial work across the farm is something different/fun to get involved with,"" he says.

Relationship between growers and advisers critical for optimum IPM implementation

There is desire for farmers and growers to reduce their reliance on artificial inputs and instead use biological products.

However, the relationship between agronomist and growers is critical for this success, says Ben Burrows, independent agronomist at Crop Management Partners.

There is little or no reliable scientific evidence available for how these practices work, so growers have to be prepared to do their own research, learn from their own successes and failures and share knowledge with other farmer and advisers, he adds.

How are agronomic decisions made? Is the risk shared between both agronomist and farmer?

""When trialling new ideas on farm, try to work out where your attitude to risk lies. Be prepared to try something different, but in a way that does not take large, unnecessary risks,"" he advises.

""You may not always completely agree with ideas from agronomists and advisers, but it's important to have the discussion.

""Try to explain the risks of doing/not doing something that is an established convention.""

For example, ask yourself ""˜What happens if we don't apply the T3 ear wash fungicide?' and use this as a way of assessing risks and thinking of new ways to overcome problems.

More German growers are companion-cropping maize with beans to address astronomical ammonium nitrate and protein costs, saying the dry matter and protein performance of the resulting silage outweighs the energy hit. 

Maize-bean acreage in Germany increased from virtually nothing in 2018 to cover 30,000ha (74,000 acres) last year.

Heike Molenaar, research and development leader at bean and pea seed house Van Waveren, predicts maize and beans will cover 4.25% (about 500,000ha or 1.23m acres) of Germany's arable land by 2028.

She pointed to German research in 2020 and 2022 showing that maize-bean silage beat maize alone on protein and calcium, and ensiled well.

However, it was slightly lower in energy at 7MJ/kg net energy lactation level (methane conversion factor), compared with 7.2MJ/kg for maize alone (see table).

Market necessity

Dr Molenaar told Farmers Weekly that high soy and ammonium nitrate values had forced a change at farm level, with dairies seeing the merits of a legume.

""It's not just the dairies,"" she said. ""The farms growing for biogas plants are using beans too because they are so convinced with the benefits of the system.""

She said the technique was a step towards the old method of growing the ""three sisters"" - maize, beans and pumpkins - together in the same field.

German fertiliser market

Latest market intelligence from the third quarter of 2022 showed the following trends:

Low-input success

Peer-reviewed trials found that maize-bean yields were equal to and occasionally beat maize yields in a high-input (165kg N/ha) setting, and consistently outperformed maize-only in low-input (85kgN/ha) conditions (see graph).

Dr Molenaar said estimates of the nitrogen fixation rate of the bean as a legume were 20-40kg N/ha, with different varieties potentially fixing different amounts. However, more research was needed.

Why German farmers like maize and beans

Dr Molenaar told Farmers Weekly why external factors were encouraging the practice to take hold.

She summarised the other agronomic and nutrition benefits of growing maize and beans:

What works in Germany

Maize-bean cropping in the UK

Growing beans with maize brings the same benefits as it does in Germany, but the UK has some specific challenges, according to MGA agronomist Jon Myhill.

He said the companion-cropping aspect ticked a box for the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI), but there were three big obstacles for UK growers:

Mr Myhill said UK farmers were also trying to lower nitrogen inputs, with some cow/poultry manure systems cutting out synthetic nitrogen completely on maize-only crops. He added:

Will Green is using a drone on his Northamptonshire farm to cut his nitrogen fertiliser use by nearly a third on his winter wheat destined to make breakfast cereal at the nearby Weetabix factory.

Multiple photographic images taken across his wheat fields are cross-referenced with soil nitrogen test results, allowing him to trim ammonium nitrate rates by nearly 70kg/ha without any effect on yield, and with a benefit to profits and the environment.

The drone service is provided free by his agronomist, Andrew Lowe of advisory group Agrii, who sees improving crop nutrition as the first big gain from using drones, with better weed and disease control and a yield prediction application to come later.

See also: A wheat grower's 4 tests to get nitrogen application rates spot on

Time saving 

The ability of the drone to scan crops quickly means it can give accurate plant counts to feed into nitrogen fertiliser programmes, rather than Will or Andrew having to spend many hours assessing crops manually, and they have just finished their third season using the technology.  

""We are always looking at ways of improving efficiency, and the saving in fertiliser is welcome, while we can also look out for poor patches of crops which may be due to bad drainage or pest damage,"" says Will.

The first step in giving the wheat crop just the right amount of nutrition is to undertake a soil mineral nitrogen test (SMN) to determine the nitrogen in the soil in the early spring. The drone is then used to measure the green area index (GAI) which will give a value of how thick or thin the wheat crop is.

Andrew says: ""With the SMN and GAI numbers together and with a realistic yield assessment, we can then work out exactly the right amount of nitrogen the crop needs and not provide nitrogen for the next crop.

""Will's contract with Weetabix does not specify a protein content, so we can fine-tune nitrogen applications precisely to the yield target without worrying too much about building protein. Ultimately, it's about ensuring the right amount of nitrogen is applied to the crop in question, and if there is a saving that's an added bonus.""

Environmental benefits

Andrew says using nitrogen wisely is increasingly important from environmental and carbon footprint perspectives, and this technology offers a viable way to avoid wastage, reduce nitrates entering watercourses, and cut potential ammonia losses to the atmosphere.

Flying the drone at 30m above the ground, Andrew can pick points where he needs to drop down to look at the crop in more detail. Photos can then be taken at these points some 1.5m above the crop.

The drone's software gives a very accurate assessment of GAI across the field from multiple points, and is superior to satellite images as the drone can distinguish between crops and weeds, adds Andrew.

On Will's farm, for winter wheat following spring oats there was seen to be more nitrogen in the soil than expected, suggesting the oat crop is less deserving of its reputation for scavenging for nutrition. For wheat following beans, it was found the beans were not leaving as much nitrogen in the soil as initially envisaged.

Will is growing 25-30ha of winter wheat on his 87ha family-owned arable operation at White House Farm, Bozeat, just east of Northampton, on heavy clay land, along with winter beans and winter rye.

Nitrogen needs

For harvest 2022, he grew the winter wheat variety Costello after oats, and he normally refers to the industry fertiliser bible, the AHDB's RB209, to see what nitrogen fertiliser he would need to achieve his average yield of 8-8.5t/ha.

""We would normally stick pretty much to RB209 recommendations for fertiliser applications, which last year said we would need to apply 220kg/ha of nitrogen to achieve our target yield,"" he says.

However, using the drone's estimate of GAI and linking this back to the SMN tests, Agrii's drone-based system showed one field needed only 151kg/ha of nitrogen, and so this was applied over three splits in March, April and May 2022. On two other fields, the recommendations came out at 152kg/ha and 162kg/ha of nitrogen.

The savings therefore ranged from 58kg/ha to 69kg/ha of nitrogen, which Will considers pretty sizeable, given the cost of nitrogen fertiliser at that time. It also meant a saving of 200-250kg of carbon dioxide equivalent per hectare.

""The highest yield came in at 9.4t/ha, pretty much the best we ever get here, with an average of 8.25t/ha, which, considering the massive savings we saw in fertiliser costs, was a great result,"" he adds.

Long-term advantages

In the season for harvest 2021 - the first year he used the drone - the nitrogen fertiliser savings were up to 50kg/ha, so Will is convinced of the long-term advantages of the drone-based system.

For harvest 2023, he switched to wheat variety Dawsum, which has Costello in its parentage, and his wheat followed winter beans in the rotation. The technique again resulted in savings, but not quite as high as previously.

The RB209 calculation advised that 180kg/ha of nitrogen was needed for the wheat crop after beans, but the drone-based system assessed the crop's nitrogen needs at just 147-160kg/ha, so there has been a further year of fertiliser savings.

The system is also useful for assessing plant counts across the whole farm, and is also more accurate than manual counts. This gives Will a good overview of his crops which could highlight areas of bad drainage and damaged soil structure.

""We can map the whole farm in about two hours, rather than spending a couple of days crop walking and making a number of plant counts across square metres,"" he says.

Aerial assessment

As the farm aims for a wheat plant count of 250-270/sq m, when an aerial assessment is made in the early spring, if the crop is thin then a plant growth regulator such as chlormequat can be used to improve tillering, or if the crop is too thick then nitrogen dose rates can be scaled back.

A further big advantage is that the system can tell how uniform the crop is, which can be a precursor to whether the grower should be using a variable-rate fertiliser application system.

""If you're seeing 96% uniformity in your crops, there is little point in carrying out variable rate applications, whereas if it is 50% or 60%, there may be a case for this,"" says Andrew.

The next step after crop nutrition and conducting plant counts could be weed and disease control.

Crops are analysed perhaps three or four times a year ahead of each potential split of nitrogen, and at the same time weed and disease hotspots can be monitored in the field that might not have easily been seen.

""Weed mapping is something we would like to get into eventually and the drone is also really useful in checking out dense crops such as oilseed rape and beans as they develop,"" says Will.

Blackgrass assessments

One big advantage could be assessing blackgrass levels in the early summer and then planning a grassweed strategy for the next season based on where the severity of the blackgrass is the most critical.

""It's much more accurate than satellite imagery which can only distinguish between brown and green,"" says Andrew. ""So if you have blackgrass in there or other weeds, the drone will allow us to filter all this out to give as accurate a GAI as possible.""

In the past 12 months, he says, Agrii has been concentrating on developing systems that can work in other crops such as oilseed rape and beans as well as winter wheat.

""It's really useful in oilseed rape for the timing of the flowering spray for sclerotinia, for example, and also for the timing of the glyphosate pre-harvest timing,"" he says.

""Trying to walk through a field of OSR when it is fully podded up is almost impossible. You get about 5m in and that's about as far as you can go.""

The drone can tell the grower what stage of flowering the crop is at, assessing the whole field for a fungicide spray, and also how far podded the crop is, to help with the timing of glyphosate desiccation.

In addition, Agrii and drone supplier Drone AG are working on a prediction scheme for chocolate spot to assess disease levels in bean crops when it is often difficult to walk through a fully grown crop.

""We're also using the drones to develop a wheat yield prediction system that, once a crop has headed up, will estimate what the yield of that field is going to be,"" says Andrew.

Drone gains for the future 

Increased productivity, cost reductions and helping the environment are some of the advantages that drones could bring to arable farming, says Agrii's lead pilot and technology trial manager Jonathan Trotter.

""The potential is huge. We are already starting to use drones with our customers to identify early indications of potential localised problems such as nutrient deficiency or pest infestations before they become a major problem,"" he says.

Jonathan sees many possibilities, from swarms of drones applying specific agrochemicals, to larger individual machines capable of carrying larger payloads, all of which could be controlled remotely and work with real-time data.

The issue moving forward is not the potential of the technology, he says, but ensuring it aligns with the legislation surrounding it and, to a degree, helping shape this.

This is why Agrii and Drone AG are working closely with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and other key bodies to establish safe working practices and operational strategies for the future.

""We want to explore what is going to be possible and make sure it complies with all guidelines and legislation so growers and the wider industry can get the most benefit from aerial technologies,"" says Jonathan.

Flying rules

Currently, the CAA allows drones up to 25kg to be flown with relevant qualifications. For bigger machines, there is a need to apply for an Operating Safety Case.

""So it could be that in a few years' time we are looking at operating drones weighing closer to 80kg or 100kg. Whether we have one drone or a swarm of drones flying to apply fertiliser or pesticides - all in line with regulations, obviously - is something we are very keen to explore,"" Jonathan says.

One possibility for the future, once legislation and authorisation with the CAA is agreed, is being able to pilot drones remotely from one of Agrii's research and development technology centres. Although this will initially be used in R&D, the principles behind it could be used for collecting farm data at some later stage.

He explains: ""The idea is we will be able to deploy ""˜drone-in-the-box' systems whereby we can place fully automated containers wherever we want, with a drone inside all pre-programmed and ready to go.

“We can then set it off autonomously, fly it over a field or trials site, collect high-resolution data, and it will then return to its box to be charged up again.""

At the moment, Agrii has several agronomists and crop input specialists trained to use drones, with more undergoing training for this potentially very valuable use of technology on farm.

Will Green is using a drone on his Northamptonshire farm to cut his nitrogen fertiliser use by nearly a third on his winter wheat destined to make breakfast cereal at the nearby Weetabix factory.

Multiple photographic images taken across his wheat fields are cross-referenced with soil nitrogen test results, allowing him to trim ammonium nitrate rates by nearly 70kg/ha without any effect on yield, and with a benefit to profits and the environment.

The drone service is provided free by his agronomist, Andrew Lowe of advisory group Agrii, who sees improving crop nutrition as the first big gain from using drones, with better weed and disease control and a yield prediction application to come later.

Time saving 

The ability of the drone to scan crops quickly means it can give accurate plant counts to feed into nitrogen fertiliser programmes, rather than Will or Andrew having to spend many hours assessing crops manually, and they have just finished their third season using the technology.  

""We are always looking at ways of improving efficiency, and the saving in fertiliser is welcome, while we can also look out for poor patches of crops which may be due to bad drainage or pest damage,"" says Will.

The first step in giving the wheat crop just the right amount of nutrition is to undertake a soil mineral nitrogen test (SMN) to determine the nitrogen in the soil in the early spring. The drone is then used to measure the green area index (GAI) which will give a value of how thick or thin the wheat crop is.

Andrew says: ""With the SMN and GAI numbers together and with a realistic yield assessment, we can then work out exactly the right amount of nitrogen the crop needs and not provide nitrogen for the next crop.

""Will's contract with Weetabix does not specify a protein content, so we can fine-tune nitrogen applications precisely to the yield target without worrying too much about building protein. Ultimately, it's about ensuring the right amount of nitrogen is applied to the crop in question, and if there is a saving that's an added bonus.""

Environmental benefits

Andrew says using nitrogen wisely is increasingly important from environmental and carbon footprint perspectives, and this technology offers a viable way to avoid wastage, reduce nitrates entering watercourses, and cut potential ammonia losses to the atmosphere.

Flying the drone at 30m above the ground, Andrew can pick points where he needs to drop down to look at the crop in more detail. Photos can then be taken at these points some 1.5m above the crop.

The drone's software gives a very accurate assessment of GAI across the field from multiple points, and is superior to satellite images as the drone can distinguish between crops and weeds, adds Andrew.

On Will's farm, for winter wheat following spring oats there was seen to be more nitrogen in the soil than expected, suggesting the oat crop is less deserving of its reputation for scavenging for nutrition. For wheat following beans, it was found the beans were not leaving as much nitrogen in the soil as initially envisaged.

Will is growing 25-30ha of winter wheat on his 87ha family-owned arable operation at White House Farm, Bozeat, just east of Northampton, on heavy clay land, along with winter beans and winter rye.

Nitrogen needs

For harvest 2022, he grew the winter wheat variety Costello after oats, and he normally refers to the industry fertiliser bible, the AHDB's RB209, to see what nitrogen fertiliser he would need to achieve his average yield of 8-8.5t/ha.

""We would normally stick pretty much to RB209 recommendations for fertiliser applications, which last year said we would need to apply 220kg/ha of nitrogen to achieve our target yield,"" he says.

However, using the drone's estimate of GAI and linking this back to the SMN tests, Agrii's drone-based system showed one field needed only 151kg/ha of nitrogen, and so this was applied over three splits in March, April and May 2022. On two other fields, the recommendations came out at 152kg/ha and 162kg/ha of nitrogen.

The savings therefore ranged from 58kg/ha to 69kg/ha of nitrogen, which Will considers pretty sizeable, given the cost of nitrogen fertiliser at that time. It also meant a saving of 200-250kg of carbon dioxide equivalent per hectare.

""The highest yield came in at 9.4t/ha, pretty much the best we ever get here, with an average of 8.25t/ha, which, considering the massive savings we saw in fertiliser costs, was a great result,"" he adds.

Long-term advantages

In the season for harvest 2021 - the first year he used the drone - the nitrogen fertiliser savings were up to 50kg/ha, so Will is convinced of the long-term advantages of the drone-based system.

For harvest 2023, he switched to wheat variety Dawsum, which has Costello in its parentage, and his wheat followed winter beans in the rotation. The technique again resulted in savings, but not quite as high as previously.

The RB209 calculation advised that 180kg/ha of nitrogen was needed for the wheat crop after beans, but the drone-based system assessed the crop's nitrogen needs at just 147-160kg/ha, so there has been a further year of fertiliser savings.

The system is also useful for assessing plant counts across the whole farm, and is also more accurate than manual counts. This gives Will a good overview of his crops which could highlight areas of bad drainage and damaged soil structure.

""We can map the whole farm in about two hours, rather than spending a couple of days crop walking and making a number of plant counts across square metres,"" he says.

Aerial assessment

As the farm aims for a wheat plant count of 250-270/sq m, when an aerial assessment is made in the early spring, if the crop is thin then a plant growth regulator such as chlormequat can be used to improve tillering, or if the crop is too thick then nitrogen dose rates can be scaled back.

A further big advantage is that the system can tell how uniform the crop is, which can be a precursor to whether the grower should be using a variable-rate fertiliser application system.

""If you're seeing 96% uniformity in your crops, there is little point in carrying out variable rate applications, whereas if it is 50% or 60%, there may be a case for this,"" says Andrew.

The next step after crop nutrition and conducting plant counts could be weed and disease control.

Crops are analysed perhaps three or four times a year ahead of each potential split of nitrogen, and at the same time weed and disease hotspots can be monitored in the field that might not have easily been seen.

""Weed mapping is something we would like to get into eventually and the drone is also really useful in checking out dense crops such as oilseed rape and beans as they develop,"" says Will.

Blackgrass assessments

One big advantage could be assessing blackgrass levels in the early summer and then planning a grassweed strategy for the next season based on where the severity of the blackgrass is the most critical.

""It's much more accurate than satellite imagery which can only distinguish between brown and green,"" says Andrew. ""So if you have blackgrass in there or other weeds, the drone will allow us to filter all this out to give as accurate a GAI as possible.""

In the past 12 months, he says, Agrii has been concentrating on developing systems that can work in other crops such as oilseed rape and beans as well as winter wheat.

""It's really useful in oilseed rape for the timing of the flowering spray for sclerotinia, for example, and also for the timing of the glyphosate pre-harvest timing,"" he says.

""Trying to walk through a field of OSR when it is fully podded up is almost impossible. You get about 5m in and that's about as far as you can go.""

The drone can tell the grower what stage of flowering the crop is at, assessing the whole field for a fungicide spray, and also how far podded the crop is, to help with the timing of glyphosate desiccation.

In addition, Agrii and drone supplier Drone AG are working on a prediction scheme for chocolate spot to assess disease levels in bean crops when it is often difficult to walk through a fully grown crop.

""We're also using the drones to develop a wheat yield prediction system that, once a crop has headed up, will estimate what the yield of that field is going to be,"" says Andrew.

Drone gains for the future 

Increased productivity, cost reductions and helping the environment are some of the advantages that drones could bring to arable farming, says Agrii's lead pilot and technology trial manager Jonathan Trotter.

""The potential is huge. We are already starting to use drones with our customers to identify early indications of potential localised problems such as nutrient deficiency or pest infestations before they become a major problem,"" he says.

Jonathan sees many possibilities, from swarms of drones applying specific agrochemicals, to larger individual machines capable of carrying larger payloads, all of which could be controlled remotely and work with real-time data.

The issue moving forward is not the potential of the technology, he says, but ensuring it aligns with the legislation surrounding it and, to a degree, helping shape this.

This is why Agrii and Drone AG are working closely with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and other key bodies to establish safe working practices and operational strategies for the future.

""We want to explore what is going to be possible and make sure it complies with all guidelines and legislation so growers and the wider industry can get the most benefit from aerial technologies,"" says Jonathan.

Flying rules

Currently, the CAA allows drones up to 25kg to be flown with relevant qualifications. For bigger machines, there is a need to apply for an Operating Safety Case.

""So it could be that in a few years' time we are looking at operating drones weighing closer to 80kg or 100kg. Whether we have one drone or a swarm of drones flying to apply fertiliser or pesticides - all in line with regulations, obviously - is something we are very keen to explore,"" Jonathan says.

One possibility for the future, once legislation and authorisation with the CAA is agreed, is being able to pilot drones remotely from one of Agrii's research and development technology centres. Although this will initially be used in R&D, the principles behind it could be used for collecting farm data at some later stage.

He explains: ""The idea is we will be able to deploy ""˜drone-in-the-box' systems whereby we can place fully automated containers wherever we want, with a drone inside all pre-programmed and ready to go.

“We can then set it off autonomously, fly it over a field or trials site, collect high-resolution data, and it will then return to its box to be charged up again.""

At the moment, Agrii has several agronomists and crop input specialists trained to use drones, with more undergoing training for this potentially very valuable use of technology on farm.

A blend of four winter wheat varieties can help increase yields and allow growers to cut back on fungicides costs as it helps to slow down disease cycling through the crop

Four milling varieties blended together gave a higher yield than any of the individual varieties in 2022 and 2023 trials overseen by Dr Aoife O'Driscoll, senior specialist in plant pathology at crop consultant Niab.

""Growers were asking whether blends can increase yields or allow them to cut fungicide use. Well, they can do both,"" she says.

See also: Wheat blends prove simple way to boost average yields

Milling mix

When treated with a standard fungicide regime, the four milling varieties - Skyfall, Crusoe, Illustrious and Zyatt - gave individual yields ranging from 8.8t/ha to 10.75t/ha at 2022 harvest, while a four-way blend of the varieties yielded 11.2t/ha.

In 2023, the four varieties separately reached between 8.8t/ha and 10.8t/ha, while the blend again yielded 11.2t/ha.

There was a disease dilution effect seen in the trial, with septoria spores spread more evenly through the crops. More susceptible varieties saw less disease and more resistant varieties had small levels of disease.

""The blend is better or as good as the best variety and this could lead to some small cuts in fungicide use,"" says Aoife.

Feed blends

She points out that in a Champion-Dawsum feed wheat blend, the more septoria-resistant Champion did see some disease, while Dawsum, which has a lower septoria resistance score, was less infected than expected.

Champion scores 8.1 and Dawsum 6.4 for septoria resistance on a 1-9 scale where 9 shows good resistance and 1 is the most susceptible.

The four milling varieties in the trial had a small range of septoria resistance scores, from Skyfall at 5.4 to Crusoe at 6.2.

The four milling varieties tended to develop together, with 75% of the crop showing flag leaf emergence on 15 May, compared with a range of 67-82% for the four varieties grown separately. This suggests that the timing of fungicides is not such a big issue when using blends.

Millers’ views

One concern about using blends, especially breadmaking varieties, is the acceptance by millers. They buy based on variety and know how to deal a variety if it falls short on, say, protein. But dealing with a blend could prove to be more problematic.

However, Aoife points out that 18% of the milling wheat area in France is down to blends, which shows that this trend is taking off in a big way for French growers. She adds that many English growers were putting 5-10% of their wheat area into blends.

In addition, from a yield point of view, Scottish grower Gordon Rennie was hitting world record yields in 1994 using blends of winter wheat and winter barleys.

Nature-friendly farming

South Cambridgeshire grower Martin Lines is cutting back on fungicide use and is seeing better profits, as he has improved his soils, made crop rotations more diverse and introduced nature-friendly farming.

He is achieving good first winter wheat yields of 10-11t/ha and second wheats of 8-9t/ha on his heavy Cambridgeshire clays, and is making more money, as inputs are cut back.

A move to direct drilling has reduced his fuel use by 65%, he has applied no insecticides for nine years, and he is also cutting back on herbicides and fungicides.

""We are seeing better crops from better soils, and by adding nature back to farming, we are achieving better profits,"" says Martin.

He is looking to build fertility in his soils, helped by having been in stewardship schemes for the past 20 years. He says applying more fertiliser often encourages more disease.

""If we put on more fertiliser to get 0.2t/ha extra yield, we were having to put on another fungicide,"" he says.

Fungicide cuts 

He has cut back winter wheat fungicides use to just T1s and T2s, with no T0s, and is flexible when he sprays, pushing back timings if there is no disease threat.

He says if his plants get stressed, it's not nitrogen they need, but micronutrients.

He has halved his winter barley fungicide sprays from two to one, his winter beans only get one fungicide, and his in-field wildflower strips have helped him cut out insecticides. He is also using fewer slug pellets.

""We are not chasing yield, we are chasing margin. We are putting nature at the heart of the business and nature is free,"" adds Martin.

He farms 165ha at Papley Grove Farm, with other land rented or contracted.

In some areas of the farm, using Countryside Stewardship and the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI), he is earning more than with the old Basic Payment Scheme.

Direct drilling

Dr Henry Creissen, a research fellow in crop protection at Scotland's Rural College, has looked at how Scottish farms are reacting to the SFI.

He points out that a move to direct drilling, which could be a part of the SFI for next year, can lead to more disease pressure.

His work showed that where winter barley was established by direct-drilling into chopped straw, there were more trash-borne diseases such as rhynchosporium, and this often necessitated an extra fungicide compared with a plough-based system.

""On sites with reduced tillage, there was more of a response to fungicide use,"" he says, adding that winter barley crops established using reduced tillage in Scotland often needed a third fungicide, instead of the usual two-spray regime.

Looking at spring barley grown in a regenerative system, he says the best programmes - and usually the most profitable ones - did use some fungicides.

Carbon counting  

The use of fungicides in arable farming could actually reduce overall carbon emission, says Tamara Fitters, research consultant at crop consultant Adas.

The use of fungicides in an Adas trial showed that winter wheat yields increased to 10.20t/ha from 8.42t/ha.

This use of fungicides increased carbon emissions by 59kg carbon dioxide equivalent/t, but the need for more wheat land to make up for that yield decline would have led to emissions of 277kg.

Considering fungicide use achieved a yield increase of 21%, if no fungicides were used across the whole UK, there would have to be a big increase in the wheat area of just over 1.8m hectares to make up for this loss in yield.

Tamara pointed out that 70% of greenhouse gas emissions from arable farming is associated with nitrogen fertiliser, whether from manufacturing, spreading or emissions in the field.

Farms with lower greenhouse gases emissions were associated with lower nitrogen use.

Interestingly, farms with lower greenhouse gas emissions tended to show higher yields due to better efficacy of nitrogen use, less intensive cultivations, less grain drying, and less manures and phosphorus and potassium fertilisers applied.

In addition, she pointed out that a one point rise in septoria resistance can cut yield loss by 0.31t/ha, so better plant genetics can lead to less emissions.

In some areas of the farm, using Countryside Stewardship and the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI), he is earning more than with the old Basic Payment Scheme.

Direct drilling

Dr Henry Creissen, a research fellow in crop protection at Scotland's Rural College, has looked at how Scottish farms are reacting to the SFI.

He points out that a move to direct drilling, which could be a part of the SFI for next year, can lead to more disease pressure.

His work showed that where winter barley was established by direct-drilling into chopped straw, there were more trash-borne diseases such as rhynchosporium, and this often necessitated an extra fungicide compared with a plough-based system.

""On sites with reduced tillage, there was more of a response to fungicide use,"" he says, adding that winter barley crops established using reduced tillage in Scotland often needed a third fungicide, instead of the usual two-spray regime.

Looking at spring barley grown in a regenerative system, he says the best programmes - and usually the most profitable ones - did use some fungicides.

Carbon counting  

The use of fungicides in arable farming could actually reduce overall carbon emission, says Tamara Fitters, research consultant at crop consultant Adas.

The use of fungicides in an Adas trial showed that winter wheat yields increased to 10.20t/ha from 8.42t/ha.

This use of fungicides increased carbon emissions by 59kg carbon dioxide equivalent/t, but the need for more wheat land to make up for that yield decline would have led to emissions of 277kg.

Considering fungicide use achieved a yield increase of 21%, if no fungicides were used across the whole UK, there would have to be a big increase in the wheat area of just over 1.8m hectares to make up for this loss in yield.

Tamara pointed out that 70% of greenhouse gas emissions from arable farming is associated with nitrogen fertiliser, whether from manufacturing, spreading or emissions in the field.

Farms with lower greenhouse gases emissions were associated with lower nitrogen use.

Interestingly, farms with lower greenhouse gas emissions tended to show higher yields due to better efficacy of nitrogen use, less intensive cultivations, less grain drying, and less manures and phosphorus and potassium fertilisers applied.

In addition, she pointed out that a one point rise in septoria resistance can cut yield loss by 0.31t/ha, so better plant genetics can lead to less emissions.

British Crop Production Council's (BCPC) diseases review 2023

All the speakers were attending the British Crop Production Council's (BCPC) diseases review 2023 meeting on ""Disease control - Balancing food security and environmental responsibility”, held on 17 October 2023 at Niab's Park Farm facility. BCPC is part of the Niab Group.

A daffodil extract added to livestock feed could reduce methane emissions from dairy cows by 30% if a project at Scotland's Rural College (SRUC) is successful.

Daffodils produce a compound that prevents ruminants from generating methane.

Research at SRUC has shown that adding an extract from the flower to livestock feed reduced methane in artificial cow stomachs by 96%.

See also: £2.9m project aims for lower methane emissions from sheep

The scientists involved in the four-year trial hope it will reduce emissions from real cows by more than one-third.

The daffodils are being grown on farms in Wales and England.

Livestock farmer Kevin Stephens in Fedwlydan, Glasbury on Wye, has been growing daffodils for 14 years, principally to extract a compound known to slow the progress of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.

Kevin describes the research as a ""game changer"" and one which could make a huge difference to the livestock industry.

""There are governments across the world currently trying to meet net zero by either taxing livestock farmers or putting quotas on the number of livestock you can have because of the methane by-product,"" he said.

""This gives us a very real opportunity to change that story.""

Emissions

It is estimated that half of UK agriculture's methane emissions come from cows - globally, they are thought to be responsible for 14% of all greenhouse gases.

The SRUC research has involved developing a supply chain of daffodils and extracting the desired chemicals before testing that the additive is safe for animals and humans.

In the final stage of the project, the scientists will work with farmer partners across England and Wales to prove the additive is effective in reducing methane production and feed costs.

341,"Farmers reject claims they are ‘anti-nature’","https://www.fwi.co.uk/news/environment/biodiversity/farmers-reject-claims-they-are-anti-nature","Farmers reject claims they are ‘anti-nature’

Farming and science organisations have hit back at suggestions that intensive farming is mainly to blame for nature decline in the British countryside.

The claim is made in the latest State of Nature report, compiled every few years by more than 60 research and conservation groups.

It says there has been an average 19% decline in the abundance of species studied since the 1970s.

Birds and pollinators have fared particularly badly, and the report cites intensive farming and climate change as the two biggest drivers of nature loss.

See also: How we covered the Sate of Nature report in 2016

""A combination of technological advancements, the use of agro-chemicals, and changing agricultural policy has reduced the capacity of farmed landscapes to support wildlife, resulting in widespread biodiversity loss,"" says the report.

And while the authors acknowledge there have been some recent moves towards more nature-friendly land use, ""only a fifth of farmland is now in agri-environment schemes, with only some of that helping nature,"" they say.

Beccy Speight, the RSPB's chief executive, said:

""We need to move far faster as a society towards nature-friendly land and sea use, otherwise the UK's nature and wider environment will continue to decline and degrade, with huge implications for our own way of life.""

Response

But the NFU has defended British farming’s record, pointing to the ""huge amounts of work"" that has been carried out to boost nature, create habitats, and benefit soil health and water quality.

""Hundreds of flower-rich field margins have been developed to provide habitats for bees and other insects, while 149 species were recorded during this year's Big Farmland Bird Count, including 33 species from the Red List for Birds of Conservation Concern,"" said NFU president Minette Batters.

""We are also working in a variety of ways to reduce emissions through improved productivity on farm, as well as planting more trees and hedges.""

Pro-science think tank Science for Sustainable Agriculture is also critical of the report, saying it ignores the enormous progress made by Britain's farmers to produce food more sustainably.

For example, through more precise application of pesticides and fertiliser, the adoption of low-till cultivation, and selection of crops that are less reliant on chemicals.

The group also challenges the report's ""relentless focus"" on agri-environmental, or ""land-sharing"", policy approaches.

""The scientific evidence increasingly suggests that a land-sparing approach - farming as productively as possible on land that is farmed, leaving more room for natural habitats to be left intact - is the most effective way to produce sufficient food, while preventing biodiversity loss and tackling climate change,"" it argues.

Solutions

The report has, however, been welcomed by the Nature Friendly Farming Network, which acknowledges the role agriculture has played in the past, but argues it can now be part of the solution.

It points to the hundreds of farmers ""who are already working to turn the tide"".

West Sussex arable farmer James Baird, for example, has planted many hedgerows and dug ponds on his 526ha.

""We see declines in the State of Nature report that are alarming, but this is a whole of society issue that's not just restricted to agricultural land management,"" he said.

""Nature is assaulted from many arenas. It is not something agriculture can address in its own right, but UK farmers have an important role to play.""

Craig Bennett, chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts, said the budget for nature-friendly farming should increase to at least £4.4bn/year.

This would be more than £1bn over what is currently spent on agricultural and rural support in the UK.

344,"Young farmers: What do they need to succeed?","https://www.fwi.co.uk/farm-life/young-farmers/young-farmers-what-do-they-need-to-succeed","Young farmers: What do they need to succeed?

The third annual study carried out by the National Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs (NFYFC) has shed new light on the challenges facing young farmers as they try to break into farming.

The study, backed by both Defra and training body Lantra, highlights the growing frustration over changing regulations and the uncertainty over career prospects for new entrants within the agricultural sector.

Among the top concerns cited were accessibility to land and to finance, with 72% of the 511 respondents feeling that it is difficult, if not impossible, to get into farming.

Some 75% also felt that the new Defra environmental schemes were not benefiting them at all.

See also: Tips for young farmers on making media appearances

Luke Cox, NFYFC's vice chairman of the YFC Agri steering group, said:

""Young farmers want to continue to produce great British food, but year-on-year the survey indicates that new entrants can't access the support required to break into the industry.

""Without this injection of new and exciting ideas, UK farming is going to miss out on a generation of talent and enthusiasm.""

Key findings

The survey was conducted on an audience of 511 young farmers, with an average age of 22 years.

Of those that responded, 81% were members of a young farmers club, and 31% were students. 

Education needs

One of the greatest issues uncovered by the survey was the need for education and development around soil health, which ranked highly, alongside the need for business and financial management training,

More than 60% of respondents noted that soil health was a topic they needed guidance and training on if they are to succeed and understand agri-environmental targets.

Responding to the results, the NFYFC and Lantra have called for a ""back to basics"" approach in making skill development and training in the fundamentals of soil health a priority.

Lantra spokesperson Corina Urquhart said: ""Well-managed and biologically active soils are the foundation of farming, representing the largest active carbon store after our oceans.

""Therefore, we are keen for further insights from young farmers to ensure our soils are fit for food production and future business opportunities.""

Already, a series of focus groups with NFYFC members have been planned for later in the year.

Delivering agri-environment policy

Asked what farmers and land managers would need to deliver more environmental outcomes, 68% of the respondents, which had an average age of 22, ranked grant funding as the most important aspect of support required.

55% chose business support, 56% voted for encouragement of new entrants, and 54% ranked training the highest. 

Despite this, two-thirds of the respondents said they did not understand what current agri-environment policy changes would mean for them, and 60% of young farmers felt they lacked proper information and advice on agricultural policy.

A further 90% acknowledged they would need to acquire new skills to farm and manage in line with new legislation. 

NFYFC's agriculture and rural issues manager, Sarah Palmer, said: ""Positive action from three years of surveying is welcome to address the concern raised for prospects and opportunities for next generation farmers and land managers.

""This research, combined with the learning from the recent Defra new entrant pilots for the design of a future scheme, will provide much-needed support for next generation aspirations."" 

New entrant Chris Lake

Despite highlighting the many difficulties, the survey also showed that, on average, young farmers feel more positive than negative about the new policy framework.

Subject to the right skills and development training, they are also undeterred by the industry's challenges. 

Young farmer Chris Lake, 22, from Cambridgeshire, is determined to start farming and secure a tenancy.

Not originally from a farming family, Chris, who works as a farm consultant, is experiencing first-hand the many challenges that new entrants face.

He said: ""I'm passionate about breaking into farming - and you need to be to make it happen.

""Land is the asset that determines whether farming becomes a full-time job.

""My plan is to have a tenancy so I can run a mixed farm, which I am financing through the sale of a property.

""I was turned down for a tenancy in Norfolk last year and I have since applied for one in Cambridgeshire.""

Chris first became interested in a career in farming after joining his local YFC in Comberton.

He made a friend that worked on a regenerative farm, where he started cultivating and drilling before studying applied farm management at the Royal Agricultural University in Cirencester.

""The biggest barrier for new entrants is land accessibility and it's an issue I am currently experiencing.

""I am determined that I will be farming by September - even if that means I rent private land. I appreciate this is not an option for everyone.

""Finance is another major barrier, but some of that is due to not understanding what is available to new entrants.

""I recognise it's a minefield for a lot of new entrants trying to source government funding.

""It's either too difficult or contradictory - the government needs to be more concise with what they are offering and stick with the titles and eligibility criteria of the schemes, instead of changing them.""

Timely cultivations reducing beetle populations

Mr Peters points to promising results from 2022, which suggest the pest is vulnerable at the pupae stage while it is still in the ground, with timely cultivations taking out high numbers of the beetle just as the new crop is being established.

Work on two Cambridgeshire farms with very high beetle populations showed reductions of up to 90% in adults emerging from the soil when cultivated straight after the OSR was combined, compared with non-cultivated ground.

The findings come from a limited number of sites in just one year.

However, previous experience with pest numbers on farms where straw raking is being used to reduce slug damage shows similar effects.

This suggests that cultivations can have a major role in reducing beetle numbers.

""If the beetles are still in the ground as pupae and haven't hatched, they appear to be vulnerable,"" he says.

""We still need to understand more about the cultivations that work best and if the weather affects the results, as well as any effects on parasitoids, but post-harvest cultivations do seem to help manipulate the flea beetle population.""

In the absence of effective chemical control methods, alternative management methods are being investigated by the csfbSmart project which aims to get a better understanding of the pest's biology.

Rethink volunteers as a trap crop

The work also suggests that leaving volunteers as a trap crop for newly hatched adults is not the right thing to do and could increase the national flea beetle population.

This goes against what growers have been advised to date, stresses Mr Peters, who reveals that water traps left in volunteers this summer didn't contain beetles, even though emergence traps in the same fields contained high numbers.

""Many insects are programmed to move and fly away when they emerge from the ground."" 

Volunteers were at the cotyledon stage as the beetles hatched this year, he notes, backing up this finding from a network of farms around the country.

""There isn't any research work that shows that volunteers work as trap crop and can contribute to a reduction in pest numbers. They may, however, have an impact on the establishment of crops adjacent to the volunteers.""

Bespoke emergence traps used during 2022 also showed that beetles continue to emerge from the ground into December - far later than was previously thought.

That changes the length of the egg laying period and resulting stem larval numbers and could have implications for other pest management strategies, says Mr Peters.

""It also helps to explain why longer-lasting companion crops might help in an integrated pest management strategy.  We need to have a rethink about the whole life cycle of the pest.""

Long-lasting companion crops

Longer-term companion crops appear to help with reducing cabbage stem flea beetle larvae numbers, reveals Colin Peters.

Mr Peters is looking for more UK growers prepared to leave companion crops until the end of February so that stem sampling can be done.

On-farm monitoring shows that keeping companion crops going, rather than taking them out in the autumn, dilutes adult beetle egg-laying, with corresponding falls in larvae numbers.

Companion crops containing at least one other species to the oilseed rape also meet the requirements of the intermediate soil standard in the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI), which attracts a £40/ha payment.

Results from 2022 show that OSR crops without companions had a sizeable increase in larvae numbers, says Mr Peters.

""This means we need to understand more about how to grow companion crops and how much they compete with the rape crop, as well as what the best species are to use.

""We also need to be able to plan herbicide use to deal with weed issues.""

In the same way, growers could look at having oilseed rape as part of an overwinter cover crop before spring cereals, he suggests, so that it acts as a trap crop.

""In an effective integrated pest management strategy, you need to provide somewhere for the insects to go.""

""We also need to be able to plan herbicide use to deal with weed issues.""

In the same way, growers could look at having oilseed rape as part of an overwinter cover crop before spring cereals, he suggests, so that it acts as a trap crop.

""In an effective integrated pest management strategy, you need to provide somewhere for the insects to go.""

More sites needed

Colin Peters is keen to hear from growers with sites that have oilseed rape with longer-term companion crops, so his team can carry out free-of-charge sampling.

All the results will be shared with participants. Email Colin at Niab at colin.peters@niab.com

Redwater fever is the colloquial name for bovine babesiosis, a disease of cattle.

In the UK, redwater is caused by two species of protozoan parasite: Babesia divergens and Babesia major.

B divergens is by far the more common of the two and is also more prone to causing severe disease.

Transmission

In the UK, Babesia is transmitted by the hard tick Ixodes ricinus. Once injected into the bloodstream by the tick, the parasite invades red blood cells and begins dividing, eventually rupturing the cells.

Clinical signs begin about two weeks after infection.

Ticks can also pass Babesia transovarially (from adult to egg to larva).

This has implications for control, as the disease can be maintained between seasons, even if it is removed from host mammals by treatment or avoiding grazing risk areas.

It is thought that Babesia can survive within the tick population for up to four years without any requirement for periods in the cow.

About the author



Paul Doran is a vet at Friars Moor Livestock Health, Dorset. He has a particular interest in farm animal diagnostics and post-mortem investigation.

Each month, we bring practical advice from an XLVets practice on a range of different subjects.

Historically, deer were not thought to be a significant reservoir of infection because studies relying on blood smear examination failed to detect the parasite in them.

However, a more recent PCR-based study, conducted on a farm where the disease was present, showed 11% of red deer on the farmland and surrounding areas were infected with B divergens, suggesting their significance may have been underestimated.

Disease in the UK is seen mainly in South West England, with seasonal peaks in the spring and autumn.

Clinical signs

The most recognisable clinical sign is red urine. The colour comes from haemoglobin produced by the rupture of red blood cells.

Other clinical signs include high temperature (often 40C or more), anorexia, depression, weakness, high heart rate and ""pipe stem diarrhoea"". These progress to severe dehydration, recumbency and sometimes death.

Diagnosis is based on history, clinical signs, confirmation of anaemia and examination of stained blood smears.

PCR testing is available and is more sensitive than blood smear examination, but is considerably more expensive and not suitable for rapid cow-side diagnosis.

Milder cases of redwater can recover without treatment.

It has been shown that clinical signs do not occur in every incidence of adult infection, so it is likely that a significant proportion of infections may pass unnoticed.

Factors thought to affect the outcome of an infection include the age of the animal, number of infecting ticks, virulence of the B divergens strain, any factor that may cause immunosuppression, and co-infection of cattle with other tick-related ailments such as tick-borne fever or anaplasmosis.

Treatment

The mainstay of treatment for redwater is administration of imidocarb dipropionate. Given the clinical signs, anti-inflammatories are also advised.

Blood transfusion is often necessary in severely anaemic cattle.

A commonly accepted rule of thumb is that animals with a packed cell volume (PCV) of less than 15% are likely to benefit from transfusion, and those with a PCV of 10% or less are highly unlikely to survive without a transfusion.

Immunity

Cattle have an inverse age resistance to babesiosis, which means youngstock are highly resistant to the disease, whereas adults with no previous exposure to infection are not.

Therefore, young animals exposed to the disease can acquire immunity without showing any clinical signs and will maintain this immunity owing to repeated tick challenges.

Cattle in endemic areas will rarely show clinical signs, but non-immune adult cattle brought into an endemic area, or present in an area where tick migration has occurred, may be susceptible.

The age at which susceptibility to disease from Babesia infection increases is unclear.

One review suggested calves up to nine months old were resistant to clinical disease, while another implied that a less complete degree of resistance may prevail up to two-and-a-half years.

Prevention

Imidocarb can be used at a higher dose rate for prevention of clinical disease in naive animals moving to a high-risk area.

This is thought to provide protection for three to six weeks while still allowing natural immunity to occur.

Several vaccines for Babesiosis exist, although none is licensed in the UK. Apparently, all live vaccines have significant drawbacks or limitations.

Exposing youngstock to ticks should ensure natural immunity is acquired, but achieving this might not be practical in all situations. In many cases, Babesia seems to affect particular fields, rather than a whole farm.

While several antibody tests for demonstrating exposure to the parasite have been developed and can be used in research settings, cost and practicality have prevented these tests from becoming commercially available.

Blood smear examination and PCR tests are of little practical value for monitoring exposure, so there is no way to measure the effectiveness of youngstock exposure.

Tick control can be used to reduce the risk of the disease by reducing the degree of challenge.

Neither synthetic pyrethroids nor macrocyclic lactones have a licence for tick control in UK cattle, although certain preparations may be prescribed for tick control by your vet.

However, tick control could potentially be a double-edged sword in that it may compromise the development of natural immunity in younger animals.

This raises the risk of outbreaks when these animals mature.

There is a further potential risk when macrocyclic lactones are used as part of a worm control programme, as tick control may then occur as an unintended side effect.

Politics, the weather, livestock disease and market volatility are all part of the territory for those involved in agriculture. And they add up to quite a memorable year. 

Over the coming days, we look back at key events that have helped shape the farming year, taking it two months at a time.

See also: Defra to unveil final details on six new SFI standards

January 

Defra farming minister Mark Spencer opened the year with a promise at the Oxford Farming Conference to pay Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) applicants a £20/ha management payment to help cover the ""office time"" spent filling out forms.

He also agreed to pay 10% more for ""actions"" under Countryside Stewardship, and 48% more for ""capital items"".

Tenant Farmers Association chief executive George Dunn said it failed to plug the hole left by cuts in the Basic Payment Scheme.

Defra and the Forestry Commission announced tough new penalties for unlicensed tree felling, with unlimited fines and risk of imprisonment.

Researchers at Aberystwyth University and University College Cork embarked on a £1.3m study into growing duckweed in slurry stores as a source of protein for livestock.

Start-up company Farm Wilder launched a new 50:50 burger - half beef, half plant - for sale to environmentally conscious students at Exeter University.

National Beef Association boss Neil Shand slated the apparent ""demonisation of beef"".

Devon farmers were equally appalled by a motion from Exeter City Council to transition to plant-based catering only.

West Scotland suffered major flooding, with more than 400 sheep lost in one incident when the River Nith burst its banks.

Another 27 sheep perished in Kent's ""worst ever"" sheep worrying event.

Richard Irvine was appointed the new chief veterinary officer for Wales, replacing Christianne Glossop after 17 years in the role, while Defra chief vet Christine Middlemiss received a gong in the New Year Honours list.

A survey by the National Farm Animal Veterinary Society urged farmers to treat student vets better and provide ""more positive experiences"".

An NFU intentions survey warned of significant contraction to come in the beef and sheep sectors in response to soaring feed costs and declining support payments.

Agricultural contraction was also a thing for Peterborough City Council, which announced plans to sell off some of its council farms.

More positively, Buckinghamshire farmer and TikTok star Will Young made his debut in the Love Island villa in South Africa, while Northumberland agronomist Chris McClymont ran 268 miles along the Pennines to raise £5,000 for charity.

The month ended as it started, with more news on the SFI, as Defra revealed the six new ""standards"" to be rolled out for English farmers later in the year, covering hedgerows, grassland, arable and horticultural land, pest control and nutrient management.

February 

Good news as agflation showed the first signs of slowing in over a year. But bad news too, as farm consultant Andersons showed that rises in farm input costs were still outstripping retail prices.

British Apples and Pears described its members as being ""on a knife edge"" as some orchards were grubbed up.

Bird flu continued to ravage the country's poultry flocks. Free-range birds had been housed for so long their eggs had to be marketed as ""barn eggs"" instead.

On the meat side, 2 Sisters Food Group said it was going to close its processing plant in Anglesey.

Milk prices were also on the slide, having peaked at more than 50p/litre at Christmas, but now on the way down as supply and demand got out of kilter.

FW editor Andrew Meredith called for careful downward management of prices rather than a race to the bottom.

In retail, supermarket Aldi dropped its pledge to stock only British lamb in stores and bring in New Zealand product.

Sainsbury's had to apologise after Italian barn eggs were found on shelves purporting to have come from free-range hens.

Farming unions held their usual annual conferences, with the Scottish NFU vexed by the lack of detail about future farm support.

The Scottish government’s rural affairs secretary Mairi Gougeon unveiled her Agricultural Reform Route Map, but refused to be drawn on how any future cash might be allocated.

NFU Scotland leader Martin Kennedy said the vast bulk of funding should stay as direct payments.

The NFU's annual get-together in Birmingham was best remembered for a ""car crash"" performance by Defra secretary Therese Coffey, which compared starkly with a ""slick"" presentation by Labour leader Sir Kier Starmer.

Kaleb Cooper and Jeremy Clarkson returned with season two of Clarkson’s Farm © Ellis O’Brien/Prime Video

The industry ""love-in"" with celebrity farmer Jeremy Clarkson resumed, as Clarkson's Farm 2 hit Amazon screens.

Red tape and badger culling topped the bill, though a cavalier approach to health and safety raised a few eyebrows.

Yorkshire farmer's daughter Miriam Payne broke the record for rowing solo across the Atlantic Ocean in just under 60 days, raising money for charities Wellbeing in Women and Mind.

Britain's Fittest Farmer officially opened for entries. Firefighters were called to rescue two cows from a slurry pit on a farm in Cornwall.

Today, Wednesday, 8 March, is International Women's Day, an event to celebrate women's achievements, raise awareness about discrimination, and take action to drive gender parity.

It is also a great opportunity to think about the possibilities and challenges for women working in agriculture.

While I was growing up, it was almost unheard of for women to run farms, but times are changing. In recent years female farmers have gained a lot more exposure, inspiring others including myself.

About the author



Hannah Reddaway trained as a structural engineer, but returned to her family's Tuckenhay Farm in South Devon, where she works on the farm and runs the Tuckenhay Farm Meat Boxes enterprise. Here she points to the great achievements of women in agriculture.

TV programmes such as This Farming Life, which put a lot of female farmers into the public eye, have encouraged and supported girls to take on physical outdoor roles.

Emma Gray is inspirational as she runs a farm, raises a family and teaches her spouse from outside the industry how to farm.

Social media accounts, such as Zoe Colville’s @thechiefshepherdess, also demonstrate that girls can farm even with no prior background or experience in the industry.

As farming is going through a time of uncertainty and change, it has never been more important for the industry to be diverse and inclusive, to attract new entrants and gain public support.

It is therefore important to step back and think about how we can overcome the challenges for women and welcome people into the industry regardless of gender or background.

Challenges

A Farmers Weekly and Barclays survey found that ""industry attitude"" is the second-biggest challenge women face in agriculture.

Although views are changing, it is much more common for women to be encouraged to take off-farm work or lead diversifications, rather than to take leading roles on the farm.

With 61% of women saying they are never or rarely treated equally when it comes to succession, they are often not given the same opportunities as men to make those leading decisions on the farm.

The attitude while I was growing up was that girls should work hard at school, get a good job (off the farm), and then, if they were interested in farming, marry a farmer.

It can be difficult to overcome people telling you that you aren't capable of farming or shouldn't be doing it because you're female.

However, there are plenty of people who won't care what gender you are when you get in a tractor, catch a sheep or calve a cow.

Fortunately, machinery is ""equality enabling"" within farming, regardless of physical strength, and skill is now becoming more important.

Confidence

For me, it was perhaps going on to study and work in engineering (another male-dominated industry), that gave me the confidence to try my hand at the traditionally male-dominated roles on the farm.

It could also have been because machinery and a shift in mindset are enabling female farmers to become more visible in the community.  

I have found huge fulfilment in doing practical work, being outdoors and connecting with my family heritage in the South Devon landscape, alongside setting up Tuckenhay Farm Meat Boxes.

I hope more women and girls feel able to choose this path in the future.

So, on International Women's Day, if you are a man, why not celebrate the achievements of the women around you, alongside thinking about how you could help to welcome more women into the industry?

And if you are a woman, know that there is a place for you within farming, and the best way to support and encourage others is to get stuck in and be visible within the industry, to show other women (and men) what we are capable of.

A report carried out by the Scottish government has found that women in agriculture still face regular sexism, gender bias and tokenism.

The Women in Agriculture: Leadership programme development research study assessed the needs of women within the sector, with a view to developing a programme specifically tailored to promoting more women to leadership positions.

See also: Top tips from three multitasking farming mums

Key findings of the report showed that many women in agriculture have to ""use humour as a way of dealing with sexism"" and that these ""persistent forms of gender bias"" have a detrimental effect on women working in the industry.

This underlying sexism was described as ""corrosive"", with one interviewee saying: ""There is a perception that ""˜oh, she's female""¦she's going to go off on maternity leave'. I've heard that articulated in a boardroom situation.""

Respect 

The report also highlighted that many women face a barrier when it comes to gaining the respect of male counterparts.

One woman said: ""In agriculture… if you go into any position as a man, it's assumed that you can do it until you prove otherwise. I think when you go in as a woman, it's assumed that you probably can't do it, until you prove otherwise.""

While gender bias and stereotyping have hindered women from progressing to leadership roles, the study found that, for those who had participated in leadership and development programmes, there was a consensus that these had instilled greater confidence, skills and networking opportunities. 

Gemma Cooper, head of policy at NFU Scotland said: ""The report clearly identifies areas for further work, and NFU Scotland will continue to work with all Women in Agriculture partners to enhance the opportunities for all women working within Scottish agriculture. 

""There is a wealth of talent, both already within the sector and as yet undiscovered.""

China is leading the way on using drones to spray arable crops, and the presence of Chinese drone giant DJI's agriculture division at the Agritechnica event in Hanover showed it is keen to flex its muscle in a market where it sees huge potential.

Up to now, Europe has lagged behind the US and China, but the sight of drones spraying arable crops may be getting closer, with signs that Europe is opening up regulation to permit their use.

DJI Agriculture has so far sold about 200,000 drones for spraying, 80% of which are in China.

Opening up

DJI Agriculture pointed to its latest annual Agricultural Drone Insight Report, published in August, which highlights a gradual opening up of regulation in Europe.

The EU Commission proposed an update to its Sustainable Use Directive in summer 2022, which will exempt some unmanned aerial vehicles from the 2009 law prohibiting aerial pesticide application.

This is because spraying drones - when used in conjunction with remote sensing technology to produce application maps - can be much more targeted and reduce overall pesticide use, which is a key goal for the EU's Green Deal and Farm to Fork strategy.

Furthermore, the European Aviation Standards Authority ecently softened requirements for risk assessments when using a drone for a specific purpose such as chemical application, including lifting a 25kg weight limit, as long as it is within a maximum dimension of 3m.

Individual member states including Italy and France have already granted licenses for spraying of vineyards and orchards where steep slopes restrict access for ground sprayers.

Germany is also granting permission for agricultural drone use below 50kg.

In Switzerland, Agroscope, the country's centre of excellence for agricultural research, has concluded that the environmental impact of using drones for spraying is similar to ground sprayers and has backed use of the technology.

Here in the UK, there is now a mechanism to get a permit for aerial spraying, with users able to submit application plans to the Health and Safety Executive for consideration.

The Health and Safety Executive is also leading a global partnership on how drones could be used to apply pesticides in the future.

This will help understand the risks to humans and the environment and adapt regulatory systems to better accommodate drone applications.

Positive outlook

All this paints a positive outlook for drone spraying operations in Europe, and DJI Agriculture's Zhong Wing tells Farmers Weekly that drones can complement existing spraying technology very well.

In the short term, this will mostly be on difficult terrain and for spot spraying applications, but she says efficiency of drones, in terms of hectares covered, can already compete with a medium-sized 18m boom sprayer.

With relatively short flight times on existing batteries, this would require multiple drones, batteries, a fast charger, and well-trained operators to achieve constant flight.

""On the other side is efficacy. A drone creates a downwash, which is something unique [to the technology] and makes better penetration [of the crop canopy].

""If you are spraying a crop with a thick canopy like potatoes, the downwash of the drone will push the droplets [to the target] better, so in some ways there is a possibility to replace ground sprayers in the future,"" she explains.

DJI Agriculture is working with research organisations globally, including Auburn University in the US, to improve efficiency, efficacy and drift control when using drones.

Data on the latter is key to maintain momentum in opening up regulation where adoption is behind regions like Asia, such as in Europe.

""From the technical side, there is a lot we can do to change the regulatory ecosystem, like reducing drift by enhancing downwash, adding agents into the solution, and improving the precision of the systems,"" explains Zhong.

Advanced technology

The first of two new DJI Agriculture drone models, the Agras T50 has been available in China since last year and is the largest and most advanced agricultural drone DJI has produced thus far.

Superseding the T40, the quadcopter has a coaxial dual rotor design with 54in blades and high-power electronic speed controllers (ESCs).

This means it is capable of flying at faster speeds while carrying a liquid spraying payload of 40kg and spreading (fertiliser or seeds) payload of 50kg.

Following the lead of other agricultural drone manufacturers, the unit moves away from hydraulic nozzles and uses centrifugal nozzles to deliver chemical to the target.

These have a motor-driven disc that rotates at high speed, dispersing spray droplets by centrifugal force. Droplet size is regulated by the speed of the disc and the flow rate from pump to nozzle.

Flow rates have improved dramatically compared with previous models, with 16 litres/min and 24 litres/min possible with two and four nozzles, respectively.

Its twin pump system is now integrated into the spray module rather than the drone, which makes cleaning and maintenance more straightforward.

If applying solid materials, the spreading module has an upgraded motor with increased torque and a spiral flow channel spinner which it is claims spreads more evenly and smoothly than before at rates up to 108kg/minute.

Improved camera

Other upgrades see the T50 carrying an ultra-high-definition first person view gimbal camera for better image collection and a powerful obstacle sensing system. This uses two phased array radars and two dual binocular vision systems front and rear.

Better LED spotlights also improve abilities when working at night and its combination of surveying and product application is claimed to make it a complete drone solution.

The second new model is the Agras T25P, which trumps the T20P model, and is a more flexible and portable option aimed at precision applications carried out by a single pilot on smaller farms.

Payload is 20kg for spraying and 25kg for spreading and the T25P benefits from all the other upgrades of the T50 for improved operation.

Neither DJI or its primary European distributor would say how much each drone might cost once on sale in 2024, but it's likely to command a premium over â‚¬17,000 (£14,600) for a T30 package, which includes batteries, charger, and control system.

Given the cost and current regulatory roadblocks, will many be investing in agricultural drones from DJI and others in the short term?

ISO Standard

Joanna Wang, DJI Agriculture's policy manager, says a recently published international standard (ISO23117) will help drone makers comply with a set of minimum requirements for reducing the risk of environmental issues when using drones for spraying.

Once agricultural drone models have this ISO certification, it will inevitably encourage regulators to permit their use where the country recognises the ISO standard.

Another significant roadblock is the agrochemical approvals in Europe, as almost all product labels will not include aerial spraying with drones as a means of application.

Joanna says there might be two routes for the EU and other countries including the UK to take.

One would be to follow the model used by Asia Pacific countries such as China and Thailand, which decided to permit use of most products applied with ground sprayers for drones.

The other is to follow the lead of Japan and have a separate list of registered products for drones, individually approved by the country's health and safety regulators.

This would be a very heavy workload for the relevant department, but may be considered necessary here due to the use of low water volumes - meaning higher concentration of chemical in spray solutions - associated with drone spraying, for example.

DJI Agriculture is working with research organisations globally, including Auburn University in the US, to improve efficiency, efficacy and drift control when using drones.

Data on the latter is key to maintain momentum in opening up regulation where adoption is behind regions like Asia, such as in Europe.

""From the technical side, there is a lot we can do to change the regulatory ecosystem, like reducing drift by enhancing downwash, adding agents into the solution, and improving the precision of the systems,"" explains Zhong.

Advanced technology

The first of two new DJI Agriculture drone models, the Agras T50 has been available in China since last year and is the largest and most advanced agricultural drone DJI has produced thus far.

Superseding the T40, the quadcopter has a coaxial dual rotor design with 54in blades and high-power electronic speed controllers (ESCs).

This means it is capable of flying at faster speeds while carrying a liquid spraying payload of 40kg and spreading (fertiliser or seeds) payload of 50kg.

Following the lead of other agricultural drone manufacturers, the unit moves away from hydraulic nozzles and uses centrifugal nozzles to deliver chemical to the target.

These have a motor-driven disc that rotates at high speed, dispersing spray droplets by centrifugal force. Droplet size is regulated by the speed of the disc and the flow rate from pump to nozzle.

Flow rates have improved dramatically compared with previous models, with 16 litres/min and 24 litres/min possible with two and four nozzles, respectively.

Its twin pump system is now integrated into the spray module rather than the drone, which makes cleaning and maintenance more straightforward.

If applying solid materials, the spreading module has an upgraded motor with increased torque and a spiral flow channel spinner which it is claims spreads more evenly and smoothly than before at rates up to 108kg/minute.

Improved camera

Other upgrades see the T50 carrying an ultra-high-definition first person view gimbal camera for better image collection and a powerful obstacle sensing system. This uses two phased array radars and two dual binocular vision systems front and rear.

Better LED spotlights also improve abilities when working at night and its combination of surveying and product application is claimed to make it a complete drone solution.

The second new model is the Agras T25P, which trumps the T20P model, and is a more flexible and portable option aimed at precision applications carried out by a single pilot on smaller farms.

Payload is 20kg for spraying and 25kg for spreading and the T25P benefits from all the other upgrades of the T50 for improved operation.

Neither DJI or its primary European distributor would say how much each drone might cost once on sale in 2024, but it's likely to command a premium over â‚¬17,000 (£14,600) for a T30 package, which includes batteries, charger, and control system.

Given the cost and current regulatory roadblocks, will many be investing in agricultural drones from DJI and others in the short term?

ISO Standard

Joanna Wang, DJI Agriculture's policy manager, says a recently published international standard (ISO23117) will help drone makers comply with a set of minimum requirements for reducing the risk of environmental issues when using drones for spraying.

Once agricultural drone models have this ISO certification, it will inevitably encourage regulators to permit their use where the country recognises the ISO standard.

Another significant roadblock is the agrochemical approvals in Europe, as almost all product labels will not include aerial spraying with drones as a means of application.

Joanna says there might be two routes for the EU and other countries including the UK to take.

One would be to follow the model used by Asia Pacific countries such as China and Thailand, which decided to permit use of most products applied with ground sprayers for drones.

The other is to follow the lead of Japan and have a separate list of registered products for drones, individually approved by the country's health and safety regulators.

This would be a very heavy workload for the relevant department, but may be considered necessary here due to the use of low water volumes - meaning higher concentration of chemical in spray solutions - associated with drone spraying, for example.

China is leading the way on using drones to spray arable crops, and the presence of Chinese drone giant DJI's agriculture division at the Agritechnica event in Hanover showed it is keen to flex its muscle in a market where it sees huge potential.

Up to now, Europe has lagged behind the US and China, but the sight of drones spraying arable crops may be getting closer, with signs that Europe is opening up regulation to permit their use.

DJI Agriculture has so far sold about 200,000 drones for spraying, 80% of which are in China.

See also: What are the prospects for spraying using drones in the UK?

It brought two new agricultural drone models and some of its top team from China to Agritechnica last month to discuss its research and development work and its collaboration with regulators to make the technology more accessible.

Opening up

DJI Agriculture pointed to its latest annual Agricultural Drone Insight Report, published in August, which highlights a gradual opening up of regulation in Europe.

The EU Commission proposed an update to its Sustainable Use Directive in summer 2022, which will exempt some unmanned aerial vehicles from the 2009 law prohibiting aerial pesticide application.

This is because spraying drones - when used in conjunction with remote sensing technology to produce application maps - can be much more targeted and reduce overall pesticide use, which is a key goal for the EU's Green Deal and Farm to Fork strategy.

Furthermore, the European Aviation Standards Authority ecently softened requirements for risk assessments when using a drone for a specific purpose such as chemical application, including lifting a 25kg weight limit, as long as it is within a maximum dimension of 3m.

Individual member states including Italy and France have already granted licenses for spraying of vineyards and orchards where steep slopes restrict access for ground sprayers.

Germany is also granting permission for agricultural drone use below 50kg.

In Switzerland, Agroscope, the country's centre of excellence for agricultural research, has concluded that the environmental impact of using drones for spraying is similar to ground sprayers and has backed use of the technology.

Here in the UK, there is now a mechanism to get a permit for aerial spraying, with users able to submit application plans to the Health and Safety Executive for consideration.

The Health and Safety Executive is also leading a global partnership on how drones could be used to apply pesticides in the future.

This will help understand the risks to humans and the environment and adapt regulatory systems to better accommodate drone applications.

Positive outlook

All this paints a positive outlook for drone spraying operations in Europe, and DJI Agriculture's Zhong Wing tells Farmers Weekly that drones can complement existing spraying technology very well.

In the short term, this will mostly be on difficult terrain and for spot spraying applications, but she says efficiency of drones, in terms of hectares covered, can already compete with a medium-sized 18m boom sprayer.

With relatively short flight times on existing batteries, this would require multiple drones, batteries, a fast charger, and well-trained operators to achieve constant flight.

""On the other side is efficacy. A drone creates a downwash, which is something unique [to the technology] and makes better penetration [of the crop canopy].

""If you are spraying a crop with a thick canopy like potatoes, the downwash of the drone will push the droplets [to the target] better, so in some ways there is a possibility to replace ground sprayers in the future,"" she explains.

The government's failure to meaningfully address the climate and nature crises and support farmers risks the UK being unable to produce enough of its own food, according to a new report from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR).

The IPPR's study, Reaping the rewards: Cultivating a fair transition to farming (PDF), examines the effects of climate change and environmental pressures on farmers, along with the wider challenges faced by the farming community.

See also: Farming needs £4.4bn a year, not £3.5bn, say green lobby groups

For the study, the think tank convened community panels in Somerset, Cumbria and Kent, and asked: ""How should farming change to address the climate crisis and restore nature in a way that is fair to farmers, farmworkers and the public.""

The think tank analysed the responses and developed nine key guiding principles for a fair transition. These include: doing more to promote local food, connecting people with where their food comes from, raising interest in the industry, and offering more support for people who want to farm.

The report concludes that a ""significant shift"" is needed to ensure the UK's food security, with ""robust intervention"" by the government, including to support farmers in the transition to ensure the UK's food security and also meet net-zero targets.

The think tank's analysis says this must involve:

Lesley Rankin, co-author of the report and researcher at IPPR, said:""¯ ""The evidence is crystal clear: protecting our planet, boosting farmers' livelihoods and food security go hand-in-hand. Now it's on the government to act to put us on a path that provides a better life for us all."" 

A UK government spokesperson said: ""We are committed to backing our farmers so we can grow our economy, protect nature and deliver the food security that is needed.

""We have embarked on our next steps to deliver this, by committing to maintain the £2.4bn annual farming budget and investing in productivity and innovation on farms.

""Together this action will move us away from ineffective EU policies and instead support British farmers to take actions that help produce food sustainably.

""We have also always been clear that we will not compromise the UK's high food safety and animal welfare standards in trade negotiations so as to protect British farmers and native food production.""

UK trials of a novel irrigation system which collects, stores and recycles water, and reuses nutrients to enhance crop production, are taking place at Writtle University in Essex.

The Irrigation Solar Attenuation Harvest (Isah) system captures rainwater in underground tanks for irrigation or as a flood alleviation tool.

See also: Research targets pheromones to control key arable pests

Since its launch last year, it has been gaining interest in arid countries from Saudi Arabia to Malaysia and Botswana.

Visitors to the New Scientist Live event in London (7-9 October) were able to view a cross-section of a crop field kitted out with the system, and see how agri-tech sensors controlled the water movement as a live data stream showed fluctuating soil moisture levels.

How it works

A soil stabilisation material forms a hydrophobic underground storage base on which attenuation crates are stacked. Each crate has a 95% water storage capacity.

A membrane filter captures nutrients leached from the topsoil, and a simple irrigation pump resupplies these, along with water, to crops as required.

Using specialist remote sensors, operators can control the correct moisture level for crops – particularly in the horticultural industry – to optimise yields.

By capturing rainwater in attenuation tanks under crop fields, and using it for crop irrigation or releasing it slowly back into rivers, the risk of drought and flooding is reduced.

“We see the system working as part of a collaborative approach between farmers, landowners and government agencies,"" says founder of the UK system Kevin O'Grady.

Trial system

The Isah trial taking place at Writtle University covers a 10x5m area, with crates buried 0.5m deep in the ground under crops of open-field tomatoes and runner beans.

""For growers who irrigate their crops, just 10-15% of water applied is used by the crop – the remainder is left to drain through the groundwater supply, before returning to the water authorities. But with the attenuation system this water is collected for reuse,"" explains Kevin.

A system of 60 attenuation crates, stacked 400mm high, is capable of storing 11,500 litres of water and can withstand up to 62t/sq m of weight above. The system can be placed deeper in the ground - such as 1m - with sites as large as a football pitch.

Installing the system from scratch at Writtle University – including levelling off the site and implementing a cloud monitoring system – amounted to a total cost of £70,000. It has a predicted lifespan of 60 years.

Isah uses a stabilisation material called Envirocore that reacts with clay particles in the soil via a bio-geochemical process to create a solid, impermeable base.

The material is manufactured in Liverpool and has been used in the construction industry round the world for more than 40 years.

""Once the site is level, the topsoil placed to one side and Envirocore rotovated into the ground and compacted, it forms a long-term waterproof barrier which stores water,"" says Kevin.

Next steps

The firm is currently applying for UKRI funding in collaboration with Cardiff University for the development of a potential second UK attenuation storage system.

""The technology has come a long way from our launch last year and we are rapidly gaining interest in the UK and round the world.

“Water use efficiency is becoming a more and more important topic, and this tech could be game-changing in developing countries. It's important we continue to research and develop the system and capture data.""

Furthermore, says Kevin, the novel technology has potential for “3D” solar panel stacking.

""With the solid Envirocore base, solar panels can be bolted to the foundations to capture sunlight above the crops, while still allowing enough sunlight to power crop growth. The system could ultimately provide water storage, food production and energy capture,"" he says.

Companion cropping spring barley and red clover is our latest trial. We're sowing the barley in 10cm bands every 50cm, with red clover in between.

If it grows (it may be a big “if” given the recent snow), we will use our new machine, which mows only the clover rows.

This apparent madness is driven by a wish to investigate ways of producing decent crops while dramatically decreasing the spend on grass weed control and nitrogen fertiliser.

About the author

For some tips, I've just listened to a Base webinar from Frederik Larsen about growing lucerne and wheat together in Denmark.

Years ago we tried to grow a clover understory using white and micro varieties. However, we always ended up with too much clover and not enough crop or vice versa.

We also had trouble with clumps, so maybe stolons aren't right for this situation.

Amazingly, I completed my Basis project on wheat and clover bi-crops about 20 years ago.

During this time, there was a lot of research about that included information from a niche government department some may remember called MAFF.

Of course there is the possibility it may never have caught on for a reason. But maybe now it could help with carbon capture.

Perhaps stacking cover crop mixes and low-input, spring crop Countryside Stewardship options might help?

I made a schoolboy error on the final field of spring barley when adjusting its seed rate.

I used a normal calculator rather than one with an agricultural error coefficient built in, and consequently ran out of seed with a couple of runs around the outside to go.

I then had a double lesson in why it might not be best to always do everything as cheaply as possible when my local seed merchant, T Denne & Sons, was not only able to let me pick up one bag at very short notice, but also very kindly changed my small trailer tyre that had given up the ghost once loaded.

The UK imported 70% of its millet from Ukraine before the Russian invasion, and with all exports from the country halted, farmers could profit from more home-grown millet this season.

Limited supply has consequently pushed prices upwards to £425/t, creating new opportunities for domestic production.

As supplies from Ukraine remain dramatically affected and other export nations including France, Egypt and China run low, there is scope for the UK to more than double its area grown.

The UK typically requires 12,000t of millet annually, of which 3,000-4,000t is grown locally by 100-200 growers (depending on contract availability). The aim is to plant an additional 1,600ha of millet this spring.

Millet in the UK

Like maize, millet is a C4 combinable crop, which means its alternate photosynthetic pathway makes it suited to warmer and sunnier climates.

Millet is commonly grown for the birdseed market, and its gluten-free grain is desirable for human consumption. It is also grown as feedstock for anaerobic digestion plants.

The main variety of white millet grown in the UK is Mammoth, which is specifically bred for UK conditions.

It suits most soil types anywhere south of the Vale of York, as long as it is planted into warm seed-beds with a minimum temperature of 10C.

Soya UK is a major seed supplier of millet and its director David McNaughton says there is plenty of seed available.

The company offers full buy-back contracts, based on buyers-call and market value at the time of movement.

""Millet is traditionally worth about £100/t above the feed wheat price, but at £425 ex-farm, it is currently worth closer to £200 above feed wheat values,"" says Mr McNaughton.

It acts as a good break crop as it is relatively cheap and straightforward to grow, with good disease tolerance and no significant pest pressures.

It also offers effective blackgrass control, thanks to its late sowing window from late April to mid-May.

""Mammoth is earlier to mature than off-the-peg American or French varieties,"" Mr McNaughton says.

""It is ready for cutting in mid-September. It has good disease tolerance and is resistant to all known strains of smut. No fungicides are commonly used.""

The variety is competitive, taking just 130-135 days from planting to harvest, and grows to 1m in height. It requires 70-100kg N/ha. No pre-emergence herbicides are used - all weed control is post-emergence.

It also offers good standing ability.

Harvesting is relatively straightforward using a standard combine. However, desiccation with glyphosate is required at the end of August, ahead of a late September/early October harvest.

Millet grain is a similar size to rapeseed with a creamy-beige colour, with expected yields of 2-4t/ha. Crops are normally harvested at about 16% moisture and will require drying to 14% to meet market standards.

A significant proportion of its growth takes place between June and August, when temperatures are at their highest. Cold, exposed sites should, therefore, be avoided.

Case study: Andrew Bullock, Aston Farm, Gloucestershire

Andrew Bullock will grow the crop again this year © Andrew Bullock

Cotswolds mixed farmer Andrew Bullock was looking for an alternative break crop when he decided to grow Mammoth millet for the first time last year, and plans to grow the crop again this season.

Although oilseed rape is his predominant break crop, other options were not stacking up for him, so he decided to give millet a try at Aston Farm, near Bourton-on-the-Water.

""Peas and beans were not performing on our Cotswold brash heavy clay soils and resulted in weed burden, while linseed was difficult to combine and was affected by weevils,"" he says.

Mr Bullock direct-drilled the millet with a Horsch Avatar into a sprayed-off cover crop. With a sprinkling of rain before drilling in early May, the crop went into a good seed-bed.

However, without any significant rainfall over the next two months crops struggled to establish and yield was heavily restricted.

""The crop never really started growing until the end of June when the rain finally arrived,"" he explains.

""Poor establishment was purely weather dependent which restricted crop growth and yield.

""Due to such dry conditions, we achieved yields of 1t/ha but this was down to the season rather than the crop itself.""

A yield of 2.5t/ha would have been very economical, he says. ""We get a price agreed on a buy-back contract with Soya UK, with a minimum contract price of £400/t.

""Last year, we received a price of £425/t.

He says that apart from the spring drought there were no troubles growing it at all.

""With seed, fertiliser, herbicide and a spray of glyphosate as the only inputs, it's certainly a profitable break crop option.""

A total of 70kg of N was applied in a 50:50 split - the first down the spout at the time of drilling and the second once the tramlines were visible.

No fungicides or insecticides were applied, just a broadleaf weed herbicide.

Mr Bullock says: ""The late-drilling offers excellent cultural control for blackgrass, but this is the only control method as graminicides cannot be used as this would otherwise kill off the millet.

""A few patches of wild oats appeared but we went through with a weed surfer, as one of our other farms is organic, which successfully cleared it up.""

Harvest

When it came to harvest in early October, Mr Bullock says it was ""simply a doddle"".

""We sprayed the crop off with glyphosate, waited for it to dry and it cut so easily. We aimed to leave the crop to dry for about three weeks but due to the weather it was more like four.""

It was harvested on a sunny afternoon at the beginning of October at 18-19% moisture and was dried down to 14% in the grain dryer.

The straw was chopped and wheat was direct drilled into the clean seed-bed with no volunteers or weeds. The only drawback was lower residual N levels as the crop is not a legume, Mr Bullock says.

""We're giving millet another go this year and, hopefully, we get better weather this spring to get the crop up and away. If successful, we will increase the area of the break crop grown on farm.""

403,"How two dairy farms achieved a better work-life balance","https://www.fwi.co.uk/livestock/dairy/how-two-dairy-farms-achieved-a-better-work-life-balance","How two dairy farms achieved a better work-life balance

Work-life balance will mean something different to everybody. There are some who will scoff at the term while, for others, it is a key part of business management.

With the ongoing challenge to secure and retain good labour in the dairy sector, it is an area some farms have been looking at - for employees and themselves.

Becki Leach, head of people at Kite Consulting, says the main stumbling block for many farmers is the cost and complexity it can add to the system.

See also: How 10 in 7 milking helped work-life balance and cow health

It usually means employing more staff to allow for different shift patterns and reduced working hours, which increases overheads, and looking again at rotas, which requires management.

It can also mean simplifying systems so protocols are easy to follow for larger teams. Therefore, farmers will only make it work if it is a core objective of their business.

Effect of poor work-life balance

Ms Leach says it is worth considering the effect of a poor work-life balance on productivity because the cost of poor labour is not just in the wages bill - technical mistakes have a cash cost to the business, too.

""If you look at your typical dairy shift pattern of 55-60 hours a week, it's very hard to be productive for that level of time for 48 weeks a year, if we're giving them 28 days' leave.""

When it comes to the farm owner, improving work-life balance may mean recruiting more senior staff and delegating responsibilities to them.

We look at two farms that have effectively integrated flexibility into their working patterns.

Case study: Flexible shift patterns - Dourie Farming Company

Rory Christie © Judith Armstrong

Farm facts

At Dourie Farm, the Christie family offers staff flexible shift patterns to improve employees' work-life balance and attract strong candidates to their roles.

""There is no doubt that the industry needs a better work-life balance.

""I often live in a constant state of anxiety due to the pressure of being a dairy farmer, and having great difficulty finding good labour increases that,"" says Rory Christie, who runs the farming business alongside his brother, Gregor.

When recruiting, they offer a potential pattern of four days on, four days off, or even an ""oil rig-style"" eight days on and eight days off.

However, it can be challenging to find the right people to make this work because they need to be able to learn the job between extended periods off rota.

It is also not for everyone because making income stack up for employees can be challenging in non-salaried roles.

""What we are currently finding is that most people enjoy is a 10-four rota, which is four days off within 10,"" says Mr Christie.

""There are not many folk that'll work 12 days on, two days off, nowadays. The truth is you have to be flexible - interview them and find out what they want and need.""

The expectation when working six days in 10 is that an employee would generally do 40 hours a week.

Top tip: Consider different shift patterns to suit different employees. Crucial to making this work is having well-organised rotas.

""Hours will stretch for six weeks in February-March when we are calving, but 48 hours is enough. The working time regulations were made for good reason,"" Mr Christie says.

He does not pretend management is simple - rotas can be complex, with the equivalent of 13 full-time staff on varying shift patterns, especially to manage continuum.

""It requires organisational management skills, which we have got - we have an extremely able ex-navy farm manager.""

The other thing Mr Christie does to improve work-life balance is help all his team find good homes to live in and integrate socially, introducing them to clubs such as rugby or Young Farmers, so they can enjoy time off-farm.

""I don't want people just to work here, I want them to live here - their happiness is important to us,"" he says.

Top tip: Help younger staff make the most of their time off by having a plan for pastoral care, which includes social opportunities in the local area.

Case study: Changing the farming system - Hollings Hill Farm

Farm facts

Austin and Faye Knowles have ""worked every hour of every day"" for decades and are now adjusting their system to relieve pressure and free up time to spend with family.

""We are trying to get a better work-life balance. We are not there yet, but we are not giving up on achieving it,"" says Mr Knowles.

The first change at Hollings Hill Farm, spurred on by staff loss and a large TB outbreak, was dropping milking from three times to two times a day and reducing cow numbers.

However, each milking now takes longer and, while the rush for lunchtime milking has gone, the system has elongated the day.

Top tip: Get a good herdsperson to take pressure off the business owners.

Therefore, the Knowleses have to decide between putting in a larger parlour to decrease milking times, which would mean increasing the herd size to service the debt, or reducing herd size even further.

Cutting cow numbers will allow the couple to spend more time with their four children, and create a business wit a range of options that is attractive for the next generation, rather than being restricted by scale and debt.

""The challenge now is profitability, but at what point is profit more important than work-life balance?"" says Mr Knowles. ""There's got to be a balance.""

Five months ago, they employed a full-time herdsperson, which has given them more time off farm.

They also use professional advice to improve staff management, and this has included personality profiling across the team.

All the people on the farm have got to buy into what you are trying to achieve. Mutual respect is key - if everyone gets on, we can teach the technical skills,"" says Mr Knowles.

Top tip: Only retain staff who fit with the farm system. Employees need to be team players first and foremost and support the farm's goals.

Farm facts

William de Feyter, who farms with his wife and business partner, Sarah, studied farm business management at Harper Adams University and set up in pigs in 2014.

He cut his teeth on an 850-place, wean-to-finish indoor unit, but had to give it up when the farmyard was developed for tourism.

Losing that unit kick-started a new venture using 35 second-hand tents on 4ha (10 acres) of grass rented from his parents.

He signed a five-year contract-rearing agreement with BQP, which enabled him to attract start-up capital. He is on course to hit a budgeted three-year payback.

William also took on a set of buildings to finish 160 small pigs from the tents, and runs a 450-place indoor nursery unit.

System

He provides accommodation, straw and labour, while BQP supplies the pigs, feed and veterinary and technical support.

He receives a monthly flat rate for each pig place, plus bonuses for good feed conversion ratios (FCR) and low mortality.

When weaners arrive, they have already been introduced to a creep starter.

He continues feeding this for a week before moving them onto weaner pellets. For the final week before they move on to BQP's finishing units, pigs switch to grower pellets.

The tents accommodate 4,200 pigs from five weeks old to store weight. Made by John Harvey Engineering, the tents were 10 years old when William bought them.

He reckons they could last another 15 years. ""You can easily replace a canvas or a bent pole, and it's not silly money,"" he says.

Tents are dragged onto new ground after each batch of pigs. After three years, the site rotates to a fresh field.

Straw-for-muck arrangements are in place with three farms, all within five miles. Each batch produces 600-700t of muck and uses 300-350 round bales plus 70-90 square ones.

Health and welfare

Bedding and feeding are done twice weekly by William or his part-time, self-employed pigman, John Bell.

All pigs are checked twice a day. BQP vets draw up a herd health plan and visit quarterly - or more frequently if a health issue arises.

The tents are served by two water lines, each fitted with a Select Doser system, so medication can be directed at specific tents, rather than giving blanket treatment.

This allows for more responsible use of antibiotics, says William. When not medicating, the water is run with a broad-spectrum biocide to ensure it is free of biofilm and bacteria.

William gets daily water consumption updates via his mobile phone. Any significant change in intake alerts him to consult his vet before a health issue arises.

He has moved entirely to intradermal vaccination. ""There are no bent needles and it's clean, easy and quick,"" he says.

Wider view

William is a director of the Aylsham Agricultural Show Association and an assistant head steward at the Royal Norfolk Show.

""It's a great way of giving something back to the local community and keeps me on my toes dealing with businesses outside the farm environment,"" he says.

He is also happy to show anyone around the unit. ""I have nothing to hide,"" he adds.

Tents have proved to be a low-cost way of expanding and William's aim is to extend the current site and, in the long term, set up a second site.

He would also like to do a Nuffield scholarship to increase his knowledge of the straw-based pig industry. 

What the judges say

Green Farm Livestock is a young business led with enthusiasm, entrepreneurial flair and determination to succeed, along with a willingness to take advice and adopt technologies to help protect pig health.

Farm facts

Guy King's love for pigs began when he took a Saturday job on a farm with 100 sows. Prior to that, he had no farming knowledge or experience.

He studied at the local agricultural college and worked on various units before branching out into engineering and building. By the time he returned to the pig industry, he had learned that ""time is money"".

He set up GSK Pigs in 2005 and now has nine outdoor breeding units run as part of arable rotations on rented land across Norfolk and Suffolk.

System

Every unit is a closed herd and operates independently with its own staff and machinery.

Each has a dedicated area for gilts selected as replacements to grow on, a service radial with a central tent for artificial insemination, dry sow radials, individual farrowing paddocks, and a vaccination pod.

For seven of the units, pig farming operation BQP supplies pigs, feed and veterinary support, while GSK Pigs provides the land, staff, machinery and equipment.

These units have been repopulated with high-health-status stock during the past 18 months.

At the same time, the herds have been switched over to five-week weaning, two-week batching operations. Pigs from these units move to BQP grower units.

In addition, Greenlane Organics is a 400-sow farrow-to-finish setup at Sandringham, run on behalf of the Organic Pig Company, while Bruntona Rare Breeds is the newest venture.

This 200-sow unit also takes pigs to finishing weight; it supplies high-end restaurants and hotels.

Guy is committed to establishing and maintaining green cover on all sites to protect water quality and soil structure.

He has found using a mix of timothy, cocksfoot, fescues and clover produces a resilient and tufty sward that has deep roots.

""It's a nicer environment for the staff now too, and wear and tear on machinery is less of an issue,"" he says.

Health and welfare

Guy prefers to take on staff with no previous pig experience and train them. ""Without good staff, I wouldn't be sane - or where I am today,"" he says.

""All pigs are checked daily, and each unit has a dedicated team who know the farm, the pigs, the equipment and the best way to get a job done.""

He has appointed one of his staff, Jason Hindle, as fieldsman to help with the day-to-day running of the units. Part of his role is to make full use of the PigVision management software recently introduced.

This system is linked to ear tags fitted to each sow and will enable data to be called up instantly to inform decisions about performance, feed use and piglet health.

Each unit has a dedicated vet who completes a quarterly health plan with actions that form a working document for the staff.

Wider view

Guy's aim is to continue growing the business and embracing new ideas and techniques, always with the environment in mind.

Pig shades are being trialled this year and will be rolled out across the units in 2024.

And a tented finishing system is being introduced at Greenlane Organics with the aim of improving daily liveweight gain and reducing days to slaughter.

Guy is also developing an in-house staff training facility with guidance from Andrew Palmer, AHDB knowledge exchange relationship manager for the pork sector.

""If you keep doing what's best for the pig, then the pig does right for you,"" he says. 

What the judges say

GSK Pigs comprises nine outdoor breeding units with a strong focus on high welfare and environmental standards and close monitoring to ensure healthy pigs perform consistently across the board.

Brandy Wharf Piggery, South Kelsey, Lincolnshire

Farm facts

Dogged determination to succeed as a pig farmer has got Frank Tobin where he is today, with a 500-sow, indoor breeder-finisher unit on a purpose-built site in north Lincolnshire.

Initially, Frank - who also leads a York-based veterinary practice specialising in pigs - was a shareholder in an outdoor pig organisation.

When that got into difficulty, he bought the indoor pigs from that outfit and set up on his own. He then took on a finishing unit, but the buildings were of poor quality and the venture was ""a disaster"".

Undeterred, he bought 1.2ha of arable land at Brandy Wharf, where he built two finishing sheds and a feed mill in 2011. Four years later, he added farrowing and dry sow accommodation, and moved his pigs there.

System

The unit at Brandy Wharf was built for 600 sows weaning 12 pigs a litter.

However, since introducing Danish genetic stock four years ago (chosen for prolificacy and growth rates) and using a careful process of staged fostering, final litter size has risen to 15 pigs.

To accommodate the increased productivity, herd size has been dropped to 500 sows. ""The advantage for us is fewer sows, and we're still weaning a decent pig,"" says Frank.

The whole unit is slatted and slurry-based. This suits the wet-feeding system Frank chose, making use of a wide range of crop co-products including liquid potato, whey, yeast and distillers' grain.

""When I set up the unit, there was a saving on each of these liquids,"" he says. ""It isn't what it was, and energy costs are higher, but there is definitely still a saving.""

The biggest economy, however, comes from milling all feed on site. Wheat and barley are bought from, and stored at, local farms.

Soya is also used, but by including co-products such as yeast, less is needed, saving cost and lowering the unit's carbon footprint.

Feed is made fresh each day. Rather than pre-mixing all the dry ingredients, they are kept separate so any adjustments to rations can be implemented quickly.

After weaning, pigs are fed two creep diets - also milled on farm - before moving onto a weaner diet.

All finished pigs have left the unit 20 weeks after weaning, at 95kg deadweight, with the biggest pigs pulled out three to four weeks early.

Health and welfare

High standards of biosecurity are maintained to minimise disease risk.

Although Frank is himself a specialist pig vet, he recognises the value of an outside eye and takes regular advice on pig health, welfare and nutrition.

Heated mats keep piglets warm in the farrowing rooms, while a misting system cools sows, second-stage weaners and finishers on hot summer days.

Frank's confidence in his team of four staff is clear: he spends just one a day a week at the unit.

""We've got a stable staff structure, and they're a good bunch of lads,"" he says, adding that they have PigVision software to aid herd management.

Wider view

Frank collaborates with a neighbouring farmer, whose land surrounds the pig unit, to manage slurry, which is pumped underground and accessed via hydrants for spreading using an umbilical system.

He also sits on Sainsbury's pig production group, which has a particular focus on finding ways to improve sustainability and lower the carbon footprint of pig production.

Attempts to get planning permission to extend the site at Brandy Wharf have so far failed, but Frank did set up another 600-sow pig unit north of York last year. 

What the judges say

Brandy Wharf has been built with pigs and staff in mind and is managed efficiently as a result. Productivity is high, while milling feed on site and using liquid by-products keep costs down.

405,"Why you should stop blanket cattle worming and how to do it","https://www.fwi.co.uk/livestock/health-welfare/why-you-should-stop-blanket-cattle-worming-and-how-to-do-it","Why you should stop blanket cattle worming and how to do it

Many cattle farmers are still taking a blanket approach to using wormers, which could render them useless while damaging the fragile ecosystem that makes livestock farming viable.

This is the finding of vet and Nuffield scholar Rob Howe of LLM Farm Vets. He carried out a farm study that showed most farmers used wormers prophylactically or in ""a blanket fashion"".

Many were also using long-acting, seasonal control options, such as boluses. Most had been adhering to the same strategy for more than a decade.

See also: How a Cheshire dairy is calving heifers at 23 months

The study, which is ongoing, started in 2018 and, to date, about 30 cattle farms in Lancashire have enrolled.

This common approach to wormer use not only costs more but potentially reduces animal resilience, as cattle are less able to build natural immunity.

It also increases the likelihood of wormer resistance, particularly to Group 3 Ivermectin anthelmintics.

Impact on dung beetles

Overuse of wormers is also affecting soil and dung pat biology. Rob says dung beetles, which are essential to pasture health and productivity, are feeling the impact.

He says: ""Ivermectin passes through the cow virtually unchanged.

""Once in the dung, there's a lot of scientific evidence that shows it can kill or reduce the reproductive success of our critically important dung beetle populations, as well as other dung decomposers.""

© The Dung Beetle Trust

Rob, who is a board member of the British Cattle Veterinary Association, believes a non-chemical approach, focusing on responsible use of wormers in a similar fashion to antibiotics use, is needed.

""The good news is there's so much low-hanging fruit in this area compared with antibiotics,"" he says.

""We found a 90% reduction [in wormer use] is achievable."" In fact, most farmers in the trial managed to remove the need for wormers during the grazing season.

Integrated plan

Rob suggests farmers work with their vet or Registered Animal Medicines Advisor to create a farm-specific, integrated parasite management plan. This focuses on the following areas:

1. Vaccination for lungworm

Speak to your vet about whether lungworm vaccination is appropriate for your farm.

This can be the foundation for removing the need for chemical control, because unlike gut worm, lungworm is not easy to monitor or predict using muck tests and can be deadly.

2. Monthly faecal egg samples

Take pooled faecal egg count (FEC) samples from each grazing group and field, every month, starting three or four weeks after turnout.

This allows you to establish the gut worm burden in youngstock and get an idea of pasture burdens, so fields can be managed accordingly. For example, if FECs are high in one field, avoid grazing first-season calves in that area.

Pooled samples are an average and will mask high readings, so it may be necessary to individually sample animals that show signs of infection.

3. Targeted treatment decisions

The Control of Worms Sustainably (Cows) group advises against treating every animal in a group, as this encourages wormer resistance.

Instead, treatments can be targeted based on FECs or animal performance. For example, when a group has a high FEC, treatments can be targeted towards those animals below a target daily liveweight gain.

Stockmanship observations (for example, dirty rear ends) should always be used.

4. Pasture management

Case study: Neil Kidd, Booth Hall, Lancaster

Farm Facts: Booth Hall, Lancaster

Wormers are a thing of the past at Booth Hall near Lancaster, where an alternative vaccination and monitoring strategy has resulted in improved cattle growth rates, money savings and reduced stress.

About four years ago, the Kidd family routinely applied pour-on wormers every month when youngstock were turned out.

Neil Kidd says discussions with vet Rob Howe of LLM highlighted the potential to overhaul parasite management and only worm if and when necessary.

Vaccinating for lungworm would also boost cattle's immunity and reduce potential growth checks from exposure.

Routine worming was replaced with monthly faecal egg counts (FECs) at pasture to establish the worm burden and the need to treat.

Neil admits to being ""shocked"" that worm counts have been consistently low enough not to warrant any treatment, with results commonly finding no eggs in a sample.

Lungworm vaccine

He now only vaccinates for lungworm. ""We've turned it completely on its head, and don't use the pour-ons at all. We've seen improvements in growth, especially in younger cattle,"" he says.

This has been reflected in a three- to four-month reduction in age at first calving, to 22-23 months. Neil says this has been a bigger financial benefit than the saving in wormer costs.

Faecal samples can also be taken when stock are routinely checked. This is less hassle than gathering cattle for treatment, he says.

Pasture is no longer grazed by sheep, meaning cattle graze higher swards, which lowers fluke contamination risk.

The milking cows are also not treated for fluke, which removes milk withdrawal concerns.

Neil says the new approach has been hugely beneficial. ""It's definitely a lot better: less stressful, better growth rates and more money in our pockets at the end of the day.""

Grazing strategy and pests, parasites and dung beetles

Dr Bryony Sands © Amanda Sands

Rotational grazing has a similar impact on worm egg counts as using anthelmintics, without negatively affecting beneficial pasture insects, according to new research.

Dr Bryony Sands, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Vermont, looked at the impact of grazing strategy on worm egg counts and the pasture ecosystem on 30 dairy farms in the US states of Vermont and New York.

Farms set-stocked, with or without anthelmintics, or rotationally grazed, with or without anthelmintics.

""Rotational grazing reduced worm egg counts down to a level comparable to the farms that were using veterinary parasiticide treatments,"" Bryony explains.

When the Williams family ventured into venison production, a chief consideration was how it would integrate into their existing beef and sheep enterprises.

It meant reducing the sheep flock by 200 ewes to create a dedicated 26ha (64-acre) grazing area for the deer, but with a higher-value product, the economics favoured venison.

Three years on, and the Williamses say the new enterprise is helping them to make the best use of farm and labour resources as the key production stages in the three systems complement each other.

See also: How a Cornish farm set up on-farm deer processing facilities

Planning for the future

The principal reason for the new venture was to create a business model that would generate sufficient income for two families, as farmers Keith and Ali Williams were joined by their daughter, Becca, at Hendy, a 160ha (400-acre) upland farm at Hundred House, Llandrindod Wells.

The major reasons why they considered deer were the low labour requirements and minimal handling and birthing problems.

""We felt deer would reduce our exposure to the sheep market and would fit well around the busier times of beef and sheep farming,"" explains Mr Williams.

After a great deal of research, which included visiting established commercial deer farms, they took the plunge in 2019.

They invested £100,000 in fencing and handling facilities and bought 80 young hinds and two stags from UK deer farms.

They run these as two herds, with one stag to 40 hinds. The stags cost £2,000 a head compared with an average of £250 for the hind calves, but they have an estimated working life expectancy of 10 years.

Changing mindset and farm infrastructure

The family quickly realised that farming deer needed a different mindset to how they ran their sheep and cattle.

""It was about changing our mentality as much as anything else,"" admits Miss Williams.

""For example, we will work a dog behind the sheep when we are moving them, but you can't do that with deer.

""The deer will also always run along the fence line when you try to move them. It's all those things we had to get used to,"" she adds.

Deer also require much greater containment than beef and sheep. Fencing needs to be at least 2m high and well maintained - a reason why the setup cost of £10/m for full-height deer fencing in 2019 was so high.

""If a deer escapes, it is unlikely that you will see it again, so you have to be absolutely certain they can't get out,"" Mr Williams points out.

Gates were positioned in corners, where possible, to create a funnel, making it easier for the deer to see them.

For handling, a drop-floor crush specific to deer was purchased. The crush has tapered sides and the floor is released after a deer walks into the crush, allowing it to be held securely by the sloped sides.

Management

Fencing and handling aside, in nearly every other management aspect deer are easier to farm than sheep or cattle, Miss Williams says.

This is largely a consequence of the farmed animal being just a few generations removed from the wild so, for example, any issues with breeding have been dealt with through natural selection.

The hinds calve at grass in June and July. Calves stay with their mothers until weaning at five to six months old, after the rutting season, and they are housed in a cattle shed fitted with netting.

Enrichments, including yoga balls, have been introduced to deter bullying.

""It distracts them – if they get grumpy, they take that aggression out on the balls instead of each other,'' she explains.

Silage is fed in troughs during housing - ideally at 10.5MJ/kg metabolisable energy - alongside 0.25kg a head a day of concentrates.

Hinds and stags are outwintered on hay and fed a minimal concentrate to help with management.

""They get to know what a bag means so it helps when we need to round them up,"" says Mr Williams.

Youngstock are turned out to grass at the beginning of April, just before the ewes are housed for lambing.

In their first calving season, a pregnancy rate of 50% is expected. This was the case in both herds at Hendy, but at the second calving, this increased to 90% in one herd and 75% in the other.

Health

Deer have very few health issues - they do not suffer from foot-rot, fly strike or mastitis.

Although the family have had no cases, deer can suffer from cryptosporidium, which can build up on the ground during calving.

The only health interventions are a copper bolus administered once a year before breeding, alongside worming, if required, and a flukicide when the calves are weaned in December.

The biggest health concern is bovine TB - Hendy is in a high-risk area and although there is not a requirement for the deer to be tested, that would change if there was a disease breakdown in the suckler herd.

De-antlering needs to be done once a year, in the late summer or early autumn, when the velvet, or furry skin, that covers them has rubbed off.

Sales and payback

There are now 63 animals destined for slaughter in September and October 2023.

They will be sold to Dovecote Park to supply Waitrose.

The Williamses had hoped to sell some of the meat direct to add value over and above the £6/kg deadweight they are paid by their processor, but this would mean hiring the abattoir purposely for that.

""The regulations don't allow for deer to be slaughtered in the same kill as other livestock, so we would have to hire out the entire slaughterhouse and pay for a vet to be present - it just wouldn't be financially viable for two or three deer,"" says Mr Williams.

But with a strong market price, he calculates that the initial investment will have a seven-year payback.

At 80 hinds, numbers are at a level that sits well with the other enterprises at Hendy. To expand numbers, additional suitable land would be required.

""The 64 acres [25ha] where the deer are now works well because it doesn't involve any rights of way, [whereas] our other land does and that wouldn't work with deer,'' says Mr Williams.

Catesby Estates

Your land is an important asset.

 It is never too early to start thinking about whether your land has development potential and putting together a land promotion strategy for your land. 

 The uplift in land value between agricultural land and land with planning permission can be significant. However, obtaining planning permission for a site can be extremely expensive and time consuming, with no guarantee of success.

 Catesby Estates take on the finance and risk of promoting your site through the planning system so as a landowner you don't have to.

412,"How farmers face huge disruption from electricity infrastructure","https://www.fwi.co.uk/business/how-farmers-face-huge-disruption-from-electricity-infrastructure","How farmers face huge disruption from electricity infrastructure

The government is looking at ways to speed up the construction of a new electricity transmission network to meet demand in urban areas and its net-zero targets. Farmers Weekly asks how farmers will be affected.

Pylons have blighted the treasured British countryside for years, and there could soon be a proliferation in the network of these skeletal giants.

There are currently almost 22,000 pylons on the transmission network in England and Wales, but National Grid has outlined plans to install hundreds of miles of new pylons and overhead cables.

The energy company says five times more power lines need to be built over the next seven years, by 2030, than in the past 32 years to harness energy from renewables.

See also: A guide to reclaiming professional fees paid by farmers

Earlier this year, National Grid launched its Great Grid Upgrade initiative, the largest overhaul of the electricity grid in generations, which will initially involve nine major onshore projects worth a combined total of £4.5bn.

It says its upgrade is ""urgently needed"" to connect new green energy to the grid, to ensure homes and businesses across the country can benefit from more affordable, clean electricity and meet government's net-zero targets.

The government has set a target to fully decarbonise the electricity grid by 2035 when all electricity should be provided by clean energy sources. This includes wind and solar and new nuclear power stations, subject to supply. 

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has pledged ""100% clean energy by 2030"".

Independent report

The UK's Electricity Networks Commissioner, Nick Winser, an independent adviser to government, published a detailed report in August on speeding up the energy transmission infrastructure.

Mr Winser's report included recommendations to halve the time to construct new powerlines to seven years and streamline the planning process for electricity transmission infrastructure, such as pylons and substations.

The report recommends the construction of overhead lines to transmit electricity, arguing that underground cables are too expensive and have an environmental impact.

But many farmers would prefer to have cables underground, rather than overhead, and tolerate the disruption from undergrounding for two to three years, rather than have the permanent disruption from a big 400kV pylon.

Mr Winser's report recommends lump sum payments for individual households which are close to new lines and a community fund. 

The NFU is seeking clarification on how the lump-sum payments would be calculated and whether the community fund will also be dispersed to the farming community in areas where they will be primary hosts for these new transmission lines.

""Farmers must be fully compensated for the disturbance pylons cause on a daily basis to their agricultural operations,"" Louise Staples, the NFU's senior rural surveyor, tells Farmers Weekly.

The NFU wants to see an offshore transmission network built as soon as possible to connect renewable energy from offshore wind farms and brought onto land where that energy is needed.

Norwich to Tilbury line

Currently, National Grid Electricity Transmission (NGET) is proposing to build a 114-mile overhead line from Norwich to Tilbury which would see hundreds of big pylons constructed on farms.

The NFU says the building of an offshore transmission network would avoid the need for such a long length of overhead lines and pylons on farms.

It is lobbying NGET and government to consider the undergrounding of cables as part of the transmission network.

A further 400kV overhead electricity transmission powerline is being proposed from North Humber to High Marnham. Several more similar schemes will be brought forward by NGET in the near future.

""An offshore transmission network would reduce the proposed length of overhead line, as in the Norwich to Tilbury scheme, and the amount of underground cables that are also being brought on to farms from the offshore wind farms that are being built by multiple developers out at sea,"" says Ms Staples.

The NFU says NGET must properly consult and negotiate with farmers and landowners to reach agreement on hosting infrastructure, instead of using their compulsory purchase powers.

Energy regulator Ofgem says it is working with the government and electricity transmission operators to engage with businesses and consumers to ""understand how they will be impacted, and to find fair ways to address this"".

But, ultimately, it says the legal rights to compensation are determined by the government, specifically the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ).

Farmers may also be entitled to additional compensation for losses incurred in a number of other areas - for example, crop losses, disturbance costs, the costs of any reinstatement work to repair drains, land or soil, and loss of development value.

A spokesperson for National Grid says: ""We are committed to working closely, fairly, and consistently with farmers and landowners across all our projects to reduce the impact of construction on their land. 

""Proposals put forward to planning authorities always consider this, along with biodiversity and impact on the landscape.""

Projects in Wales

Meanwhile, in Wales, Bute Energy is looking to build further wind farms and connect them with a smaller 132kV line from the Radnor Forest in Powys, mid-Wales, to Carmarthenshire, in a project which has been named the ""Green GEN Towy Usk power line"".

The project has sparked a backlash from farmers who are requesting for the line to be built underground.

Views are now being sought over a second Bute Energy power line project, called the ""Green GEN Vyrnwy Frankton connection"", which proposes to connect a new wind farm near Powys to the National Grid via Lower Frankton, Shropshire.

Case study: Farmer warns Norfolk to Tilbury power line will ""˜trash the countryside'

A farmer affected by National Grid's plans to build a 114-mile overhead line from Norwich to Tilbury fears the project will trash the countryside and seriously disrupt his farming activities.

John Rayner, owner of Upp Hall Farm in Great Tey, Essex, has been told by National Grid that pylons need to be built across his 215ha mixed farming enterprise.

The land is known locally as ""God's own acre"" by virtue of its high quality, loamy clay soil and the ideal microclimate for farming.

Mr Rayner, 72, says the farm also has miles of hedgerows, trees and woods, some of which face destruction to make way for the construction of pylons and overhead power lines.

Fisher German is acting on behalf of National Grid, and Mr Rayner says they are struggling to provide answers on the correct levels of compensation and details of construction methods.

""I have hundreds of metres of mature hedges full of berries and wildlife and they want to remove lots of it to build their pylons,"" he says.

""Our beautiful countryside is getting trashed to benefit foreign investors who own National Grid, but have nothing to do with this country.""

Fisher German has indicated there will be a one-off payment per pylon and per length of the wires.

But Mr Rayner says it falls way short of his expectations and needs to be renegotiated with today's farming economics in mind. ""How on earth can I be properly compensated for this loss?"" he asks.

In July, former home secretary Priti Patel, Conservative MP for Witham, and Sir Bernard Jenkin, Conservative MP for Harwich and North Essex, joined local campaigners for a farm walk at Mr Rayner's farm.

Both MPs have voiced opposition against National Grid's plans and have urged their own government to develop the offshore grid instead.

Farming unions

Renewable projects must work for everyone, says FUW

Farmers' Union of Wales (FUW) president Ian Rickman's farm comes within three miles of Bute Energy's proposal to connect a 60-mile power line from mid-Wales through the Towy Valley, connecting to the grid in Carmarthenshire.

Mr Rickman's beef and sheep farm will not be directly affected by the plans, but many neighbouring farms will be.

""It is a hugely controversial issue, especially in the Towy Valley. As a union, we maintain a neutral stance on renewable energy production in Wales,"" he says.

""We realise there needs to be more infrastructure to supply that electricity throughout the UK. But similar to our policy on trees, we'd like to see the right renewable energy in the right place.""

For example, FUW would like to see more investment in smaller on-farm renewable projects, such as solar panels on the rooftops of farm buildings.

FUW senior policy and communications officer Gareth Parry adds: ""Large projects which have an impact on farmers and landowners must work for all.

""This could include cheaper electricity for local residents, the use of underground cabling where practical and/or providing fair compensation to those affected.""

Farmers must be fully compensated for hosting infrastructure, says NFU

Farmers Weekly understands that National Grid will be seeking to pay affected farmers an easement payment (a one-off compensation payment) for the interference of the electricity infrastructure scheme, instead of an annual wayleave payment.

Currently, farmers are paid annual wayleave payments to compensate for poles and pylons on their land.

The NFU says the whole package needs to be reconsidered to ensure that farmers are fully compensated for the interference of all the transmission lines which are needed to transmit electricity to populated urban areas and meet the government's new net zero targets.

Pressures on farming businesses have been mounting this year as Basic Payment Scheme reductions continue and both market volatility and interest rates remain high.

So what can be done to improve business resilience and reduce the financial risks? We look at the current advice.

See also: How agriculture policies affect our Arable Insights farmers

After the bumper year of 2022, today's lower commodity prices have resulted in farms feeling the squeeze and investment plans being revisited.

The government's shifting stance on its net-zero agenda and the stop-start nature of policy development have added uncertainty.

At the same time, the supply chain's indifference to elevated costs of production is putting additional strain on farm finances and cash management, as well as the ability to plan for a sustainable future.

Profits need to be made while navigating the changing climate, continuing biodiversity collapse and a cost-of-living crisis, without the safety net of the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS), agree commentators.

""Everyone needs to change,"" says Strutt & Parker's head of farming Jonty Armitage. ""That may mean farming in a different way and taking a new approach to risk or working with others, to name just a few options.""

Current support

While Defra's recent commitment to making accelerated payments to those who enter Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) 2023 has been welcomed, the controlled rollout of the scheme means it is unlikely that most applicants will be able to join in time to benefit this year.

An advance payment of 25% in the first month of the agreement - rather than at the end of three months - is the latest government offer.

Given that 10,000 farmers have expressed interest in SFI 2023, the online application process will need to work well.

Defra has also announced three other new support packages, a £4m fund for small abattoirs, a share of £15m for installing rooftop solar equipment and a further £15m for automation and robotics, all aimed to help farming remain competitive.

Bank advice

Amid growing cashflow challenges, the advice to farmers is to remain calm.

While solutions to cashflow issues are unique to individual situations, they typically fall into two scenarios, says Oxbury Bank's chief risk officer, Robin Hill.

""Usually, it's either increased working capital facilities to help through a specific situation or proactive management of the current debt to ensure that the actual repayment is in line with the ability to pay.""

That may include payment holidays or an interest-only period, he suggests.

Fixed costs, such as hire purchase, rent, labour and interest charges can be harder to vary - with the latter causing unexpected increases, most of which weren't budgeted for.

""Speak to your bank if the repayment of the debt is not manageable within existing cash facilities,"" Robin advises. ""That applies to land rents too - talk to your landlord about deferral or a temporary reduction.""

Ian Webb, Lloyds Bank area director for agriculture in the south and east of England, agrees that communication is key.

""Engage with your bank at the earliest opportunity. While some of the pressures that farms are under have eased a bit, we recognise that there are ongoing challenges with debt profiles.""

A wide range of finance options are available to farms, he reveals.

""It's usually best to keep the overdraft facility for managing the seasonality of the business and then look at other options for specific projects.""

Finance options

Asset finance is the obvious fit for new machinery and equipment, which has a shorter term repayment window, while longer term loans - for up to 25 years - should be used for business growth, he suggests.

This may include land purchase or a renewables project, such as solar or wind, or a development that helps to secure the farm's capability and add in resilience, as well as meet the green agenda.

""A reservoir is a good example. Winter water storage means the business is less reliant on rainfall during the growing season, says Ian.

It is also used for diversification projects - most of which are in tourism, renewables or property, he reveals. These may involve bringing in other professionals, such as accountants and solicitors, especially where lease arrangements are made.

""Despite the current climate, there are plenty of farmers wanting to take their businesses forward and who have identified what they need to do,"" says Ian.

He adds that it's important that the length of the loan fits the investment requirement, which is why banks need to understand what the cashflow will look like and will require a detailed financial forecast with some sensitivity included.

""That helps us to agree on the timescales - should the loan be for 10 years or for longer, for example?

""If you have a vision for the medium term, then you need to look at the best way of funding that. Banks can help if they are given the right information and are involved at an early stage.""

Managing the constant state of flux - some pointers

Managing risk

For Jonty, the loss of BPS means that many farms will inevitably have to take on more risk, so that they can reduce their costs.

""With machinery, for example, that may mean having fewer, smaller options at your disposal,"" he says. ""While that leaves you exposed in the year that brings exceptional weather or unusual circumstances, those don't happen very often.""

Most farms are over-resourced when it comes to machinery, he adds.

""Making better use of kit, especially the bigger and more expensive machines, is an obvious move. With their higher work rates, they can lend themselves to a number of sharing opportunities.""

These can be simple agreements, with costs being split between the parties on a per hectare basis, or they may evolve over time and become contract farming agreements (CFAs).

""The choice between the two comes down to attitude to risk,"" he continues. ""One is about machinery sharing and the other is about spreading costs - but they both result in machinery being used over a bigger area. In a CFA, only one party carries the risk of machinery ownership.""

While CFAs remain popular, there are situations where some are being converted into Farm Business Tenancies, says Jonty.

""As the risk in farming increases, some landowners prefer to take a fixed rental payment than a share of the profits. Profitability has always been uncertain in farming, even with the safety net of the BPS.""

Case study: Transition farmer Matthew Williams

Matthew Williams © Richard Stanton

For first-generation arable farmer Matthew Williams, who works with nine different landowners in Shropshire, expenditure is the one thing he can control in the current climate.

Despite farming 1,100ha, he will receive just £6,000 in BPS this year, so isn't too concerned about how the business will make up any funding gap in future years and points out that it won't go bust without this support.

Instead, he is committed to making good margins for both parties, so keeps a tight rein on costs and runs a low-disturbance, sustainable farming system - in line with expectations and policy developments.

""The business side is what makes me tick,"" he admits. ""I've got no control over world markets, but I can influence whether we make money or not this year and how we grow our crops.""

Having started his business in 2016 with next to nothing, it doesn't carry any unnecessary costs or equipment and over time he has reduced his reliance on contractors - which were an essential resource in the early days.

""Crunching the numbers showed that it made sense for me to buy my own baler, which I did in 2019,"" he says. ""Until that time, I used contractors.""

A switch to liquid fertilisers has saved £18/ha on nitrogen, improved accuracy and helped to stretch out cashflow, as the last tanks to be filled on the farm in the growing season don't have to be paid for until May or June.

Even in 2022, when fertiliser prices hit levels that had never been seen before, Matthew managed to have an average nitrogen cost of £635/t.

""I left the phosphorus and potassium purchases to the last minute as they were coming down in price - as a result, we benefited from a massive reduction.""

He employs two distributor agronomists to help with decision-making and puts the farm data through the Yagro platform, which gives him his costs of production and shows how the business is performing compared with others.

Although he describes himself as frugal, Matthew stresses that he is willing to spend if there is a return on offer.

A good example was his use of a foliar micronutrient product on wheat last year - for a cost of £6.50/ha he saw a 0.8t/ha yield increase.

""We saw some of our best wheat yields from it so I have committed to apply the product to all of our wheat this year.""

He is reluctant to pay a premium for new genetics, so sticks to wheat varieties that have performed well on the farm in previous years and have the characteristics that make them easy to manage.

Farm-saved seed is used in some circumstances.

""We've got a couple of blocks of triticale being grown on our lighter ground - it has the necessary drought tolerance and requires fewer inputs.""  

He sees the biggest risk for agriculture in England is land going into environmental schemes and being taken out of production.

As he doesn't own any land, Matthew's diversification options are limited. He does, however, run a couple of lorries, which provides another revenue stream and complements the farming activities.

Any business expansion opportunities are assessed very carefully.

""When I started, I needed more land to spread my fixed costs. Now I'm lucky enough to be in a position which allows me to stand back if the deal isn't right.

In the meantime, he is focused on the little wins, such as the SFI 2023 and premiums for growing sustainable crops.  

""I get huge satisfaction from farming sustainably while both the farmer and the contractor make a good return."" 

Control of inputs

When it comes to reducing input costs, he reports that there has been a move away from liberal applications of fertiliser - largely due to huge price hikes.

Other sources of nitrogen and targeted applications have been adopted, with rates being scrutinised.

""It's important farmers don't walk away from this better practice, even though fertiliser prices are back to more-normal levels.""

Those already in soil carbon schemes or supply chain partnerships, most of which are found in dairy and fresh produce, will be committed to this new approach.

Others need to recognise that the green agenda will impact them too and find ways to engage with it sooner, rather than later, he remarks.

""Reducing your focus on yield is possible if you are being rewarded in other ways for sustainable practices.""

Otherwise, higher interest rates are forcing changes to the management of cashflows and putting the emphasis on better payment terms, with businesses able to negotiate delayed terms and saving money.

""Money in the bank at the moment is worth more,"" he explains.

""So the longer you can keep it there, the better."" That also applies to any sales strategy.

""If you are going to sell later, you need to know that there will be an uplift in the price. It costs you to keep grain in the shed.""

What about diversification?

There hasn't been a huge uplift in diversification projects in the past few years although the Farm Business Survey results show a steady increase in the amount of income coming from diversification.

""Most of this activity has been around the development and letting of buildings,"" says Jonty Armitage.

""There's good demand for housing and commercial lets, with rents being seen as a safe, guaranteed income.""

Diversified businesses don't happen overnight and they shouldn't be seen as a replacement for BPS, he stresses.

""Some of them fail, others prosper over time and become the dominant business.""

Ring-fencing

Getting investment for a new venture may need a fresh approach, he says, as ring-fencing the new business can make it more investable.

""You also have more lending opportunities to choose from - a partnership can work well.""

Natural capital markets haven't been big income streams to date and it's becoming clearer with every day that they will be part of the mix on farms, rather than the salvation, he summarises.

""For most farms, food production will remain the core business.""

Contract farming returns

Latest comparison figures from Ceres Rural show that contract farming agreements (CFAs) remain popular, despite reducing returns and profits since the record year of 2022.

The company's data comes from 54 CFAs, covering 13,900ha of arable land, with the most recent 2023 figures being an estimate based on the results from 41 farms, reports consultant Seb Young.

An increase in the contractor charge in 2022 to £277/ha - the highest since the comparison started in 2018 - reflects the greater level of risk being experienced by the farming industry in that year and the need for contractors to ensure that all costs were covered.

""Although 2022 was the best farming year that many can remember, there were plenty of unknowns when it came to cashflow requirements and whether the markets would cover the costs of growing and harvesting crops,"" says Seb.

The contractor charge is expected to be higher again in 2023, at an average of £294/ha, as the combination of rising costs, reducing BPS and market uncertainty continue to create difficulties for farming businesses.

""Many businesses were carrying two years of fertiliser costs in 2023,"" he continues. ""They then had a much more mediocre harvest, so the figures that we have to date for 2023 reflect that.""

In the same way, the farmer total returns for harvest 2022 were much higher than previous years, also being the highest seen within the Ceres Rural dataset.

At £589/ha, it was £119/ha higher than 2021.This has dropped to an estimated £412/ha for harvest 2023.

The greatest increase seen in all the Ceres Rural figures is the contractor total return for harvest 2022.

At £601/ha, this figure is £120/ha higher than the previous year. Again, we see this coming down substantially for harvest 2023.""

Ceres Rural partner Ed Hutley points out that unless commodity prices rise, figures for 2024 will be very similar to those of 2023. ""It all looks quite flat,"" he comments.

An Essex landowner is likely to take up to 17% of his 400ha of arable out of production in favour of a biodiversity net gain scheme, while potentially producing and selling carbon credits from the rest of the farmed ground and an area of pasture in a significant change to the farm's current business model.

The change at the 600ha Braxted Park Estate has been unlocked by being involved in a Natural Environment Investment Readiness Fund (NEIRF) project led by Essex County Council (see “What is the Natural Environment Investment Readiness Fund?”).

What is the Natural Environment Investment Readiness Fund?

Defra and the Environment Agency's Natural Environment Investment Readiness Fund provides grants of up to £100,000 to environmental groups, local authorities, businesses and other organisations to develop nature projects to a point where they can attract private investment.

These projects aim to demonstrate a return on the fund's investment by capturing the value of carbon, water quality, biodiversity and other benefits provided by natural assets, with revenue generated through the sale of carbon storage, improvement in biodiversity, natural flood management benefits and reduced water treatment costs.

A report by the independent Essex Climate Action Commission for the county to reach net zero by 2050 includes a recommendation that 50% of Essex's farmland uses sustainable land stewardship (see “What is sustainable land stewardship?”) by 2030, 75% by 2040 and 100% by 2050.

One of the council's responses to the report has been to apply for NEIRF investment to research the potential of biodiversity net gain (BNG) and carbon credits, in conjunction with Downforce Technologies, a global provider of natural capital intelligence at scale, and nature specialist corporate finance advisers Finance Earth.

What is sustainable land stewardship?

Essex Climate Action Committee defines sustainable land stewardship as a range of farm systems and strategies applied to agriculture and land use, which have a positive environmental effect lowering global carbon emissions.

Sustainable agricultural systems exhibit the following key attributes:

Downforce Technologies is providing baseline soil carbon and biodiversity measurements using its innovative big data analytics platform, while Finance Earth is exploring investment opportunities for the project, which involves four farming estates.

Historical and current information combining satellite and local geophysical and environmental data is integrated in Downforce Technologies' virtual analytics platform to provide measurements, such as vegetation structure and cover, above-ground carbon and biomass, and soil organic carbon, at scale for the project, explains Maria Whittaker, the company’s chief development officer.

""That data is then being used by Essex County Council to understand what is possible and to help map the most efficient use of land to reach their restoration goals,"" she says.

The data supports decisions around where to site BNG projects for greatest benefit and least risk, while for soil carbon it is identifying where carbon credits could be produced to offer into voluntary soil carbon trading market, Maria says.

Pilot landowner

Access to that type of information was a key part of why Braxted Park Estate owner Duncan Clark was interested in being one of the four pilot landowners in the project.

The estate effectively has two areas: a 200ha Grade II* listed park and garden behind a 4.5-mile wall and the 400ha of arable land to the north-east outside the wall, Duncan explains.

""The agricultural land is not the highest quality,"" he says.

Duncan Clark © Paul Starr

For 10 years in the 1990s, the entire area was in the set-aside scheme - ""something of a local scandal,"" Duncan says - and then in a Countryside Stewardship scheme for another 10 years before being ""dragged back into intensive arable farming"" in 2014 by the termination of the stewardship scheme.

""But when we did that, I refused to give up all the biodiversity gains we had made on about 40ha of the 400. We had rewilded by accident, but it was incredible what had happened - turtle doves, nightingales, oak trees planted by jays and squirrels, red-listed flora and fauna and beautiful scrub and mature canopy.""

With a history of managing land - ""by benign neglect"", he jokingly calls it - for environmental gains such as those required for BNG projects, he jumped at the chance at being a pilot farm in the project.

""It's marginal land,"" he says. ""I've got first-mover advantage and the numbers [developers] are talking about are, for us, much better than growing wheat, at least for now.

""When wheat is £300/t and yields high, it will be tougher, but I don't buy the sustainability of those high prices, and I love BNG because I don't have to pay contractors, buy fertiliser or worry about weather. And I'm doing more for turtle doves, nightingales, rare flora and fauna, so it's a win-win.

""Farm clusters, like the one I'm setting up, will be the key to getting scale,"" he adds.

Private money

One major difference, unlike with set-aside and Countryside Stewardship schemes, is he is no longer taking taxpayer money, he points out. ""This time it is the private sector.""

About 70ha of the current arable area has been identified by Duncan's legacy advisers Bidwells’ analysis as suitable for BNG offsets. The area will be locked into the scheme for 30 years.

Management costs should be relatively low - any scheme he enters will be for ""benign neglect, because I'm good at it"", rather than, for instance, planting delicate pollen and nectar mixes on the heavy clay land.

""I'm a great believer in reforestation by nature because I've done it. Thick blackthorn establishes for the first 10 years, then out pop the oak plants and the next thing you have a canopy that kills the blackthorn, and finally you have a wood or scrubland that is very attractive to certain red-listed species. This needs management but it's low cost, straightforward and very rewarding.""

Roughly another 70ha, mostly pasture, has been identified as most suitable for producing carbon credits, despite that area having some of the highest levels of soil carbon on the estate, according to Downforce Technologies’ analysis.

""It was more of a pragmatic decision,"" explains George Hewson, UK country manager for Downforce Technologies.

""It will be allowed to go into natural regeneration scrubland to increase the carbon, so it's better to be land that Duncan is not particularly wedded to being under agricultural production.""

Carbon programme

As part of the NEIRF project, Downforce Technologies is road-testing its own carbon programme, Maria says.

For this project, the credits will be sold as offsets, with the idea of building opportunities to sell credits locally in Essex. In other projects, the firm is developing carbon inset programmes reducing emissions in supply chains.

""It's a voluntary 25-year programme,"" Maria says. ""The programme is outcomes-based, so you sell the extra carbon you deliver using a mean of six years of baseline data and comparing it with the average of the last three years of data to make sure you are sequestering that carbon in the soil.

""You don't need to sample your soils, and with our data analytics platform, we can provide granular insights into soil organic carbon levels and variability, down to 10sq m detail, every 10 days since the beginning of 2017. Our unique capability lies in analysing historical and spatial distributions to an exceptional degree of detail,"" she explains.

The programme could also be extended to include the arable area on the farm, with changes in farming practices or agronomy resulting in increased soil carbon.

The in-depth analysis by Downforce Technologies in other projects is providing evidence of how rotation or certain farming practices, for example, can increase and decrease soil carbon.

""The accuracy and validity of your baseline data are of utmost importance,"" Maria says. ""If you have the right information, you can build rotations that are more productive for carbon, as well as yield.""

That's important, Duncan acknowledges. ""It would increase the amount of land I can commit to producing carbon credits, but is somewhat dependent on the extent I can convince my contractor to farm it in that manner and for that purpose. It's not an either-or decision like BNG.""

Individually, BNG credits are worth much more, he says. ""We haven't signed a contract yet, but in theory the uplift is something like six credits per hectare, and I've heard numbers anywhere between £10,000 and £30,000 for a credit, so it is potentially big money,"" he concludes.

Our unique capability lies in analysing historical and spatial distributions to an exceptional degree of detail,"" she explains.

The programme could also be extended to include the arable area on the farm, with changes in farming practices or agronomy resulting in increased soil carbon.

The in-depth analysis by Downforce Technologies in other projects is providing evidence of how rotation or certain farming practices, for example, can increase and decrease soil carbon.

""The accuracy and validity of your baseline data are of utmost importance,"" Maria says. ""If you have the right information, you can build rotations that are more productive for carbon, as well as yield.""

That's important, Duncan acknowledges. ""It would increase the amount of land I can commit to producing carbon credits, but is somewhat dependent on the extent I can convince my contractor to farm it in that manner and for that purpose. It's not an either-or decision like BNG.""

Individually, BNG credits are worth much more, he says. ""We haven't signed a contract yet, but in theory the uplift is something like six credits per hectare, and I've heard numbers anywhere between £10,000 and £30,000 for a credit, so it is potentially big money,"" he concludes.

Climate change is putting arable crops at greater risk from attack by pests and diseases never before seen on UK shores.

According to a scientific review by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), a single, unusually warm winter may be enough to help an invasive pest establish in temperate regions such as the UK.

While half of all emerging plant pests and diseases are spread by global travel and trade, Defra says weather is the second most important factor.

The biogeography of the British Isles means that many airborne pests and pathogens can naturally traverse the English Channel and spread from continental Europe.

Agricultural crops, horticulture, flowers, and fruits and vegetables are big business in the UK - they are estimated to contribute £4.1bn to the economy every year.

But in the past 25 years, diseases such as cercospora in sugar beet and ramularia leaf spot in barley have taken hold in the UK, and small outbreaks of wheat stem rust have appeared sporadically, threatening that trade and food security.

Outbreaks warning

James Brown, plant pathology research group leader at the John Innes Centre in Norfolk, says although recent outbreaks of stem rust have not been large enough to cause economic damage, it is a warning of things to come.

New strains of wheat yellow rust, which attacked some previously resistant UK varieties, emerged in 2011.

And barley yellow dwarf virus, a virus transmitted by aphids and previously well controlled by insecticides, is a cause for concern because neonicotinoids can no longer be used as a treatment. 

In horticulture, the tomato brown rugose fruit virus, which affects mainly tomato and sweet pepper plants, was detected in the UK in June 2019 - five years after the first cases emerged in Israel, causing significant economic losses for growers.

Number of potential pests

There are a vast number of potential plant pests and pathogens that could take hold in the UK; the UK Plant Health Risk Register has identified more than 700 for either further research or as a potential threat to the UK.

And there are 165 pests that threaten UK potato cultivation alone, including potato flea beetles, which can cause a major impact on the crop's commercial value. In the past, it has been intercepted on ware potatoes at the UK border.

Prof Brown says identifying which countries diseases emerge from is not straightforward, but some of the new strains of yellow rust are known to have come here from east Asia.

""Human movement is the biggest risk of introducing rust, with spores coming into the UK on clothes and footwear,"" he says.

Climate change

Climate change is one reason why wheat stem rust has taken hold in the UK, and it is likely to set a precedent.

""Modelling has shown that, over the next 50 years, warmer summers could see diseases associated with hot climates becoming more of a problem in the UK,"" says Prof Brown.

One of the biggest consequences for crop production that he sees from climate change is the unpredictability it brings to weather patterns.

""What that unpredictability means for plant diseases is less understood, but we are probably going to get more outbreaks in crops,"" he warns.

Is enough being done to prevent diseases emerging?

One of the principal actions to ward off the emergence, or re-emergence, of plant disease is effective breeding.

For example, breeding for resistance has meant better than anticipated control of yellow rust in old varieties, as well as new ones.

In the case of Septoria nodorum, this once prevalent disease, which mainly infects wheat, has virtually disappeared from the UK by breeding for durable resistance.

Many farmers do grow more resistant varieties, but some don't, and these susceptible varieties play a disproportionate role in spreading disease.

With Septoria tritici, if all farmers chose to grow varieties with at least moderate resistance, there would be less of a problem, says James Brown of the John Innes Centre.

But there are multiple factors why farmers choose a variety - quality, maturity date, standing power, and resistance to other pests and diseases, to name some of them.

Resistant varieties needed

Hasty decisions to withdraw broad-spectrum fungicides and insecticides, including neonicotinoids, have not allowed plant breeders time to breed varieties resistant to some diseases.

""When new diseases comes along, we don't have resistant varieties - they need to be bred and that is a long process,"" Prof Brown points out.

In the case of Septoria tritici, which emerged in the UK as a major problem in the 1970s, it took 20 years before breeders started to release resistant varieties, and another 20 years to get to the point where those varieties could compete with established modern varieties.

""The 2018 neonicotinoids ban was introduced quickly, but it takes nine years to release new varieties of winter cereals, and five years for spring varieties,"" he says.

""We have to produce varieties that are not just resistant to one pest or disease, but varieties with at least moderate resistance to all pests or disease. Just focusing on one problem is not the solution.""

Crop management and production will also have a greater role to play in disease control, with the withdrawal of neonicotinoids from general use.

Strategic approach to disease control

The global database of the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation lists more than 90,000 pests and diseases of interest to plant protection, agriculture, and forestry.

The database spans insects, bacteria, fungi, viruses, and nematodes, yet there are a significant number of species which are not included.

So, what measures are in place in the UK to protect crops and plants from these?

According to the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha), there are robust systems to monitor emerging diseases and to identify risks, including the UK Plant Biosecurity Strategy.

This policy, a partnership between the UK, Scottish and Welsh governments and the Forestry Commission, was agreed in January 2023 to co-ordinate the approach of countries to plant biosecurity over the next five years.

It is the second plant biosecurity strategy for GB - the first was in 2014 in response to the first cases of ash dieback being identified.

The pathogen arrived here naturally as wind-blown spores and through the importation of infected ash trees.

Defra says its latest strategy will create a new biosecure plant supply chain to safeguard food security and help mitigate the effects of climate change.

As part of that, Apha's Internet Trading Unit will be expanded to increase monitoring of online retailers and social media sites for the trade of high-risk plant products.

Certification

Certifying seed is another way to reduce pests and diseases; all seed bought and sold in the UK must be certified and wheat quality must meet EU minimum standards.

But if new pests or diseases do infiltrate these controls, with fewer treatment options now on the market for growers of all crops, managing them will be difficult.

""Once a new pathogen or pest is here, it is here - we need to learn how to control it once it has arrived,"" says Prof Brown.

""While breeding for durable resistance has been shown to be effective, for instance, in wheat mildew and barley brown rust, time won't be on our side.""

Could mint extracts be the secret ingredient to tackling resistant weeds, such as blackgrass and Italian ryegrass? Could they even be a glyphosate replacement?

That's what a US-based start-up company, Harpe Bioherbicide Solutions, is hoping as it develops natural bioherbicides based on plant extracts, primarily from the menthus or mint family.

See also: Video: Mechanical hoes offer solution as herbicide resistance builds

Harpe's co-founder, Dr Chad Brommer, reviewed hundreds of plant extracts for potential herbicidal compounds, but narrowed the selection to those from mint, dill and caraway.

These are being formulated into non-selective herbicides that can be sprayed using traditional farm equipment or drones.

Research has shown that in the right combination and mixes, these essential oil compounds, which are extracted from the leaves by steam distillation, cause plant cell walls to leak.

Daniel Pepitone, chief operating officer for Harpe, explains: ""That means when you make an application, whether pre-emergence or post-emergence, the cellular membranes can no longer function.""

Post-emergence, that means plants will wilt as the cells cannot retain water, photosynthesis stops as the chloroplast membranes leak, while energy production ceases when mitochondria walls are attacked.

""The plant stops functioning and dies,"" Daniel says. ""By having multiple points of attack at the same time, we're throwing a lot at the plant that it cannot recover from.""

Pre-emergence

When used pre-emergence, the compounds disrupt the cellular communication required for germination, slow cell division, and stop germination and root and shoot emergence.

""Most pre-emergence products today needs the weed seeds to swell and germinate before coming into contact with the herbicide,"" Daniel says.

""We don't need to wait for the seed to germinate. We prevent it - the product just needs to come into contact with the seed.""

The multiple modes of action, he says, should also reduce the risk of resistance developing.

About 15 unique formulations derived from natural and nature-identical sources are being developed as solo products, which will be suitable for both conventional and organic markets. A further 32 pre-mixed formulations combine the extracts with existing herbicides such as glyphosate, pendimethalin, metribuzin and glufosinate.

Daniel says: ""You will need more Harpe [bioherbicide] when it is doing the work alone, so we don't see it as an either/or for our chemistry.""

The extracts can be used in pre-emergence markets, where the products prevent germination of and control small-seeded broad-leaf weeds and grassweeds in the top 2cm of the soil, including resistant blackgrass and Italian ryegrass.

UK trials

""In UK trials, as long as we get good coverage, we're achieving 85%-plus control of blackgrass,"" Daniel says.

""Currently, we're trying to fine-tune the formulation, so we get best coverage and consistent outcomes, while lowering the actives needed to do that.""

The product does not move through the soil profile, meaning that crop seeds planted to the correct depth are unaffected. This is similar to how current pre-emergence herbicides, such as flufenacet and cinmethylin, achieve crop safety.

Harpe also expects its products to be used in non-selective herbicide markets where glyphosate is currently dominant, including pre-drilling stubble clean-up and pre-harvest desiccation applications, although it is not as systemic as glyphosate.

Another potential use is in combination with herbicide-tolerant crops. The firm recently signed a licence agreement with Corteva Agriscience to use Crispr-Cas 9 gene editing technology to develop such crops with St Louis, Missouri-based Solis Agrosciences.

""That means in future we'll have the ability to spray Harpe formulations over the top of crops and not injure them,"" Daniel says.

""Gene editing is the most likely path to do that, which will expand the opportunity for growers and to stack traits that are available today in herbicide-tolerant crops.""

The products are likely to be introduced first in the US, where some of the natural plant extracts are classified as minimum risk under Section 25(b) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (Fifra), and so are exempt from regulations on efficacy and toxicity.

""We're working through our understanding of other key markets because registration is different,"" Daniel says.

""But these products are well-known compounds that are consumed and used by people every day, so a lot of information exists. We hope to be able to expedite registration - I would hope it would be less than five years.""

That might not be under the Harpe Bioherbicides banner, though. ""Our end goal is not to commercialise ourselves, but to exit to a partner, such as one of the leading crop protection companies.

""They have all the things we don't as a start-up - marketing, distribution and production on a global scale.""

Electrical weed control machinery in development

Using electricity as the primary ""mode of action"" is becoming increasingly practical as technology develops.

German company crop.zone has co-developed with John Deere a 24m version of its system, which sprays a conductive liquid onto the target, lowering the leaf surface's resistance to an electrical current applied through special applicators.

In previous systems the spray boom was attached to the front of the tractor. In the new John Deere version it is integrated into an existing John Deere trailed sprayer, says Dirk Vandenhirtz, chief executive of crop.zone.

""You spray and apply at the same time,"" he says. ""You drive at 6km/h - one pass is enough so you can do about 40ha/hour. We only use 26kWh/ha, which is less than an electrical vehicle would use on a 100km journey.""

The system is targeted at non-selective burndown markets, such as desiccation of crops including potatoes, cereals, chickpeas and cotton.

A British company, RootWave, has also developed an electric weeder, for use in vineyards and orchards.

Developed as a follow-up to a hand-held spot weeder which used 50Hz frequency, the tractor-powered machine uses a higher frequency waveform of 18kHz, explains Tom Archer, head of marketing for RootWave.

""50Hz is the same as our domestic power supply and can be a lethal form of electricity, whereas 18kHz and above is a higher frequency waveform that is safer than 50Hz and DC. However, it does still kill weeds.""

Used for weed control, electricity is similar to glyphosate in that it is systemic, he explains.

""We have to make contact with the leaf of the plant with our electrodes, and electricity flows through the plant and into the roots, gets converted to heat energy and near-instantaneously kills the plant.""

The tractor-mounted and powered machine has three treatment electrodes on either side, delivering up to 10kW each.

""These electrode arms are flexible to be able to treat 1.8m to 4m wide rows, which is important as there can be huge variability in row widths on fruit farms,"" Tom says.

Targeting new modes of action

MoA Technology, a start-up spun out of University of Oxford research, has developed a high-throughput platform that uses miniaturised plants to help identify new compounds with potential herbicidal activity and novel modes of action.

""We are focused on addressing herbicide resistance,"" explains Dr Virginia Corless, MoA Technology's chief executive.

""And there is broad consensus that one of the best ways is to discover new herbicides that work in new ways with new modes of action, such that there is no evolved resistance in weed populations.

""What is special about our discovery engine is by working with these miniaturised plants, we're able to identify symptoms that tell us with a high degree of specificity about the mode of action of the compounds we are testing.""

Traditional screens use slightly larger plants in glasshouses when symptoms become more generic, she notes.

That often means new discoveries turn out to have existing modes of action, whereas MoA's platform finds varied and distinctive symptoms which can identify novel modes of action at the first step.

""Our pipeline is filled with molecules, synthetic and natural, that meet the criteria of having both herbicidal efficacy and novel modes of action,"" she says.

So far, nothing in that pipeline has made the registration process, she says. ""That's always a multiyear process but we are pushing towards that point as fast as possible.""

""They have all the things we don't as a start-up - marketing, distribution and production on a global scale.""

Electrical weed control machinery in development

Using electricity as the primary ""mode of action"" is becoming increasingly practical as technology develops.

German company crop.zone has co-developed with John Deere a 24m version of its system, which sprays a conductive liquid onto the target, lowering the leaf surface's resistance to an electrical current applied through special applicators.

In previous systems the spray boom was attached to the front of the tractor. In the new John Deere version it is integrated into an existing John Deere trailed sprayer, says Dirk Vandenhirtz, chief executive of crop.zone.

""You spray and apply at the same time,"" he says. ""You drive at 6km/h - one pass is enough so you can do about 40ha/hour. We only use 26kWh/ha, which is less than an electrical vehicle would use on a 100km journey.""

The system is targeted at non-selective burndown markets, such as desiccation of crops including potatoes, cereals, chickpeas and cotton.

A British company, RootWave, has also developed an electric weeder, for use in vineyards and orchards.

Developed as a follow-up to a hand-held spot weeder which used 50Hz frequency, the tractor-powered machine uses a higher frequency waveform of 18kHz, explains Tom Archer, head of marketing for RootWave.

""50Hz is the same as our domestic power supply and can be a lethal form of electricity, whereas 18kHz and above is a higher frequency waveform that is safer than 50Hz and DC. However, it does still kill weeds.""

Used for weed control, electricity is similar to glyphosate in that it is systemic, he explains.

""We have to make contact with the leaf of the plant with our electrodes, and electricity flows through the plant and into the roots, gets converted to heat energy and near-instantaneously kills the plant.""

The tractor-mounted and powered machine has three treatment electrodes on either side, delivering up to 10kW each.

""These electrode arms are flexible to be able to treat 1.8m to 4m wide rows, which is important as there can be huge variability in row widths on fruit farms,"" Tom says.

Targeting new modes of action

MoA Technology, a start-up spun out of University of Oxford research, has developed a high-throughput platform that uses miniaturised plants to help identify new compounds with potential herbicidal activity and novel modes of action.

""We are focused on addressing herbicide resistance,"" explains Dr Virginia Corless, MoA Technology's chief executive.

""And there is broad consensus that one of the best ways is to discover new herbicides that work in new ways with new modes of action, such that there is no evolved resistance in weed populations.

""What is special about our discovery engine is by working with these miniaturised plants, we're able to identify symptoms that tell us with a high degree of specificity about the mode of action of the compounds we are testing.""

Traditional screens use slightly larger plants in glasshouses when symptoms become more generic, she notes.

That often means new discoveries turn out to have existing modes of action, whereas MoA's platform finds varied and distinctive symptoms which can identify novel modes of action at the first step.

""Our pipeline is filled with molecules, synthetic and natural, that meet the criteria of having both herbicidal efficacy and novel modes of action,"" she says.

So far, nothing in that pipeline has made the registration process, she says. ""That's always a multiyear process but we are pushing towards that point as fast as possible.""

425,"Study shows growers can cut oilseed rape pest damage","https://www.fwi.co.uk/arable/osr/study-shows-growers-can-cut-oilseed-rape-pest-damage","Study shows growers can cut oilseed rape pest damage

Agro-ecological and genetic solutions are being examined to overcome pest problems in oilseed rape.

Rothamsted Research is doing work on increasing populations of natural enemies as part of a Europe-wide EcoStack project.

The results show that growers can use practices to either reduce pest numbers or their effect on the crop, such as companion cropping, using bespoke field margins and encouraging pest predators, which can involve no-tillage.

Companion cropping

A reduction in cabbage stem flea beetle damage was seen when cereals or unattractive brassica companions were used, reports Gaetan Seimandi-Corda, who adds that the effect of clover as a companion is dependent on its density.

""The denser the clover population, the less damage was observed.

""Straw mulch was also effective in reducing attacks,"" says Dr Seimandi-Corda.

Bespoke flower margins

Where flower margins were established, Rothamsted's results indicated that certain wildflower species are more attractive than others - with different insect species favouring different plants.

There are also differences between plants favoured by pollinators and those preferred by parasitoids, so bespoke mixes may be needed.

""The next stage is to identify the flower traits that explain these preferences so we can come up with the best seed mixes for attracting beneficials,"" he says.

Predators of OSR pests

Both carabids and rove beetles are key predators of oilseed rape pests, especially pod midge and pollen beetle larvae.

""Beetles eat the soft-bodied forms of pests on the soil surface. So they have a suppression effect, reducing numbers before they can become a problem in the crop,"" says Rothamsted's Kelly Jowett.

Building carabid numbers is important, which is why a range of connected farm habitats is key.

""They need the resources to feed, breed and shelter, so a range of crops with some adjacent semi-natural habitat is ideal,"" says Dr Jowett.

Rape winter stem weevil

Winter stem weevil has been an issue in East Anglian crops this season, with some going backwards after Christmas and dying off from the effects of larval feeding and sharp frosts.

The larvae have a distinctive C-shape with dark orange heads, and often live alongside flea beetle larvae, invading the main stem and developing crown.

Earlier drilling may have suited the pest, says Dick Neale, technical manager at agronomy group Hutchinsons, as the adults have an earlier egg laying period than flea beetles.

""We may have unintentionally played into their hands by drilling earlier to avoid another pest.

""Unfortunately, the only solution is to spray, which most growers are trying not to do,"" he says.

Earlier drilling wasn't to blame in the crops of AHDB Diss Monitor Farmer Richard Ling, who lost 20ha of hybrid oilseed rape to the pest, after it had established well from a September drilling.

""It started to go backwards in mid-January. Fortunately, I hadn't spent the money on an Astrokerb application and the seed was left over from the previous year, so I was able to make the decision to rip it up without being out of pocket,"" he says.

A replacement spring barley crop is up and growing well.

Mr Ling won't be making the same mistake twice.

""Oilseed rape is still in my future plans, providing conditions are good at drilling and there's enough moisture, and that we don't run over into September.""

Genetic solutions?

Twenty oilseed rape varieties are being put through their paces at Rothamsted for flea beetle larval tolerance.

At least two of the varieties in this year's trial have a trait, identified by the John Innes Centre, that helps the plant tolerate larvae infestations, says Sam Cook of Rothamsted.

Next year, the study will expand to include varieties with a trait for adult flea beetle tolerance.

""There is every reason for growers to be optimistic about the future place for oilseed rape in rotations, despite some of the current challenges,"" says Dr Cook.

Tillage effect on beneficials

Parasitoid emergence is highest in no-tillage situations with the effect increasing over time since cultivations ceased, according to EcoStack.

What is OSR Future?

Corteva Agriscience is delighted to sponsor OSR Future, a series following the progress of the 2022-23 oilseed rape crop and exploring how farmers are changing the way they grow the crop.

OSR is a vital part of the rotation and Corteva remains committed to helping deliver the tools to ensure the crop has a bright future with farmers.

With an innovative R&D pipeline, fantastic varieties - such as sclerotinia-tolerant hybrid PT303 - alongside proven crop protection products, such as Belkar, Astrokerb, Kerb Flo 500 and Korvetto, farmers will be equipped with the tools they need to maximise the potential of their crops.

About the survey

The Farmers Weekly oilseed rape survey was carried out in September/October 2022 and had 353 respondents, representing all areas of the UK. 

The average farm size was 406ha and the average area of oilseed rape grown was 95ha. Of those questioned, two-thirds have grown oilseed rape every year for the last five years.

439,"What UK dairy farmers can learn from Dutch ‘nitrogen crisis’","https://www.fwi.co.uk/livestock/dairy/what-uk-dairy-farmers-can-learn-from-dutch-nitrogen-crisis","What UK dairy farmers can learn from Dutch ‘nitrogen crisis’

Scientists in the Netherlands are developing ways dairy farmers can reduce greenhouse gas emissions using methods that could also benefit UK milk producers.

It follows calls by the Hague government for a 50% cut in nitrogen emissions by 2030 - a target that Dutch farmers say threatens to drive them out of business, destroying their livelihoods and breaking up rural communities.

Dairy farmer Herman Miedema milks 175 cows across some 100ha of grass and maize silage just outside the small village of Vyns, in the heart of Friesland province - the dairy capital of the Netherlands.

See also: Joint land ownership allows Dutch milk producer to extensify

Mr Miedema is already reducing emissions. He installed a curved slatted floor system in 2009, so slurry and urine are stored immedately rather than left exposed to the elements, where they would volatilise.

He is also grazing cows outside for 180 days annually, reducing the amount of crude protein in feed rations and diluting manure with water before spreading it on the fields. But it is not enough. ""We are being asked to do more - much more.""

One of the world’s most densely populated countries, the Netherlands is home to about 16,000 dairy farmers milking some 1.57 million cows.

Dutch agriculture is responsible for about half the country’s greenhouse gas emissions.

The Dutch government requires farmers to have a permit to farm.

Mr Miedema is one of the lucky ones; he still has his permit. But the Dutch Supreme Court has declared the permits of 3,000 livestock farmers invalid, throwing their future into doubt.

Permit predicament

Those 3,000 farmers find themselves in a nitrogen crisis. They are unable to invest in their businesses because the banks won’t lend them money. But they can’t sell-up either because few people want to buy a farm with an invalid permit.

To help farmers, the government has earmarked â‚¬25bn (£22bn) to halve nitrogen emissions from agriculture by the 2030 target. Proposals include paying dairy farmers to quit the industry.

Trinke Elshof, of the Dutch farmers union (LTO), says a 40% reduction in nitrogen emissions is possible. But a 50% reduction is a step too far, she argues - an impossible goal for the dairy sector.

""The government is focusing purely on nitrogen emissions. But we think they should look more broadly.

“We need a total package - reductions, yes, but also solutions such as innovation and other on-farm measures.""

Scientists at the Dairy Campus research centre - part of Wageningen University - agree that innovation has a big part to play in reducing emissions in a way that could benefit farmers, consumers and the environment.

Founded in 2011, the centre is undertaking an increasing amount of research into emissions reduction, including innovative nutrition and grazing techniques, manure and slurry management, housing, and animal health and welfare.

The centre at Leeuwarden includes 500 dairy cows across 350ha of land.

Wageningen livestock scientists conduct high-tech, applied research and groundbreaking experiments across the entire dairy chain.

Data first

""This is not a farm - milk is a by-product of what we do,"" says Dairy Campus managing director Kees de Koning.

""Our core business is research - our cows produce data - lots and lots of data and information. We need cows to do that to help shape a future for Dutch dairying while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.""

© MAG/Johann Tasker

When it comes to cow diets, Dairy Campus researchers have already shown that a 1g reduction in crude protein content can reduce ammonia emissions by 1% without a corresponding drop in milk yield, so long as cow management is high.

They have already reduced dietary crude protein content from 165g to 150g/kg dry matter, cutting ammonia emissions by 15% without any detrimental effect on cows with a 10,000-litre lactation. Their aim is to see how low they can go.

""We have a saying: what doesn’t come in, doesn’t come out,"" says scientist Harmen van Laar.

""It is about adjusting the ration to reduce emissions without affecting milk output, cow health and welfare or fertility.""

Dairy Campus scientist Bert Philipsen has been investigating the effect of grazed grass and silage on emissions. Silage contains more crude fibre, but fresh grass can help reduce emissions of enteric methane, he says (see “Ways to cut dairy emissions”).

Feeding fresh grass is a cost-effective way of reducing emissions, says Dr Philipsen.

""You don’t have to invest in any additional machinery or technical equipment, and some processors will pay a 1-2cent/litre premium on the milk produced.

Feed suppliers and other farm input suppliers are using this knowledge to help farmers improve cow management out in the field.

They include Judith Mensink, a nutrionist with the feed company Agrifirm.

""We are delivering feeding advice - encouraging farmers to graze more efficiently, add supplements to their rations where appropriate and reduce crude protein content to cow diets where they can.

“But it’s not just about the ration, it’s also about feed management. It’s about cow comfort and health.

“You want your cows to give as much milk as possible, and that means ensuring they are healthy, whether they are feeding indoors or grazing outside.""

People and planet

Despite some success, farming campaigners argue that the government is continuing to prioritise the environment at the expense of people.

And they warn that putting farmers out of business will decimate rural communities.

""There is a lot of pressure on farmers to just go away,"" says Sieta van Keimpema, of the Dutch Farmers Defence Force.

""Our government wants to buy out farmers, and if you do not do it voluntarily, they will push you out. It’s going too far.”

Like the farmers she represents, Ms van Keimpema believes innovation is the answer.

""It’s the reason that we are not milking cows by hand anymore. And we shouldn’t forget, that every year there are more people on this planet. Everyone is a consumer, and that is part of the problem.

“If there was no innovation, no one would have a bicycle or a car or would fly. It’s unfair to ask farmers to turn the clock back 200 years while letting everyone else consume whatever they want.""

It is an argument that has gone beyond farming.

The Farmer-Citizen Movement (BBB) political party has surged in popularity - winning some 20% of the vote in last month’s provincial elections.

BBB politician Femka Wiersma says the shock result shows that the government needs to listen to the people.

""Trust in the government is at an all-time low,"" she says. ""We need a party that can regain that trust, and a long-term policy for Dutch farmers.""

Ways to cut dairy emissions

Graze grass

Grass and grazing have the potential to reduce both ammonia and methane emissions.

Methane emissions are lowest with full grazing, compared to grass silage and zero-grazing systems.

A further study is investigating whether grass silage from first, second and third cuts lead to a different quantity of methane emissions.

Weekly milk samples are being taken to determine milk fat and protein content, with feed samples collected from silage pits of grass cut at different times.

Better floors

Emissions-reducing floor systems enable rapid drainage of urine as well as sealing of the floor.

Using this system, slurry pit emissions have been as low as 6kg of ammonia an animal a year.

Dairy Campus researchers are testing a new system they believe could reduce ammonia emissions to just 3kg an animal, without gas forming in the slurry pit below and with separate manure flows for further valorisation.

Feed additives

Methane inhibitors have significantly cut dairy cow emissions in the Netherlands.

The reduction varies from 27-40% a cow, depending on the animal's ration and the amount of inhibitor administered.

A quarter of a teaspoon of the inhibitor Bovaer daily per cow has reduced emissions by an average of 30%.

Tests were conducted across three different configurations of grass silage and maize silage diets.

There are also indications that certain types of seaweed can inhibit the formation of methane during the digestion of feed.

Urine and manure

By encouraging cows to urinate in a special ""toilet"" while eating concentrate, the urine does not end up in the solid manure, and considerably less ammonia is formed.

The toilet is actually a walk-through concentrate feed box that stimulates the cow to discharge urine.

It detects urination and then collects, drains and stores it away from the manure. Cows voluntarily enter and leave the box.

Scientists say there is no indication that the welfare of the cows is compromised during this process.

They say there is another major advantage, too - the pure cow urine is rich in potassium and nitrogen and can be used as a fertiliser substitute.

Farm leader Minette Batters has criticised Defra's Environmental Land Management scheme for farmers in England, arguing that it is not supported by science.

The NFU president delivered her damning verdict on Environmental Land Management (ELM) at Reading University on Tuesday 7 March during a speech on balancing net zero with food security.

""I guess my big frustration with the ELM scheme is that it has no scientific rigour at all,"" she told delegates.

""The co-design has been very much about selecting of farmers; some good farmers, some moderate farmers and some probably not very good farmers at all.""

Mrs Batters said no one knew the identity of the farmers selected to build the ELM pilots and their outcomes. ""Is that really a credible way to build a new policy?"" she asked.

She questioned how the UK government could drive a new policy without scientific rigour.

""Why isn't the ELM scheme effectively having the tyres kicked on the scientific rigour that should be absolutely underpinning everything that is done?"" she asked.

Mrs Batters suggested the UK government should have involved the country's best scientists in the design of ELM, including our world-leading, science-based agricultural research institutes, such as Rothamsted Research and Niab.

She said Defra should have developed a foundation for farmers under the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI), the first tier of ELM, which is based on a metric for soil health and carbon sequestration targets they should aspire to achieve - and define which carbon calculators they should use.

Mrs Batters warned there was a ""real danger"" on the journey towards net zero that if the right farming policies are not put in place, the UK ""is going to get left behind"".

And if the policy did not deliver positive outcomes, the Treasury may in future seek to divert funding to the NHS or education.

Self-sufficiency target

On food production, Mrs Batters said prime minister Rishi Sunak made some important commitments in his leadership campaign, including the creation of a new statutory target on food self-sufficiency and mandatory reporting of that figure.

Mrs Batters said it was critical that Mr Sunak delivered on his promises for farming and included the self-sufficiency figure and the annual reporting process in the government's Land Use Framework, which is making its way through parliament.

""We have got to get this right, and getting that whole food production built into this thinking is fundamental on the journey to net zero as well,"" she added.

Independent agronomists say early wheat drilling compounded many of the yield-limiting issues experienced this year and urge growers to consider the risks when planning planting schedules this autumn.

Back in September 2022, wheat producers were on edge - harvest finished early, very expensive fertiliser was sat in the shed, the wheat price was riding high at £350/t and conditions were suitable for drilling.

Some commentators championed early drilling, perhaps encouraged by a promising new grassweed herbicide and decent trials performance of the two newest cereal fungicide additions in recent seasons.

Fast forward to the ongoing harvest and the talk is of average or slightly below average yields, dragged down by a host of problems that in many cases were exacerbated by earlier drilling.

Association of Independent Crop Consultants (AICC) director Matthew Paterson, who advises in the East, reports the highest levels of uncontrolled grassweeds in crops for several years.

He points out that on many farms, drill capacity is stretched and rainfall is tending to fall in extreme events rather than steadily across each month, which is changing the psychology of growers.

""There is a great fear of not getting anything in, so in a year like we've just had, when there was a long gap between harvest and drilling, it leans farms towards earlier drilling.""

AICC chairman Andrew Blazey believes that on average, wheat was drilled about 10 to 14 days earlier (late September/early October) than the established post-blackgrass norm (mid-October) across his eastern area.

This also ratcheted up early septoria pressure to levels more akin to those experienced in the South West.

""It forced us to consider a T1.5 fungicide [targeting final leaf 2], but there is a question mark over whether growers can get that on, as sprayer capacity is already stretched.

""There is also the risk of compromising T2 timing, so it's a bit of a double-edged sword.""

With barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) infection at its highest level for several years, Andrew questions whether cover crops are making matters worse.

Although there are many benefits, moving towards having green cover between crops as much as possible can provide a green bridge for BYDV vectors.

There is also an overreliance on pyrethroid sprays to control the disease, with some using two or three in autumns such as 2022. This has a negative impact on beneficial insects that are there to suppress aphid numbers.

""There was a compound effect of earlier drilling on all these problems - there is a need for everyone to remember the risks as we plan for the season ahead,"" Andrew notes.

Experts reinforce case for later drilling

Grassweeds

Niab's grassweed guru John Cussans says the high grassweed pressure in crops this summer can't be solely attributed to earlier drilling dates, but holding one's nerve in any autumn is a good foundation for successful control.

The perfect storm of dry conditions, lack of a chit to create stale seed-beds and poor herbicide performance resulted in significant levels of blackgrass in crops.

""We've relearned that it doesn't matter how much money you spend on herbicides, if you get conditions like some of the earliest drilled crops were drilled into - open, dry seed-beds, bright and sunny weather - you can't get them to work very well at all.

""Some herbicides were less bad than others, but we're also reminded that the key driver of herbicide efficacy is conditions, more than the herbicides you choose to use.""  

Levels of ryegrass continue to rise, with significantly more samples now sent to Niab for resistance testing than other species, and bromes have also been widespread and seen in unexpected places.

John attributes brome issues to system change, with great and sterile brome in particular encouraged by increasingly common min- or no-tillage regimes.

Also, due to resistance in blackgrass populations, there is now less routine use of post-emergence acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibitor herbicides with activity on brome species.

With high weed seed return likely this autumn, John stresses the value of identifying the problem by mapping affected areas and warns many fields will not be suitable for autumn drilling this year.

Where fields are suitable, planting schedules should be planned to start with the cleanest fields and finish with the moderate and higher risk situations, ideally about mid-October onwards.

With wetter conditions prevailing through July, there should be an opportunity to create stale seed-beds after the combine this autumn but, if soils do dry out, the advice is to wait for moisture before moving soil.

""Attempting stale seed-beds in dry conditions is counterproductive: you are better off just leaving weed seeds on top to be degraded by environmental conditions.""

Exceptions are sterile and great brome, which are best worked into the soil with a cultivator behind the combine to help break dormancy.

Meadow and rye bromes are the opposite, best left on the surface as exposed as possible - baling and removing straw helps.

Where bromes have appeared in unexpectedly high numbers, John recommends a review of herbicide programmes.

""Ask yourself where the strengths and weaknesses are. Avadex (tri-allate) and pendimethalin are strong on bromes and bringing back ALS chemistry might help.""

John concludes that 2023 highlighted the importance of good-quality advice on-farm.

""A good agronomist can provide attention to detail, getting out and observing what's going on and reacting. You can plan, but sometimes you need to adapt and that's where we saw the best results last year.""

Septoria

Fewer harsh winters mean septoria is now the major disease challenge across the whole UK.

Knowing how drill date affects a variety's resistance scores, as it did in 2023, is now the key to control.

That's according to Niab senior crop protection and IPM specialist Aoife O'Driscoll, who points to evidence in the AHDB's Project Report No. 634 quantifying this effect in simple terms.

It shows that early sowing (average date of 22 September) decreases the effective varietal septoria resistance rating by 0.6 compared with the average of the Recommended List ratings (average sowing date of 7 October).

Late sowing (average date 20 October) is predicted to increase the effective resistance rating by 0.6, for the varietal resistance ratings tested in the project.

Delaying drilling by four weeks from 22 September to 20 October therefore increased the resistance rating of a variety by about 1.2.

The analysis - led by Adas and in collaboration with Niab and SRUC - provides an estimated effect of early or late sowing on septoria disease risk on a scale that is familiar to growers and can be used to support variety selection and management decisions.

With some 30% of the British wheat area down to varieties with a septoria resistance score of 6 or below, some drilled slightly earlier in autumn 2022 would have been very vulnerable to the disease.

""We had such a high spore loading on leaves in spring and it's whether or not the variety was able resist that. Drilling later will certainly help reduce that pressure and avoid the fungicides having to do so much heavy lifting,"" adds Aoife.

BYDV

Alan Dewar, entomologist, and director of Dewar Crop Protection, says the most obvious way to prevent BYDV epidemics becoming more commonplace is later drilling.

""It reduces the need for pyrethroid sprays in most years and as many farms are trying to control grassweeds, there are other good reasons to do it as well.

""The downside is being caught by inclement weather, like in autumn 2019. It's not something that everyone can do, so BYDV-tolerant varieties seem like the best way forward.""

Breeder RAGT is leading the way in wheat with Wolverine and Grouse, which was launched this summer.

It also has a potential Group 1 or 2 milling wheat with BYDV tolerance, called Goldfinch, which has just completed National Listing and produced some excellent baking test results.

KWS offers conventional six-row winter barley Feeris, which made the 2022/23 Recommended List.

Such varieties are garnering plenty of interest from those considering the insecticide-free Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) option.

However, until BYDV tolerance is incorporated into wheats with complete agronomic packages - as seen with turnip yellows virus tolerance in oilseed rape - there will still be a need to use insecticides in risky seasons.

Alan says better information on when and where to spray is needed.

An improved decision-support landscape would include information on the resistance status of the two main aphid vectors, the grain aphid (Sitobion avenae) and bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padae).

While resistance to pyrethroids has not yet been found in bird cherry-oat aphids in the UK, grain aphids do carry knock down resistance (Kdr) although there have not been any reported control failures for the past two years.

""With the Kdr gene expressing moderate resistance, it's only likely to cause a major problem where pyrethroid rates are reduced or spray coverage is poor,"" says Alan.

Another important piece of the puzzle is establishing the proportion of aphids carrying BYDV.

Bird cherry-oat aphids © Blackthorn Arable

An AHDB pilot study carried out by Rothamsted in 2018 testing suction trap samples suggested one in five bird cherry-oat aphids were carrying at least one strain of the BYDV virus at some locations.

In subsequent surveys in 2019 and 2022, infectiousness of aphids ranged from 13-34% with 28-58% of them carrying the more severe RPV strain.

Alan believes this is symptomatic of a warming climate allowing the bird cherry-oat aphid to overwinter in grasses and cereal crops as asexuals, rather than developing sexual forms that return to the primary host to reproduce and lay eggs over the winter.

Further work at Rothamsted suggests the proportion of bird cherry-oat aphids colonising cereal crops in the autumn is directly correlated to the severity of the previous winter's temperature.

While untested in the field, this relationship has potential to be used as part of a risk-prediction tool.

Using suction trap and meteorological data, Alan predicts that some 13% of the population will be cereal colonisers in East Anglia this coming autumn.

Combining this with the pyrethroid resistance data and BYDV status, and other data from suction and yellow water traps and T-Sum calculations, the accuracy of risk forecasting to help insecticide recommendations can be immensely improved.

""However, if we can use new tolerant varieties to stop the yield loss from BYDV, then we wouldn't have to use insecticides at all,"" Alan adds.

Final word - mindset shift needed to make later drilling work in most years

AICC president and Niab northern regional agronomist Patrick Stephenson backs later wheat drilling to ease some of the downward agronomic pressures on winter wheat yields.

However, in his part of Yorkshire it is often very difficult to achieve without significant risk, as the weather can slam drilling windows shut during the first half of October.

This does not mean it's impossible, but Patrick says a significant shift in mindset is required in the way farms and their staff plan drilling campaigns.

Instead of one operator struggling through a 16-hour shifts, two men could do an eight-hour shift each to maintain standards and keep machinery running.

While some operators will be resistant to losing overtime, businesses could find other extra work and there are positives for the operator such as spending more time with family, which are often not considered.

""Hot-bedding the machinery to do more work in less time ensures the capacity is there to get the job done right in a tighter window, reducing the risk of getting caught out and seed left in the shed.""

All information in this article was gathered at the AICC's annual summer technical event, which was held at Niab's Park Farm and Sophi Taylor Building, Histon, near Cambridge in July.

Late sowing (average date 20 October) is predicted to increase the effective resistance rating by 0.6, for the varietal resistance ratings tested in the project.

Delaying drilling by four weeks from 22 September to 20 October therefore increased the resistance rating of a variety by about 1.2.

The analysis - led by Adas and in collaboration with Niab and SRUC - provides an estimated effect of early or late sowing on septoria disease risk on a scale that is familiar to growers and can be used to support variety selection and management decisions.

With some 30% of the British wheat area down to varieties with a septoria resistance score of 6 or below, some drilled slightly earlier in autumn 2022 would have been very vulnerable to the disease.

""We had such a high spore loading on leaves in spring and it's whether or not the variety was able resist that. Drilling later will certainly help reduce that pressure and avoid the fungicides having to do so much heavy lifting,"" adds Aoife.

BYDV

Alan Dewar, entomologist, and director of Dewar Crop Protection, says the most obvious way to prevent BYDV epidemics becoming more commonplace is later drilling.

""It reduces the need for pyrethroid sprays in most years and as many farms are trying to control grassweeds, there are other good reasons to do it as well.

""The downside is being caught by inclement weather, like in autumn 2019. It's not something that everyone can do, so BYDV-tolerant varieties seem like the best way forward.""

Breeder RAGT is leading the way in wheat with Wolverine and Grouse, which was launched this summer.

It also has a potential Group 1 or 2 milling wheat with BYDV tolerance, called Goldfinch, which has just completed National Listing and produced some excellent baking test results.

KWS offers conventional six-row winter barley Feeris, which made the 2022/23 Recommended List.

Such varieties are garnering plenty of interest from those considering the insecticide-free Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) option.

However, until BYDV tolerance is incorporated into wheats with complete agronomic packages - as seen with turnip yellows virus tolerance in oilseed rape - there will still be a need to use insecticides in risky seasons.

Alan says better information on when and where to spray is needed.

An improved decision-support landscape would include information on the resistance status of the two main aphid vectors, the grain aphid (Sitobion avenae) and bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padae).

While resistance to pyrethroids has not yet been found in bird cherry-oat aphids in the UK, grain aphids do carry knock down resistance (Kdr) although there have not been any reported control failures for the past two years.

""With the Kdr gene expressing moderate resistance, it's only likely to cause a major problem where pyrethroid rates are reduced or spray coverage is poor,"" says Alan.

Another important piece of the puzzle is establishing the proportion of aphids carrying BYDV.

Bird cherry-oat aphids © Blackthorn Arable

An AHDB pilot study carried out by Rothamsted in 2018 testing suction trap samples suggested one in five bird cherry-oat aphids were carrying at least one strain of the BYDV virus at some locations.

In subsequent surveys in 2019 and 2022, infectiousness of aphids ranged from 13-34% with 28-58% of them carrying the more severe RPV strain.

Alan believes this is symptomatic of a warming climate allowing the bird cherry-oat aphid to overwinter in grasses and cereal crops as asexuals, rather than developing sexual forms that return to the primary host to reproduce and lay eggs over the winter.

Further work at Rothamsted suggests the proportion of bird cherry-oat aphids colonising cereal crops in the autumn is directly correlated to the severity of the previous winter's temperature.

While untested in the field, this relationship has potential to be used as part of a risk-prediction tool.

Using suction trap and meteorological data, Alan predicts that some 13% of the population will be cereal colonisers in East Anglia this coming autumn.

Combining this with the pyrethroid resistance data and BYDV status, and other data from suction and yellow water traps and T-Sum calculations, the accuracy of risk forecasting to help insecticide recommendations can be immensely improved.

""However, if we can use new tolerant varieties to stop the yield loss from BYDV, then we wouldn't have to use insecticides at all,"" Alan adds.

Final word - mindset shift needed to make later drilling work in most years

AICC president and Niab northern regional agronomist Patrick Stephenson backs later wheat drilling to ease some of the downward agronomic pressures on winter wheat yields.

However, in his part of Yorkshire it is often very difficult to achieve without significant risk, as the weather can slam drilling windows shut during the first half of October.

This does not mean it's impossible, but Patrick says a significant shift in mindset is required in the way farms and their staff plan drilling campaigns.

Instead of one operator struggling through a 16-hour shifts, two men could do an eight-hour shift each to maintain standards and keep machinery running.

While some operators will be resistant to losing overtime, businesses could find other extra work and there are positives for the operator such as spending more time with family, which are often not considered.

""Hot-bedding the machinery to do more work in less time ensures the capacity is there to get the job done right in a tighter window, reducing the risk of getting caught out and seed left in the shed.""

All information in this article was gathered at the AICC's annual summer technical event, which was held at Niab's Park Farm and Sophi Taylor Building, Histon, near Cambridge in July.

With less than 1ha (2.2 acres) to play with, space is at a premium at Surrey Docks Farm.

Not all London's 12 city farms are as small (though some are even smaller) but they all go to great lengths to bring farming to their local communities, despite a host of challenges.

Surrey Docks Farm was set up in 1975 and has been at its present site, a former lorry park alongside the Thames, since 1985.

Farm facts: Surrey Docks Farm, Rotherhithe

""As a city person, I have so much love for this farm as I know what it can give,"" says livestock manager Claire Elson, who has worked there for more than 20 years.

She grew up in Peckham, visited the farm when she was in primary school and went on to study animal management at Sparsholt College in Hampshire.

""My parents took me out to the countryside, but lots [of children] don't get that opportunity,"" she adds.

Lack of space means feed must be bought in small quantities © MAG/Judith Tooth

The farm's 10 staff cover farming, youth and education work, as well as projects for people with learning difficulties.

Two full-time apprenticeships (in livestock and gardening) are offered, as well as weekly work experience placements for young people - and there are more than 100 adult volunteers on the farm's books.

""Some [volunteers] come because they love animals, some are referred by their doctor, some are between jobs, and some want a career in farming,"" says Claire.

Grazing management

With such a small site, grazing is limited, even in summer. Being on heavy clay, which quickly turns to sludge in wet weather, imposes further restrictions.

However, the cattle, sheep, donkeys and pony all have access to grass, albeit fields are watched carefully and closed off if conditions start to deteriorate.

Bought-in hard feed and hay, as well as straw for bedding, are relied on heavily.

Without the opportunity to shut fields for long periods, health challenges such as foot rot have to be tackled with regular foot dips, trimming, and treatment when necessary, says Claire.

""Because we know it's a problem, we're on high alert and carry out regular monitoring,"" she says.

Access to services

As veterinary practices in central London deal only with small animals, a vet from outside the capital has to be brought in.

This adds to farm costs, particularly once the Congestion Charge and Ultra Low Emission Zone charge have been passed on.

Restrictions prohibiting larger vehicles using the nearby Rotherhithe Tunnel result in some longer journeys to the farm, adding further cost.

Not everyone is willing to deliver to central London, and lack of storage space demands regular deliveries of relatively small quantities from those who will.

""It’s like playing Tetris to get the hay and straw in,"" says Claire.

Similarly, there is no local abattoir - although this is a challenge not unique to London - so stock are taken to C Humphreys & Sons near Chelmsford, Essex, in the farm's vehicle, towing a trailer borrowed from another city farm.

Carcasses are butchered by Brian Wilson at Hockley, near Southend.

Manure management

A small-scale biodigester is used to speed up manure and bedding decomposition.

This reduces pressure on space for storage and helps minimise waste exported by the farm.

The biodigester is stored in a large ""inner tube"" in a polytunnel and is maintained by students from University College London.

The resulting biofertiliser is pumped back to the muck heap to help it rot more quickly.

Once well-rotted, it is bagged into 1t sacks and supplied to local allotments and community gardens.

The gas produced by the biodigester is used to boil the kettle for the farm's volunteers to make hot drinks.

Sources of income

Feed, bedding and veterinary costs now total £28,000 a year. The farm receives funding from the local authority towards staff wages, but raising enough money to cover other costs is a constant challenge for Claire and her team.

Entry to the farm (open every day) is free, but £1 bags of feed are sold to visitors for the animals.

A charge is made for small animal petting at weekends and bottle-feeding lambs in season. Visiting school groups and a mobile farm used to deliver educational talks bring in further income.

Meat and other farm produce are sold in the on-site shop. ""We get questioned every day about what we do, and we're very open.

“We get a lot of vegan visitors and a lot of meat eaters. I'm very much about having a conversation,"" says Claire.

With so many young people being able to learn the basics of livestock husbandry, Claire is keen to develop greater links with the farming community to create more opportunities for city people to forge careers in the industry.

Mudchute Park and Farm

Farm facts: Mudchute Park and Farm, Isle of Dogs

Tom Davis, farm manager at Mudchute Park and Farm on the Isle of Dogs, was 10 years old when he spent his first day volunteering at a city farm.

He returned home to tell his parents he wanted to be a farmer, and has never looked back.

""One of the best things about city farming is that we bridge the gap between farm and countryside,"" he says.

""For some city people, it's the only farming they see. I think we're undervalued as a resource and underused in what we can do for the industry.""

Mudchute, a stone's throw from Canary Wharf, is London's only Rare Breeds Survival Trust approved conservation centre.

Since Covid and the cost-of-living crisis, the number of daily visitors has risen to more than 1,000.

In addition, school bookings bring 16,000 children to the farm each year.

And an after-school club runs five days a week, as well as a holiday club and a young farmers' club, where children can help with farm tasks.

Challenges

Unlike Surrey Docks Farm, Mudchute (set up in 1977) is an open site. This means livestock can be accessed day and night, which brings potential issues, says Tom.

His focus in recent years, therefore, has been on encouraging the local community to have a sense of farm ownership, so they want to protect it.

Efforts are ongoing to educate people not to feed the livestock and to keep their dogs out of the enclosed grazing areas.

Having lost two cows to neospora, Tom has decided to buy in calves, rather than continue breeding Dexters.

© MAG/Judith Tooth

Although grazing is more plentiful at Mudchute, bought-in feed remains an important part of animal rations.

Options are limited, says Tom, because only a couple of merchants supply the city farms, and having to buy in bags always incurs a markup in price.

Non-bagged feed such as fodder beet would be impossible to access, he adds.

Farming is responsible for 11% of total UK greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and as much as 88% of UK ammonia emissions, according to Defra's latest Agri-climate report.

Emissions matter for several reasons - the production of GHGs such as nitrous oxide, methane and carbon dioxide is linked to global warming and climate change, while ammonia is a damaging air pollutant with harmful effects on the environment.

Air pollution is also the leading threat to public health - harmful particulates cause up to 36,000 deaths a year and it is estimated that this will cost the NHS and social care £1.6bn between 2017 and 2025.

See also: How livestock producers can cut their carbon footprint

Downward trend

Behind these headlines, Defra's report confirms that the past 30 years has seen a downward trend for most emissions from farming, with total GHGs falling by 16% and ammonia emissions by 10%.

Much of this fall has occurred in recent years and is the result of a drop in ruminant numbers and less use of synthetic fertilisers.

Emissions from producing 1 litre of milk have fallen by 22% since the 1990s, with 11% more milk being produced from 21% fewer cows.

Likewise, the GHG emissions from producing 1kg of pork have fallen by 44%. And while nitrous oxide emissions from wheat production are unchanged, wheat yields have increased - suggesting that more wheat is being produced from the same amount of nitrogen.

Given the current emphasis on net zero, it's not surprising that the Defra report also reveals that 64% of farmers considered it important to factor in GHGs when making farm business decisions, with 58% of them admitting to already taking action to reduce emissions.

Targets and legislation

The government has set a goal for the UK to be net zero by 2050, while the NFU has been more ambitious and committed to a date of 2040.

Other government targets include a reduction of 16% in ammonia emissions by 2030, compared with 2005 levels.

The Clean Air Strategy 2019 aimed to reduce air pollution from agriculture, offering support for farmers to invest in infrastructure and equipment to reduce emissions, and bringing in regulations on low-emission-farming methods and fertiliser use.

The Global Methane Pledge, which came from COP26 last year, saw the UK being one of the signatories to collectively cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030, on a 2020 baseline.

In addition, the Environment Act 2021 makes air quality one of four priorities, and requires government to set legally binding targets for England, with an additional target on fine particulate matter.

When it comes to ammonia emissions, large intensive pig and poultry units already have to obtain and comply with permit conditions set by the Environment Agency - something that could be extended to big dairy and intensive beef units before too long.

What are farmers already doing?

The three most common actions being taken by farmers to reduce emissions are:

Emissions types

There are three main GHGs produced from agriculture: nitrous oxide, methane and carbon dioxide.

Of these, nitrous oxide from soils and methane from livestock are the two biggest sources. Carbon dioxide from energy use contributes much less.

GHGs are presented and measured in units of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), which allows comparisons to be made between them.

Carbon dioxide is the most abundant gas and is used as a benchmark.

The others are converted into CO2e by multiplying the quantity of gas emitted by the global warming potential (GWP) of that gas - its heat-absorbing ability compared to carbon dioxide.

As such, carbon dioxide has a value of 1. For methane, the value is 28 and for nitrous oxide, the value is 298.

These figures are produced when a timeframe of 100 years is used to calculate emissions of GHGs.

Some scientists believe that this method misrepresents the impact of shorter-lived GHGs, such as methane, and that a 20-year time horizon is more relevant.

Others believe that GWP should be used, as it accounts for the different properties of the gases and their impact on the climate. It also allows for the fact that methane has a shorter lifespan than the others.

Methane

Agriculture is responsible for 47% of the UK's methane emissions, most of which come from livestock production via enteric fermentation.

Research has highlighted the most promising ways to reduce methane emissions from ruminants, as well as investigating their costs.

They include:

At the Roslin Institute, microbiome research has shown a direct correlation between the abundance of archaea in the rumen and the amount of methane produced by an animal.

It also showed that a cow's genetics can directly affect the environment within the rumen, making it more or less hospitable for different species of micro-organism, including the methanogenic archaea.

According to Mick Watson of the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute, cattle breeders are now using microbiome data in their breeding programmes to select for lower emitting animals.

""When farmers use this data in their breeding goals, together with feed additives that reduce methane emissions, there is an immediate fall in emissions.""

Feed additives show great promise and there are several options that can help to reduce methane production.

Of particular interest is Bovaer, which has been shown to give a 30% reduction in methane - or a 10-12% drop in GHG emissions for every kg of milk.  

Animals lost to disease each year also have a climate and emissions impact, notes Prof Watson.

""Resources are used and methane produced. By addressing animal health, along with genetics and nutrition, the sustainability of production is improved.""

Nitrous oxide

Farming is responsible for 68% of the UK's nitrous oxide emissions.

A very potent GHG, nitrous oxide mainly comes from fertiliser use, with 50% attributed to the manufacturing process and 50% to its use.

The gas is released during spreading and when on the field, through processes such as volatilisation, leaching and direct loss.

There are several actions that farmers can adopt to reduce their reliance on nitrogen fertiliser, says Emma Adams of the Farm Carbon Toolkit.

""Improving soil health, incorporating cover crops, widening the rotation and using organic sources of nitrogen are all helpful.""

Other actions that can help with nitrous oxide arising from fertiliser use includes the sourcing of fertiliser products - those coming from the UK or Europe usually have a lower emissions factor than product coming from China, for example.

Inhibitors, used to slow the conversion of ammonium to nitrate, have a role with urea products and help to improve nutrient use efficiency (NUE), which remains low with many granular fertiliser products.

""The standard figure for NUE from granular products is 60%,"" adds Ms Adams. ""Some 40% is being lost at the outset and we need to consider how to minimise these losses.""

For most, it's about application. ""Given their very high cost, it makes sense to apply fertilisers with accuracy, when the weather and plant growth is going to maximise uptake of the product.""

Carbon dioxide

Farming is responsible for just 2% of the UK's carbon dioxide emissions, most of which come from combustion.

That puts fuel use in the spotlight, whether it's for operating machinery, drying or heating.

Simply minimising cultivations and tracking fuel use in real-time can help, as can minimising the time that tractors spend idling.

Further ahead, the development of autonomous machines and the use of robotics offer improvements, while the development of hydrogen technologies, biomethane combustion and battery-based electric vehicles will all help to reduce emissions.  

Ammonia: What's the problem and what can be done?

Most of the ammonia produced by agriculture comes from the urine and faeces that is produced by livestock, although the spreading of manures and fertiliser also plays a part.

A natural gas, ammonia is released when animal excrement comes into contact with air, before reacting with other gases in the atmosphere to form toxic particles known as particulate matter.

Emissions are already subject to legal reduction targets - with a 16% reduction required by 2030 - and there are many steps that farmers can take to reduce ammonia emissions.

This involves focusing on losses at excretion from animals in buildings, as well as losses from manure storage and at spreading - with particular emphasis given to the spreading stage, so that the field operation doesn't undo any good work already achieved.

""Remember that you are dealing with a gas,"" says John Morgan, of Creedy Associates. ""You can't see it, so it's possible to save it in one part of the farm, only to lose it in another.""

Diet is the first opportunity, as ammonia production is linked to the amount of protein fed to livestock.

Wherever possible, diet protein should be matched to animal requirements, which will vary with age, sex and production system.

""Supply the feed ration as it was designed,"" he says. ""This is important with forage, which can be variable. And avoid waste by concentrating on feed conversion efficiency.""

Extended grazing also helps, because it curtails emissions. ""If you can avoid the use of yards and slurry storage, you have an advantage. Not housing livestock makes a big difference.""

A systems approach - working from a back to front view - is how he suggests farmers can get to grips with ammonia emissions.

For this reason, he highlights spreading as a key action, as mistakes made at this stage mean other benefits are lost.

Manure/slurry spreading

Putting on the right amount, in the right place, at the right time is essential, which is why a nutrient plan and soil testing should be part of the procedure, with applications matched to crop need.

Rapid incorporation of manures and slurries is a good opportunity to reduce emissions, as left on the surface they can lose as much as 50-60% of ammonia in the first 12 hours, with FYM typically losing 30% in that time.

""It's all about reducing the surface area of the slurry exposed to the air,"" explains Mr Morgan. ""This is why low-emissions spreading equipment for liquid manures can help.""

Ammonia emissions are higher when it is warm and sunny, so the best conditions for spreading are when it's overcast and dank.

Storage

Farms with enough manure and slurry storage are in a good position to carry out spreading when crops can make the best use of nutrients.

Covering stores reduces ammonia emissions - both permeable and impermeable covers can be used to good effect.

""You are only losing ammonia when the muck is in contact with the air, so covers have a role,"" says Mr Morgan.  

Slurry bags are another option and involve total containment, but they must be put in a bund.

Covering solid manures with a sheet can also help, but is seldom a popular request, notes Mr Morgan.

""As well as reducing ammonia losses, it helps to prevent the leaching of nutrients.""

Housing

Absorbing faeces and urine with bedding reduces their exposure to air and helps to reduce emissions, as does regular scraping and cleaning of buildings.

""Avoid standing urine pools on concrete wherever possible,"" says Mr Morgan.

Vegetative buffers and breaks around buildings help to reduce wind blowing through them and limit exposure to air, while air scrubbers used in poultry buildings filter the pollutants and retain the ammonia.

Another technique used is acidification, which involves lowering the pH of manures to less than 6.

This cuts ammonia emissions dramatically and the acid can be added at any stage to suit - either in-house, in-storage or in-field.

Actions that make a difference

The following on-farm actions will help to reduce emissions, according to a guide produced by Innovation for Agriculture in conjunction with WWF and Tesco. It stresses that taking a whole-farm approach, with multiple actions suitable to specific enterprise types, is the best approach for making progress:

Transition Farmer case study: Andy Bason

Emissions have already fallen at Newhouse Farm in Hampshire, as manager Andy Bason makes changes to the farming system in line with future requirements for delivering public goods.

In the past 10 years, fertiliser use has fallen by 18% and fuel use by 40%, thanks to reduced cultivations and a focus on soil health.

""It wasn't deliberate at first - we were more intent on making adjustments that secured a sustainable future for the farm,"" he says.

""But a carbon foot-printing exercise carried out a few years ago helped with identifying areas that we needed to concentrate on.""

A goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% was set when he joined the Leaf Resilient and Ready initiative, and soils have benefited from receiving chopped crop residues and growing cover crops.

As a result, organic matter levels have risen, soil function has improved and the soils are starting to cycle nutrients.

Ways of reducing total N fertiliser applications are also being investigated - although the farm doesn't use urea, with its associated ammonia emissions, Mr Bason would like to bring fertiliser costs down and be less reliant on the bag.

""We are using tissue testing, Nmin measurements and refined application timings, so that we are only applying what the crop needs at the time that it needs it,"" he says.

The full version of the Sustainable Farming Incentive 2023 for England was revealed in June, receiving a mixed reception from growers and advisers alike.

With 23 actions and a far more flexible feel, at first glance it offers much of what the farming industry has been calling for, with its ""pick and mix"" approach.

A more detailed inspection shows there are many similarities with Mid Tier Countryside Stewardship (CS), with repackaged existing options being a sizeable proportion of the ""new"" actions.

See also: Tips on establishing perennial wildflower strips for bees

While payments rates across common Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) and CS options largely mirror each other, there are some differences that growers need to be aware of before committing to either scheme (see ""Main differences: SFI v Mid Tier CS"").

Wide uptake

The aim with such a broad offer is that growers can do as much or as little as they want from a selection of in-and-around-the-field actions, says Janet Hughes of Defra, who confirms that further actions will be added next year.

""It's been designed for mass uptake and targets the sweet spot of being good for both the farm and the environment.""

SFI 2023 replaces the 2022 version, where actions were grouped in packages as standards and different ambition levels could be achieved.

The most popular were the introductory and intermediate soils standards, which paid £22/ha and £40/ha, respectively.

These standards are now closed and will not be used in future; instead, a controlled rollout of SFI 2023 will take place from August.

While they will be compensated for their initial efforts, early adopters have been left disheartened. Having planned rotations, drawn up budgets and committed to increase their level of ambition over time, they are back to square one.

Trust and confidence

""The removal of key elements from the 2022 scheme is disappointing, especially the progressive whole farm approach previously outlined,"" says Joe Spencer, partner at accountants MHA.

""It looks as though we now have a diluted version - many of the actions unveiled were already available in Countryside Stewardship.""

Changing a scheme so rapidly and with no warning doesn't give farmers confidence in Defra's strategy or vision for the industry, he notes.

Ian Gould, co-owner of Oakbank, stresses that it's early days and that many are still getting their heads round the 2023 offer.

There are new actions that will appeal to arable farmers, such as companion cropping and zero insecticide, as well as a helpful hedgerow offer and good cover crop payments, he points out.

""Companion cropping, for example, doesn't just have to be done in oilseed rape. There are exciting developments with trap cropping and inter-cropping, for example, and bicrops are grown more widely now.""

In terms of delivering for the environment, the most important thing is that the right option is used in the right place, he adds. ""Farmers must realise that they are expected to achieve the aim and the purpose with any actions they introduce.""

New SFI 2023 actions

Note: New actions available under the SFI only have been highlighted, actions already available under CS are not listed. The SFI management payment of £20/ha up to the first 50ha entered also applies to SFI 2023.

Main differences: SFI v Mid Tier CS

The greater flexibility on offer in the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) 2023 should make it easier to fit around other farming activities, especially as scheme alterations are allowed, advises Chloe Timberlake, associate farming consultant with Ceres Rural.

While future changes cannot be ruled out with a scheme in its infancy, farmers choosing whether to persist with Mid Tier Countryside Stewardship (CS) applications this year or opt for SFI 2023 instead should consider the following points, she advises.

1. Legume fallow - AB15 or NUM3

The two-year rotational legume fallow known as AB15 in CS has become a static option (NUM3) in the SFI and must be maintained as the same area in each of the three years.

""NUM3 allows flexible cutting to control blackgrass heads, as required,"" says Chloe.

In Mid Tier, AB15 specifies management by topping only within specific dates, she adds.

2. Herbal leys - GS4 or SAM3

Herbal leys, which have been a popular choice in Mid Tier CS, pay £382/ha in both schemes.

In the SFI as SAM3, they don't have to be rested and can receive artificial fertiliser, unlike their use as GS4 in Mid Tier, she reports.

3. Low-input grassland - GS2 or LIG1

For those with grazing livestock, Chloe highlights that the low-input grassland (LIG1) action in SFI allows supplementary feeding and is paid at the same rate as GS2 at £151/ha, but the latter does not allow supplementary feeding.

4. Flower-rich margins - AB8 or IPM2

IPM2 is a rotational option, which means that flower-rich margins, blocks or in-field strips can either be established in a different location each year, or maintained in the same place, she notes.

""The Mid Tier equivalent is AB8, which is non-rotational.""

5. New actions

New payments in the SFI include soil testing at £5.80/ha and an additional £95/agreement, nutrient management plan at £589/year, integrated pest management plan at £989/year, plus payments for companion cropping at £55/ha and no use of insecticide at £45/ha - none of which are available in CS.

""There's also been a return for grassy field corners and blocks in the SFI, known as AHL3, at £590/ha.""

6. Higher environmental habitats

CS has better, more rewarding options for higher value environmental habitats, reports Chloe. ""GS9 and GS10, management of wet grassland options, are paid at£353/ha and £217/ha respectively, whereas the nearest you could get to that with SFI would be £151/ha.

""In addition, options such as AB6 [enhanced over-winter stubble], AB14 [low-input cereal] and AB12 [supplementary winter feeding for farmland birds] - all of which are popular - are only available in stewardship.""

7. Historic options

There are no historic environment options within the SFI, so the revenue options for historic features in CS can be more lucrative.

""HS2 pays £476/ha where these areas are taken out of cultivation, while HS3 pays £92/ha for reduced-depth cultivations.""

8. Capital Items

Chloe's final point is that there is no longer a cap applied to standalone capital applications, which had previously been £20,000/theme.

""No capital items are available in SFI, but you can have standalone grant agreements on SFI land. In Mid Tier, they are available as either standalone or part of an agreement, but some require complementary field revenue items, such as fencing for GS2 and GS4.""

A participant in four of the options available in the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) pilot, Ben has already taken 10-12% of his land out of production, using an AB8 mix in buffer strips, field corners and other areas.

As a result, the business is receiving £152/ha when averaged across the whole farm.

Looking ahead, Ben sees the recently unveiled companion cropping payment of £55/ha, the zero-insecticide option at £45/ha and the winter cover crop payment of £129/ha all being relevant, especially as the farm is not in Countryside Stewardship.

A further £6/ha will be available through the soil testing option.

""As we are in the pilot, we aren't eligible for all of these yet, but we are allowed to introduce the zero-insecticide action,"" he says.

If direct-drilling and precision farming actions are introduced next year, as Defra has indicated, then he will be able to include more SFI options across the farm and increase revenue.

""It means we could be looking at £200-£300/ha before we've even planted a crop.""

The full version of the Sustainable Farming Incentive 2023 for England was revealed in June, receiving a mixed reception from growers and advisers alike.

With 23 actions and a far more flexible feel, at first glance it offers much of what the farming industry has been calling for, with its ""pick and mix"" approach.

A more detailed inspection shows there are many similarities with Mid Tier Countryside Stewardship (CS), with repackaged existing options being a sizeable proportion of the ""new"" actions.

See also: Tips on establishing perennial wildflower strips for bees

While payments rates across common Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) and CS options largely mirror each other, there are some differences that growers need to be aware of before committing to either scheme (see ""Main differences: SFI v Mid Tier CS"").

Wide uptake

The aim with such a broad offer is that growers can do as much or as little as they want from a selection of in-and-around-the-field actions, says Janet Hughes of Defra, who confirms that further actions will be added next year.

""It's been designed for mass uptake and targets the sweet spot of being good for both the farm and the environment.""

SFI 2023 replaces the 2022 version, where actions were grouped in packages as standards and different ambition levels could be achieved.

The most popular were the introductory and intermediate soils standards, which paid £22/ha and £40/ha, respectively.

These standards are now closed and will not be used in future; instead, a controlled rollout of SFI 2023 will take place from August.

While they will be compensated for their initial efforts, early adopters have been left disheartened. Having planned rotations, drawn up budgets and committed to increase their level of ambition over time, they are back to square one.

Trust and confidence

""The removal of key elements from the 2022 scheme is disappointing, especially the progressive whole farm approach previously outlined,"" says Joe Spencer, partner at accountants MHA.

""It looks as though we now have a diluted version - many of the actions unveiled were already available in Countryside Stewardship.""

Changing a scheme so rapidly and with no warning doesn't give farmers confidence in Defra's strategy or vision for the industry, he notes.

Ian Gould, co-owner of Oakbank, stresses that it's early days and that many are still getting their heads round the 2023 offer.

There are new actions that will appeal to arable farmers, such as companion cropping and zero insecticide, as well as a helpful hedgerow offer and good cover crop payments, he points out.

""Companion cropping, for example, doesn't just have to be done in oilseed rape. There are exciting developments with trap cropping and inter-cropping, for example, and bicrops are grown more widely now.""

In terms of delivering for the environment, the most important thing is that the right option is used in the right place, he adds. ""Farmers must realise that they are expected to achieve the aim and the purpose with any actions they introduce.""

New SFI 2023 actions

Note: New actions available under the SFI only have been highlighted, actions already available under CS are not listed. The SFI management payment of £20/ha up to the first 50ha entered also applies to SFI 2023.

Main differences: SFI v Mid Tier CS

The greater flexibility on offer in the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) 2023 should make it easier to fit around other farming activities, especially as scheme alterations are allowed, advises Chloe Timberlake, associate farming consultant with Ceres Rural.

While future changes cannot be ruled out with a scheme in its infancy, farmers choosing whether to persist with Mid Tier Countryside Stewardship (CS) applications this year or opt for SFI 2023 instead should consider the following points, she advises.

1. Legume fallow - AB15 or NUM3

The two-year rotational legume fallow known as AB15 in CS has become a static option (NUM3) in the SFI and must be maintained as the same area in each of the three years.

""NUM3 allows flexible cutting to control blackgrass heads, as required,"" says Chloe.

In Mid Tier, AB15 specifies management by topping only within specific dates, she adds.

2. Herbal leys - GS4 or SAM3

Herbal leys, which have been a popular choice in Mid Tier CS, pay £382/ha in both schemes.

In the SFI as SAM3, they don't have to be rested and can receive artificial fertiliser, unlike their use as GS4 in Mid Tier, she reports.

3. Low-input grassland - GS2 or LIG1

For those with grazing livestock, Chloe highlights that the low-input grassland (LIG1) action in SFI allows supplementary feeding and is paid at the same rate as GS2 at £151/ha, but the latter does not allow supplementary feeding.

4. Flower-rich margins - AB8 or IPM2

IPM2 is a rotational option, which means that flower-rich margins, blocks or in-field strips can either be established in a different location each year, or maintained in the same place, she notes.

""The Mid Tier equivalent is AB8, which is non-rotational.""

5. New actions

New payments in the SFI include soil testing at £5.80/ha and an additional £95/agreement, nutrient management plan at £589/year, integrated pest management plan at £989/year, plus payments for companion cropping at £55/ha and no use of insecticide at £45/ha - none of which are available in CS.

""There's also been a return for grassy field corners and blocks in the SFI, known as AHL3, at £590/ha.""

6. Higher environmental habitats

510,"How moving to the US led to an 800-cow business","https://www.fwi.co.uk/livestock/dairy/how-moving-to-the-us-led-to-an-800-cow-business","How moving to the US led to an 800-cow business

Crawford Porter was 15 when he first fell in love with dairy farming in the US on a study trip with his dad.

But it would take family tragedy and overcoming the challenges presented by Covid before he finally found the courage to move there permanently.

Crawford, who now milks 800 cows in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, originally hails from County Down in Northern Ireland, where he milked 80 cows on his family's 40ha (100-acre) farm.

See also: 6 things I learned from visiting US ""˜mega-dairies'

His mother, Elma, passed away when he was 17, and after completing a joinery certification he returned home to farm with his father, Jackie, at the age of 19.

At the time, they ran 80 Angus suckler cows because their former 120-cow dairy herd had been ravaged by TB.

Farm facts

After his father died just two years later, Crawford worked in Australia for two years before returning home and re-establishing a 100-cow dairy herd.

However, frustration with sky-high land values and a shortage of labour left him longing to return to the US.

""It was very hard to get land and labour at home. I was putting everything I had into the farm, but I was stagnant,"" he recalls.

Making the move

Fate struck when he bumped into old friends in Northern Ireland that had moved to the US to farm, and it reignited his hunger to uproot.

""I got in touch with Dairy Realty, which specialises in selling dairy farms in the US and they put me in contact with George Bailey [originally] from Newtownards, who had relocated to the US with his wife, Joanne, 14 years ago.

""He took me under his wing and has been a fantastic mentor.""

Crawford decided to sell his cows and work for George in the US, but Covid hit and he was forced to return to Northern Ireland after just three months.

""During this time, a farm in Milwaukee came on the market and, on impulse, Crawford decided to buy it, for $10,000/acre (£8,000/acre) and sell his family farm.

""I had never seen the farm before I bought it, so it was a huge leap of faith, but George and other friends, Jim and Alison Thompson, viewed it, and I trusted their opinion.""

© Crawford Porter

The home farm sold for £17,000/acre on the same day the offer was accepted on the new Milwaukee one on 17 November 2021, but difficulty in obtaining a visa meant it would take nine months before Crawford was able to return to the US and follow his dream.

""It was very hard trying to get a visa during Covid because everyone was working from home, and I couldn't get through [on the phone]. I only did because I wouldn't take no for an answer,"" he says.

Crawford moved on 1 January 2022. He bought 300 cows and spent £243,000 upgrading the 24/24 rapid exit parlour and concreting.

He has borrowed money but says the bank has been supportive. He started milking three months later, on 1 April.

He says it is much easier to grow the business in the US than in Northern Ireland and, because he has a bigger herd, he can justify more labour. Six full-time members of staff are employed, which allows Crawford to spend more time off farm.

""The bigger you get, the easier it gets. I remember milking 80 cows in Northern Ireland and the weight of the world being on my shoulders and on my mind.

""I was doing everything all the time with absolutely no help, aside from the odd relief milker every second Sunday,"" he admits.

Farm setup

In the US, land availability keeps it cheap and there is no TB to drive up the cost of cows, with animals averaging $2,000 (£1,600), he adds.

Heifers are reared at a satellite farm until six months of age for $3.60/day (£2.90/day) and are then trucked to a feedlot in Kansas, where they are served and brought back one month before calving, at 23 months.

Rearing costs at the feedlot total $2.80/day (£2.20/day).

A double Ov-Sync programme is used on the cows, with the herd's pregnancy rate averaging 40%.

The farm comprises two sand-bedded cubicle sheds with headlocks, a calving barn and the parlour, which is currently being extended by adding a further four stalls each side to make a 32/32 rapid exit setup.

A flood-wash system is used to move slurry, where the sand is deposited in a separate lane to settle in a concrete area to dry and be recycled.

© Crawford Porter

The biggest overhead, much like in the UK, is feed. However, electricity costs are cheaper than in the UK, at $3,000/month (£2,427/month) and two wells supply the farm's water requirements.

About 81ha (200 acres) of maize and triticale is grown on owned land, with the rest bought in.

Last year, Crawford trialled double cropping: growing triticale after the maize harvest and with slurry applied twice using a dribble bar in the autumn and February.

It yielded 17t/ha as fed, with maize direct-drilled afterwards. This is fed mainly to far-off dry cows alongside maize in equal proportions.

Future

The move to the US has not been without its challenges, but Crawford says it has enabled him to focus on the bigger picture.

""It has been a massive learning curve - managing staff and the increased number of cows,"" he says.

""What I like about farming over here is that if you make a small change, it makes a big difference to the business because of the scale.

""When I milked 80 cows in Northern Ireland, I didn't have time to focus on the business or seize opportunities that were passing me by.""

Crawford has recently set up a machinery sales business, importing tractors from the UK, but he has big ambitions for the future.

© Crawford Porter

""I want to milk 3,000 cows on this site and have multiple sites in later years; I have just purchased 300 cows and have enough stalls to accommodate this,"" he says.

But for now, he is taking it one step at a time and hopes his parents would be pleased he has moved.

""I'm really grateful to the Baileys and Thompsons for helping me get to where I am today. My mother was a really nice lady and I think she would be happy that I am happy.

""Dad loved the US when we went on the trip so I think he would be pleased, too.""

Researchers in Northern Ireland are exploring how manures can be more than just a waste product by helping reduce overall carbon footprints and associated emissions.

The work, carried out by the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (Afbi), forms part of the NI government’s plans to reach net zero.

Agriculture is the country's biggest greenhouse gas emitter - responsible for 27% of all emissions in 2020, according to the Statistics and Research Agency.

See also: How Cornish farmer cut feed emissions but maintained output

These emissions are made up of methane, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide - all three of which are often associated with livestock production and, in particular, the management and handling of manure and slurry.

""Agriculture is such an important sector to Northern Ireland. Livestock production is what we do,"" says Chris Johnston from Afbi's agri-environment branch.

""We've got more animals than people, so [what we're focusing on] is [reducing] emissions to air and emissions to water. Our soils are also filling up with nutrients, which isn't particularly useful for soil or water quality either.""

Financially, it is uneconomic too, he adds: ""If you think about it, we're just filling up [soils] with more and more valuable nutrients.

“What we want is a situation where livestock manures are managed in a way that we can produce energy, recycle the nutrients from them by extracting nitrogen and phosphorus and potentially recirculate those products back into agriculture or elsewhere.

""Phosphorus, for example, is one nutrient we have far too much of. We import a lot - in feed more than fertiliser - and we export less than we import.

""So, the question is: what can we do to try to make livestock agriculture sustainable into the future?""

Nitrogen losses

Afbi's John McIlroy adds that the nitrogen cycle and losses associated with it have also been fundamental drivers behind the research.

""A lot of our research is on emissions into the air, and in particular we've focused on ammonia emissions in recent years because it's a very significant pathway for nitrogen loss - it's one of the greatest losses within our nitrogen cycle.

""So essentially, we're bringing nitrogen fertiliser onto farms and paying a lot of money for it - particularly in light of recent political events and the cost of nitrogen fertiliser - but we're losing a significant proportion of that as ammonia.""

Not only is that an environmental hazard, but it also results in financial losses for farmers. ""That [lost] nitrogen is nitrogen that, had it been stabilised and retained within the fertiliser, would have made its way into the soil [to be] used by the crop.""

With those challenges in mind, the system in place at Afbi’s Hillsborough research centre is based around using anaerobic digestion (AD) and slurry separation technology to make better use of slurry.

While the technology itself is nothing new, Dr McIlroy says it is how this technology - and the subsequent manure and by-products - can be used that makes it interesting from an emissions reduction perspective.

""It's a holistic system that we've been developing at our platform at Afbi Hillsborough, where we have control of the emissions through treatment of the manures.""

So how does it work and how could the system be beneficial for Northern Ireland’s farmers in the long term?

Anaerobic digestion

The first stage of the process is using the slurry from Afbi's own farm, which is “recycled” via the on-site anaerobic digester.

Animals extract the nutrients they need from feed and grass during digestion. But there is still a residual energy source in the organic matter carbon in the resulting slurry, Mr Johnston explains.

""So what we're doing is forcing more methane out under an anaerobic environment - anaerobically digesting it and pushing more methane and carbon dioxide out.

""We're adding extra material to it as well, to up the amount of methane, because it’s the methane that is the energy molecule we are after.""

This enables the reuse of as much material as possible in terms of the carbon, recovering the maximum amount of energy in a final digestate product, which can then be used as a fertiliser, he explains.

""It's really the same thing as the [unprocessed] slurry, but it will have changed chemically to a degree because the carbon will have reduced slightly due to us converting some to carbon dioxide and taking the methane out.

""There will [also] be higher available nitrogen because of the different bacterial processes that go on within the AD plant.

“All the phosphorous, potassium and nitrogen is still there - really all we've done is take out some carbon, oxygen and hydrogen.”

Though the composition may be similar, Dr McIlroy warns that, to keep emissions as low as possible, further processing is needed after AD.

""If you compare digestate to slurry, there's higher available nitrogen - the nitrogen has changed from organic nitrogen to an inorganic form called ammoniacal nitrogen.

""That ammoniacal nitrogen is more predisposed to ammonia loss.

“The pH of the digestate is also increased slightly when compared with the slurry, so both of those things make digestate more predisposed to ammonia loss than slurry, which is why we really need to have nutrient management technology after AD.""

This could be covering slurry stores or applying the materials to land using low-emission spreading methods.

This technique is something that has been in place at Afbi Hillsborough since 2019 and has been proven to reduce ammonia emissions, adds Dr McIlroy.

Issues such as phosphorous loading on to agricultural fields, and the problems associated with that, also strengthen the argument for this post-digestion management.

Separation

The next step is separation. ""This is a physical process whereby solids and liquids will be split to the greatest degree possible - and there are lots of different technologies that can be implemented [to do that],"" says Mr Johnston.

Afbi is using a screw-press separator, which is the most common type used in agriculture and works like a pressurised sieve to separate materials.

""The idea is to have as much of the phosphorous in the solid fraction and as much of nitrogen in the liquid fraction - that's the general goal of the separation process,"" explains Dr McIlroy.

© Afbi

""The reasoning for this,” explains Mr Johnston, “is that we want to remove some of the phosphorus from the land base, but we want to leave the [nitrogen] that's expensive to buy - there's no point removing all the fertiliser and having to buy it in through a very greenhouse gas-hungry process.""

It is estimated that this technology has the potential to reduce total phosphorus content from slurry or digestate by 20-40%.  

Future applications

What happens next with these solids and liquids is an area still being investigated by Afbi.

""This is the bit where we're now trying to find out what the best route for Northern Ireland agriculture is,"" explains Mr Johnston. 

With regards to the liquid fraction, management can be as simple as spreading it onto land via a trailing hose or a trailing shoe, says Dr McIlroy.

""You'd reduce a lot of the emissions from [doing] that, but you would still have some.""

There are a number of nitrogen separation technologies that can reduce emissions further, but these are currently only available on a large scale and require further investigation.

""By doing that [nitrogen separation], we're able to create a nitrogen fertiliser that can be reused and redistributed. But we're also removing the environmental impact of that nitrogen as we're capturing, managing and saving it,"" says Mr Johnston.

Acidification of the liquid fraction could also help stabilise the nitrogen, which would again reduce emissions when it's spread on the land, says Dr McIlroy.

""Another example is an acid-stripping system, where you use a sulphuric acid to scrub the ammonia from that liquid fraction, and what you end up with is a liquid ammonium sulphate solution - like a liquid fertiliser - which reduces nitrogen losses.""

There are fewer available options for the solid fraction. ""People often forget that when you separate, you have a big pile of solids to deal with as well as the liquid fraction,” he adds.

“On farms in Northern Ireland, particularly big farms, it's likely that those solids would be destined either for further processing or for export off that farm, as the phosphorous balance might already be exceeded.""

Through further processing, there is the possibility that these solids could be used to make a compost-like substance for horticulture, for example, but Mr Johnston says this is where there are more questions than answers at the moment.

""The question is: what are the most suitable markets? We hear lots about removing peat from horticultural products, so it may be that this is a good alternative,"" he says.

However, before this becomes an option for livestock farmers, more needs to be understood about the biosecurity, regulations, nutrition, and value as a fertiliser.

Gas potential

The use of biomethane captured from slurry is a huge area that offers potential to farmers, wider agriculture and associated industries, says the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute’s (Afbi’s) Chris Johnston.

A recent paper co-authored by Afbi examined the potential for Northern Ireland livestock and agriculture contributing to displacing the import of fossil gas.

Though much of Northern Ireland's fuel is still based on oil sources, there is a new gas network that is currently distributing 6,500GWh (gigawatt-hour) of gas, explains Mr Johnston.

About 80% of this could be displaced directly from biogas produced through anaerobic digestion, according to economic modelling based on the research findings.

Underused grass and other energy crops could all be co-digested with the slurry, highlighting the huge potential for agriculture to be a big part of the solution for decarbonising energy in Northern Ireland, believes Mr Johnston.

""There's the opportunity to decarbonise domestic properties and industry transport, and then there's methane tractors, too - we've had one at Afbi to try - so it does seem to be a real opportunity and a way forward to try to make better use of biomethane.""

6 key measures for livestock emissions reduction

A new report gives priority recommendations to focus the ruminant livestock sector in its bid to achieve net zero.

At the top of the list is a call for the standardisation of greenhouse gas (GHG) data to establish baselines and enable benchmarking for carbon footprint audits. Such an “evidence-based” approach would allow for a better assessment of the success of GHG reduction strategies.

""The ruminant livestock industry has a critical role to play in achieving the ambition of net-zero emissions by 2050,"" says Jayne Brookman, of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology Food (EIT Food), which published the report.

Called Achieving net zero targets in the ruminant livestock industry in the UK and Ireland, the study brought together experts from government and non-government organisations.

Key stakeholders from the wider agri-food industry included the AHDB, Teagasc, and the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute.

""For the ruminant livestock industry to transition to net zero, input and support will be required from all players along the supply chain, as well as adoption by farmers,"" says Ms Brookman.

""We hope that the recommendations will help a wide range of stakeholders, from farmers to investors and policymakers, to take meaningful action that will support the ruminant livestock industry to achieve net zero.""

End of tenancy issues for those with longer-term tenancies under the Agricultural Holdings Act (AHA) 1986 will vary, depending on the terms of the tenancy agreement.

However, even with a written agreement there can be grey areas. Agricultural lawyer Peter Snodgrass of Shakespeare Martineau says tenants can expect some landlords to push boundaries to bring tenancies to an end, or during end-of-tenancy negotiations.

See also: Top tips on avoiding dilapidations disputes for tenants

Areas to pay attention to include:

Case B notices to quit

When properly drafted and validly served, these allow a landlord to recover possession of land or buildings when they have planning permission for an alternative non-agricultural use of that land and/or the buildings.

The case of Kirkby v Baker in 2020 concerned a landlord's attempt to use a Case B notice to quit on the grounds of permitted development under the planning rules (rather than the landlord having applied for and obtained planning permission) for a non-agricultural use.

The tenant challenged this and won, with permitted development rights found not to be grounds for service of a Case B notice.

However, Peter believes the point to notice is that a ground for possession that had hardly been used before was researched and tried out by the landlord's lawyer.

""Where planning is needed and a Case B notice is likely, or has already been served, the tenant can get involved in the planning process and explain to the council the impact of the loss of the land, holding or building on their business if planning is granted,"" says Peter.

He also warns tenants to be aware of ""try-on"" Case B notices, where the new use may not be truly non-agricultural, for example horse-grazing for a livery business, or a wildflower scheme including livestock grazing.

Tree planting is another use for which landlords may seek to terminate a tenancy. Case B notices cannot usually be used, as tree planting does not require planning permission.

However, there is another route, which would (among other things) require that the landlord is acting fairly and reasonably in seeking possession.

A special area is the provision of land for biodiversity net gain, which obliges developers to achieve a 10% biodiversity uplift in association with their sites from January next year.

If land associated with a site is included within the ""red line"" of a planning application, it may be argued in future that this land is effectively part of the consented planning, and therefore enable a valid Case B notice, suggests Peter.

Planning granted

""It is sometimes tricky to judge at what point a tenant should get involved in the process,"" he says.

""Each situation, the characters and the history, are different, and advice should be taken. But generally, if a landlord is going for planning, it's best to talk to them about it.""

Once planning is granted, however, all is not lost. In one case in which he was involved, the grant of planning consent meant the tenant faced losing both land and his home.

However, the tenant took the planning decision to judicial review and won on the grounds that the impact on their business had not been taken into account, as it should have been. The tenant remained in occupation.

Statutory compensation 

When an AHA tenant loses land because planning permission has been granted for a non-agricultural use, the tenant is entitled by law to compensation from the landlord, equivalent to five or six years' rent on the land lost.

Tenant's improvements are also compensated, subject to satisfying the tests in the Agricultural Holdings Act.

Retirement

Some tenants without successors or coming to the end of the final generation of a succession tenancy may, for a variety of reasons, want to retire before the full term has run.

Whether this might lead to a surrender payment to the tenant will depend on the circumstances and how the landlord will benefit from recovering possession of the land and buildings, says Peter.

""Some landlords may simply not be interested, others will be.

""But whatever you do, don't burn your boats by serving a tenant's notice to quit because then you have lost negotiating power over the value of an early surrender - or giving up the tenancy at all.""

Whatever the circumstances of an AHA tenancy ending, read the tenancy agreement very carefully and check for any clauses it may contain on repairs and dilapidations.

These will guide the obligations on both tenant and landlord.

If an AHA tenancy agreement does not make clear who is responsible for a repair, then what is known as the model clauses apply.

These are regulations that apply to all AHA 1986 tenancies. They can also apply to farm business tenancies (FBTs) if they are expressly mentioned in the written agreement.

They set out the obligations on both landlord and tenant to maintain, repair and insure fixed equipment, including buildings.

This does not preclude landlords and tenants from negotiating and agreeing repair provisions outside of the model clause provisions.

Where the model clauses and the agreement conflict, the written agreement takes precedence.

Where the model clauses apply, there is an option for the tenant to apply for a building to be declared redundant, which removes any repairing liability on the tenant.

""This would be in specific circumstances where the building is clearly no longer suitable for modern agricultural uses,"" says Peter.

""A good example would be small brick and tile buildings, expensive to repair, but of little use in modern farming.""

Consent

A further end-of-tenancy consideration is to look for any landlord's consent for tenant's improvements  or ""deals"" done, for example on buildings. These might be diary notes, letters, or more formal documents.

Where a tenant's building remains at the end of a tenancy, even if there was a technical defect in a compensation claim, there may be an opportunity in some cases to negotiate a payment to the tenant, says Peter, if it was clearly unfair in all the circumstances for the landlord to simply take it over for no consideration. 

Counterclaim

It is also important for the tenant to consider whether they may have a counterclaim for any breaches of the landlord's obligations.

The tenant would have to show their loss caused by the years of disrepair, because of the landlord's failure to repair.

""It's quite common to counterclaim against the landlord and the sums involved are offset against what a tenant might owe for dilapidations.""

Dilapidations

For a longer article focusing on dilapidation questions, go to Top tips on dilapidations for tenants

Land-use question at tenancy end

The question of whether a tenant must reinstate pasture to arable sometimes arises at the end of a tenancy.

For an obligation to exist requiring reinstatement of pasture to arable, there would have to be a clause in the tenancy agreement requiring the tenant to maintain certain fields as arable, says Peter.

""If there was no such clause (and in many tenancies there is none), then no reinstatement would be necessary. The model clauses 2015 do not impose this restriction. 

""Sections 14 and 15 of AHA 1986 provide for some flexibility for tenants where there are restrictive clauses in the tenancy agreement, but these work in the tenant's favour.

""It is usual to have an 'agriculture only' clause, but that would not of course prevent changing from arable to pasture.""

Farm business tenancies

These are usually contractual terms with a fixed end point, so the tenant cannot normally contest a notice to quit on an FBT.

Conversely, unless the tenant is in breach of the agreement, the landlord cannot force them to leave before the term ends.

""However, if the landlord wants the tenant to leave before the term ends, then it's a matter of negotiation and any premium paid to the tenant to surrender will be related to what the landlord hopes to get out of that early surrender,"" says Peter.

Regarding repairing obligations and dilapidations, FBTs by their nature offer freedom of contract.

""But if the tenancy agreement is silent on this, then the implied terms on a tenant are to not to commit waste or damage to the land and buildings, beyond wear and tear.

""For example, they must not trash the holding by using non-approved chemicals, create any other pollution, or damage fences and gates.

""Unless the tenancy agreement provides for anything further, buildings must be kept wind and watertight.""

It is advisable to engage early with the landlord once an FBT tenant knows the tenancy is ending, says Peter. ""For FBTs, arbitration is costly and often inefficient.""

Housing challenges of farming retirement

A lack of housing and pension provision prevents a good number of tenants from retiring when they might wish to, or when it might be best for health or other reasons to do so.

Peter Snodgrass, who is secretary and a trustee of the Addington Fund, points out that the charity is keen to hear from anyone in this position.

The fund buys houses to rent at affordable rates to retired farmers, or those who, for other reasons, have had to leave their farming homes.

It takes pains to try to ensure that these are in a suitable area that fits with the person or the family's needs.

Processing potato growers had a positive experience with a new potato sprout suppressant last year, with the product achieving good sprout control in very challenging circumstances.

However, pre-pack growers are worried about its use after treatment in some cold stores and on some varieties was linked to costly tuber defects during its first season of use.

See also: Morrisons pilot to cover cost of growing potatoes and carrots

Approval

New plant protection product approvals are increasingly rare, so in August 2022 when 1,4Sight (1,4-dimethylnaptheline or DMN) was approved for use in potato stores, it was warmly welcomed by the potato industry.

Following its approval, 1,4-Sight was widely used during the 2022-23 storage period and, in most cases, users were very happy with results, particularly in bulk-stored processing varieties held at temperatures of 7-8C.

One such user is Simon Alexander of SA Consulting, who specialises in potato agronomy and manages seed and processing potato stores across East Anglia.

He used it in all stores, except where ethylene was requested by processors McCain and Albert Bartlett. Every letter of the label and technical guide was followed before and after application.

The label allows for up to 120ml of product to be applied per crop and Simon made no more than three applications of 20ml (60ml in total) to potatoes in his long-term stores.

""Last year was a tricky season and DMN performed as well, if not better, than I would've expected of CIPC in similar conditions.

""It is promising how long crops held on at the backend between the last DMN application and crop movement. In the stores where we are allowed to use it again this season, we certainly will,"" he says.

Fresh problems

Lincolnshire-based Simon Faulkner of SDF Agriculture looks after a mix of processing and pre-pack stores and had an equally positive experience with DMN where it was used on crops destined for processing.

However, some pre-pack growers saw incidences of external and internal defects in some varieties held in their cold-box stores - typically kept at 3-4C - and fogged with DMN.

Melody and Mozart were the worst-affected varieties. Conversely, varieties such as King Edward and Maris Piper, grown for the same market, seemed to avoid any of the same issues.

Samples of affected potatoes from some stores were sent to Fera's plant clinic near York to check for bacterial or fungal pathogens, but these came back negative in all cases.

While some managed to grade out affected tubers and pack the majority of crop for supermarkets, others had significant tonnage that dropped straight into the stockfeed pile, resulting in significant final losses.

Farmers Weekly understands that a preliminary notice of legal proceedings against fogging contractors has been served, so discussing case specifics is not advised.

It should also be stated that so far, there is no concrete link between the defects and DMN use.

However, until there is conclusive evidence either way, Simon says it will be extremely difficult for any potato storage adviser to recommend the product in cold stores, despite manufacturer advice remaining unchanged.

""I won't be using it on the fresh side. On the processing side, I don't think anyone has any concerns and it worked very well,"" he says.

Tom Green of Lincolnshire-based fogging specialist Stored Crop Conservation has taken a similar stance on applications.

""We would like to use it in all stores, not just processing, as it's a great product to apply, was very effective last year at controlling sprouting and our customers have reported less weight loss with DMN compared with alternatives,"" he says.

Condensation risk

So, what might have gone wrong? Scorch of tubers is always a risk when hot-fogging stores and condensation occurs at or soon after application.

There is plenty of independent and manufacturer advice on how to reduce this risk - measures include minimising crop, fridge (if present) and store fabric temperature differentials ahead of application.

However, with the most severe defects, the cause and any mitigating guidance is less clear.

Simon believes that last year's advice to apply ""as soon as the crop is dry"" might be a factor, as tubers might not have been cured enough at application.

Curing is the process of healing any minor nicks or bruises and the thickening of skins. Speed of curing is largely influenced by tuber temperature (warmer means faster) and physiological age.

Last year, crops were heat and moisture stressed at stages throughout the growing period and sprouting in some varieties was evident in the field.

Furthermore, conditions were less than ideal for the application of maleic hydrazide - which for many forms the first line of defence against sprouting in store - so some farms didn't apply or feared uptake had been compromised.

This triggered a knee-jerk reaction to treat in store early, but this isn't always necessary, particularly in fresh stores where potatoes are cooled and then held at 3-4C, which limits dormancy break anyway.

""It isn't unusual to see sprouting in the field in some varieties and, generally, if you get them into store, dry, cure and cool them, that initial sprout drops off anyway. The condition of the crop won't get any worse.

""For me, the minimum period from loading to DMN treatment would be six to seven weeks. If you've used Fazor or Crown MH [both maleic hydrazide], there shouldn't be any rush anyway. Let the MH do its job.""

Ongoing investigation

Ajay Jina of manufacturer DormFresh, who provides technical support to DMN users across the UK and Europe, says the company is working with businesses to establish if there is a link between the defects and DMN.

He says if any adverse interaction is confirmed, it will be in the company's best interests to advise on how to use the product safely and effectively and avoid any further issues.

However, Ajay adds that the product has been used in cold stores in other countries since 2015 and there have been no problems categorically linked to DMN use.

Until then, he says the advice remains the same as it was last year, which is clear on the label and in the product's technical manual.

This means sticking to the mantra ""dry, cured and no condensation"". If this is followed, Ajay says there should not be any risk using the product in any crop, fresh or processing.

""We continue to work closely with contractors to advise on the best application techniques and improve understanding of when and where to apply the product. We also have an additional member of staff in the technical team to help give advice and visit stores.

""The UK industry has had one full season with DMN and will build experience and confidence in the product as we move forward,"" he adds.

Treatment advice

Tom says where growers are able to use DMN this year, correct store setup is essential. The store should have its refrigeration unit turned off 24 hours before fogging and fans left running to even out store temperature.

As with mint and orange oil, the introduction of the hot fog should be as far away from the point of entry to the store as possible, giving the vapour time to mix evenly with the air before reaching the crop.

Introduction of the vapour should be measured - just 0.5 litres/min - due to the very low dose rate. Fans should also be run slowly on an inverter/speed controller during application.

Stores need to be sealed for 24-48 hours after application to ensure good uptake into tubers.

""The better sealed the store is at setup, the better the efficacy from each application, so ensure you check for leaks before any treatment,"" he concludes.

French view - trials hint at DMN treatment risks and how to avoid them

French crop research institute Arvalis conducted controlled trials with DMN last year and results shed some light on the risk factors associated with any potential post-treatment tuber damage.

The product was first registered in France in 2017, but with little demand and no distribution partners, there were only a handful of commercial experiments until CIPC was withdrawn from the market in 2020.

Arvalis researcher Michel Martin tells Farmers Weekly that once the product was used widely, reports of defects in cold box stores after treatment with DMN started coming to light.

Like in the UK, evidence suggests there was some external necrosis around the rose end and eyes of tubers, with some internal damage spreading out from those lesions internally into the flesh. Ambient bulk stores holding processing varieties were unaffected.

Michel says there was an investigation by the manufacturer and industry to find common factors.

These are reported to be cold stores, thin-skinned varieties and introducing the DMN fog too quickly and too close to the crop.

DormFresh did update its advice based on the findings as a result, particularly around the introduction of DMN into stores.

© Arvalis

Storage trials

The reported issues inspired Michel and his team at Arvalis to set up some trials during the 2022-23 storage period to look at the causes and effects of damage in more detail.

Stocks of four varieties - Galante, Agata, Charlotte and Jazzy - were treated with DMN at a rate of 15ml/t. The variables investigated included:

The treatments showed some differences, with variety and tuber maturity being clear factors.

No defects were recorded in any of the four varieties when tubers were mature.

However, where they were immature - meaning skins had not fully thickened - crop effects were seen in thin-skinned varieties Agata and Charlotte.

When considering temperature, little or no crop effects were recorded at 7C, with almost all confined to tubers held at 4C.

Although less clear-cut, overirrigation and condensation events did seem to add to a culmination of risk factors that could result in damage to tubers when fogging with DMN.

Michel stresses that after just one year's trials, no concrete conclusions can be drawn from the work and the study will continue into the 2023-24 storage period.

Modified advice

However, Arvalis has modified its advice on DMN use for this year, urging farmers not to treat too quickly after loading stores.

This will ensure tubers are dry and have an adequate curing period before the introduction of product.

Spending sufficient time internally recirculating air before hot-fogging is also crucial to ensure an even temperature through the building and crop.

He recommends switching internal recirculation on again a few hours after treatment to maintain this even temperature, before any external ventilation begins 48 hours after the treatment.

Michel acknowledges that DMN is a dormancy enhancer, so its optimum timing is before any dormancy break in the store.

This means delaying treatment enough to ensure adequate drying and curing, but before any buds appear.

Michel concludes that loading stores quickly, evenly and with varieties with a similar dormancy profile helps.

Like other advisers, he believes an effective treatment of maleic hydrazide before haulm destruction is key, where possible, to provide early residual control.

Samples of affected potatoes from some stores were sent to Fera's plant clinic near York to check for bacterial or fungal pathogens, but these came back negative in all cases.

While some managed to grade out affected tubers and pack the majority of crop for supermarkets, others had significant tonnage that dropped straight into the stockfeed pile, resulting in significant final losses.

Farmers Weekly understands that a preliminary notice of legal proceedings against fogging contractors has been served, so discussing case specifics is not advised.

It should also be stated that so far, there is no concrete link between the defects and DMN use.

However, until there is conclusive evidence either way, Simon says it will be extremely difficult for any potato storage adviser to recommend the product in cold stores, despite manufacturer advice remaining unchanged.

""I won't be using it on the fresh side. On the processing side, I don't think anyone has any concerns and it worked very well,"" he says.

Tom Green of Lincolnshire-based fogging specialist Stored Crop Conservation has taken a similar stance on applications.

""We would like to use it in all stores, not just processing, as it's a great product to apply, was very effective last year at controlling sprouting and our customers have reported less weight loss with DMN compared with alternatives,"" he says.

Condensation risk

So, what might have gone wrong? Scorch of tubers is always a risk when hot-fogging stores and condensation occurs at or soon after application.

There is plenty of independent and manufacturer advice on how to reduce this risk - measures include minimising crop, fridge (if present) and store fabric temperature differentials ahead of application.

However, with the most severe defects, the cause and any mitigating guidance is less clear.

Simon believes that last year's advice to apply ""as soon as the crop is dry"" might be a factor, as tubers might not have been cured enough at application.

Curing is the process of healing any minor nicks or bruises and the thickening of skins. Speed of curing is largely influenced by tuber temperature (warmer means faster) and physiological age.

Last year, crops were heat and moisture stressed at stages throughout the growing period and sprouting in some varieties was evident in the field.

Furthermore, conditions were less than ideal for the application of maleic hydrazide - which for many forms the first line of defence against sprouting in store - so some farms didn't apply or feared uptake had been compromised.

This triggered a knee-jerk reaction to treat in store early, but this isn't always necessary, particularly in fresh stores where potatoes are cooled and then held at 3-4C, which limits dormancy break anyway.

""It isn't unusual to see sprouting in the field in some varieties and, generally, if you get them into store, dry, cure and cool them, that initial sprout drops off anyway. The condition of the crop won't get any worse.

""For me, the minimum period from loading to DMN treatment would be six to seven weeks. If you've used Fazor or Crown MH [both maleic hydrazide], there shouldn't be any rush anyway. Let the MH do its job.""

Ongoing investigation

Ajay Jina of manufacturer DormFresh, who provides technical support to DMN users across the UK and Europe, says the company is working with businesses to establish if there is a link between the defects and DMN.

He says if any adverse interaction is confirmed, it will be in the company's best interests to advise on how to use the product safely and effectively and avoid any further issues.

However, Ajay adds that the product has been used in cold stores in other countries since 2015 and there have been no problems categorically linked to DMN use.

Until then, he says the advice remains the same as it was last year, which is clear on the label and in the product's technical manual.

This means sticking to the mantra ""dry, cured and no condensation"". If this is followed, Ajay says there should not be any risk using the product in any crop, fresh or processing.

""We continue to work closely with contractors to advise on the best application techniques and improve understanding of when and where to apply the product. We also have an additional member of staff in the technical team to help give advice and visit stores.

""The UK industry has had one full season with DMN and will build experience and confidence in the product as we move forward,"" he adds.

Treatment advice

Tom says where growers are able to use DMN this year, correct store setup is essential. The store should have its refrigeration unit turned off 24 hours before fogging and fans left running to even out store temperature.

As with mint and orange oil, the introduction of the hot fog should be as far away from the point of entry to the store as possible, giving the vapour time to mix evenly with the air before reaching the crop.

Introduction of the vapour should be measured - just 0.5 litres/min - due to the very low dose rate. Fans should also be run slowly on an inverter/speed controller during application.

Stores need to be sealed for 24-48 hours after application to ensure good uptake into tubers.

""The better sealed the store is at setup, the better the efficacy from each application, so ensure you check for leaks before any treatment,"" he concludes.

French view - trials hint at DMN treatment risks and how to avoid them

French crop research institute Arvalis conducted controlled trials with DMN last year and results shed some light on the risk factors associated with any potential post-treatment tuber damage.

The product was first registered in France in 2017, but with little demand and no distribution partners, there were only a handful of commercial experiments until CIPC was withdrawn from the market in 2020.

Arvalis researcher Michel Martin tells Farmers Weekly that once the product was used widely, reports of defects in cold box stores after treatment with DMN started coming to light.

Like in the UK, evidence suggests there was some external necrosis around the rose end and eyes of tubers, with some internal damage spreading out from those lesions internally into the flesh. Ambient bulk stores holding processing varieties were unaffected.

Michel says there was an investigation by the manufacturer and industry to find common factors.

These are reported to be cold stores, thin-skinned varieties and introducing the DMN fog too quickly and too close to the crop.

DormFresh did update its advice based on the findings as a result, particularly around the introduction of DMN into stores.

Storage trials

The reported issues inspired Michel and his team at Arvalis to set up some trials during the 2022-23 storage period to look at the causes and effects of damage in more detail.

Stocks of four varieties - Galante, Agata, Charlotte and Jazzy - were treated with DMN at a rate of 15ml/t. The variables investigated included:

The treatments showed some differences, with variety and tuber maturity being clear factors.

No defects were recorded in any of the four varieties when tubers were mature.

However, where they were immature - meaning skins had not fully thickened - crop effects were seen in thin-skinned varieties Agata and Charlotte.

When considering temperature, little or no crop effects were recorded at 7C, with almost all confined to tubers held at 4C.

Although less clear-cut, overirrigation and condensation events did seem to add to a culmination of risk factors that could result in damage to tubers when fogging with DMN.

Michel stresses that after just one year's trials, no concrete conclusions can be drawn from the work and the study will continue into the 2023-24 storage period.

Modified advice

However, Arvalis has modified its advice on DMN use for this year, urging farmers not to treat too quickly after loading stores.

This will ensure tubers are dry and have an adequate curing period before the introduction of product.

Spending sufficient time internally recirculating air before hot-fogging is also crucial to ensure an even temperature through the building and crop.

He recommends switching internal recirculation on again a few hours after treatment to maintain this even temperature, before any external ventilation begins 48 hours after the treatment.

Michel acknowledges that DMN is a dormancy enhancer, so its optimum timing is before any dormancy break in the store.

This means delaying treatment enough to ensure adequate drying and curing, but before any buds appear.

Michel concludes that loading stores quickly, evenly and with varieties with a similar dormancy profile helps.

Like other advisers, he believes an effective treatment of maleic hydrazide before haulm destruction is key, where possible, to provide early residual control.

Processing potato growers had a positive experience with a new potato sprout suppressant last year, with the product achieving good sprout control in very challenging circumstances.

However, pre-pack growers are worried about its use after treatment in some cold stores and on some varieties was linked to costly tuber defects during its first season of use.

Approval

New plant protection product approvals are increasingly rare, so in August 2022 when 1,4Sight (1,4-dimethylnaptheline or DMN) was approved for use in potato stores, it was warmly welcomed by the potato industry.

Following its approval, 1,4-Sight was widely used during the 2022-23 storage period and, in most cases, users were very happy with results, particularly in bulk-stored processing varieties held at temperatures of 7-8C.

One such user is Simon Alexander of SA Consulting, who specialises in potato agronomy and manages seed and processing potato stores across East Anglia.

He used it in all stores, except where ethylene was requested by processors McCain and Albert Bartlett. Every letter of the label and technical guide was followed before and after application.

The label allows for up to 120ml of product to be applied per crop and Simon made no more than three applications of 20ml (60ml in total) to potatoes in his long-term stores.

""Last year was a tricky season and DMN performed as well, if not better, than I would've expected of CIPC in similar conditions.

""It is promising how long crops held on at the backend between the last DMN application and crop movement. In the stores where we are allowed to use it again this season, we certainly will,"" he says.

Fresh problems

Lincolnshire-based Simon Faulkner of SDF Agriculture looks after a mix of processing and pre-pack stores and had an equally positive experience with DMN where it was used on crops destined for processing.

However, some pre-pack growers saw incidences of external and internal defects in some varieties held in their cold-box stores - typically kept at 3-4C - and fogged with DMN.

Melody and Mozart were the worst-affected varieties. Conversely, varieties such as King Edward and Maris Piper, grown for the same market, seemed to avoid any of the same issues.

Norman Dunne is six years into his regenerative farming journey and is using a flock of 200 laying hens to graze down cover crops on his heavy land farm about 20 miles west of Dublin.

Working in partnership with his father, Michael, he farms 162ha outside Maynooth, County Kildare, and, in 2016, he started going down the conservation ag route.

He recalls that using a plough-based system felt like being on a treadmill.

""There were too many variables - crop type, rotation – and soils had become very damaged.""

It was proving hard to create good seed-beds on the very heavy land and he noted a lack of worms. ""Soils were dead,"" he admits.

After years on the regen journey, by harvest 2022 yields finally matched those with the plough-based approach, and he is seeing the benefits of improved margins and soil health.

Farm facts

Regenerative farming approach

Back in 2015, Mr Dunne realised a radical change was needed.

""We started our regenerative approach when the crows and seagulls weren't following the plough anymore because of the lack of worms.""

He took a biological soils course, run by farmer David Wallace, and ""it opened up a lot of new thinking and different approaches"".

He also had to convince his father to adopt a more regenerative farming approach.

So he started with a 4ha field and hired a contractor to direct-drill some beans.

""They went into what looked like a poor cover crop, but they did 1t/acre, which was good in a dry season.""

It was followed by a first wheat, and yields were better than some of his neighbours, who suffered with take-all issues. ""It was a fantastic crop of wheat,"" Mr Dunne says.

During that time, he also visited different farms in Ireland and worldwide, including some on heavier soils, and saw regen farming in action.

""He [my father] had to see it, as seeing is believing.""

The family kept increasing the area that was direct-drilled a bit at a time until 2020, when the whole farm was in no-till with cover crops.

Soil health benefits

Mr Dunne says that when he used to plough and power-harrow, it was difficult to achieve good seed-beds on his soils.

""We are now seeing better rooting and the soil breaks up more easily. It also has fibrous roots and worms, and there is good percolation of rain.""

He puts the better soil health partly down to cover crop roots doing their job.

Cover crops are kept as diverse as possible, and he likes brassicas because they ""get up and out early"", so he includes radish, mustard and forage rape.

Other species in the mix include phacelia, linseed, buckwheat and clover.

He also grows oilseed rape, which is drilled with a companion crop mix and Australian winter peas.

The mix includes sunflowers, buckwheat, clover and phacelia. Soil is quite heavy and he drilled it twice - first the companion crops and then oilseed rape.

""Most die during the winter, leaving mostly OSR. Then, in spring, the winter peas will fix some nitrogen,"" he explains. Both will be harvested and separated.

Chopping straw

Another part of his approach is to chop straw. ""We chopped a lot of straw this year and will chop even more next year.""

2022 will be remembered for being bone dry, but Mr Dunne says where he had chopped the straw, there were good moisture levels for establishing the next crop.

""It is a blanket to protect soils from baking heat. It is also a food and carbon source for soils, and a food for worms.""

In late August/early September, the place was dry and there was a small bit of moisture, which the straw protected.

Next year, he is looking to blow seed on the combine and then chop straw on top to seal the moisture in.

He carried out two tests sprinkling seed after the header. ""It gave better results than drilling the crop,"" he says.

Cutting inputs

After several years of regenerative farming, Norman Dunne has successfully cut back his inputs.

In the past two years, he has eliminated phosphorus and potassium inputs and is instead feeding crops with compost.

""We have an agreement with our neighbour to supply straw and we get compost back.

“Yields are back to where they were with the plough-based system, but we have higher margins, as we are burning less diesel, resulting in lower establishment costs”, he says.

He has also reduced fungicides and nitrogen fertiliser inputs.

With nitrogen, he is now using 150kg/ha for winter wheat, where he was previously applying 213-225kg/ha.

Mr Dunne achieved this by cutting back a little each year. He believes this was made possible through a combination of cover cropping, applying compost and moving to a more diverse rotation.

""Things are working better now, so we find we need less nitrogen,"" he says.

Lower risks

One key benefit of the regen farming approach is that establishment costs are lower and the system is more flexible, with less risk.

Like many farmers, he lost an area of wheat and barley in the autumn of 2019. It was drilled in the last two days of October, just before the rain arrived and seedlings drowned. ""It didn't stop raining,"" he says.

With his approach, the lower diesel use, combined with using home-saved seed, meant he didn't lose too much.

In contrast, some neighbours redrilled that autumn and lost that crop too.

Hens

One unique part of his system is the addition of a 200-hen pasture laying flock in a mobile house with mobile fencing. Eggs are sold directly to consumers.

It is a low-labour system with an automated shed based on a system set up by Richard Perkins, a regen farmer in Sweden. Hens have access to green, fresh pasture at all times.

The hens are moved every seven to 10 days on cover crops or pasture. They are good at using cover crops, and the droppings return nutrients to the soil, he says.

He adds that they see good egg production on the cover crops - higher than when they are on pasture.

Birds are supplemented with feed produced on farm, including barley/peas, oats/peas, some beans, and wheat. All are sprouted, which improves digestibility for the birds.

Case study: Tommy Hughes, County Meath, Ireland

Tommy Hughes farms 160ha with his father and brother, and they made the switch to regenerative farming five to six years ago.

All combinable crops are now established using a no-till disc drill, with good use of cover cropping and a strong focus on the rotation.

More recently, he has adopted companion cropping, and his aim is not to grow monocultures again if he can help it - all combinable crops are established with a companion.

For example, his winter wheat crop has a pea companion crop, but he doesn't intent to harvest the pulse.

""Wheat is the core crop and peas are there to assist in some way by reducing weed pressure and alleviating the need for early nitrogen fertiliser,"" he explains.

Hopefully, it will also help reduce disease pressure, he adds.

Oats and beans also seem to work well together.

Norman Dunne and Tommy Hughes were speaking at the recent BioFarm 2022 conference organised by National Organic Training and held at Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim, Ireland.

With nitrogen, he is now using 150kg/ha for winter wheat, where he was previously applying 213-225kg/ha.

Mr Dunne achieved this by cutting back a little each year. He believes this was made possible through a combination of cover cropping, applying compost and moving to a more diverse rotation.

""Things are working better now, so we find we need less nitrogen,"" he says.

Lower risks

One key benefit of the regen farming approach is that establishment costs are lower and the system is more flexible, with less risk.

Like many farmers, he lost an area of wheat and barley in the autumn of 2019. It was drilled in the last two days of October, just before the rain arrived and seedlings drowned. ""It didn't stop raining,"" he says.

With his approach, the lower diesel use, combined with using home-saved seed, meant he didn't lose too much.

In contrast, some neighbours redrilled that autumn and lost that crop too.

Hens

One unique part of his system is the addition of a 200-hen pasture laying flock in a mobile house with mobile fencing. Eggs are sold directly to consumers.

It is a low-labour system with an automated shed based on a system set up by Richard Perkins, a regen farmer in Sweden. Hens have access to green, fresh pasture at all times.

The hens are moved every seven to 10 days on cover crops or pasture. They are good at using cover crops, and the droppings return nutrients to the soil, he says.

He adds that they see good egg production on the cover crops - higher than when they are on pasture.

Birds are supplemented with feed produced on farm, including barley/peas, oats/peas, some beans, and wheat. All are sprouted, which improves digestibility for the birds.

Case study: Tommy Hughes, County Meath, Ireland

Tommy Hughes farms 160ha with his father and brother, and they made the switch to regenerative farming five to six years ago.

All combinable crops are now established using a no-till disc drill, with good use of cover cropping and a strong focus on the rotation.

More recently, he has adopted companion cropping, and his aim is not to grow monocultures again if he can help it - all combinable crops are established with a companion.

For example, his winter wheat crop has a pea companion crop, but he doesn't intent to harvest the pulse.

""Wheat is the core crop and peas are there to assist in some way by reducing weed pressure and alleviating the need for early nitrogen fertiliser,"" he explains.

Hopefully, it will also help reduce disease pressure, he adds.

Oats and beans also seem to work well together.

Norman Dunne and Tommy Hughes were speaking at the recent BioFarm 2022 conference organised by National Organic Training and held at Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim, Ireland.

Norman Dunne is six years into his regenerative farming journey and is using a flock of 200 laying hens to graze down cover crops on his heavy land farm about 20 miles west of Dublin.

Working in partnership with his father, Michael, he farms 162ha outside Maynooth, County Kildare, and, in 2016, he started going down the conservation ag route.

He recalls that using a plough-based system felt like being on a treadmill.

""There were too many variables - crop type, rotation – and soils had become very damaged.""

It was proving hard to create good seed-beds on the very heavy land and he noted a lack of worms. ""Soils were dead,"" he admits.

After years on the regen journey, by harvest 2022 yields finally matched those with the plough-based approach, and he is seeing the benefits of improved margins and soil health.

Farm facts

Regenerative farming approach

Back in 2015, Mr Dunne realised a radical change was needed.

""We started our regenerative approach when the crows and seagulls weren't following the plough anymore because of the lack of worms.""

He took a biological soils course, run by farmer David Wallace, and ""it opened up a lot of new thinking and different approaches"".

He also had to convince his father to adopt a more regenerative farming approach.

So he started with a 4ha field and hired a contractor to direct-drill some beans.

""They went into what looked like a poor cover crop, but they did 1t/acre, which was good in a dry season.""

It was followed by a first wheat, and yields were better than some of his neighbours, who suffered with take-all issues. ""It was a fantastic crop of wheat,"" Mr Dunne says.

During that time, he also visited different farms in Ireland and worldwide, including some on heavier soils, and saw regen farming in action.

""He [my father] had to see it, as seeing is believing.""

The family kept increasing the area that was direct-drilled a bit at a time until 2020, when the whole farm was in no-till with cover crops.

Soil health benefits

Mr Dunne says that when he used to plough and power-harrow, it was difficult to achieve good seed-beds on his soils.

""We are now seeing better rooting and the soil breaks up more easily. It also has fibrous roots and worms, and there is good percolation of rain.""

He puts the better soil health partly down to cover crop roots doing their job.

Cover crops are kept as diverse as possible, and he likes brassicas because they ""get up and out early"", so he includes radish, mustard and forage rape.

Other species in the mix include phacelia, linseed, buckwheat and clover.

He also grows oilseed rape, which is drilled with a companion crop mix and Australian winter peas.

The mix includes sunflowers, buckwheat, clover and phacelia. Soil is quite heavy and he drilled it twice - first the companion crops and then oilseed rape.

""Most die during the winter, leaving mostly OSR. Then, in spring, the winter peas will fix some nitrogen,"" he explains. Both will be harvested and separated.

Chopping straw

Another part of his approach is to chop straw. ""We chopped a lot of straw this year and will chop even more next year.""

2022 will be remembered for being bone dry, but Mr Dunne says where he had chopped the straw, there were good moisture levels for establishing the next crop.

""It is a blanket to protect soils from baking heat. It is also a food and carbon source for soils, and a food for worms.""

In late August/early September, the place was dry and there was a small bit of moisture, which the straw protected.

Next year, he is looking to blow seed on the combine and then chop straw on top to seal the moisture in.

He carried out two tests sprinkling seed after the header. ""It gave better results than drilling the crop,"" he says.

Cutting inputs

After several years of regenerative farming, Norman Dunne has successfully cut back his inputs.

In the past two years, he has eliminated phosphorus and potassium inputs and is instead feeding crops with compost.

""We have an agreement with our neighbour to supply straw and we get compost back.

“Yields are back to where they were with the plough-based system, but we have higher margins, as we are burning less diesel, resulting in lower establishment costs”, he says.

He has also reduced fungicides and nitrogen fertiliser inputs.

With nitrogen, he is now using 150kg/ha for winter wheat, where he was previously applying 213-225kg/ha.

Semex chief executive Paul Larmer © Semex

Advances in cattle genetics could lead to a 20-30% reduction in methane emissions by 2050, says one of the world’s largest breeding companies.  

Canadian-based Semex announced at its international conference on Glasgow on Tuesday (17 January) that it is launching a new genomic test, in April, that can assess methane emissions in cattle.

This will allow it to select for low-emission animals and make a valuable contribution to mitigating climate change.

See also: Why genetics can play bigger role in breeding out lameness

Drew Sloan, Semex vice-president of corporate development, said: ""In many countries, the proverbial finger is pointed at agriculture, specifically cattle, as a culprit of excess emissions, with many nations adopting laws targeting net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

""This is another tool to bring down emissions on farm, which will contribute to reaching that goal.""

Genetic traits 

According to the company, a new genetic trait has been found with an 85% genetic correlation between collected and mid-infrared (MIR) predicted methane.

This trait also has 23% heritability, 70-80% reliability, and no impact on yields or fat and protein levels.

The genetic gains are cumulative and permanent, according to Semex Alliance chief executive Paul Larmer.

Semex worked alongside Canadian producer-owned business Lactanet and the University of Guelph studying MIR spectroscopy records and feed efficiency records to find a genetic solution to reducing methane emissions.

Advances in genetics are already able to help improve feed efficiency, achieve higher yields for each cow, reduce antibiotics use, and help to breed healthier cows.

About 19-24% of methane emissions made by cattle are linked to an individual animal’s genetics, while 7-13% of emissions can be explained by ruminal microbiota, according to studies by Norway's Department of Breeding and Genetics and Lanzhou University.

‘Ground-breaking’

Stuart Roberts, former NFU deputy president, farmer and conference chairman, said: ""Society absolutely expects us as an industry to play our part in climate change.""

""I think it is genuinely ground-breaking that we have now got a genetic tool that can significantly help us on that journey.""

A group of farmers is taking part in a four-year project to explore the impact of bale grazing on forage quality and soil health.

The Innovative Farmers field lab will fill a research gap: to date, there have been no published, UK-based trials to quantify the practice, which involves outwintering on bales rolled out within a paddock management system similar to mob-grazing.

We speak to four of the six farmers to find out about their experiences of bale grazing so far.

FAI Farms, Oxfordshire

Bale grazing is in its fourth year at FAI Farms, a 567ha (1,400-acre) organic farm on medium heavy clay in the floodplain of the River Thames.

""Planning is key - I'm doing this now for next winter,"" says farm manager Silas Hedley-Lawrence.

He is calculating feed requirements and plotting the layout of grazing cells for daily moves using AgriNet software.

He maps 160 cells of 0.5ha on a block of parkland, each with five round bales of hay made from the floodplain meadows.

""If it's very wet, the cattle might get 1ha instead, or we might move them more frequently,"" Silas explains.

The previous system of winter housing cost £2.40 a cow and calf a day (calculated before recent high inflation). He costs bale grazing at £1.04 a cow and calf a day - a saving of £1.36.

For a 100-cow herd and an average housing period of 180 days, the overall saving is £24,480. And for growing stock, the daily saving is even greater, at £1.49 a head a day.

""It's a huge cost saving,"" he says. ""We've also seen massively improved diversity in the sward, and infiltration rates have gone from more than two hours four years ago to less than 30 seconds now.""

Gowbarrow Hall Farm, Lake District

Claire Beaumont farms 186ha (460 acres) at Gowbarrow Hall Farm, of which 156ha (385 acres) is a mix of meadows, rough grazing and wood pasture grazed by 63 head of Shorthorn cattle.

Last winter, following a small trial in a rough field the previous year, 34 bales were set out in a 5ha (12-acre) field that had been rested for 10 months.

They fed 32 cattle for 34 days in February/March, forming a bridge between winter and the growing season.

""I was quite surprised by how little hay you lose - about 10% the cows don't eat - and this gets rotted down,"" says Claire.

""After bale grazing, there were some areas of poaching, but we saw this as an opportunity for seeding.

""The field is not species rich, but there are definite changes."" She plans to use species-rich hay from another farm to introduce more diversity into the sward for bale grazing next winter.

Baston Hall, Malvern Hills

Cows bale-graze with calves at foot at Baston Hall, where Ian Horsley has completed his second winter trialling the system.

He runs 18 pedigree Aberdeen Angus cows and followers and 45 sheep on 36ha (90 acres) of grazing.

In 2021-22, he ran 14 cows and 10 calves (14.2 livestock units (LU)) on 1.4ha (3.5 acres) for 43 days.

They then bale-grazed a second area for 34 days in March/April and used a total of 90 bales across the two systems.

Despite a wet December, the ground recovered, and Ian expanded the area of bale grazing in the second winter, to 80 25x25m cells for 13 cows and calves, and seven yearlings - a 45% increase.

These animals used 140 bales over 94 days at a cost of £22.50/day, or £1.09/LU a day, compared with £2.82/LU a day when housed.

""This time, snow in March was challenging and made the area very wet, very quickly,"" he says.

""Sections of the field have been damaged - parts of 10 cells out of 80, so about 2%. It's not too bad, but there's room for improvement.""

Whitriggs Farm, Scottish Borders

Stuart Mitchell © Angus Findlay

Bale grazing has resulted in big savings for Stuart Mitchell, now in his fourth year of the system.

His fittest 60 cows winter on the hill with one bale/day, while 40 bulling heifers and first-calved heifers outwinter on lower land on the same system.

He costs housing 140 cows for six months at £18 a cow a week at a total of £60,480.

By contrast, outwintering 100 cows at £4.50/day and housing 40 for four months costs a total of £23,760 - a saving of £36,720, or £262 a cow.

And rather than using four hours of labour a day, the system requires just one.

By mob-grazing through the summer on herbal leys, hay can be made from the 405ha (1,000-acre) organic farm's permanent pasture. Calves are weaned before the cows go on the hill.

""The cows eat 50% hay, 50% grass, and if they go on the hill in good condition, they come back off OK, five days before calving,"" says Stuart.

""They have to cope with the system and get back in-calf within six weeks, no excuses.""

Seventh farmer joins field lab

AHDB beef and sheep monitor farmer Harry Sordy, has been trialling bale grazing at a 1,400ha (3,459-acre) Alnham Farm in Northumberland.

He has recently joined the Innovative Farmers field lab.

The move comes as the AHDB prepares to carry out a broader cost-benefit analysis of the practice.

""It's evident bale grazing is becoming more popular, with cost savings, better soil carbon management and improvements in animal health,"" says AHDB senior knowledge exchange manager Katie Evans.

""The field lab is a really interesting project with a great group of farmers, and including Harry's farm will help get more knowledge out and put more data behind the claims.""

The four farmers were speaking at Groundswell (28-29 June)

For more information see our website Harper Adams University

Meadow, one of the UK's leading value-added ingredients businesses, has become the latest associate partner in Harper Adams University's School of Sustainable Food and Farming, which is working to help the farming industry on its journey to achieve net-zero targets.

© Harper Adams

Created by sustainable agri-food chain specialists at Harper Adams, it sees academics working alongside various commercial partners, including Morrisons, McDonalds, the National Farmers Union - and now Meadow.

Through its shared mission, the school aims to plug the knowledge gap in the farming industry and break down barriers when it comes to working towards net-zero targets.

Its purpose - followed by both the university and its partners – is to equip farmers with skills and knowledge to work towards net-zero targets within sustainability parameters (economic, environmental and social).

It also exists to improve farm data to track carbon emission reductions and sequestration, offsetting at a whole farm system approach and encourage new entrants into the food industry and a diversity of entrepreneurial people.

The school talks a common language with regards to net-zero emissions and sustainable farming.

Meadow has always championed sustainability and recently announced that sustainability will now be front and centre in the company's growth ambitions - with the aim of being net zero across all operating sites by 2030 and fully net zero by 2050.

The ingredients specialist also has a programme of work with its farm supply base which will see Meadow working to achieve a 10% reduction in emissions per litre of milk by 2025.

The business also aims for its ingredients to be 100% responsibly sourced by the same year.

Head of Sustainability at Meadow, Alun Lewis, said: ""The partnership with Harper Adams on this new sustainable initiative lines up perfectly with our values and mission: to make sustainable ingredients easy for our customers.

""We will be combining our influence, knowledge and passion for sustainability, as well as our 30-plus years of experience working with producers to identify challenges facing farmers and how to best support them.

""The opportunity to share knowledge from the partnership with our producers through our farmer engagement programme, being launched early 2023, will be another resilient tool for the farmers, on their road to a sustainable future.""

Director of The School of Sustainable Food and Farming at Harper Adams University, Simon Thelwell, said: ""Sustainable supply chains and sourcing are becoming increasingly important to customers, suppliers and producers. 

""We're proud to be leading the agri-sector in helping them to deliver on their sustainable ambitions and to be partnering with some of the biggest names in industry so that collectively we can achieve ambitious sustainability goals.""

Meadow Foods is an award-winning company that operates from four BRC AA accredited sites in Chester, Peterborough, Holme-on-Spalding Moor and Dolgellau where they manufacture value-added ingredients seven days a week for some of the UK's best known food manufacturers. 

The company currently employs more than 450 people and handles in excess of 550m litres of milk each year direct from its network of dedicated milk producers across the UK.

Securing a long-term sustainable supply of potatoes is behind McCain Food's partnership approach to regenerative potato production, as it works with growers to reduce the impact of growing the crop.

Recognising that the challenges with potatoes are different to those of other crops, McCain vice-president for agriculture, James Young, says the company is listening to farmers as it develops a framework to measure progress.

See also: Video: Camera technology improves marketability for potato growers

""The improvements being made at the farm level are really exciting,"" he reports.

""With 240 growers working with us to produce 700,000t of potatoes, we are committed to sourcing good-quality produce from the UK.""

Having previously been accused of greenwashing, James is keen to emphasise the company's commitment to UK production.

""Our biggest customer McDonald's has huge expectations, and we are working closely with them on the rate of change.

""There's been no let-up in demand and we don't want to import potatoes,"" he stresses.  

James believes there are six key regenerative principles that can be applied to potato production (see box), and says that the company's economic supply chain includes farmer returns.

""Changing the way that things are done on farms comes with risks. That means the commercial model for regenerative farming must be different.""

Improving soil health, enhancing biodiversity and reducing the impact of synthetic inputs will help improve climate resilience, water-holding capacity and biodiversity, while reducing costs and emissions, he adds.

McCain smart and sustainable farming - six key principles

Ed Brown, head of agroecology with Hutchinsons, points out that growing potatoes in a regenerative system is more involved, but stresses that where the basic principles are applied, positive changes do follow.

""Good inroads can be made,"" he says. ""And it's important to note that lessening the impact that the crop has on the environment doesn't have to come with a yield cost.""

Ed has worked with John Bubb to introduce various changes and new practices on his Shropshire farm (see panel).

A fundamental step has been to get the soils functioning better and to rebalance the soil food web, leading to a healthier, more resilient system.

Soil organic matter (OM) levels have increased with the use of cover crops, improving water retention and reducing the need for irrigation.

Fuel use has come down as cultivations have reduced and the farm's carbon footprint is heading in the right direction, helped by input reductions.

However, blight sprays remain high, admits Ed. ""We have bought more diversity into fields and worked on building healthier plants, as well as growing more resistant varieties, but we haven't made a big impact yet.""

Gene editing may be able to help with this goal, but McCain is wary and efforts are currently being directed at conventional breeding techniques.

""As a family-owned company with responsibilities to our customers and our consumers, we are keen to keep making progress through conventional plant breeding,"" confirms James. ""But we recognise that it could have potential.""

Nutrient management is an area where there has been significant change for John Bubb, and Ian Robertson of Hutchinsons has helped with soil testing and sap analysis, which underpins a feed-to-need strategy.

Building fertility across the rotation has reduced the overall nitrogen (N) requirement and allowed the farm to move away from ammonium nitrate fertiliser, in favour of urea and foliar applications.

In addition, biologicals and organic acids have replaced phosphate fertiliser and a feed-the-crop approach has seen potash use drop.

""The upshot of getting the soil to work better has been a £345/ha saving,"" reports Ian. ""And the yield of 74t/ha was identical to that of the previous farm standard.""  

He is still exploring how low the farm can go with nitrogen. ""My feeling is that we can start with 50-70kg/ha of N and build it from there.""

In future, compost extracts will be evaluated on the farm and more will be done with plant diversity and input reductions.

""It's working progress,"" summarises Ed. ""We are meeting the demands of retailers and consumers, providing home-grown potatoes with a better environmental profile from a profitable and resilient system.""

Potatoes are grown for McCain Foods on 162ha of the 810ha farmed in Shropshire by John Bubb, who runs a diversified business that also includes wheat, oilseed rape and flowers in a six-year rotation.

A whole-farm approach is taken to soils and cultivations, with efforts to reduce working depth and eliminate the number of passes being made in potatoes complemented by using strip tillage to establish other crops.

Actions to de-intensify potato cultivations by less bed-tilling and tines fitted to destoners are paying off, and the purchase of a new potato harvester in 2019 has made a huge difference to operations and timeliness, reveals John.

""Having the right equipment - and enough of it - means that we don't have to travel when the conditions aren't right, which minimises soil damage.""

Being involved in a five-year research project to reduce the number of passes involved with potato planting is also helping, he continues, although it's still early days and the soil's high stone content is a challenge.

Multispecies cover crops are grown twice in the rotation - ahead of potatoes and flowers - and an eight-week catch crop is fitted in between oilseed rape and winter wheat.

The species mix has been fine-tuned with experience; brassicas aren't included and oats don't feature ahead of the flower crop.

Other plant diversity comes in the form of stewardship mixes and companion planting; the latter involving peas and beans being grown with potatoes for a nitrogen benefit and buckwheat with oilseed rape.

In wheat, this diversity is being introduced by establishing a living clover mulch, with the wheat being drilled in 50cm rows in a wide band and the clover grown between them.

A DeCyst trap crop, to help with potato cyst nematode control, is also grown in the rotation.

Along with appropriate variety selection and testing, this has helped bring nematicide use down to just 8% of the potato ground, where previously it had been 90%.

Re-ridging trials are being conducted to see if herbicide reductions can be achieved, but fungicides are proving to be more difficult, especially where blight is concerned.

""It can be slow progress but an exception to that is our fertiliser regime, which has changed massively, thanks to the use of soil testing and sap analysis,"" highlights John.

""By increasing fertility across the rotation, we've reduced our nitrogen requirement and seen phosphorus (P) fertiliser use drop by 90% and potassium (K) fertiliser use fall by 35%.""

Securing a long-term sustainable supply of potatoes is behind McCain Food's partnership approach to regenerative potato production, as it works with growers to reduce the impact of growing the crop.

Recognising that the challenges with potatoes are different to those of other crops, McCain vice-president for agriculture, James Young, says the company is listening to farmers as it develops a framework to measure progress.

See also: Video: Camera technology improves marketability for potato growers

""The improvements being made at the farm level are really exciting,"" he reports.

""With 240 growers working with us to produce 700,000t of potatoes, we are committed to sourcing good-quality produce from the UK.""

Having previously been accused of greenwashing, James is keen to emphasise the company's commitment to UK production.

""Our biggest customer McDonald's has huge expectations, and we are working closely with them on the rate of change.

""There's been no let-up in demand and we don't want to import potatoes,"" he stresses.  

James believes there are six key regenerative principles that can be applied to potato production (see box), and says that the company's economic supply chain includes farmer returns.

""Changing the way that things are done on farms comes with risks. That means the commercial model for regenerative farming must be different.""

Improving soil health, enhancing biodiversity and reducing the impact of synthetic inputs will help improve climate resilience, water-holding capacity and biodiversity, while reducing costs and emissions, he adds.

McCain smart and sustainable farming - six key principles

Ed Brown, head of agroecology with Hutchinsons, points out that growing potatoes in a regenerative system is more involved, but stresses that where the basic principles are applied, positive changes do follow.

""Good inroads can be made,"" he says. ""And it's important to note that lessening the impact that the crop has on the environment doesn't have to come with a yield cost.""

Ed has worked with John Bubb to introduce various changes and new practices on his Shropshire farm (see panel).

A fundamental step has been to get the soils functioning better and to rebalance the soil food web, leading to a healthier, more resilient system.

Soil organic matter (OM) levels have increased with the use of cover crops, improving water retention and reducing the need for irrigation.

Fuel use has come down as cultivations have reduced and the farm's carbon footprint is heading in the right direction, helped by input reductions.

However, blight sprays remain high, admits Ed. ""We have bought more diversity into fields and worked on building healthier plants, as well as growing more resistant varieties, but we haven't made a big impact yet.""

Gene editing may be able to help with this goal, but McCain is wary and efforts are currently being directed at conventional breeding techniques.

""As a family-owned company with responsibilities to our customers and our consumers, we are keen to keep making progress through conventional plant breeding,"" confirms James. ""But we recognise that it could have potential.""

Nutrient management is an area where there has been significant change for John Bubb, and Ian Robertson of Hutchinsons has helped with soil testing and sap analysis, which underpins a feed-to-need strategy.

Building fertility across the rotation has reduced the overall nitrogen (N) requirement and allowed the farm to move away from ammonium nitrate fertiliser, in favour of urea and foliar applications.

In addition, biologicals and organic acids have replaced phosphate fertiliser and a feed-the-crop approach has seen potash use drop.

""The upshot of getting the soil to work better has been a £345/ha saving,"" reports Ian. ""And the yield of 74t/ha was identical to that of the previous farm standard.""  

He is still exploring how low the farm can go with nitrogen. ""My feeling is that we can start with 50-70kg/ha of N and build it from there.""

In future, compost extracts will be evaluated on the farm and more will be done with plant diversity and input reductions.

""It's working progress,"" summarises Ed. ""We are meeting the demands of retailers and consumers, providing home-grown potatoes with a better environmental profile from a profitable and resilient system.""

Confusion remains among farmers on what to declare when it comes to farm-saved seed, while many growers question why royalty payments are necessary.

We spoke to The British Society of Plant Breeders (BSPB) for a quick refresh on the dos and don'ts of farm-saved seed and find out the importance of seed declarations in the development of new varieties.

See also: The importance of larger seed sizes for farm-saved seed

What does the farm-saved seed legislation state?

Under section 9 of the Plant Varieties Act 1997, it is a requirement for farmers to declare use of farm-saved seed from protected varieties and pay for the use of eligible varieties.

Plant breeders' rights give the breeder legal rights over certain plant varieties they have developed and allow them to charge royalties for the use of “protected” varieties.

BSPB chief executive Sam Brooke explains: ""Farm-saved seed legislation looks to maintain traceability and quality within UK seed production.

""It ultimately aims to protect the buyer and fund research and development of breeding for improvements in UK agriculture.""

Which crops are covered by the rules?

Farm-saved seed from wheat, barley, oilseed rape, oats, triticale, field peas, field beans, linseed, rye and potatoes (see Potatoes panel for more information) are all affected by the legislation.

""The declaration of any protected variety is payable upon drilling, regardless of whether it is part of a blend, cover crop or a failed crop,"" continues Sam Brooke.

""The BSPB is keen to remind growers that yield, and whether the variety makes up part of a blend or cover crop, does not affect the need to make a declaration.""

Where a blend or cover crop that includes a protected variety is sown, the grower must declare the ratio of seed in the blend.

This percentage can be used in conjunction with the seeding rate to calculate the payment needed for using the blend.

Volunteer crops fall under the farm-saved seed rule, while the legislation excludes hybrid varieties which means they may not be farm-saved.

Saving seed from hybrid varieties not only goes against current legislation but can lead to variable offspring, reduced yields and loss of agronomic characters.

Where do royalty payments go?

Royalty payment rates are calculated according to an agreement between BSPB and the NFU and are subject to change each year.

The payments are returned to the breeder of the variety to support continued investment in improved varieties, bred for UK conditions. BSPB operates as a not-for-profit organisation.

By breeding new varieties, UK agriculture contributes to improving yields, crop performance and developing more resistant cultivars.

For example, investment in plant breeding has led to the development of higher performing varieties that are more resilient to UK growing conditions.

An independent study by the HFFA found that without the contribution of plant breeding over the past 20 years, all major arable crop yields across UK farms would be down 20%.

""About 20-22% of a breeders turnover is put back into research and development.

""This is a very high percentage of turnover and farmers have seen the benefits of new varieties, increased yield and improved disease resistance.

""If every farmer cuts corners and does not pay royalties, this research can soon dry up,"" she says.

Can you sell or share farm-saved seed?

""It is illegal to sell, buy, barter or share farm-saved seed,"" warns Sam.

farm-saved seed can only be planted on the holding on which it was produced which is why farmers cannot sell, buy, barter, or otherwise transfer farm-saved seed outside their own holding.

A farm’s holding may have more than one farm - so long as all holdings are managed as the same business, farm-saved seed is permitted to be shared.

""It's important to note, we are not against farmers using farm-saved seed - we are very much in favour,” says Sam.

""Many farms produce high-quality seeds which can bring benefits to growers. However, the key is not switching seed between holdings, to protect the variety.

""This comes back to maintaining traceability and quality of seeds,"" she says.

How are payments made?

Farmers can quickly and simply declare and pay online or receive a paper declaration form.

When declaring online there is an option to go paperless and receive future FSS declarations by email.

""If there is any uncertainty the BSPB team is on hand to help and offer guidance on how to calculate and declare all varieties of farm-saved seed,"" she says.

Is there a small farmer exemption?

Small farmer exemption applies if the area of land is large enough to produce less than 92t of combinable crops or less than 185t of potatoes per harvest.

Small farmers are exempt from payment, but not from declaration, and are contacted every five years by BSPB. If you think you are eligible, please contact the organisation.

Can a contractor declare for me?

Where a landowner employs a contractor to farm their land the responsibility to return the farm-saved seed declaration remains with the landowner, unless the contractor has agreed to declare on behalf of the landowner.

Do I need to declare if I have paid a processor?

Processors who collect farm-saved seed payments for BSPB do not pass on details of work for individual farmers, so the organisation asks for declarations to ensure records are up-to-date.

Can feed grain be sown?

No - it is against the law to use any bought-in grain to establish a crop.

For all tonnages processed by BSPB registered cleaners the following rates apply

Unlike other protected varieties, there is no agreement in place between the BSPB and UK farming unions for potatoes.

Instead, each potato rate is set by the variety owners, and the BSPB collects royalties on farm-saved seed from growers for eligible varieties.

Payment rates are set at the default rate established in EU law of 50% of the royalty payable for classified seed production of each variety.

However, the BSPB does not publish a full list of payment rates for potatoes, and growers must contact the organisation for individual rates.

""This is a very high percentage of turnover and farmers have seen the benefits of new varieties, increased yield and improved disease resistance.

""If every farmer cuts corners and does not pay royalties, this research can soon dry up,"" she says.

Can you sell or share farm-saved seed?

""It is illegal to sell, buy, barter or share farm-saved seed,"" warns Sam.

farm-saved seed can only be planted on the holding on which it was produced which is why farmers cannot sell, buy, barter, or otherwise transfer farm-saved seed outside their own holding.

A farm’s holding may have more than one farm - so long as all holdings are managed as the same business, farm-saved seed is permitted to be shared.

""It's important to note, we are not against farmers using farm-saved seed - we are very much in favour,” says Sam.

""Many farms produce high-quality seeds which can bring benefits to growers. However, the key is not switching seed between holdings, to protect the variety.

""This comes back to maintaining traceability and quality of seeds,"" she says.

How are payments made?

Farmers can quickly and simply declare and pay online or receive a paper declaration form.

When declaring online there is an option to go paperless and receive future FSS declarations by email.

""If there is any uncertainty the BSPB team is on hand to help and offer guidance on how to calculate and declare all varieties of farm-saved seed,"" she says.

Is there a small farmer exemption?

Small farmer exemption applies if the area of land is large enough to produce less than 92t of combinable crops or less than 185t of potatoes per harvest.

Small farmers are exempt from payment, but not from declaration, and are contacted every five years by BSPB. If you think you are eligible, please contact the organisation.

Can a contractor declare for me?

Where a landowner employs a contractor to farm their land the responsibility to return the farm-saved seed declaration remains with the landowner, unless the contractor has agreed to declare on behalf of the landowner.

Do I need to declare if I have paid a processor?

Processors who collect farm-saved seed payments for BSPB do not pass on details of work for individual farmers, so the organisation asks for declarations to ensure records are up-to-date.

Can feed grain be sown?

No - it is against the law to use any bought-in grain to establish a crop.

Confusion remains among farmers on what to declare when it comes to farm-saved seed, while many growers question why royalty payments are necessary.

We spoke to The British Society of Plant Breeders (BSPB) for a quick refresh on the dos and don'ts of farm-saved seed and find out the importance of seed declarations in the development of new varieties.

See also: The importance of larger seed sizes for farm-saved seed

What does the farm-saved seed legislation state?

Under section 9 of the Plant Varieties Act 1997, it is a requirement for farmers to declare use of farm-saved seed from protected varieties and pay for the use of eligible varieties.

Plant breeders' rights give the breeder legal rights over certain plant varieties they have developed and allow them to charge royalties for the use of “protected” varieties.

BSPB chief executive Sam Brooke explains: ""Farm-saved seed legislation looks to maintain traceability and quality within UK seed production.

""It ultimately aims to protect the buyer and fund research and development of breeding for improvements in UK agriculture.""

Which crops are covered by the rules?

Farm-saved seed from wheat, barley, oilseed rape, oats, triticale, field peas, field beans, linseed, rye and potatoes (see Potatoes panel for more information) are all affected by the legislation.

""The declaration of any protected variety is payable upon drilling, regardless of whether it is part of a blend, cover crop or a failed crop,"" continues Sam Brooke.

""The BSPB is keen to remind growers that yield, and whether the variety makes up part of a blend or cover crop, does not affect the need to make a declaration.""

Where a blend or cover crop that includes a protected variety is sown, the grower must declare the ratio of seed in the blend.

This percentage can be used in conjunction with the seeding rate to calculate the payment needed for using the blend.

Volunteer crops fall under the farm-saved seed rule, while the legislation excludes hybrid varieties which means they may not be farm-saved.

Saving seed from hybrid varieties not only goes against current legislation but can lead to variable offspring, reduced yields and loss of agronomic characters.

Where do royalty payments go?

Royalty payment rates are calculated according to an agreement between BSPB and the NFU and are subject to change each year.

The payments are returned to the breeder of the variety to support continued investment in improved varieties, bred for UK conditions. BSPB operates as a not-for-profit organisation.

By breeding new varieties, UK agriculture contributes to improving yields, crop performance and developing more resistant cultivars.

For example, investment in plant breeding has led to the development of higher performing varieties that are more resilient to UK growing conditions.

An independent study by the HFFA found that without the contribution of plant breeding over the past 20 years, all major arable crop yields across UK farms would be down 20%.

""About 20-22% of a breeders turnover is put back into research and development.

""This is a very high percentage of turnover and farmers have seen the benefits of new varieties, increased yield and improved disease resistance.

""If every farmer cuts corners and does not pay royalties, this research can soon dry up,"" she says.

553,"How much milk should dairy replacements get?","https://www.fwi.co.uk/livestock/livestock-feed-nutrition/how-much-milk-should-we-feed-dairy-replacements","How much milk should dairy replacements get?

Feeding dairy heifers more than six litres a day can prevent them from eating enough starter concentrate.

Speaking at a recent AHDB event at Halton Farms, near Congleton in Cheshire, Alex Bach, research professor at the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA), questioned why calf rearers were feeding more milk.

He cautioned: ""If you are offering lots of milk, the animal will pull back on starter. The right balance for me is three litres in the morning and three litres in the afternoon.""

See also: Calf bottles and tube feeders on test

He added that this should be mixed at a rate of 150g/litre, requiring 900g of powder in total.

He said he often saw a check in growth at weaning because calves were not eating enough starter and their rumen had not been properly prepared for the transition from milk.

Dr Alex Bach © Rhian Price

Which feeds to choose

He advised farmers to feed high-quality milk replacers containing 25% protein and 25% fat to avoid ""overwhelming"" calves with too much lactose.

""One with 18% fat and 22% protein will have too much lactose and you can end up overwhelming the stomach,"" he said.

He added that concentrate must be of high quality and palatable, and farmers should look for products that are 40-45% starch and above 20% protein, containing no more than 5% molasses.

Straw is the best forage to provide adequate fibre for rumen development, but it must be chopped to 2.5cm and included in small amounts - ideally, only 5% inclusion when mixed with concentrate, he added.

""Straw is ideal. If you don't have straw, use poorer-quality hay high in fibre and lower in protein. It is the physicality rather than nutritional quality that matters.""

He stressed that forages must be free from mycotoxins and palatable.

Dr Bach said silage should be limited until heifers are 180 days of age and the rumen is able to digest it.

He said the target was to achieve 1kg daily liveweight gain before weaning and for this to increase to 1.2-1.3kg daily after weaning.

""If you feed less milk, calves will eat more concentrate, and you want them consuming at least 2.5kg/day [of concentrate] before weaning,"" he added.

High levels of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from the drained lowland peat soils in the Fens are threatening to change how they are managed and what they can produce.

Finding ways to continue to farm on lowland peat soils while also reducing emissions and meeting climate targets is the urgent challenge facing growers and producers in the Fens.

Known for its fertile and highly productive soils, the region makes a vital contribution to food production, growing 33% of the country's fresh vegetables, as well as providing valuable habitat and ecosystem services.

See also: Soil carbon: Targets and how to store it in arable fields

Despite this economic and social value, the Fens are fragile, acknowledges John Shropshire, chairman of the G's Fresh group of companies, which is headquartered near Ely, Cambridgeshire.

John is also chairman of Fenland Soil, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to tackling climate issues relating to agriculture and peat in the Fens.

He believes that the future role of the fenland area is up for debate due to farming practices on drained lowland peat resulting in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions - mainly carbon dioxide - making them an obstacle for reaching net zero.

""There are no easy answers or quick wins,"" says John.

""Drained lowland peat soils emit carbon dioxide and are vulnerable to subsidence, so we need to find ways to limit those, while still producing food.""

A thriving environment and productive farming can go hand-in-hand in the region, despite the unique set of pressures, most believe.

However, conflicting priorities must be addressed so that balance can be restored. That may mean introducing management changes, assessing alternative crops or taking some areas out of production.

What do the Fens deliver?

Meeting the challenge

Fenland Soil was set up two years ago to tackle the climate issues relating to agriculture and peat.

Putting equal focus on sustainability, opportunity, innovation and learning, the farmer-led group is working with experts from across the industry to get a better understanding of how they can operate in a more sustainable way.

As professor Chris Evans of the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH) explains, lowland peat soils hold more carbon than any other ecosystem and, even where soils have been depleted over time, they make most other habitats look like deserts.

""One hectare of 30cm-deep peat holds as much carbon as 1ha of primary tropical rainforest,"" he says.

The problem arises when these soils are drained, as that exposes the waterlogged organic matter to decomposition and compaction, releasing carbon dioxide and causing subsidence.

""Peat needs to be wet or it decomposes,"" summarises Chris.

For context, total UK GHG emissions in 2020 were 409m tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), while total peat emissions were 18.8m tonnes - as much as 4% of the total, which cancels out the forest carbon dioxide sink.

Peatland emissions are estimated to account for up to a third of the Fens' carbon release and represent 1% of England's total emissions. ""If these soils are drained, they will emit,"" he says.

""Even wasted peat still emits, albeit at a lower rate. ""Wasted peat is the term given to soils where the remaining peat is all contained in a 40cm plough layer.

""Only soils with less than 10% organic matter are approaching equilibrium.

The initial drainage work in the Fens was carried out in the 17th century and has since been expanded and enhanced, but much of the current pumping infrastructure is dated, says Chris.

Raising the water levels is an option, but there is a balance to be achieved between carbon dioxide and methane emissions.

""If you simply flood a system, methane becomes a problem. So turning the Fens into a giant shallow lake isn't the answer.""

For this reason, ditches are also an issue, he explains. Fully saturated strips in the landscape are ""methane factories"", adding to the complexities of moving towards net zero.

A network of flux towers constantly measures emissions from lowland peat to inform decision-making.

This work will continue and is being merged with field management information, so that emissions for different crop types can be established.

For Chris, simply stopping all farming activity in the region is a luxury that the country can't afford.

""We can't expect farmers and associated businesses to take such a huge personal loss for the good of society.

""A far better approach would be to grow food in a sustainable way on the most productive areas and manage other areas for carbon and biodiversity.

""There needs to be a balance between food, energy and public goods production.""

Solutions pending

Robert Caudwell, chair of the Lowland Agricultural Peat Taskforce and a farmer in South Lincolnshire, believes finding a sustainable way forward is possible, providing farmers recognise the urgency.

""We must start to act,"" he stresses. ""I'm confident that there is a farming future in the region, but that may mean you have to change how you manage the land.""

He is still waiting for the government's response to the taskforce report but points out that different areas of peat need different solutions.

""What works will in the Fens might not work in the Somerset Levels,"" he says. ""That's why groups led by local farmers are important and government's role should be to enable these groups to do what's required.""

Water is always important with peat, so water level management - something that has been done for years - will play a future role.

""We know the issues and now we need more innovation and research to help us with water management.

""Robert notes that paludiculture (see box below) and emerging natural capital markets have potential for the Fens but stresses the need to be able to stack carbon and biodiversity schemes to make them viable.

Economic considerations

That's a point shared by Megan Hudson, general manager of Fenland Soils, who says that it is possible to mitigate the risks and grow high-value crops in a different way.

But that farmers and growers are still waiting for guidance from the government and details on what funding will be available.

""The current ELM (Environmental Land Management) proposals don't meet requirements,"" she says.

""There are two options for raised water table management but they simply don't provide enough money for replacing very valuable crops.""

She also points out that while crops can be grown at raised water tables, dealing with them is very difficult. ""Getting them harvested, or carrying out weed and disease control, is problematic.

Even with the advent of new technology, travelling on these soils will be an issue.""

She adds that tree planting is not permitted on the Fens - ruling out an option that applies to farms in other parts of England.

Regenerative farming practices aren't suited to soils with high organic matter, so that discussion is not relevant either.

Thanks to £96,000 of Discovery Grant funding from Natural England, Megan worked with Elizabeth Stockdale of Niab across 36 farms and three internal drainage boards last year to collect data on soil types, hydrology and productivity.

This information was then used to highlight areas where changes to water table management could be introduced and what other types of funding, such as biodiversity net gain and carbon, could apply.

""Land use management across the 140,000ha of lowland peat in the Fens will be a feature in the future,"" predicts Megan.

""Getting the balance right between food production and environmental protection is possible with the right co-operation and willingness to engage.""

While some of the highest emitting crops may be removed or restricted, there will be a whole range of options employed and technology will have a key role, she adds. ""This is why we are collecting the data, working with others and sharing our findings.""

What is paludiculture?

Paludiculture is the term applied to farming on rewetted peat and is a system for the production of wetland crops, such as thatching reed, typha and sphagnum.

Farming at higher water tables reduces the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the current agricultural use of these soils.

As such, it could be one component of lower-emitting peat landscapes in the future.

Companies such as Saltyco, a next-generation materials manufacturer, are creating textiles from plants grown in wetland and peatlands. Its first product, BioPuff, is a plant-based fibre fill for insulating clothing.

Water level management

Water level management is key to the future of farming on lowland peat, and measures that help farmers to manage water are required.

Bringing the water level up to 20cm seems to be the point at which balance is reached in terms of emissions - as methane production switches off and carbon dioxide release shuts down.

Another option is to bring water levels higher for some of the year, especially at times when land isn't being cropped, to prevent soil loss. Adding organic matter and using mulches are also in the frame.

What is being done in other countries?

In Canada, some 35% of the country's vegetable production takes place on drained agricultural peatland, where there's an average soil loss of 2cm/year - with consequences for soil quality and productivity.

Since 2016, work has been carried out to address soil degradation, which involves assessment of biomass production and the use of soil amendments.

""Using degraded areas to grow high-yielding biomass crops such as willow and miscanthus - so that we also had enough material from them to use as a soil amendment - was successful,"" reports professor Jacynthe Dessureault-Rompre of Laval University.

""A soil amendment rate of 12t/ha a year maintained soil height, Jacynthe notes.

""Using the right amendment at the right rate can compensate for the loss of soil. ""

In Sweden, where soils had to be drained to produce anything, it has been possible to reduce emissions. ""It's not easy and every site is unique,"" says Dr Orjan Bergland.

""Our soils don't behave in the same way - their physical properties mean that they have different oxygen levels when they are drained.""

No effect on emissions was seen when the soil was managed differently, with ploughing and shallow tillage producing the same results.

The same was true of crop type. Soil amendments did have an effect, with emissions dropping by 20%, when plots were treated with 5cm of foundry sand.

""Another finding from our work is that carbon emissions from abandoned peatland do not decrease with time after agricultural practices have ceased.""

In the Netherlands, some 50% of the country's emissions come from the peat soils that are drained for summer grazing by the dairy industry.

Subsidence is taking place at a rate of 1cm/year, reports Joost Kenskamp of Wagingen University.

There are two national research projects being undertaken to address the issue.

""We have higher emissions from our peat soils than the UK, but lower than those of Germany and Denmark,"" says Joost.

Dutch farmers are against raising the water table above 60cm, as it increases the risk to their businesses in the face of climate change, he notes.

""Where that isn't possible, we have looked at soil amendments and alternative crops.

A thin layer of clay applied in the top of the peat did help to bring emissions down without any detrimental effects.""

What are the options for fenland farmers?

Luke Palmer, FC Palmer & Son, Stretham, Ely, Cambridgeshire

Luke Palmer © Jason Bye

Farming 1,618ha from Stretham near Ely in the Fens, Luke Palmer is very aware of the pressures being brought to bear on local growers as he considers what his farming business will look like in the future.

Luke, who is vice-chairman of Fenland Soil, has always recognised the need to protect his fenland soils. His goal is to pass on the farm to the next generation in a better state.

He has used measures such as higher cutting height at harvest and chopped straw to limit soil loss and damage.

However, the emphasis changed to carbon and meeting net-zero obligations around two years ago, following the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combine Authority's Independent Commission on Climate report.

""We were intent on preventing erosion and degradation - now the situation has been given a different focus,"" says Luke.

""Even so, it's really important that we avoid tunnel vision, as there are biodiversity, social and economic factors at play in this unique landscape, not just carbon dioxide emissions.""

He also makes the point that fen soils are releasing carbon, even when they're not being farmed.

""Nobody wants to lose or damage their soils, or risk their livelihood, which is why we are collaborating to come up with a common answer on how we move forward.""

Luke's business is diverse - some land is rented out for vegetable and turf production, and he grows potatoes, sugar beet, wheat, beans, peas and barley.

There are also 98ha of solar panels, two reservoirs - one of which hosts an aqua park - and a joint venture sheep enterprise.

""Some of the farming businesses in the Fens are very specialist agri-businesses, but we have deliberately maintained as much diversity as possible.""

Luke accepts that some areas of the Fens could be taken out of production, but he is concerned about what the future holds if sufficient funding isn't forthcoming.

""Once BPS has gone completely, we will be exposed.

""Everyone tells us that diversity is the way forward for offsetting or reducing emissions, as well as generating other income streams, but intensifying production is often the most viable option.""

Luke hopes that the future will involve greater integration with Internal Drainage Boards, perhaps with them becoming water facilitation boards, and would like to see funds available within catchments for opportunities such as localised flooding.

""Market-driven cropping will always be part of the mix, but it's important to recognise that the situation has never been static in the Fens.

""We're more than happy to trial different techniques and farm in different ways if the data supports that and it makes business sense.""

A trial by the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology on his farm last year highlighted some of the complexities involved.

Growing winter wheat at a higher water table resulted in a 25% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, but also gave 25% less yield.

""We will repeat the work as it was done in last year's heatwave, so keeping the water levels up proved challenging"" he says.

Lowland peatland code

An update of the Peatland Code - a voluntary certification standard for UK peatland projects wishing to market the climate benefits of peatland restoration - now includes fenland peat soils.

This means that for the first time, fenland peatland being restored or rewetted will be eligible for carbon credit registration.

These projects are now expected to attract private investment and support, after it became clear that public funding alone was not enough to cover the costs involved or persuade landowners to change.

""Fens with a minimum peat depth of 45cm are now eligible for restoration under the Peatland Code,"" explains code co-ordinator RenÃ©e Kerkvliet-Hermans.

""Along with the huge carbon benefit that can be realised for this update, there is also the chance for long-term protection and enhancement of the natural environment.""

Fenland Soil was set up two years ago to tackle the climate issues relating to agriculture and peat.

Putting equal focus on sustainability, opportunity, innovation and learning, the farmer-led group is working with experts from across the industry to get a better understanding of how they can operate in a more sustainable way.

As professor Chris Evans of the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH) explains, lowland peat soils hold more carbon than any other ecosystem and, even where soils have been depleted over time, they make most other habitats look like deserts.

""One hectare of 30cm-deep peat holds as much carbon as 1ha of primary tropical rainforest,"" he says.

The problem arises when these soils are drained, as that exposes the waterlogged organic matter to decomposition and compaction, releasing carbon dioxide and causing subsidence.

""Peat needs to be wet or it decomposes,"" summarises Chris.

For context, total UK GHG emissions in 2020 were 409m tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), while total peat emissions were 18.8m tonnes - as much as 4% of the total, which cancels out the forest carbon dioxide sink.

Peatland emissions are estimated to account for up to a third of the Fens' carbon release and represent 1% of England's total emissions. ""If these soils are drained, they will emit,"" he says.

""Even wasted peat still emits, albeit at a lower rate. ""Wasted peat is the term given to soils where the remaining peat is all contained in a 40cm plough layer.

""Only soils with less than 10% organic matter are approaching equilibrium.

The initial drainage work in the Fens was carried out in the 17th century and has since been expanded and enhanced, but much of the current pumping infrastructure is dated, says Chris.

Raising the water levels is an option, but there is a balance to be achieved between carbon dioxide and methane emissions.

""If you simply flood a system, methane becomes a problem. So turning the Fens into a giant shallow lake isn't the answer.""

For this reason, ditches are also an issue, he explains. Fully saturated strips in the landscape are ""methane factories"", adding to the complexities of moving towards net zero.

A network of flux towers constantly measures emissions from lowland peat to inform decision-making.

This work will continue and is being merged with field management information, so that emissions for different crop types can be established.

For Chris, simply stopping all farming activity in the region is a luxury that the country can't afford.

""We can't expect farmers and associated businesses to take such a huge personal loss for the good of society.

""A far better approach would be to grow food in a sustainable way on the most productive areas and manage other areas for carbon and biodiversity.

""There needs to be a balance between food, energy and public goods production.""

Solutions pending

Robert Caudwell, chair of the Lowland Agricultural Peat Taskforce and a farmer in South Lincolnshire, believes finding a sustainable way forward is possible, providing farmers recognise the urgency.

""We must start to act,"" he stresses. ""I'm confident that there is a farming future in the region, but that may mean you have to change how you manage the land.""

He is still waiting for the government's response to the taskforce report but points out that different areas of peat need different solutions.

""What works will in the Fens might not work in the Somerset Levels,"" he says. ""That's why groups led by local farmers are important and government's role should be to enable these groups to do what's required.""

Water is always important with peat, so water level management - something that has been done for years - will play a future role.

""We know the issues and now we need more innovation and research to help us with water management.

""Robert notes that paludiculture (see box below) and emerging natural capital markets have potential for the Fens but stresses the need to be able to stack carbon and biodiversity schemes to make them viable.

Economic considerations

That's a point shared by Megan Hudson, general manager of Fenland Soils, who says that it is possible to mitigate the risks and grow high-value crops in a different way.

But that farmers and growers are still waiting for guidance from the government and details on what funding will be available.

""The current ELM (Environmental Land Management) proposals don't meet requirements,"" she says.

""There are two options for raised water table management but they simply don't provide enough money for replacing very valuable crops.""

She also points out that while crops can be grown at raised water tables, dealing with them is very difficult. ""Getting them harvested, or carrying out weed and disease control, is problematic.

Even with the advent of new technology, travelling on these soils will be an issue.""

She adds that tree planting is not permitted on the Fens - ruling out an option that applies to farms in other parts of England.

Regenerative farming practices aren't suited to soils with high organic matter, so that discussion is not relevant either.

Thanks to £96,000 of Discovery Grant funding from Natural England, Megan worked with Elizabeth Stockdale of Niab across 36 farms and three internal drainage boards last year to collect data on soil types, hydrology and productivity.

This information was then used to highlight areas where changes to water table management could be introduced and what other types of funding, such as biodiversity net gain and carbon, could apply.

""Land use management across the 140,000ha of lowland peat in the Fens will be a feature in the future,"" predicts Megan.

""Getting the balance right between food production and environmental protection is possible with the right co-operation and willingness to engage.""

While some of the highest emitting crops may be removed or restricted, there will be a whole range of options employed and technology will have a key role, she adds. ""This is why we are collecting the data, working with others and sharing our findings.""

What is paludiculture?

Paludiculture is the term applied to farming on rewetted peat and is a system for the production of wetland crops, such as thatching reed, typha and sphagnum.

Farming at higher water tables reduces the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the current agricultural use of these soils.

As such, it could be one component of lower-emitting peat landscapes in the future.

Companies such as Saltyco, a next-generation materials manufacturer, are creating textiles from plants grown in wetland and peatlands. Its first product, BioPuff, is a plant-based fibre fill for insulating clothing.

Water level management

Water level management is key to the future of farming on lowland peat, and measures that help farmers to manage water are required.

Bringing the water level up to 20cm seems to be the point at which balance is reached in terms of emissions - as methane production switches off and carbon dioxide release shuts down.

Another option is to bring water levels higher for some of the year, especially at times when land isn't being cropped, to prevent soil loss. Adding organic matter and using mulches are also in the frame.

What is being done in other countries?

In Canada, some 35% of the country's vegetable production takes place on drained agricultural peatland, where there's an average soil loss of 2cm/year - with consequences for soil quality and productivity.

Since 2016, work has been carried out to address soil degradation, which involves assessment of biomass production and the use of soil amendments.

""Using degraded areas to grow high-yielding biomass crops such as willow and miscanthus - so that we also had enough material from them to use as a soil amendment - was successful,"" reports professor Jacynthe Dessureault-Rompre of Laval University.

""A soil amendment rate of 12t/ha a year maintained soil height, Jacynthe notes.

""Using the right amendment at the right rate can compensate for the loss of soil. ""

In Sweden, where soils had to be drained to produce anything, it has been possible to reduce emissions. ""It's not easy and every site is unique,"" says Dr Orjan Bergland.

""Our soils don't behave in the same way - their physical properties mean that they have different oxygen levels when they are drained.""

No effect on emissions was seen when the soil was managed differently, with ploughing and shallow tillage producing the same results.

The same was true of crop type. Soil amendments did have an effect, with emissions dropping by 20%, when plots were treated with 5cm of foundry sand.

""Another finding from our work is that carbon emissions from abandoned peatland do not decrease with time after agricultural practices have ceased.""

In the Netherlands, some 50% of the country's emissions come from the peat soils that are drained for summer grazing by the dairy industry.

Subsidence is taking place at a rate of 1cm/year, reports Joost Kenskamp of Wagingen University.

There are two national research projects being undertaken to address the issue.

""We have higher emissions from our peat soils than the UK, but lower than those of Germany and Denmark,"" says Joost.

Dutch farmers are against raising the water table above 60cm, as it increases the risk to their businesses in the face of climate change, he notes.

""Where that isn't possible, we have looked at soil amendments and alternative crops.

A thin layer of clay applied in the top of the peat did help to bring emissions down without any detrimental effects.""

What are the options for fenland farmers?

Farming 1,618ha from Stretham near Ely in the Fens, Luke Palmer is very aware of the pressures being brought to bear on local growers as he considers what his farming business will look like in the future.

Luke, who is vice-chairman of Fenland Soil, has always recognised the need to protect his fenland soils. His goal is to pass on the farm to the next generation in a better state.

He has used measures such as higher cutting height at harvest and chopped straw to limit soil loss and damage.

However, the emphasis changed to carbon and meeting net-zero obligations around two years ago, following the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combine Authority's Independent Commission on Climate report.

""We were intent on preventing erosion and degradation - now the situation has been given a different focus,"" says Luke.

""Even so, it's really important that we avoid tunnel vision, as there are biodiversity, social and economic factors at play in this unique landscape, not just carbon dioxide emissions.""

He also makes the point that fen soils are releasing carbon, even when they're not being farmed.

""Nobody wants to lose or damage their soils, or risk their livelihood, which is why we are collaborating to come up with a common answer on how we move forward.""

Luke's business is diverse - some land is rented out for vegetable and turf production, and he grows potatoes, sugar beet, wheat, beans, peas and barley.

There are also 98ha of solar panels, two reservoirs - one of which hosts an aqua park - and a joint venture sheep enterprise.

""Some of the farming businesses in the Fens are very specialist agri-businesses, but we have deliberately maintained as much diversity as possible.""

Luke accepts that some areas of the Fens could be taken out of production, but he is concerned about what the future holds if sufficient funding isn't forthcoming.

""Once BPS has gone completely, we will be exposed.

""Everyone tells us that diversity is the way forward for offsetting or reducing emissions, as well as generating other income streams, but intensifying production is often the most viable option.""

Luke hopes that the future will involve greater integration with Internal Drainage Boards, perhaps with them becoming water facilitation boards, and would like to see funds available within catchments for opportunities such as localised flooding.

""Market-driven cropping will always be part of the mix, but it's important to recognise that the situation has never been static in the Fens.

""We're more than happy to trial different techniques and farm in different ways if the data supports that and it makes business sense.""

A trial by the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology on his farm last year highlighted some of the complexities involved.

Growing winter wheat at a higher water table resulted in a 25% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, but also gave 25% less yield.

""We will repeat the work as it was done in last year's heatwave, so keeping the water levels up proved challenging"" he says.

Lowland peatland code

An update of the Peatland Code - a voluntary certification standard for UK peatland projects wishing to market the climate benefits of peatland restoration - now includes fenland peat soils.

This means that for the first time, fenland peatland being restored or rewetted will be eligible for carbon credit registration.

These projects are now expected to attract private investment and support, after it became clear that public funding alone was not enough to cover the costs involved or persuade landowners to change.

""Fens with a minimum peat depth of 45cm are now eligible for restoration under the Peatland Code,"" explains code co-ordinator RenÃ©e Kerkvliet-Hermans.

""Along with the huge carbon benefit that can be realised for this update, there is also the chance for long-term protection and enhancement of the natural environment.""

High levels of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from the drained lowland peat soils in the Fens are threatening to change how they are managed and what they can produce.

Finding ways to continue to farm on lowland peat soils while also reducing emissions and meeting climate targets is the urgent challenge facing growers and producers in the Fens.

Known for its fertile and highly productive soils, the region makes a vital contribution to food production, growing 33% of the country's fresh vegetables, as well as providing valuable habitat and ecosystem services.

See also: Soil carbon: Targets and how to store it in arable fields

Despite this economic and social value, the Fens are fragile, acknowledges John Shropshire, chairman of the G's Fresh group of companies, which is headquartered near Ely, Cambridgeshire.

John is also chairman of Fenland Soil, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to tackling climate issues relating to agriculture and peat in the Fens.

He believes that the future role of the fenland area is up for debate due to farming practices on drained lowland peat resulting in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions - mainly carbon dioxide - making them an obstacle for reaching net zero.

""There are no easy answers or quick wins,"" says John.

""Drained lowland peat soils emit carbon dioxide and are vulnerable to subsidence, so we need to find ways to limit those, while still producing food.""

A thriving environment and productive farming can go hand-in-hand in the region, despite the unique set of pressures, most believe.

However, conflicting priorities must be addressed so that balance can be restored. That may mean introducing management changes, assessing alternative crops or taking some areas out of production.

Imagine waking up in the morning, looking at your phone and finding a report saying blight risk in your potato fields had risen to a level requiring treatment, so your fleet of drones had sprayed those fields in perfect conditions overnight.

While it might sound implausible currently, according to Autonomous Spray Systems chief executive officer Rob Pearson, it could be a reality in just five years' time - albeit with several hurdles to clear before it can legally happen in the UK.

See also: How to improve consistency with foliar nitrogen sprays

The first big barrier has been cleared, with Mr Pearson's company recently receiving the first permit in the UK for commercial drone-spraying for drones weighing more than 25kg.

""We now have operational authority for commercial drone applications in agricultural settings.

""As a result, there is a legal pathway for farmers to be trained to become spray drone operators,"" says Mr Pearson.

Training takes five days, with courses offered by Harper Adams University.

More courses are rolling out in other leading agricultural universities and colleges over the next few months.

But while the permit allows trained pilots to spread untreated seed and fertilisers, or spray organic products, fertilisers and biostimulants, it does not yet allow pesticides.

Lack of data

There is a lack of data for approved products about whether the risks from drone-spraying significantly differs from ground-based techniques, particularly regarding human and environmental exposure, spray drift and efficacy.

If risk is found to be significantly different, it could mean pesticide manufacturers needing to provide extra data to enable drone-spraying authorisations on the product label.

While data in most of those areas are limited - despite legal commercial drone-spraying in Australia, China, South America, US, Africa and Ukraine - there are efforts both in the UK and elsewhere to answer these questions.

Drift research, for example, is ongoing separately by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Unmanned Aerial Pesticide Application System Task Force - a coalition of various pesticide manufacturers - as well as the Silsoe Spray Applications Unit in the UK.

The Health & Safety Executive (HSE) has been keen to help navigate the complicated world of pesticide approval, Mr Pearson says, encouraged by a government wanting to accelerate the use of commercial drones (see box).

Potential drone impact in UK (all sectors)

Source: PwC Skies without limits v2.0 report 2022

Two Chinese drone brands currently dominate the agricultural market: XAG and DJI. Both have models capable of holding about 40 litres of product in the XAG P100 and DJI T40, although the latter is not yet available in Europe.

They also have smaller 10-16 litre drones in the XAG V40 and DJI T10. Prices range from about £15,000 for the smaller drones, up to £25,000-£35,000 for the larger units.

The XAG drones are fitted with rotary atomiser nozzles, while DJI has used flat fans in the past.

The new DJI T40 has rotary atomisers, suggesting that might become the preferred option.

Rotary atomiser nozzles offer a bit more flexibility and consistency, suggests Tom Wolf, a Canadian with 33 years' research experience with spray applications.

""A rotary atomiser determines its droplet diameter from the rotational speed of the atomiser,"" he says.

""You can have a wide range of flow rates that generate the same droplet size, which a hydraulic nozzle can't do that, so we have more consistency of droplet size.""

Why is drift not the same with a drone?

Drift from drone spraying is likely to have different characteristics to that from ground-based sprayer or even planes, says Tom Wolf.

From an aircraft, the spray forms a plume behind the sprayer at over 100m, which is subject to displacement by wind.

""Drones are different. They're at the transitional point of free flight and hovering at the speed they fly at.

""The downwash from the propellers they generate is actually a kind of air-assist, pushing the spray down into the canopy.""

The strength and persistence of that downwash is key to determining whether the droplets land and hit the ground quickly or rebound or curl up, he says.

""From our observations, we've seen every conceivable behaviour of droplets from drones - from no observable drift to a flare that goes back above the drone's flying height and lots of sideways movement.""

He says the question is can we characterise that? ""Is it the weight of the drone, the speed, the flying height, the water volume?""

Current research suggests there is a diverse range of outcomes, nowhere near as predictable as from a ground sprayer.

Part of the reason is there are lots of confounding variables when using a drone, Dr Wolf explains.

""All the rotors are individually run, rotate different ways, and the rotational velocity is adjusted constantly to maintain the position of the drone.

""If there is a gust of wind, it will increase the downwash of some but not all the rotors, so you have a continuously variable flow field beneath the drone.""

The drone's weight will also change as the spray tank is emptied, which could change the amount of downwash needed to keep the drone aloft.

This, again, will change the flow field under the drone and the behaviour of the droplets.

""We need to figure out if that is important - do you need to change the height to keep drift constant. There's a lot of things we need to still understand.""

Bracken control

The likely first approvals in the UK will be for bracken control, says Mr Pearson.

""There's been a 400% increase in bracken growth in the past two years, according to the National Trust, and they're desperate.""

Bracken control is one of the few aerial pesticide applications still approved in the UK through an emergency authorisation using helicopters, but Mr Pearson says it is more typically carried out with a knapsack.

""You might be able to spray a hectare a day on rough terrain with a knapsack, while we could spray a hectare in 10 minutes from the comfort of a vehicle.""

Drones are useful for spraying hard-to-access areas © Autonomous Spray Systems

Drone agency Vertinetik, which helps farmers capture data and plan drone applications, has been working with the Agri-EPI Centre to explore the potential of using drones in the UK.

Vertinetik's co-founder, Kalique Dugarte, says spraying hard-to-access locations or when ground is not suitable for travel by ground sprayer are two of the potential benefits of using drones.

Another benefit could be spraying tall crops late in the season when ground sprayers can cause crop damage.

Mr Dugarte's working with a maize grower where late fertiliser applications have added 1t/ha to yield from a rescheduled programme.

""Drones can be a game-changer,"" he says.

But perhaps of most interest to growers are the potential benefits in reducing inputs, water and emissions associated with spraying.

Unfortunately, at least to begin with, those benefits are less likely in the UK, Mr Pearson suggests.

""The first step is to spray the chemicals in the same water volumes and concentrations as today, because reformulating and relabelling by manufacturers will take some time.""

Ultimately, he believes reduced water and input rates will be changed on labels. That, together with autonomous swarm flying, might be the step that takes drones from a niche product to mainstream, he forecasts.

""We are heading towards an autonomous future where drones will be an important part on many farms.

""The next three years will prove the safety and reliability of drones, and we are working to prove you don't need an operator, as autonomous flying will be both safer and more reliable,"" he concludes.

Lack of data

There is a lack of data for approved products about whether the risks from drone-spraying significantly differs from ground-based techniques, particularly regarding human and environmental exposure, spray drift and efficacy.

If risk is found to be significantly different, it could mean pesticide manufacturers needing to provide extra data to enable drone-spraying authorisations on the product label.

While data in most of those areas are limited - despite legal commercial drone-spraying in Australia, China, South America, US, Africa and Ukraine - there are efforts both in the UK and elsewhere to answer these questions.

Drift research, for example, is ongoing separately by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Unmanned Aerial Pesticide Application System Task Force - a coalition of various pesticide manufacturers - as well as the Silsoe Spray Applications Unit in the UK.

The Health & Safety Executive (HSE) has been keen to help navigate the complicated world of pesticide approval, Mr Pearson says, encouraged by a government wanting to accelerate the use of commercial drones (see box).

Potential drone impact in UK (all sectors)

Two Chinese drone brands currently dominate the agricultural market: XAG and DJI. Both have models capable of holding about 40 litres of product in the XAG P100 and DJI T40, although the latter is not yet available in Europe.

They also have smaller 10-16 litre drones in the XAG V40 and DJI T10. Prices range from about £15,000 for the smaller drones, up to £25,000-£35,000 for the larger units.

The XAG drones are fitted with rotary atomiser nozzles, while DJI has used flat fans in the past.

The new DJI T40 has rotary atomisers, suggesting that might become the preferred option.

Rotary atomiser nozzles offer a bit more flexibility and consistency, suggests Tom Wolf, a Canadian with 33 years' research experience with spray applications.

""A rotary atomiser determines its droplet diameter from the rotational speed of the atomiser,"" he says.

""You can have a wide range of flow rates that generate the same droplet size, which a hydraulic nozzle can't do that, so we have more consistency of droplet size.""

Why is drift not the same with a drone?

Drift from drone spraying is likely to have different characteristics to that from ground-based sprayer or even planes, says Tom Wolf.

From an aircraft, the spray forms a plume behind the sprayer at over 100m, which is subject to displacement by wind.

""Drones are different. They're at the transitional point of free flight and hovering at the speed they fly at.

""The downwash from the propellers they generate is actually a kind of air-assist, pushing the spray down into the canopy.""

The strength and persistence of that downwash is key to determining whether the droplets land and hit the ground quickly or rebound or curl up, he says.

""From our observations, we've seen every conceivable behaviour of droplets from drones - from no observable drift to a flare that goes back above the drone's flying height and lots of sideways movement.""

He says the question is can we characterise that? ""Is it the weight of the drone, the speed, the flying height, the water volume?""

Current research suggests there is a diverse range of outcomes, nowhere near as predictable as from a ground sprayer.

Part of the reason is there are lots of confounding variables when using a drone, Dr Wolf explains.

""All the rotors are individually run, rotate different ways, and the rotational velocity is adjusted constantly to maintain the position of the drone.

""If there is a gust of wind, it will increase the downwash of some but not all the rotors, so you have a continuously variable flow field beneath the drone.""

The UK's largest potato supplier is investigating a farm-scale net-zero project which aims to increase efficiency and long-term sustainability across the entire potato supply chain.

Whether it concerns variety choice, cultivations, fertiliser, storage or transport, the three-year project, run by potato supplier Branston, hopes to establish a production method that combats carbon emissions while still producing a commercially viable crop.  

Now in its second year, the firm's field technology manager, Andy Blair, talks us through various field-scale trials that include a novel potato pulp fertiliser, nitrogen-fixing biostimulant and min-till pilots.

These are being carried out by host farmers David Armstrong in Lincolnshire and John Stirling in Scotland.

See also: How regen principles are being applied to potatoes for McCain

1. Novel potato pulp fertiliser

Nitrogen fertiliser is an essential element in growing a crop of potatoes, but it also makes up a significant part of its overall carbon footprint, explains Andy.

""That's why Branston has developed a novel fertiliser source made from waste potato pulp, which should help release 80% less carbon than standard synthetic fertilisers.""

The novel fertiliser was developed in partnership with clean technology company CCm Technologies, which uses captured carbon dioxide from industrial power generation to stabilise agricultural and industrial waste streams.

Waste potato pulp, a by-product from the peeling process, is heat-treated to a high temperature to avoid disease and bacteria contamination, before being processed into pellet form.

The pellets were applied at a rate of 1.2t/ha to the potato beds at the time of planting, with no further artificial fertiliser used during the season.

""Because the pellet is slow-releasing, a significant rate can be applied at the beginning of the season as most potatoes need nutrition in the early establishment phase.

“At the equivalent rate of nitrogen, the lower-carbon fertilisers show comparable yields to the conventional fertilisers,"" says Andy.

The main challenge of pelleted waste fertiliser is that the nutritional value per kilogramme is lower. A higher rate is required, so larger trailed spreaders are often more practical than conventional spinners.

Throughout the project, Branston has been approached by various companies looking for waste products to be used in fertiliser, including waste fire extinguisher contents, which is rich in nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur. 

2. N-fixing foliar feed

A new foliar feed that fixes nitrogen from the air by working as a photosynthetic catalyst was also trialled.

Developed by Crop Intellect, R-Leaf is sprayed directly on crop leaves, and then sunlight turns atmospheric nitrous gases into nitrate that can be used by plants.

The spray was applied at 5 litres/ha, in a little-and-often approach. It is compatible with a range of tank mixes and was used in fungicide treatments for blight control, which can also promote fungicide efficacy.

""Analysis is taking place to assess how much N has been taken up by the plots treated with R-Leaf,"" says Andy.

To instantly determine in-field crop requirements, a new system from Canadian company Piketa is providing real-time nutrient analysis by sampling crop leaves.

This has the potential to save the cost of lab analysis and allow growers to respond immediately by feeding the crop what it needs, when it needs it.  

Lower nitrogen rates

In both trial fields, a baseline plot with no applied nitrogen was treated with varying levels of nitrogen, from conventional sources.

""From the lowest N rate trials of 0kg/ha to the highest at 160kg/ha there was a 10t/ha yield increase. The biggest difference was the marketability of the potatoes, as the higher nitrogen applications had a greater percentage of bakers,"" explains Andy.

3. Reducing cultivations

Low-, medium- and high-level cultivation trials were carried out by host farmers David Armstrong and John Stirling, which essentially reduced five passes to three.

© Tm Scrivener

""Carbon footprinting isn't just about taking cultivations out, it’s also about fuel use efficiency. It’s no good taking out cultivations if the power ridger is going to work at half the speed and double its fuel consumption,"" says Andy.

""This season, we found that cultivation intensity results were dependent on soil type and normal cultivation practices. In some cases a slightly lower cultivation treatment actually gave higher yields and in others it negatively affected yield. We need the right cultivations in the right field rather than a blanket approach.""

The project is also working closely with the University of Lincoln to assess the amount of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide released through the different cultivation practices.

The University is also researching the impacts of potatoes on mycorrhizal fungi populations and how levels can be promoted.

Varieties

Different varieties may also play a key role in cutting production carbon footprint. New varieties are being assessed to see which ones perform well with low levels of nitrogen and can produce a quality, high-yielding crop with reduced irrigation and lower-quality land. 

""We achieved some good results with the variety trials, with new material showing promise at low N levels. Quality and taste panelling of these new varieties is under way. This area of work will be expanded next season,"" says Andy.

Transport and storage

As part of the Tuber Net Zero project, Branston plans to optimise crop storage conditions and minimise energy costs.

Working in conjunction with tech firm Crop Systems, a low-energy air-source system known as WarmStor has been introduced to gently warm or cool loads while potatoes are in transit.

Branston is also investigating the efficiency of potato cold stores, using a new system of airflow that does not require a defrost cycle. The firm is assessing the potential for a slightly raised storage temperature while maintaining quality and sprout control.

© Tm Scrivener

An initiative to reduce reliance on wooden boxes during harvest, storage and transport is also under way. Its box-to-bulk transition will enable lorries to transport an extra 4t directly from the field or store to the packing site.

It will remove the need for forklifts to load and unload lorries, as well as avoiding the return of lorry loads of empty wooden boxes to farms. 

The potato supplier also uses PerfoTech technology, which analyses the optimum ventilation required for the crop and lasers tiny holes into the film packaging as the potatoes are packed.

The breathable holes can also prevent condensation forming, which helps keep the potatoes fresher for longer, extending the shelf life of potatoes by up to two days for retailers and customers.

An initiative to reduce reliance on wooden boxes during harvest, storage and transport is also under way. Its box-to-bulk transition will enable lorries to transport an extra 4t directly from the field or store to the packing site.

It will remove the need for forklifts to load and unload lorries, as well as avoiding the return of lorry loads of empty wooden boxes to farms. 

The potato supplier also uses PerfoTech technology, which analyses the optimum ventilation required for the crop and lasers tiny holes into the film packaging as the potatoes are packed.

The breathable holes can also prevent condensation forming, which helps keep the potatoes fresher for longer, extending the shelf life of potatoes by up to two days for retailers and customers.

The UK's largest potato supplier is investigating a farm-scale net-zero project which aims to increase efficiency and long-term sustainability across the entire potato supply chain.

Whether it concerns variety choice, cultivations, fertiliser, storage or transport, the three-year project, run by potato supplier Branston, hopes to establish a production method that combats carbon emissions while still producing a commercially viable crop.  

Now in its second year, the firm's field technology manager, Andy Blair, talks us through various field-scale trials that include a novel potato pulp fertiliser, nitrogen-fixing biostimulant and min-till pilots.

These are being carried out by host farmers David Armstrong in Lincolnshire and John Stirling in Scotland.

1. Novel potato pulp fertiliser

Nitrogen fertiliser is an essential element in growing a crop of potatoes, but it also makes up a significant part of its overall carbon footprint, explains Andy.

""That's why Branston has developed a novel fertiliser source made from waste potato pulp, which should help release 80% less carbon than standard synthetic fertilisers.""

The novel fertiliser was developed in partnership with clean technology company CCm Technologies, which uses captured carbon dioxide from industrial power generation to stabilise agricultural and industrial waste streams.

Waste potato pulp, a by-product from the peeling process, is heat-treated to a high temperature to avoid disease and bacteria contamination, before being processed into pellet form.

The pellets were applied at a rate of 1.2t/ha to the potato beds at the time of planting, with no further artificial fertiliser used during the season.

""Because the pellet is slow-releasing, a significant rate can be applied at the beginning of the season as most potatoes need nutrition in the early establishment phase.

“At the equivalent rate of nitrogen, the lower-carbon fertilisers show comparable yields to the conventional fertilisers,"" says Andy.

The main challenge of pelleted waste fertiliser is that the nutritional value per kilogramme is lower. A higher rate is required, so larger trailed spreaders are often more practical than conventional spinners.

Throughout the project, Branston has been approached by various companies looking for waste products to be used in fertiliser, including waste fire extinguisher contents, which is rich in nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur. 

2. N-fixing foliar feed

A new foliar feed that fixes nitrogen from the air by working as a photosynthetic catalyst was also trialled.

Developed by Crop Intellect, R-Leaf is sprayed directly on crop leaves, and then sunlight turns atmospheric nitrous gases into nitrate that can be used by plants.

The spray was applied at 5 litres/ha, in a little-and-often approach. It is compatible with a range of tank mixes and was used in fungicide treatments for blight control, which can also promote fungicide efficacy.

""Analysis is taking place to assess how much N has been taken up by the plots treated with R-Leaf,"" says Andy.

To instantly determine in-field crop requirements, a new system from Canadian company Piketa is providing real-time nutrient analysis by sampling crop leaves.

This has the potential to save the cost of lab analysis and allow growers to respond immediately by feeding the crop what it needs, when it needs it.  

Lower nitrogen rates

In both trial fields, a baseline plot with no applied nitrogen was treated with varying levels of nitrogen, from conventional sources.

""From the lowest N rate trials of 0kg/ha to the highest at 160kg/ha there was a 10t/ha yield increase. The biggest difference was the marketability of the potatoes, as the higher nitrogen applications had a greater percentage of bakers,"" explains Andy.

3. Reducing cultivations

Low-, medium- and high-level cultivation trials were carried out by host farmers David Armstrong and John Stirling, which essentially reduced five passes to three.

© Tm Scrivener

""Carbon footprinting isn't just about taking cultivations out, it’s also about fuel use efficiency. It’s no good taking out cultivations if the power ridger is going to work at half the speed and double its fuel consumption,"" says Andy.

""This season, we found that cultivation intensity results were dependent on soil type and normal cultivation practices. In some cases a slightly lower cultivation treatment actually gave higher yields and in others it negatively affected yield. We need the right cultivations in the right field rather than a blanket approach.""

The project is also working closely with the University of Lincoln to assess the amount of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide released through the different cultivation practices.

The University is also researching the impacts of potatoes on mycorrhizal fungi populations and how levels can be promoted.

Varieties

Different varieties may also play a key role in cutting production carbon footprint. New varieties are being assessed to see which ones perform well with low levels of nitrogen and can produce a quality, high-yielding crop with reduced irrigation and lower-quality land. 

""We achieved some good results with the variety trials, with new material showing promise at low N levels. Quality and taste panelling of these new varieties is under way. This area of work will be expanded next season,"" says Andy.

Transport and storage

As part of the Tuber Net Zero project, Branston plans to optimise crop storage conditions and minimise energy costs.

Working in conjunction with tech firm Crop Systems, a low-energy air-source system known as WarmStor has been introduced to gently warm or cool loads while potatoes are in transit.

Branston is also investigating the efficiency of potato cold stores, using a new system of airflow that does not require a defrost cycle. The firm is assessing the potential for a slightly raised storage temperature while maintaining quality and sprout control.

Organic manures from livestock have always been a valuable source of fertiliser, but the high nitrogen prices of recent times have pushed this into sharper focus.

Just how valuable muck is depends on a number of factors, including how it is stored, whether it is analysed, and how and when it is applied to fields, says Lizzie Sagoo, soil scientist at Adas.

See also: How legumes, muck and slurry can help cut fertiliser bill

""Livestock manures contain plant nutrients and organic matter, so it's possible to put a financial value on the material to reflect its nutrient value [and calculate] the saving you would make from using the manure to supply those nutrients, as opposed to buying them in,"" she says.

Although quantifying the value of the organic matter is more challenging, Dr Sagoo says the growing awareness of the importance of organic matter in building soil health - and the subsequent benefit this has on crop and grassland growth - is helping to demonstrate what a valuable resource muck can be.

Here, Dr Sagoo shares some top tips to help growers get more bang for their buck when it comes to muck.

Storage

While storage methods for liquid and solids differ, the ability to store - rather than use immediately - enables farmers to spread at the optimum time, within legal restrictions, explains Dr Sagoo.

Field heaps are the most common method of storage for solids, but this can lead to loss of nutrients. The main concern is loss of nitrogen, which occurs as a result of ammonia volatilisation - the main pathway - and nitrate leaching.

Ammonia volatilisation can be minimised by covering heaps with a waterproof sheet. For poultry manures without bedding or litter, it is a legal requirement to cover heaps.

The location of heaps within fields is important, and AHDB's Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) sets out the advice and regulations on this. For farms in a nitrate vulnerable zone (NVZ), the key storage principles to remember are that muck should not be stored:

Heaps should be moved every 12 months and a two-year gap should be left before returning to a site.

New methods of storage, such as fermenting and composting, are becoming more popular as a means to improve muck quality (see ""Bokashi benefits"").

However, Dr Sagoo warns that these practices come at an additional cost, so it is important to ensure there is evidence to show they will bring an additional benefit.

Nutrient analysis

More farmers are now getting their manure analysed, says Dr Sagoo, who adds that this is worthwhile as there is often significant variability in the nutrient quality of manures.

These differences can be down to factors such as different livestock diets. For solid muck, quality is also affected by bedding materials and storage.

The risk with not analysing muck is that farms could be over- or under-dosing other nutrients, which will in turn affect the performance of the grassland or crops it is applied to.

At a basic level, the RB209 guide provides averages for the nutrient content of muck and slurry. But for a more advanced analysis, samples can be sent to a laboratory.

Solid muck can be harder to measure and quantify than liquids © Tim Scrivener

To get a reliable analysis, the sample needs to be representative of the material that is actually being spread.

One option is to sample while spreading, either out of the hose when applying liquid, or collecting small samples of the solid.

Another method is to sample from the heap.

When doing this, farmers should dig down into the heap, taking multiple samples from different parts of the store and mixing them together to get a more representative result, says Dr Sagoo.

Adas research has also shown positive results from nutrient analysis of slurry using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy.

This can be seen in John Deere's HarvestLab tool, which enables the slurry to be analysed using a single internal sensor.

This real-time analysis means application rates can be adapted on the go, offering farmers a potential step-up in terms of manure management in the future, says Dr Sagoo.

Spreading

The method used for spreading will depend on whether the manure is solid or liquid.

But either way, it is vital that farmers take the same amount of care when applying organic manures as they do with bagged inputs, says Dr Sagoo.

This includes regular maintenance and calibration of machinery prior to spreading, to ensure even and accurate application.

Understanding application rates of organic materials is also important.

How much is being applied is relatively easy to monitor when spreading liquid via a pump with a known output rate, or a tanker with a known volume, but can be more challenging with solid muck.

She advises weighing a trailer when full and empty.

If this is not possible, growers should use trailer dimensions to work out the capacity and then consider the bulk density of the material to calculate what is being applied.

Generally, the bulk density of muck is about 0.7t/cu m.

""Organic manure is incredibly valuable, but it doesn't come with 20-10-10 on the bag,"" she says.

""You have to take a bit of extra time to work out what's in it and what's spread, to properly integrate it into your nutrient management plan.

""If you don't, there is a risk that you'll over- or under-apply and each of those scenarios has financial and environmental consequences.""

Bokashi benefits

Fermenting muck - via a process called ""bokashi"" - is an alternative option to traditional field heap storage.

Bokashi is a Japanese term for fermented organic matter, and the process involves adding a starter culture of bacteria to the muck and ensiling it in a way similar to silage.

This creates anaerobic conditions which cause the muck to ferment, explains Andrew Sincock, commercial director at Agriton, which supplies bacteria products.

The benefits of this are that muck stays cooler, retains more nutrients and leads to less carbon loss, compared with the aerobic processes that stored muck traditionally goes through.

""It's really easy - most farmers are already making silage, so they're aware of the principles,"" explains Mr Sincock.

""It [involves] a weekly application of micro-organisms onto the bedding during the housed period.

""When they [farmers] come to muck the sheds out, they simply muck it out as they would normally, put it into a heap and cover it with a black plastic sheet.

""It's not a huge job, it's not massively labour intensive, but the benefits are certainly significant.""

Virtual fencing technology is helping give livestock production a future on a north Devon farm with one of England's steepest and most spectacular coastlines.

David and Debbie Kennard, who farm with their son, Nick, at Borough Farm, Mortehoe, had thought that without support from the Basic Payment Scheme, keeping livestock in the protected landscape would no longer be tenable.

See also: How protected landscapes scheme is funding farm improvements

To make matters worse, regular incidents involving walkers with dogs had seen sheep lost over cliff edges.

However, the National Trust, from which the Kennards rent 140ha (346 acres) of coastal land, was keen to see farming continue and wanted to help its tenants move towards a more regenerative and sustainable system.

This would ideally involve replacing sheep - they currently run 500 Exmoor Mule ewes - with a low stocking rate of cattle on their coastal areas.

Farm facts: Borough Farm, Mortehoe

But as David explains: ""We're on the South West Coast Path and 100,000 visitors walk through every year, so that rules out keeping bulls and cows with calves.""

Virtual fencing lines

The solution was found with the help of a virtual fencing product that uses GPS to retain stock within a boundary mapped out on an app.

Collars with solar-powered batteries fitted to each animal play an audible melody that teaches stock not to cross the virtual fence line.

This Nofence system is used to control grazing for up to 40 head of Belted Galloways, which were bought in batches as yearlings from nearby Dartmoor to rear on the clifftop and adjoining farmland.

Here, they are kept without supplementary feeding - a requirement stipulated by Natural England on the Morte Point site of special scientific interest (SSSI) - and finished by three years of age.

""Our National Trust ranger had trialled the Nofence system on Exmoor and encouraged us to give it a go,"" says Nick, who joined the farm after studying agriculture and animal nutrition at Harper Adams University.

""We began with 20 collars and trained the cattle in a field with fixed boundaries, positioning the virtual boundary just inside the actual hedge.

""Within three weeks, we started removing the solid boundary, first by taking off a corner of the field and checking the cattle did not cross the line,"" he says.

This can be double-checked on the app, which maps the position of each animal wearing a collar at any time and sends phone alerts if an animal crosses the line.

The process involves the cattle hearing the signal as they approach the virtual boundary and only feeling a pulse if they move too close to that line.

They quickly learn to associate the sound with the impending pulse and avoid approaching the boundary another time.

""We have been quite impressed,"" says David. ""And since we introduced the cattle to the clifftop area, we haven't recorded any that have strayed.""

This has allowed cattle to graze right up to the coastal path without reaching the dangerous clifftops and with none being lost over the edge.

Grazing habits

National Trust ranger Paul South has helped the Kennards manage the plan.

He explains that, unlike sheep, whose selective grazing targets soft grasses and flowers, and whose light footprint does nothing to suppress bracken, cattle graze fairly unselectively.

They will tear all species of grass and even clear scrub, including brambles and blackthorn.

""Our natural flora evolved with large grazing herbivores such as oryx and bison, which would graze an area and move on, due to predation,"" he says.

""By using the collars, the cattle are mimicking that pattern of behaviour, mob-grazing an area and pushing into bracken and scrub.""

All of this provides an opportunity for new growth as light reaches the ground, new seeds are stamped in, and land is then rested as stock are moved away for several weeks or months.

This allows areas previously shaded by bracken and scrub to support new mosaics of habitat and boost newly introduced and diverse plant species in the opened-up ground.

And with new habitats comes more insect and mammalian life, performing functions such as burying dung, cycling nutrients, capturing carbon, pollinating wildflowers and feeding more life up the food chain.

The National Trust is closely monitoring these outcomes, although it has yet to gather complete sets of data to compare with vegetation mapped at the outset.

""Anecdotally, I can see such a difference,"" says Mr South. ""The cattle came here in December 2019 and already there are structural changes in the vegetation, such as less bracken and more primroses.""

Premium potential

Both parties praise the working relationship, which has helped the National Trust qualify for Higher-Level Stewardship and created sustainable management processes.

At the same time, it has provided the Kennards with a means of producing low-input, native-breed, grass-fed beef, potentially at a premium price.

""At the moment, we just sell to the abattoir, usually at R3H grade, and must reach a carcass weight of 250kg,"" says David.

""This is just achievable, but if we don't reach it, we'll lose at least 40p/kg.""

The only drawback they have experienced so far is the loss of battery charge as the collars' solar panels become scratched by the blackthorn and gorse.

And, while the financial investment was grant-funded on his farm, he thinks it may not be viable in some situations.

""I also feel a little vulnerable to changes in the price of the app and may feel concerned about keeping cattle alongside a main road without a perimeter fence,"" he adds.

However, the team says the virtual fencing is allowing conservation and farming to co-exist to the benefit of all involved.

""The National Trust is committed to making it sustainable for us as well as for coastal habitat management,"" says David.

""I think we are on the way to making it work.""

High-yielding dairy herds are more feed-efficient than low-yielding herds, but improvements must be made in cow fertility and longevity to lower methane emissions.

A study of 21 farms across five systems, varying from more than nine months grazed to fully housed, assessed the whole-farm feed efficiency for all animals.

It found average whole-farm feed efficiency increased as grazing time decreased across systems, although there was huge variation within systems.

See also: Advice on observing housed cows to improve dairy sheds

Factors that can improve feed efficiency

Phil Garnsworthy, professor of dairy science at the University of Nottingham, who carried out the research, said: ""Higher-yielding cows partition a greater proportion of energy to milk and you [have] much better control of your feed inputs when you house cows.

""[This is because] with a grazing system you get under-utilisation of grass at different times of the year.""

The main driver of efficiency was milk output/ha, he said.

The effect of poor fertility

Although methane levels reduce the more milk is produced, fertility can undo this, he cautioned.

Historically, there has been a negative correlation between milk yield and fertility, with pregnancy rate to first service declining over the years, said Prof Garnsworthy.

Poor fertility directly increases a farm's replacement rate and affects the lifetime efficiency of an animal.

Furthermore, feed demand for heifers rises from 16% to 44% if the replacement rate increases from 20% to 45%.

Prof Garnsworthy explained: ""The higher the replacement rate and the longer it takes before first calving, the less efficient the herd. Feed and methane costs of rearing are spread over fewer kilogrammes of milk.

""It takes one-and-a-half lactations to pay back heifer rearing costs. A lot of these cows will be culled in the first lactation, and they will never have made a profit at all.""

He concluded: ""We can get a huge reduction in methane by going for high-yielding cows, but not if it affects fertility. I'm not suggesting we house all cows [because] we can improve efficiency in all systems by boosting fertility.""

Phil Garnsworthy was speaking at the 2023 British Cattle Breeders Conference on 25 January.

586,"Lab-grown meat more costly for environment, study finds","https://www.fwi.co.uk/news/lab-grown-meat-more-costly-for-environment-study-finds","Lab-grown meat more costly for environment, study finds

New research has raised doubts over whether lab-grown meat could be a greener alternative for the planet than conventional meat produced from livestock.

Scientists at the Department of Food Science and Technology, University of California, Davis, found the carbon footprint of lab-grown, or ""cultivated"" meat, could be up to 25 times worse for the climate than meat produced by raising and slaughtering farm animals (PDF).

Food scientist Derrick Risner and colleagues assessed the environmental impact of near-term animal cell-based meat (ACBM), or ""cultured meat"", production.

See also: Is lab-grown meat a threat to traditional livestock farming?

The researchers estimated that each kilogram of ACBM produces between 246kg and 1,508kg of carbon dioxide, which is four to 25 times greater than the median global warming potential of regular beef produced from livestock.

This is because the carbon dioxide emitted for the different stages of lab-grown meat production, especially the highly purified growing process, is highly energy intensive, they say.

""Animal cell culture is traditionally done with growth medium components that have been refined to remove/reduce endotoxin,"" say the researchers.

""The method of endotoxin reduction or elimination is highly dependent upon the properties of the substance being purified""¦ the use of these refinement methods contributes significantly to the economic and environmental costs associated with pharmaceutical products since they are both energy and resource intensive.""

A study published in January by Pelle Sinke at CE Delft, a consulting company based in the Netherlands, concluded that lab-grown meat could have a lower carbon footprint than beef, if technology improves the production process.

Commenting on the findings of this latest study, NFU deputy president Tom Bradshaw said: ""Innovation and new technology has always been central to the progress of British livestock farming and we must continue to drive the ambition of producing climate-friendly beef and lamb that delivers carbon storage and environmental habitats. 

""Although the science of lab-grown meat is interesting, there are still too many unknowns about health and sustainability to be able to give further comment.""

A step increase in the agricultural budget for England to £4bn a year, including £720m of ""stability"" money, is essential if the government is to achieve its environmental, climate change and food production targets, says the NFU in its newly released manifesto.

The current government commitment is to maintain existing annual spending in England at £2.4bn for the life of this parliament.

But with a general election due next year - possibly as soon as May - politicians of all parties need to be thinking now about how they will fund their plans from 2025, says the NFU.

See also: NFU manifesto demands government targets for food production

To help in this, the NFU commissioned consultants Andersons to calculate how much would be needed to secure environmental delivery, productivity improvements and farm income stability.

Their modelling shows that, just for the environment, a budget of £2.7bn is required to meet the government's own Environment Improvement Plan, plus the Climate Change Committee's recommendations - including £1.1bn for habitat creation and species-friendly land management.

Productivity

Andersons also calculated that £615m will be needed each year to drive productivity - a sum that is based on current spending in seven other competing nations, including the US, New Zealand, Germany and France.

And to underpin financial stability for farmers, the NFU is seeking a further £720m - similar to the amount that will be paid out as delinked direct payments to farmers in England in 2024.

The NFU is quick to point out that it does not expect this money to take the form of a direct payment. ""That ship has sailed,"" said its deputy president Tom Bradshaw.

But the union is looking at various ways in which stability money could be allocated, including as top-ups to agri-environment payments or as a production-linked beef sustainability payment. 

""We don't want to get into a debate about how that money should be spent, but we must ensure that food production is no longer the poor relation in all this,"" said Mr Bradshaw.

Response

The NFU's manifesto, which includes a demand for statutory targets for food production, was presented to MPs in Westminster on Monday (11 December).

Robert Goodwill, who chairs the cross-party Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) committee, said it made a strong case for extra budget.

""If we are to deliver environmental goods, we need the funding behind it,"" he said.

""Previously, the Basic Payment Scheme was just money in the bank, but under the new ELM scheme, farmers have got to do things, which either cost money or mean sacrificing output.""

Sir Robert added that both the Conservatives and Labour would be studying the books ahead of the election. ""If anyone thinks a change of government will lead to more money in their pockets, they might be disappointed.""

But NFU policy director Andrew Clark insisted the £4bn funding demand was realistic. ""We fully recognise that public budgets are going to be under pressure,"" he said.

""But we're talking here about funding that is going to be across the whole of the country, every constituency, delivering objectives the government has set out as statutory objectives.""

Liberal Democrat rural spokesman Tim Farron said he believed farming had been neglected for too long by the current government.

""It is high time ministers stepped up to the plate,"" he said. ""That means giving farmers the financial support they need, so they can protect our beautiful environment while producing wonderful food for generations to come.""

NFU Scotland asks for funding

A multi-annual funding commitment to support Scottish farmers and crofters to produce food and protect the environment tops the list of ""key asks"" for NFU Scotland (NFUS).

Westminster allocates £620m to the Scottish government for farming every year, but there is no guarantee this will continue in the next parliament.

NFUS policy director Jonnie Hall says Scottish farmers and crofters are required to do the ""heavy lifting"" around food production, climate mitigation and enhancing nature.

With a general election looming, Mr Hall said all political parties must commit to ringfenced multi-annual funding for the next parliament.

He argued that the Westminster government should increase its budget allocation to Scotland, which is about 17% of the total budget.

NFUS is calling on all political parties to include a manifesto pledge that would see the UK agricultural budget of about £3.7bn a year increase by at least £1bn for the term of the next parliament.

This would equate to an additional £170m a year for Scottish agriculture.

The union is also demanding the immediate reinstatement of £61m of agricultural funding allocated to the Scottish government by the UK Treasury, which has been ""withdrawn"".

Low input hybrid rye has a bright future

Provided by

KWS is one of the world's leading plant breeding companies combining 165 years of heritage with leading edge technology and a commitment to develop and deliver varieties with the best yields, disease resistance, physical traits and resistance to abiotic stress.

Rye uses less water than wheat, needs less N to achieve similar yields and requires less agronomic interventions. It's the ultimate sustainable crop for the future.

Sustainability is at the forefront of everything now which, in its simplest form for agriculture, means maintaining or increasing yield whilst reducing inputs, says KWS technical specialist Olivia Potter.

© KWS UK LTD

""It is well known that hybrid rye is a light land, drought-tolerant cereal with a fantastic root system. We also know that when it comes to Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE) hybrid rye leaves winter wheat trailing in its wake.

""Hybrid rye's ability to produce high yields from relatively modest amounts of applied nitrogen is capturing peoples' imaginations.

""In our latest trials, carried out in conjunction with NIAB we looked to see how four of our hybrid rye varieties would fare with low levels of applied nitrogen.

""A 120kg N/ha and an 80kg N/ Ha regime saw all our varieties yield comfortably over 10 tonnes per hectare and KWS Tayo achieved an astonishing 10.84T/ha yield from the 80Kg N/Ha regime! This underlines the crop's potential to help growers make major cost saving and help sustainability.""

© KWS UK LTD

Extensive benefits

According to KWS hybrid rye product manager Dominic Spurrier, the crop's benefits extend far beyond cost saving.

""The structure of the plant means that in reverse to wheat and barley, the leaves play a less important role in obtaining energy, this coupled with rye's low susceptibility to diseases like septoria and rhynchosporium ensures disease control is easier and cheaper.

""Hybrid rye offers good rotational value, it can be drilled from early September through to the end of October and is earlier to harvest than wheat, it offers a partial break from take-all and performs superbly in the second or third cereal position.

""KWS' Pollen Plus technology within the hybrid breeding programme has greatly reduced ergot infection, once the bane of rye growers.

""Rye is a fast-growing crop, and its speed of growth gives it significant weed competition potential with the added bonus of a straw yield being up to 30% more than wheat or barley.

""Hybrid rye has a robust root system that helps improve soil structure. This system is also what makes it ideal for light land and our increasingly varied climate. Rye needs 25% less water than either wheat or barley, too.""

© KWS UK LTD

Increasing market opportunities

KWS hybrid rye varieties are truly dual purpose, with 50% of the seed produced used for whole cropping plus hybrid rye provides a vital role as an energy source for anaerobic digestion, he says.

""From the grain perspective, demand is being driven by the feed sector, distillery production and the food industry.

""The structure of rye grain, particularly in relation to wheat, means that rye offers health benefits when used as a feed. Many studies on pig diets show that rye improves gut health and keeps pigs feeling fuller for longer.

""We are continually researching and building evidence to support the feeding of rye in other sectors, for example we have just concluded a year-long study on egg-laying hens.

""A trial involving 16,000 birds showed there was no difference in production, from egg numbers, quality and most importantly hen health, with poultry fed a standard wheat-based diet to one where 25% of the wheat was replaced with rye.

""All in all, hybrid rye fits well with current and future demands, to move to a more sustainable production system, requiring fewer inputs whilst also being able to cope better in terms of greater climate variability.""

Independent trial data assessing the impact of plasma-treated slurry as a replacement of artificial fertiliser has revealed promising results when tested on crops of winter wheat and grass.

The novel technology developed by Norwegian firm N2 Applied uses air and electricity to boost the nitrogen (N) content of liquid manures and aims to help farmers reduce nutrient losses and improve crop performance.

See also: New soil service tests for plant available nutrients

Across three years' worth of trial data, the plasma-treated slurry was shown to increase both wheat and grass nitrogen yields by an average of 34%, when compared with untreated slurry.

The results were combined with the previous two years of trials which revealed a consistent increase in N-yield, ranging year-on-year from 27% to 41%.

In addition, the nitrogen-enriched organic fertiliser averaged a 59% increase in nitrogen use efficiency for wheat and grass compared with untreated slurry over a three-year trial period.

Annual field trials were carried out by independent research partners in diverse locations with a wide range of soil and climatic conditions.

During the 2022 season, yield trials were conducted by Adas, Oxford Agricultural Trials and Scotland's Rural College. Digestate, cow and pig slurry were all put to the test.

Emission cuts

As the treated slurry is more stable, a higher proportion of N is available to plants rather than leaching into soils and waterways.

The enriched slurry matches performance levels of a typical ammonium fertiliser.

When compared with an ammonium nitrate-based fertiliser, the nitrogen use efficiency of the treated product was 96% of that achieved by the artificial fertiliser.

Furthermore, ammonia and methane emissions are cut severely in the slurry zapping process, which also recycles on-farm nutrients and applies organic N and carbon to the soil, helping it to thrive.

The acidification of slurries reduces ammonia emissions and the plasma treatment process reduces the pH of slurries from 7.5-8 to 5-5.5pH.

Any unstable N is no longer lost as ammonia gas and instead is retained in the form of nitrate in the acidic environment.

Three years of Adas emission trials has consistently demonstrated a significant reduction in ammonia emissions, with a 5% loss from treated slurry compared with 30% loss from the untreated, on average.

However, there was no significant difference when comparing ammonia emissions between the treated slurry and ammonium nitrate fertiliser.

Furthermore, methane is almost entirely eliminated, leading to significant reduction in the amount of emissions associated with livestock farming.

Carl Hansson, chief executive officer of N2 Applied, says the company is on a mission to produce a sustainable on-farm fertiliser, which is why the firm has continued to assess the efficacy of the treated slurry through trial work.

""These latest results demonstrate that plasma treatment stands toe-to-toe with chemical fertilisers on yield, and is more attractive, given the environmental benefits.

Technology

The patented plasma technology is now available from equipment manufactured by GEA Farm Technologies.

The plasma conversion ""locks in"" both carbon and nitrogen to the liquid waste material, while vastly enriching its nitrogen content.

Fact file

Agrii agronomist Neil Harper demonstrates a ""have a go approach"" to new cropping, technology and products rolled out across his clients' farms.

He relishes taking on new challenges to develop his career and deepen his understanding of agriculture.

Neil originally started doing seasonal work at John Boyd Farms in Lenham.

After leaving Hadlow College, he was then taken on full time and progressed through the business - from farmworker to arable farm manager. 

Then, in 2015, Neil took the opportunity to join Agrii and move into agronomy advice - and he has not looked back.

Grower support

Neil manages the agronomy for a broad portfolio of customers, including farm owners, tenants, young farmers who are stepping into farm management, and contract farmers.

He started with about 2,000ha of business but has grown this to 6,000ha, retaining some 1,500ha of the original succession business, including giving the agronomy advice on the farm he started out on.

His clients' farming operations range from full tillage systems to direct-drilling, and he advises on implementing all different aspects of regenerative farming.

Neil and farmer Alan Clifton-Holt, from AA Clifton, have been working together for six years.

The 1,600ha family farm is based in Romney Marsh, Kent, where high silt soils and a high water level can be beneficial, but bring challenges with soil structures and weed burdens.

In conjunction with Neil and Agrii, the farm has been battling a historic high blackgrass pressure, which in the past has seen yields reduced from a potential 12t/ha to 5t/ha.

Spring cropping and cover crops have been introduced into the farming system.

Wheat yields are now getting back up to the targeted 12t/ha.

Alan says Neil has brought ""constructive change"" to the farm business.

""We are doing reduced tillage. Varieties have changed too,"" he says.

""Flea beetle pressure on oilseed rape can be high, so we are growing beans, spring oats and winter barley to lengthen our rotation.

""We have also moved into growing winter wheat Group 1s and 2s for profitability and resilience.

""We are using the data from Neil and the R&D that Agrii provides to help us do this.""

Alan is always looking at alternative cropping and mustard is the next crop on his research list.

Neil has introduced some large cover crop trials at his farm looking into different mixes and varieties within species, and the nutrient benefits they can gain from using these in different rotations.

Large plots of winter wheat (0.3-0.5ha) growing between 12-15 varieties, and including untreated plots, also help Alan decide how current and future varieties perform on-farm.

Alan and Neil use Agrii's MAP benchmarking service and the Yagro benchmarking service.

The data is reviewed and used to make future decisions to help drive Alan's business forward.

Additional services

In addition to the agronomy, Neil's practical experience of farming helps him provide advice on all aspects of farming.

This ranges from budgeting, environmental and compliance, to digital farming, soils and machinery.

He also sources external support for specialist topics.

Each year, Neil (with the support of Agrii) hosts different events covering various farming topics, such as cover crops, machinery, spray and fertiliser applications, drilling days and local farm trials. 

Outside of farming, Neil enjoys playing cricket and also coaches junior teams.

This gives him the opportunity to have family time with his wife and two children to try to strike a good work-life balance.

What the judges say""¦

Neil continues to experiment with various trial-based systems and methods to gain knowledge for himself to roll out to his client base. His enthusiasm and drive to achieve this stands out.

Fact file

Todd Jex is a ""one-club man"" who has been working for agronomy group Agrii for 12 years since he graduated from Harper Adams University with a degree in agriculture and crop management.

When he started working at Masstock (rebranded to Agrii) he had no clients, but now advises 25 arable farmers covering almost 10,000ha across Dorset, Wiltshire, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.

Todd provides fully integrated agronomic advice, including bi-weekly field walking, advice on rotations, establishment systems, nutrient inputs, cultural management and machinery.

Great technical knowledge around soil health and monitoring forms the basis of his regenerative and no-till farming strategy.

Grower support

About 40% of Todd's clients farm in a conventional manner and are generally min-till based.

The remaining 60% are no-till farming in regenerative-type farming systems.

Todd says his interest in no-till/regenerative farming systems was sparked by meetings with no-till pioneer Tony Reynolds in 2016.

He saw first-hand how his system had improved soil structure, lowered reliance on synthetic inputs and significantly reduced blackgrass levels, compared with neighbouring farms.

Todd has been instrumental in helping his clients move to more sustainable farming systems.

For example, Dorset grower and contractor George Fraser, who farms 1,400ha in Shaftesbury, has seen many benefits of switching 95% of his business to a regenerative system.

""We have seen an improvement in our gross margins, soil resilience and biodiversity while maintaining, and in most cases increasing, yields,"" George says.

However, Todd is flexible in his regen approach and says he and his clients ""cannot afford to be evangelical at the expense of profitability"".

For example, he is not against targeted use of the plough if he needs to press the reset button in a bad grassweed situation, such as brome and blackgrass.

He also gives consideration to crop residue levels and carbon-to-nitrogen ratios and how these will impact establishment.

Todd is acutely aware of cost pressures his clients face with the regression of the Basic Payment Scheme and increasing production costs.

So he is trying to make savings on their agrochemical bill, while still providing consistent crop yields and quality.

He is reducing their use of synthetic fertilisers and replacing this with organic manures in growing crops.

And his customers make full use of Agrii's long-standing MAP benchmarking group.

Todd says most of his clients no longer use insecticides or only apply them for early drilled winter cereals.

They will be able to bank this opportunity under Defra's Sustainable Farming Incentive.

Additional services

Todd backs up his crop walking service and reports with quarterly educational open days involving 200-plus farmers, a range of on-farm field-scale and tramline trials, and farm walks.

These have covered soil health, cover crops, no-till farming and technical advancements.

He has developed a set of chemical, biological and physical tests to monitor soil health, and recording system that allows future measurement of improvements.

In 2013, he launched a local farmer discussion group, 15 Tonne Club, with farmer members setting the agenda for meetings.

In recent years, Todd has used drone technology with Drone Ag's Skippy Scout software alongside a handheld Yara N-tester to improve nitrogen-use efficiency.

This technology decision-making is backed up through the use of satellite imagery.

What the judges say""¦

Todd is embracing sustainable min-till/no-till strategies to help his clients minimise their costs, using extensive soil analysis and benchmarking to aid crop performance.

The North Wales-based ProCam agronomist says this has been his guiding principle for success in his agronomy career spanning more than 40 years.

Merfyn is a trusted supplier-agronomist offering products and advice to clients, a digestate broker to reduce fertiliser bills, and mentor to two staff members who have joined County Crops.

More than 60% of his business is conducted in Welsh - a language most of his clients feel comfortable doing business in.

Grower support

Merfyn works with a diverse range of businesses, covering everything from medium-

sized arable enterprises, a plethora of mixed farms and several large dairy farms, some of which extend from 400 to 1,000 cows.

He specialises in providing technical agronomic advice to a wide range of clients on wheat, barley and forage crops, such as grass leys, forage maize, fodder beet, grazing brassicas, wholecrop cereals and root crops.

Some shooting syndicates also value his help with growing the most suitable cover crops for pheasants.

Various climates across Merfyn's region often present challenges in selecting the best crop varieties for different climates.

His biggest hurdle is coping with the loss of active ingredients, but drier conditions can also be demanding.

""The Vale of Clywd has an annual rainfall of approximately 25 inches [635mm], which is unusually dry for North Wales,"" he notes.

Merfyn says herbicide-resistant weeds, such as ryegrass and blackgrass, are among the biggest threats to cropping.

Blackgrass is ""thundering in"" to the region and he is tackling this by stacking pre-emergence herbicides or putting fields back into grass or silage on livestock or dairy farms.

Providing fertiliser and crop nutrition advice is a key aspect of his work.

In February, he was elected to the Basis Membership Committee as the organisation's Facts-qualified adviser.

Merfyn is nitrate vulnerable zone conscious and says increased focus on soil and tissue analysis of soils and slurries for nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium help inform his fertiliser plans for farmers who are looking to grow quality crops and grass to feed their cows.

He is also mindful of likely future restrictions regarding phosphate levels in soils.

His customers now use sulphur-based fertilisers to better effect with clear improvements in cereal grain and oilseed rape crop quality.

Merfyn recommends growing cover crops to enhance soil health and also benefit from stewardship payments offered by the Welsh government.

And he has found success in companion cropping maize with Italian ryegrass to reduce N run-off and soil erosion, and to provide winter grazing for sheep.

Additional services

Having been in the industry for the majority of his career, Merfyn is now sometimes working with the third generation of customers in his North Wales patch.

He is well-liked and widely respected not only by farmers, but so many other people in his region for his work as an independent councillor on Denbighshire County Council and as an organiser of charity events, including charity tractor runs.

Merfyn helped his company expand their coverage across North Wales with the recruitment of two new agronomists to the County Crops team: Rhys Owen, a seed expert who is now a key figure in ProCam's Field Options team and Gareth Mitchell, a first-class forage agronomist.

He guides them both when needed, but trusts them to use their own knowledge and initiative.

Fact file

Agrii agronomist Neil Harper demonstrates a ""have a go approach"" to new cropping, technology and products rolled out across his clients' farms.

He relishes taking on new challenges to develop his career and deepen his understanding of agriculture.

Neil originally started doing seasonal work at John Boyd Farms in Lenham.

After leaving Hadlow College, he was then taken on full time and progressed through the business - from farmworker to arable farm manager. 

Then, in 2015, Neil took the opportunity to join Agrii and move into agronomy advice - and he has not looked back.

Grower support

Neil manages the agronomy for a broad portfolio of customers, including farm owners, tenants, young farmers who are stepping into farm management, and contract farmers.

He started with about 2,000ha of business but has grown this to 6,000ha, retaining some 1,500ha of the original succession business, including giving the agronomy advice on the farm he started out on.

His clients' farming operations range from full tillage systems to direct-drilling, and he advises on implementing all different aspects of regenerative farming.

Neil and farmer Alan Clifton-Holt, from AA Clifton, have been working together for six years.

The 1,600ha family farm is based in Romney Marsh, Kent, where high silt soils and a high water level can be beneficial, but bring challenges with soil structures and weed burdens.

In conjunction with Neil and Agrii, the farm has been battling a historic high blackgrass pressure, which in the past has seen yields reduced from a potential 12t/ha to 5t/ha.

Spring cropping and cover crops have been introduced into the farming system.

Wheat yields are now getting back up to the targeted 12t/ha.

Alan says Neil has brought ""constructive change"" to the farm business.

""We are doing reduced tillage. Varieties have changed too,"" he says.

""Flea beetle pressure on oilseed rape can be high, so we are growing beans, spring oats and winter barley to lengthen our rotation.

""We have also moved into growing winter wheat Group 1s and 2s for profitability and resilience.

""We are using the data from Neil and the R&D that Agrii provides to help us do this.""

Alan is always looking at alternative cropping and mustard is the next crop on his research list.

Neil has introduced some large cover crop trials at his farm looking into different mixes and varieties within species, and the nutrient benefits they can gain from using these in different rotations.

Large plots of winter wheat (0.3-0.5ha) growing between 12-15 varieties, and including untreated plots, also help Alan decide how current and future varieties perform on-farm.

Alan and Neil use Agrii's MAP benchmarking service and the Yagro benchmarking service.

The data is reviewed and used to make future decisions to help drive Alan's business forward.

Additional services

In addition to the agronomy, Neil's practical experience of farming helps him provide advice on all aspects of farming.

This ranges from budgeting, environmental and compliance, to digital farming, soils and machinery.

He also sources external support for specialist topics.

Each year, Neil (with the support of Agrii) hosts different events covering various farming topics, such as cover crops, machinery, spray and fertiliser applications, drilling days and local farm trials. 

Outside of farming, Neil enjoys playing cricket and also coaches junior teams.

This gives him the opportunity to have family time with his wife and two children to try to strike a good work-life balance.

What the judges say""¦

Neil continues to experiment with various trial-based systems and methods to gain knowledge for himself to roll out to his client base. His enthusiasm and drive to achieve this stands out.

Fact file

Todd Jex is a ""one-club man"" who has been working for agronomy group Agrii for 12 years since he graduated from Harper Adams University with a degree in agriculture and crop management.

When he started working at Masstock (rebranded to Agrii) he had no clients, but now advises 25 arable farmers covering almost 10,000ha across Dorset, Wiltshire, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.

Todd provides fully integrated agronomic advice, including bi-weekly field walking, advice on rotations, establishment systems, nutrient inputs, cultural management and machinery.

Great technical knowledge around soil health and monitoring forms the basis of his regenerative and no-till farming strategy.

Grower support

About 40% of Todd's clients farm in a conventional manner and are generally min-till based.

The remaining 60% are no-till farming in regenerative-type farming systems.

Todd says his interest in no-till/regenerative farming systems was sparked by meetings with no-till pioneer Tony Reynolds in 2016.

He saw first-hand how his system had improved soil structure, lowered reliance on synthetic inputs and significantly reduced blackgrass levels, compared with neighbouring farms.

Todd has been instrumental in helping his clients move to more sustainable farming systems.

For example, Dorset grower and contractor George Fraser, who farms 1,400ha in Shaftesbury, has seen many benefits of switching 95% of his business to a regenerative system.

""We have seen an improvement in our gross margins, soil resilience and biodiversity while maintaining, and in most cases increasing, yields,"" George says.

However, Todd is flexible in his regen approach and says he and his clients ""cannot afford to be evangelical at the expense of profitability"".

For example, he is not against targeted use of the plough if he needs to press the reset button in a bad grassweed situation, such as brome and blackgrass.

He also gives consideration to crop residue levels and carbon-to-nitrogen ratios and how these will impact establishment.

Todd is acutely aware of cost pressures his clients face with the regression of the Basic Payment Scheme and increasing production costs.

So he is trying to make savings on their agrochemical bill, while still providing consistent crop yields and quality.

He is reducing their use of synthetic fertilisers and replacing this with organic manures in growing crops.

And his customers make full use of Agrii's long-standing MAP benchmarking group.

Todd says most of his clients no longer use insecticides or only apply them for early drilled winter cereals.

They will be able to bank this opportunity under Defra's Sustainable Farming Incentive.

Additional services

Todd backs up his crop walking service and reports with quarterly educational open days involving 200-plus farmers, a range of on-farm field-scale and tramline trials, and farm walks.

These have covered soil health, cover crops, no-till farming and technical advancements.

He has developed a set of chemical, biological and physical tests to monitor soil health, and recording system that allows future measurement of improvements.

In 2013, he launched a local farmer discussion group, 15 Tonne Club, with farmer members setting the agenda for meetings.

In recent years, Todd has used drone technology with Drone Ag's Skippy Scout software alongside a handheld Yara N-tester to improve nitrogen-use efficiency.

This technology decision-making is backed up through the use of satellite imagery.

What the judges say""¦

Todd is embracing sustainable min-till/no-till strategies to help his clients minimise their costs, using extensive soil analysis and benchmarking to aid crop performance.

Results from the first UK farm to test methane emissions in sheep using portable accumulation chambers have shown they were producing on average about 20g/day of methane and 1.2kg/day of carbon dioxide.

The trial took place at Hole Farm, Hertfordshire where Rob Hodgkins and Jo Franklin run 2,500 New Zealand Romneys and sell female breeding stock for low-input sheep systems.

However, there was a large amount of variation between the 120 yearlings used in the trial.

See also: 17 ways sheep farmers can work towards net zero

Despite being managed in the same group on a grass-only diet, the sheep recorded methane emissions varying from 12g/day to 28g/day, which could not be explained solely by differences in liveweight.

""Preliminary analysis on this relatively small sample of sheep suggests there may be significant differences between sires in how much methane their offspring produce,"" says Dr Nicola Lambe, a sheep geneticist with SRUC.

""This result supports research findings from New Zealand, Ireland and other countries, which have shown that methane emissions measured in portable accumulation units [PACs] are under genetic control,"" says Nicola.

""Therefore, there should be scope to include these methane measurements in breeding programmes to try to simultaneously optimise production efficiency and reduce methane emissions from sheep.""

Farm facts

Rob and Jo were awarded £48,884 from Innovate UK, which funds business-led innovation.

This was co-ordinated by Agri-EPI and covered the hire of the PACs, input from SRUC, and DNA profiling.

At Hole Farm, grazing was measured to establish dry matter intakes during the five weeks before testing.

Sheep were then weighed at testing (average 57kg; range 43-83kg) and were allocated to groups of 12 to ensure there was a mix of sires in each one.

How the testing works

The Eagle 2 gas monitor © MAG/Martin Ward

The testing equipment was designed and built by AgResearch in New Zealand.

It comprises 12 portable accumulation chambers (PACs) mounted on a trailer, six either side of a central aisle. Each chamber is a sealed metal box and can hold one sheep.

Prior to testing, each sheep's electronic identification (EID) is recorded along with its weight, the chamber number and the gas measurements in the chamber.

Two sets of measurements are taken, two weeks apart.

The sheep enters the chamber via a door at the front and can be seen at all times during testing through a large window in the door.

It spends 50 minutes in the PAC; during this time, the animal is monitored visually, and the percentage of oxygen and carbon dioxide, and methane in parts/million, are measured using an Eagle 2 gas monitor via a valve in the top of each chamber.

Gas measurements are taken at 25 minutes and 50 minutes, explains SRUC senior technician John Gordon, who carried out the testing at Hole Farm with fellow senior technician Kirsty McLean.

""The 25-minute check is to make sure the level of carbon dioxide is not too high.

""If it is, we follow a protocol that might mean letting a sheep out early,"" he says, adding that research has shown the level of carbon dioxide after 50 minutes is ""way below"" what could be considered dangerous to the animal.

After 50 minutes, the sheep are let out, the chambers are cleaned, and fresh air is run into them ready for the next batch.

Potential for low-methane sheep

At an average of 20g/day a sheep, methane emissions from Rob and Jo's existing flock are minuscule compared with, say, large leaks from oil and gas operations. So is there any point in trying to reduce them?

""I can only do what's in front of me: methane emissions on a farm scale,"" says Rob. ""But even from a purely economic point of view, it's worth taking a punt that in 10 years there will be a market [for low-methane sheep].""

Commitments to achieve net-zero emissions made by Tesco (which he supplies with lamb), the NFU and the government have convinced him he should be looking at this issue now.

""Like it or not, this is coming up,"" he says. ""You can bury your head in the sand or ride the wave and maybe make some money from it.""

Genetic progress in sheep, where a full production cycle takes two years and output averages about 1.6 lambs a year, is slow, he adds. To capitalise on low-methane sheep, work needs to start on breeding them now.

Tesco pays on a cost-of-production basis and with a bonus/kg for completing a carbon audit and maintaining certain welfare standards.

Rob can see the day where the supermarket might develop a high-environment range, paying a bonus for low methane emissions and regenerative farming practices.

Next steps

At Hole Farm, the aim is to use the trial results as a baseline against which further testing can be measured, with a view to starting a breeding programme next year.

DNA profiling offers further potential. ""Our flock shares strong genetic links to New Zealand, where a DNA profile for the New Zealand Romney has already been made,"" explains Rob.

""We also run a very similar grass-based system, so as long as we continue to bring their genetics in, we can tap into their data and directly measure our progress against a country that's been doing methane testing for 10 years.

""In theory, with those 120 methane measurements, we can test other related sheep in the field and predict their methane potential.""

He hopes to access further funding to build on the initial trial work.

At SRUC, the next steps are to collect PAC measurements of methane from other well-recorded sheep flocks in the UK across generations.

These can be used to investigate the genetic control of emissions in UK sheep, and genetic relationships with other important traits.

""This will allow methane measurements to be incorporated into breeding programmes for UK sheep in the most appropriate way,"" says Nicola.

Why test sheep for methane?

There is an urgent need to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions - specifically methane - from ruminant livestock production systems, says Scotland's Rural College (SRUC) sheep geneticist Dr Nicola Lambe.

Globally, sheep release about 700m tonnes of methane into the atmosphere each year, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization's statistics for 2020, she adds.

""Despite resource efficiency and GHG emissions being global priorities, there are few examples of research to implement breeding strategies that directly tackle these issues in sheep,"" she says.

""This is largely because of the difficulty in recording feed consumption and GHG emissions on an individual-animal basis, especially in grass-based systems.""

Portable accumulation chambers (PACs) offer a solution because they can be used:

Farm facts

First-generation farmers Matthew and Dani Blair secured their 10-year agricultural tenancy at Thrimby Farm in Cumbria four years ago, after facing tough competition from 40 applicants.

The couple invested heavily in the 200ha farm near Penrith, re-seeding leys with grass and clover, altering sheds to improve feed efficiency, and fencing large open pastures into manageable field sizes.

Thrimby Farm is now home to 420 head of cattle and 1,000 ewes plus followers.

During the couple's first year on the farm, the BBC series This Farming Life documented their highs and lows of life as new farmers, but also as new parents.

The couple have since gained a steady social media following, helping them promote British agriculture. ""Our aim is to show farming life to the public - the good, the bad and the ugly,"" says Matthew.

Improving efficiencies

As with many farming business, the couple's main challenge was increasing input costs, alongside shrinking BPS payments.

""We aim to be as self-sufficient as possible, growing our own feed: spring barley, red clover, silage and straw. Improved grassland now allows us to finish 90% of our lambs on red clover,"" says Matthew.

Running a flock of Texel, Mule and Swaledale sheep, lambing has been split into to two separate groups in order to achieve good market prices.

""We lamb one group in February to hit the lucrative early lamb market and the second in April so we can lamb outside, which reduces staffing costs and improves hygiene,"" says Dani.

Lambs are sold 50:50 through local auctions and deadweight centres. The pair also breed rams and sell pedigree Shorthorn bulls.

They plan to tap into the growing Halal meat market and sell direct. They have hosted an AHDB halal event and open day for the Muslim community on how UK farmers can better meet the needs of this market.

Keeping a close eye on cashflow, the pair realised their suckler cow enterprise was not stacking up. Unable to outwinter their stock to cut costs further due to the wet Cumbrian winters, they decided to cut the herd from 120 to 40, keeping mostly pedigree Beef Shorthorns.

Instead, they joined the Elite Beef Scheme, contract rearing dairy beef for Morrisons/Woodheads, which helps provide a year round income.

""We aim to finish 400 cattle a year - bought at five to six months and finished at 21 months. This complements our business as it utilises shed space and fits with our grazing rotation,"" says Matthew.

Community engagement

Matthew and Dani's ability to critique their business, grasp new opportunities and engage with the general public is a testament to their farming passion.

The pair have hosted a ""chef school"", welcoming stakeholders throughout the entire supply chain to the farm, an event live-streamed around the world.

They have hosted numerous vet students and YFC clubs, and this year participated in Open Farm Sunday for the first time.

After the collapse of a local agricultural college, the pair stepped in to offer students practical weekly farm visits. Dani is currently undergoing the Cevas accreditation programme to work closely with local schools and offer educational experiences. An on-farm classroom is also under construction.

Matthew and Dani are part of the Mid Tier Stewardship scheme which has seen them plant 3,000m of new hedges, with a further 2,000m to plant this winter.

What the judges say

The Blairs have a huge appetite for work and do not shy away from critiquing their business and taking on new opportunities, all while welcoming people on-farm and encouraging the next generation of farmers.

Farm Facts

Craig and Claire Grant run a complementary mixed farm with 160,000 laying hens, 270 bulling heifers, and a flying sheep flock of 1,500 ewes and lambs.

Their ambition to grow the business at Kindrought, near Fraserburgh in north-east Scotland, has seen them quadruple land to 320ha over the past four years.

The sustainable loop between each enterprise is clear. The 200ha of combinable crops - excluding oilseed rape - is fed to livestock, with nutrient-rich hen and cattle muck returned to the land.

""Cattle muck promotes organic matter levels while hen muck is high in N and has an excellent liming properties,"" says Craig.

Cutting costs

With a drive to cut escalating feed bills, Craig and Claire's pioneering decision to grow a crop of fuego spring beans for poultry diets cut soya usage by 50%.

Beans were grown for £3/percentage point of protein compared with bought soya at £8/percentage point, with further N savings on the preceding winter wheat crop.

All 64,000 free-range and 96,000 enriched colony hens are fed the bean diet. The couple are collaborating with local farmers to grow beans in order to meet demand while also developing a local market for pulses.

Craig and Claire also designed a cost-effective split feeding regime which provides a high-protein soya diet in the morning to rejuvenate birds after laying, and a lower-cost bean diet in the afternoon.

A focus on sourcing healthy birds with optimal skeletal function for quality egg production has seen average hen lifespan increase from 72 to 85 weeks, saving £80,000 on replacement pullet costs.

Meticulous data collection has allowed the Grants to calculate carbon footprint on an egg-specific basis, thought to be a UK first.

The pair's cost-cutting precision also extends to machinery, where the switch to VF flotation tyres cut fuel use by 15% at drilling.

Complementary cattle

The farm's cattle and sheep effectively utilise areas of permanent pasture and straw from rented land. Cattle play a particularly important role grazing free-range hen pasture.

Craig and Claire are rearing 270 beef bulling heifers, bought in at 9-13 months. Heifers are fed a high-selenium diet and home-grown silage to aid reproductive health.

Cattle are selected for temperament, feet and pelvic area - any animals which do not fit are sold as stores.

This attention to detail has resulted in a strong customer base. A new cattle handing system reflects the couple's dedication to improve animal welfare and employee safety.

Purchasing 365 ewes with 584 lambs at foot, and a further 600 store lambs, last year effectively utilised winter grass growth.

The team at Kindrought finished more than 1,000 lambs on its home-grown bean and barley mix. Ewes were then culled or sold on as breeders.

Community

Craig and Claire pride themselves on providing opportunities for the next generation and have built-up a team of 15 dedicated employees that form part of their farming family.

Aiming to connect with the public, they set up the ""Egg Hoosie"", selling eggs at the end of the farm lane. They also joined the Farmer Time initiative and constructed a 2,500m footpath across the farm.

Claire sells eggs at a local market once a month and the pair sponsor a local football team. They supply eggs to a food bank and donate eggs to local nurseries and schools at Easter.

Farm Facts

For Annabel Hamilton and her father Will, succession is all about the long-term future of the family farm in the Scottish Borders; its goals, its visions and the plans to achieve this with fresh ideas.

After studying at university, Annabel did a six-year stint working on two different farms in England, including a farm managerial role where she became Basis and Facts qualified.

Equipped with the skills to manage the family beef and arable farm, she returned home in 2020, when the succession plan began.

""Succession relies heavily on a foundation of respect for each other, good communication and separate responsibilities,"" she says. ""You have to ask the hard questions in order to drive the business forward.""

Quality produce

Bee Edge Farm finishes 300-350 quality Limousin-cross cattle annually and grows 1,100ha of arable which extends across five bespoke contract farming agreements, five rented farms and Bee Edge.

Growing winter wheat, malting and feed barley, oats, oilseed rape and peas for silage, the attention to detail and understanding costs for each enterprise is truly remarkable.

Annabel and Will are focused on providing a safe and happy workplace and creating a team spirit for employees.

Consistently high-quality beef cattle are sold 52 weeks of the year, and have averaged 316p/kg so far in 2023. Store cattle are bought in at 8-12 months old, with heifers sold at 600kg liveweight and bullocks above 700kg.

""Margins rely on the cattle being on the farm for as little time as possible, with good quality home-produced feed based on a ration of grass and pea silage, pot ale, barley and minerals,"" she says.

When taking on new land, Annabel's first priority is pH and drainage, treating each farm individually and having its own rotation. Varieties play a vital role, each selected based on previous performance.

Looking to add value, crops such as Golden Promise spring barley destined for the premium malt export market are grown to increase returns on more marginal land.

Over recent years, the business has initiated a min-till combination seed and fertiliser system which aids crop establishment.

Arable land also benefits from six muck-for-straw deals and manure from the home cattle.

With impressive crop yields, entering the Yield Enhancement Network was a natural next step for Annabel and Will, who over the past couple of years have won awards for their spring barley and spring oats. ""From this process we have discovered the importance of crop micro-nutrition,"" she says.

Community

Bee Edge is also an Agrii iFarm which trials a range of different varieties and seed treatments. The farm also has a straw burner which provides heat for the drying floor as well as the farmhouse.

A circular farm walk, created around the boundary, has been well-received by locals who enjoy the beautiful coastal area in which the family farm.

Annabel is also a director of the Borders Machinery Ring and AgriScot, and is part of a knowledge exchange group for biodiveristy and profitability.

Underperforming areas of land across two farms are now dedicated to agri-environment schemes with grass margins and wild bird seed plots.

Alongside her husband Tom, Annabel also runs a pick-your-own pumpkin patch from which the couple have donated more than £4,200 to a local charity, Radio Borders Cash For Kids.

What the judges say

Annabel and Will run a precise farming operation with a firm handle on production costs, which is reflected in their quality beef cattle and high-performing crops.

The pair have hosted a ""chef school"", welcoming stakeholders throughout the entire supply chain to the farm, an event live-streamed around the world.

They have hosted numerous vet students and YFC clubs, and this year participated in Open Farm Sunday for the first time.

After the collapse of a local agricultural college, the pair stepped in to offer students practical weekly farm visits. Dani is currently undergoing the Cevas accreditation programme to work closely with local schools and offer educational experiences. An on-farm classroom is also under construction.

Matthew and Dani are part of the Mid Tier Stewardship scheme which has seen them plant 3,000m of new hedges, with a further 2,000m to plant this winter.

What the judges say

The Blairs have a huge appetite for work and do not shy away from critiquing their business and taking on new opportunities, all while welcoming people on-farm and encouraging the next generation of farmers.

Farm Facts

Craig and Claire Grant run a complementary mixed farm with 160,000 laying hens, 270 bulling heifers, and a flying sheep flock of 1,500 ewes and lambs.

Their ambition to grow the business at Kindrought, near Fraserburgh in north-east Scotland, has seen them quadruple land to 320ha over the past four years.

The sustainable loop between each enterprise is clear. The 200ha of combinable crops - excluding oilseed rape - is fed to livestock, with nutrient-rich hen and cattle muck returned to the land.

""Cattle muck promotes organic matter levels while hen muck is high in N and has an excellent liming properties,"" says Craig.

Cutting costs

With a drive to cut escalating feed bills, Craig and Claire's pioneering decision to grow a crop of fuego spring beans for poultry diets cut soya usage by 50%.

Beans were grown for £3/percentage point of protein compared with bought soya at £8/percentage point, with further N savings on the preceding winter wheat crop.

All 64,000 free-range and 96,000 enriched colony hens are fed the bean diet. The couple are collaborating with local farmers to grow beans in order to meet demand while also developing a local market for pulses.

Craig and Claire also designed a cost-effective split feeding regime which provides a high-protein soya diet in the morning to rejuvenate birds after laying, and a lower-cost bean diet in the afternoon.

A focus on sourcing healthy birds with optimal skeletal function for quality egg production has seen average hen lifespan increase from 72 to 85 weeks, saving £80,000 on replacement pullet costs.

Meticulous data collection has allowed the Grants to calculate carbon footprint on an egg-specific basis, thought to be a UK first.

The pair's cost-cutting precision also extends to machinery, where the switch to VF flotation tyres cut fuel use by 15% at drilling.

Complementary cattle

The farm's cattle and sheep effectively utilise areas of permanent pasture and straw from rented land. Cattle play a particularly important role grazing free-range hen pasture.

Craig and Claire are rearing 270 beef bulling heifers, bought in at 9-13 months. Heifers are fed a high-selenium diet and home-grown silage to aid reproductive health.

Cattle are selected for temperament, feet and pelvic area - any animals which do not fit are sold as stores.

This attention to detail has resulted in a strong customer base. A new cattle handing system reflects the couple's dedication to improve animal welfare and employee safety.

Purchasing 365 ewes with 584 lambs at foot, and a further 600 store lambs, last year effectively utilised winter grass growth.

The team at Kindrought finished more than 1,000 lambs on its home-grown bean and barley mix. Ewes were then culled or sold on as breeders.

Community

Craig and Claire pride themselves on providing opportunities for the next generation and have built-up a team of 15 dedicated employees that form part of their farming family.

Aiming to connect with the public, they set up the ""Egg Hoosie"", selling eggs at the end of the farm lane. They also joined the Farmer Time initiative and constructed a 2,500m footpath across the farm.

Claire sells eggs at a local market once a month and the pair sponsor a local football team. They supply eggs to a food bank and donate eggs to local nurseries and schools at Easter.

What the judges say

Craig and Claire Grant have developed a pioneering split feeding system for their laying hens and run a complimentary mixed farming business with their beef, sheep and arable enterprises.

Farm Facts

For Annabel Hamilton and her father Will, succession is all about the long-term future of the family farm in the Scottish Borders; its goals, its visions and the plans to achieve this with fresh ideas.

After studying at university, Annabel did a six-year stint working on two different farms in England, including a farm managerial role where she became Basis and Facts qualified.

Equipped with the skills to manage the family beef and arable farm, she returned home in 2020, when the succession plan began.

""Succession relies heavily on a foundation of respect for each other, good communication and separate responsibilities,"" she says. ""You have to ask the hard questions in order to drive the business forward.""

Quality produce

Bee Edge Farm finishes 300-350 quality Limousin-cross cattle annually and grows 1,100ha of arable which extends across five bespoke contract farming agreements, five rented farms and Bee Edge.

Growing winter wheat, malting and feed barley, oats, oilseed rape and peas for silage, the attention to detail and understanding costs for each enterprise is truly remarkable.

Annabel and Will are focused on providing a safe and happy workplace and creating a team spirit for employees.

Consistently high-quality beef cattle are sold 52 weeks of the year, and have averaged 316p/kg so far in 2023. Store cattle are bought in at 8-12 months old, with heifers sold at 600kg liveweight and bullocks above 700kg.

""Margins rely on the cattle being on the farm for as little time as possible, with good quality home-produced feed based on a ration of grass and pea silage, pot ale, barley and minerals,"" she says.

When taking on new land, Annabel's first priority is pH and drainage, treating each farm individually and having its own rotation. Varieties play a vital role, each selected based on previous performance.

Looking to add value, crops such as Golden Promise spring barley destined for the premium malt export market are grown to increase returns on more marginal land.

Over recent years, the business has initiated a min-till combination seed and fertiliser system which aids crop establishment.

Arable land also benefits from six muck-for-straw deals and manure from the home cattle.

With impressive crop yields, entering the Yield Enhancement Network was a natural next step for Annabel and Will, who over the past couple of years have won awards for their spring barley and spring oats. ""From this process we have discovered the importance of crop micro-nutrition,"" she says.

Community

Bee Edge is also an Agrii iFarm which trials a range of different varieties and seed treatments. The farm also has a straw burner which provides heat for the drying floor as well as the farmhouse.

A circular farm walk, created around the boundary, has been well-received by locals who enjoy the beautiful coastal area in which the family farm.

Annabel is also a director of the Borders Machinery Ring and AgriScot, and is part of a knowledge exchange group for biodiveristy and profitability.

Underperforming areas of land across two farms are now dedicated to agri-environment schemes with grass margins and wild bird seed plots.

Alongside her husband Tom, Annabel also runs a pick-your-own pumpkin patch from which the couple have donated more than £4,200 to a local charity, Radio Borders Cash For Kids.

What the judges say

Annabel and Will run a precise farming operation with a firm handle on production costs, which is reflected in their quality beef cattle and high-performing crops.

630,"New scheme aims to protect farmer’s data from misuse","https://www.fwi.co.uk/business/new-scheme-aims-to-protect-farmers-data-from-misuse","New scheme aims to protect farmer’s data from misuse

The British Farm Data Council (BFDC) has been set up to provide a recognised standard of care, security and ownership of farmers' data.

It hopes to launch late this year, by which time it will have several companies signed up to its code of practice.

See also: 15 fresh ideas for making money or cutting costs on farm

These will have gone through a certification process that means they will set out clearly how they will use farmers' data.

The council is independent, not-for-profit and made up of a cross-section of industry people.

Data sharing can help businesses become more efficient and environmentally sustainable.

The council aims to get away from the often one-way traffic of information where farmers are expected to give over their data but get little, if anything, in return.

It aims to enable clear recognition for farms, companies and organisations across the agricultural industry that champion fair and appropriate data rights.

Dr Julian Little, co-ordinator of the BFDC, says: ""A farmer's data belongs to them - we need to build trust in companies who are doing things in a more transparent way.

""What we are trying to achieve through BFDC certification is to remove those inherent doubts so that these data and tools can be used to increase sustainability, both economically and environmentally, for UK farms.""

The biggest concerns revolve around trust and confidentiality, and what constitutes an appropriate standard of data governance, the BFDC says, so most farmers are wary of participation in data initiatives because of the associated and largely unknown risks.

Poor practice

Examples of poor practice in farm data use include automatic opt-ins for data sharing.

""The standard should be that if a farmer is to give permission for data to be used or shared, it should be made clear how that data will be used or shared, and they should have to take an action to agree to this, not for them to have to take an action to opt out of it,"" says Julian.

Participation in the BFDC's scheme by those doing business with farmers and with an interest in their data will be voluntary, under guidelines for good practice.

Following an accreditation process, there will be certification for those signing up to the initiative.

BFDC's terms of reference recognise that farm data governance is important, but that there is also general unease that things are not being done properly.

There are few or no safeguards outside the narrow confines of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) legislation, and no one is sure what ""good"" looks like, says Julian.

Aims

The council aims to accelerate digitisation of the industry and the associated potential benefits in productivity, sustainability and performance.

To start with, it is surveying the current farm data landscape so it can set out what a gold standard might look like.

Its first two years are being funded by farm data intelligence business Yagro, a subsidiary of Frontier Agriculture.

After this initial period, the plan is for certification income from companies signing up to the initiative to cover the running costs of the council and the accreditation process.

What about the long term?

Julian says the BFDC is focused on getting things done and making improvements, rather than achieving long-term lofty aims, although the eventual establishment of a British Standard or International Organization for Standardization accreditation is not being ruled out.  

He suggests that farmers ask those they do business with whether they are going to sign up to the BFDC standard.

""If they say yes, that's great,"" he says. ""If they've never head of us, point them in our direction. If they say no, ask them why not.""

Also, farmers who are asked for agreement to use of their data should read the small print, he says, even though this is often quite a task.

""If things are not clear, ask ""˜how will my data be used?' If they are a bona fide firm, they will help you understand this.""

Sanctions

Where a business signs up to the BFDC standard and is certified, if it is then shown to be failing to stick to that BFDC commitment, it will lose its certification.

Who is on the BFDC?

Council members

Council members serve as individuals, rather than as corporate representatives.

What is the British Farm Data Council

The BFDC is an independent non-profit organisation which provides direction and certification to the British farming industry on the standards and principles for farm data governance.

Its principles are independence, impartiality, transparency, equitability, and to be action-oriented and collaborative across sectors.

It consults with industry groups and bodies such as the NFU, AHDB, CLA, AIC, Red Tractor, Leaf and CropLife UK, and along the food supply chain to retailers, senior policy makers and scientific research bodies.

Its eight board members serve two-year terms.

What's happening in other countries?

Farm data, its use and ownership are hot topics elsewhere too, with several counties and federations developing voluntary safeguards in recent years.

EU

The EU Code of Conduct on Agricultural Data Sharing is voluntary and aims to shed light on contractual relations and provide guidance on the use of farm data.

Checks for farmers include what data is collected, who owns/controls access to it, what it will be used for, including whether it will be shared and whether this is made clear, and whether the farmer can disagree with use of the data.

Australia

The National Farmers Federation (NFF) has developed and adopted the Australian Farm Data Code in consultation with industry and with support from the Australian government.

This aims to promote adoption of digital technology and ensure farmers have comfort in how their data is used, managed, and shared.

Product and service providers that manage data on behalf of farmers and that fully comply with the code are eligible to be certified by the NFF.

United States

Ag Data Transparent2 is a set of guidelines on privacy and security principles for companies collecting, storing, analysing and using farmer's data.

Provided 11 questions are satisfactorily addressed, companies can be certified under the scheme. The questions cover data ownership, use, portability and security.

New Zealand

Organisations that collect, store and share primary production data can commit to the Farm Data Code.

Those observing the code agree to use common terminology to make it easier to share land and animal data securely and with permission.

The aim is to increase the rate at which data can securely move between organisations, to speed up innovation.

Farm data issues? Get in touch

The BFDC would like to hear from farmers about the way their farm data is used, or with questions about its use.

Diesel and electricity are the main energy sources used to pump water through irrigation systems.

It was, therefore, a double whammy when last year's high prices hit potato growers in what was one of the driest summers on record.

It may have led some to think about alternative forms of irrigation, such as trickle (also known as drip), which uses less water and energy than its overhead counterparts. But the choice is not straightforward.

See also: 4 tips for successful potato establishment this spring

Irrigating 472ha of potatoes, onions, parsnips and carrots cost Andrew Blenkiron - who farms south of Thetford in Suffolk - £230,00 in electricity last season, compared with £70,000 the season before (in 2021).

He uses 20 reels: 18 rain gun and two boom irrigators. ""Trickle irrigation is incredibly expensive to put in, and, for potatoes, it doesn't necessarily wet the soil as effectively as overhead,"" he says.

""There is also the labour cost - rolls of pipe to lay every row and wrapping it up when the season has finished, as well as tape disposal costs.

""It is better in terms of water use efficiency, but you need to balance that out. At the moment, for us, it doesn't pay.

""And with retailers not paying what it costs to grow potatoes, currently, it is difficult to justify any new investment.""

Andrew Howseman, managing director at Howseman Agriculture, which installs drip irrigation for potatoes and onions, says this irrigation method has the potential to reduce diesel/electric use by 30%.

But other considerations - such as yield, water use efficiency, crop quality and labour - will come higher up the list when growers are deciding whether to opt for drip irrigation.

""It is possible to achieve the same yield of potatoes with 40% less water,"" says Mr Howseman.

""We used 97mm of water in a drip system, which produced 67t/ha. A rain gun system on a neighbouring farm used 160mm of water, producing 69t/ha,"" he adds.

""In another example, drip tape applied 10% less water compared with a rain gun, and achieved 17% more yield.""

Melvyn Kay, executive secretary at the UK Irrigation Association, believes there are pros and cons with trickle irrigation. ""The implications are that it saves a lot of water, but I'm not sure it does.""

He adds that most farmers who have switched to trickle grow high-quality, premium-grade produce to meet supermarket requirements, rather than to save water.

""Trickle wetting patterns can be difficult to establish in newly formed ridges and beds, because the soil may not be compact enough,"" says Mr Kay.

""So, some farmers use overhead irrigation initially to wet up the soil profile. Trickle irrigation is perceived as an environmentally friendly irrigation method and this has marketing advantages.""

Mr Kay says trickle is an option worth considering for energy saving, but farmers still have to pump the same amount of water as a sprinkler, just at a lower rate and all day rather than a higher rate for an hour or two.

""In-field capital costs for trickle are much higher than for rain guns, but recurrent costs are often much lower, particularly as energy prices rise.

""So, look at both the capital and recurrent costs to get a true picture.""

Case study: David Matthews, G&D Matthews, Lincolnshire

Irrigation contractor and specialist grower, David Matthews, of G&D Matthews in West Pinchbeck, south Lincolnshire, has worked with trickle irrigation for years.

He says it is possible to get the same or better results with half the amount of water used in overhead irrigation.

""If you are only pumping half the amount of water, you are clearly saving energy.

""The first saving is in the amount of water needed, and the second is that the system requires less pressure to work,"" he explains.

""These factors add up to a very significant fuel (diesel) saving, of up to 70%, to deliver the same results or better.""

Where water availability is a limiting factor - for example, if a reservoir is only half full - a boom system would use it all up on half the crop area, compared to trickle irrigation, notes Mr Matthews.

But there are other factors to consider.

""If you go on to trickle, you have to lay it out, whether you are using it or not. With a boom you can set it up, take it down, and leave it in the shed if you're not using it.""

© David Matthews

Mr Matthews used to grow 160ha of maincrop potatoes using trickle irrigation, but has reduced the area latterly.

""If water is not a limiting factor, booms are easier and more cost effective. But if water is a limiting factor, I would move back to more trickle irrigation,"" he says.

His trickle irrigation system uses disposable tape, which is laid approximately 40mm below each ridge after planting.

The silty soils are prone to capping, so this approach means that irrigation can continue under the cap to control soil moisture and prevent scab during tuber initiation.

Irrigation is scheduled using an Enviroscan on 15ha blocks.

""We normally irrigate on a one- to three-day interval and have the capacity to irrigate the entire area in 24 hours, if needed.

“If it rains, we can delay the next irrigation without worrying about keeping up with crop water demand. We also use the system to apply fertiliser and nutrients with the irrigation water.""

""The first saving is in the amount of water needed, and the second is that the system requires less pressure to work,"" he explains.

""These factors add up to a very significant fuel (diesel) saving, of up to 70%, to deliver the same results or better.""

Where water availability is a limiting factor - for example, if a reservoir is only half full - a boom system would use it all up on half the crop area, compared to trickle irrigation, notes Mr Matthews.

But there are other factors to consider.

""If you go on to trickle, you have to lay it out, whether you are using it or not. With a boom you can set it up, take it down, and leave it in the shed if you're not using it.""

Mr Matthews used to grow 160ha of maincrop potatoes using trickle irrigation, but has reduced the area latterly.

""If water is not a limiting factor, booms are easier and more cost effective. But if water is a limiting factor, I would move back to more trickle irrigation,"" he says.

His trickle irrigation system uses disposable tape, which is laid approximately 40mm below each ridge after planting.

The silty soils are prone to capping, so this approach means that irrigation can continue under the cap to control soil moisture and prevent scab during tuber initiation.

Irrigation is scheduled using an Enviroscan on 15ha blocks.

""We normally irrigate on a one- to three-day interval and have the capacity to irrigate the entire area in 24 hours, if needed.

“If it rains, we can delay the next irrigation without worrying about keeping up with crop water demand. We also use the system to apply fertiliser and nutrients with the irrigation water.""

Producing clean electricity is predicted to one day outstrip rural tourism as a secondary income for UK farms.

Interest in investing in renewables or leasing sites to developers is high, from small- and large-scale solar and battery storage to wind turbines and anaerobic digestion (AD) plants.

Hampshire arable farmer Nick Russell was approached by 200 solar developers before he leased land to Conrad Energy as a battery storage site.

At a recent Farmers Weekly event on his farm near Winchester, Hampshire, experts offered advice on what to consider and some pitfalls to avoid.

Tax

Land used for a farming trade benefits from important tax reliefs, but these can be lost without the right business structure or when the size of a renewables project dwarfs farming activities.

If the landowner receives the income personally, it could be subject to additional rates of income tax and, at high levels, restrict their tax-free personal allowance, warned tax adviser and accountant Kate Hardy, of Albert Goodman.

How the business is structured is key to getting the best tax position. A sole trader or those in a family partnership will be taxed on the income personally, whereas in a company structure the income will be taxed on the company, potentially at a lower rate.

The figures involved can be substantial. In simple terms, a 35-year solar project earning £100,000/year would generate income of £3.5m, said Kate.

""If taxed on you personally and assuming you already receive £30,000/ year, at 2023-24 rates and allowances the additional tax liability would be £1.443m,” she calculated.

In a company structure, this reduces to £796,000, equating to a tax saving of £647,000.

To establish the project within a company, Kate advised that the project land is sold to the company - in most circumstances at the open market value (OMV).

Capital gains tax (CGT) would be payable on the net gain, but the proceeds in the company could be drawn down tax-free.

Alternatively, if it is gifted to the company this is still a disposal at OMV, but if the land qualifies for agricultural property relief (APR) from inheritance tax (IHT), holdover relief can be claimed and there is no immediate CGT charge.

""This does then mean funds aren't available to draw down in the company, so a mix of the two options is normally preferable,” Kate suggested.

Care should be taken to ensure stamp duty land tax implications have been considered and reliefs are available.

""You also need to ensure the transfer doesn't result in an immediate charge to inheritance tax under the chargeable lifetime transfer rules - hence the need to include professionals from the start,'' said Kate.

A solar farm or battery storage site is not classed as being occupied for the purposes of agriculture, so APR would be denied.

This can result in a significant tax liability. Without APR, land that doubles in value to £20,000/acre as a result of development will have a potential IHT liability of £8,000/acre.

If it fails to qualify for APR, it then can't be gifted tax-free, so there would also be a CGT liability of £4,000/acre.

""With income of £1,000/acre, it could take 13.5 years of net income to pay the IHT,'' Kate explained.

Business property relief (BPR) does not apply if the business consists wholly or mainly in dealing with land or holding investments and, as the lease of a solar farm or battery storage site is treated as ""holding an investment"", BPR would also be denied.

However, if it can be established that the business is mainly trading, in principle there is no reason why its full value should not qualify for BPR, said Kate.

She advised landowners considering a renewables project to obtain advice from the outset to help mitigate the tax and safeguard their IHT position.

Legal

Projects are mostly done in three stages, starting with negotiations and heads of terms, followed by agreeing the contract and ending with completion, usually culminating in a lease being granted.

Mark Charter of law firm Thrings said it was vital to get the right advice when negotiating heads of terms.

""Landowners sometimes sign heads of terms without advice simply to crack on with the project, but if they get the commercial terms wrong at that stage, those mistakes can be magnified over 30-40 years, across the lifetime of the lease.”

When it comes to exclusivity agreements, with the landowner agreeing not to talk to other developers for a set period, Mark recommended this should be no longer than three months.

""If you break the exclusivity obligations, you may well have to pay the solar operator's costs and they can be significant,” he said.

At the contract stage, the landowner should request a clause indemnifying them against loss if the operator causes damage when accessing the site for surveys and other work that can't be made good.

As there can be a three-year gap between a contract being signed and the site becoming operational, to protect future revenue Mark advised that minimum rent requirements should be specified to avoid the landowner being forced to trade at below market rents.

A clause requiring a ""turnover"" rent is also recommended to account for advances in technology, which will earn the developer more income - Mark said he was typically seeing 4-6% turnover rents. 

This means that when, for example, 6% of the developer's revenue from the installation exceeds the acreage-based rent, the landowner is paid a top-up between the two figures.

The contract should also include a clause specifying a minimum acreage acceptable to the landowner for the project.

""If the operator gets planning on only a small acreage, the disruption to the farm might make the project not worth it for the landowner,” said Mark.

Landowners should also reserve the right to exploit future natural capital benefits from the site.

A remediation fund, also known as a ""sinking"" fund, built up by the developer and which the landowner can resort to, is essential to cover the cost of restoring the land to its pre-development position, as the costs associated with this can be significant.

""It gives the landowner comfort if the developer fails to carry out remediation or goes out of business,'' said Mark.

Such funds are usually built up over the 10-15 years before the lease expires.

Grid connection

A major constraint to renewable energy development is grid capacity - if a connection can't be established, the project is a non-starter.

George Hall leads on ""front of the meter"" renewable development for Conrad Energy and is optimistic that this is changing.

He reckoned that the first quarter of 2024 would see an increase in the number of operators securing connections.

Distance between the site and an electricity sub-station is a factor when developers consider sites.

George said up to two miles was considered workable, but it depended on what sits between the site and the sub-station, with fields being more favourable than a highway. 

For battery storage sites, import and export connections are needed. Rental values for battery sites broadly range from £1,750-£2,000/MW, or £15,000-£25,000/acre, depending on access, layout, screening and planting.

When choosing a developer to work with, George said it was important that it had a good track record, was well financed and experienced in multiple technologies.

Farm energy consumption

Understanding a farm's electricity consumption profile is a good first step to working out the value to a business of small-scale renewable energy investments.

Tim Foster, head of energy services at Conrad Energy, recommended an electricity use logger as a relatively cheap device to deploy around the farm.

This will take a reading every half hour, building up a picture of how energy is being consumed and pinpointing whether equipment such as compressors, fans and pumps are running when they don't need to be.

There was scope to negotiate tariffs with the farm's energy supplier, he said.

""Most customers have a general block tariff, but if you have a quirky load, see if something can be put in place to better manage that.

""Ask your energy supplier to look at historical energy consumption - that data is not difficult to get hold of and they will be able to give some recommendations on how you can change your pricing structure to better meet your needs.”

Case study: Down Farm, Hursley, Hampshire

Nick Russell, host farmer for the event, opted for battery storage over solar because of its smaller land requirement.

His warning to landowners contemplating energy projects is to ""be careful who you get into bed with''.

The agreement with the developer he initially signed up with didn't work out and, in October 2021, that project was bought by Conrad Energy.

Nick said he was pleased with how the project had subsequently progressed, with very little interruption to day-to-day farming and the company delivering what it said it would.

Getting good advice at the start is important. ""Before you sign anything, you need to know what you are agreeing to.

“The developer often pays for the advice, so it is worth getting an experienced, top-quality solicitor or land agent involved.''

Ensure the developer selected has sufficient funds to carry the project through. ""There are some that can't go through with what they have promised,'' said Nick.

Preserving the right to the grid connection is also vital. ""You need to own the connection or have an agreement in place stating that if it all goes wrong, you get it back - the connection is what is worth the money.''

Planning can be a hurdle. ""No one can see our site, but it still had lots of objections,'' said Nick.

Increased slurry exposure at winter housing always comes with raised risk of digital dermatitis (DD), so now is an ideal time to plan ahead and think of preventative strategies.

Will Gratwick, vet for Lambert Leonard and May, and Tim Carter, chairman of the Cattle Hoof Care Standards Board, provided their tips to Farmers Weekly following UK Dairy Day.

Bedding conditioner cuts digital dermatitis

Using a once-weekly bedding conditioner on cubicles could reduce disease challenge and digital dermatitis (DD) in dairy cows, according to farm research highlighted at UK Dairy Day.

A French trial used the bedding conditioner Cobiotex in a 120-cow herd for one year and found DD cases dropped by 35% and severity by 77%.

The product is a multi-strain bacterial additive which forms protective biofilms across animal bedding and cubicle surfaces.

The biofilms work by outcompeting pathogenic bacteria, such as those linked to DD, claims UK distributor EnviroSystems.

The product is said to keep bedding drier, reducing bedding requirements. Weekly application also brings labour savings.

Dairy herds with sub-optimal fertility, unexplained abortions or weak calves are being advised to test for Q fever.

Dubbed the ""subtle disease"", it is now thought to be behind underlying fertility problems in many herds.

Furthermore, because it is zoonotic, it was designated a reportable disease - not a notifiable one - in 2021, which makes it a challenge for anyone working in an infected herd.

See also: Sheep vaccines: 5 steps to using them effectively

It is creating problems without being obvious, according to Ceva Animal Health vet Renzo Di Florio.

""You won't see an abortion storm in cows, but unexplained abortion at any stage of pregnancy, pregnancy loss, weak or premature calves, metritis, retained placenta,"" he says.

""Heifers, on the other hand, are naive and are likely to struggle when they join the herd and become infected. One case in Scotland, where heifers were reared off farm until calving, reported an abortion storm.""

In 257 tests, to September 2023, Ceva discovered 50% of sampled herds were positive for Q fever.

An AHDB-funded study of infectious diseases in 2017 found antibodies for the disease in 79.8% of bulk milk samples, so vets think it has been circulating for many years, says Renzo.

""In France, Q fever is the second cause of abortion, at 10.2%, compared with neospora at 17.4% and BVD [bovine viral diarrhoea] at 6.7%. And 80% of [French] vets have antibodies, which means it is a risk to farmers, vets, technicians and staff.""  

Q fever 

In one 2012 study, cattle with Q fever were two-and-a-half times more likely to abort.

In UK herds with evidence of bacterial infection, cows are one-and-a-half times more likely to have retained foetal membranes (RFM) after exposure and two-and-a-half times more likely to have a high incidence of metritis and clinical endometritis.

Warning signs

""Triggers to investigate are more RFM, pyometra, increased abortions, stillbirths and weak calves.

Q fever should be part of an infectious diseases health plan and any abortion sample investigation, whether it is cattle, sheep or goat.

The challenge is that losses such as stillbirths and reabsorptions are not properly recorded,"" he says.

The bacterium is found in foetal membranes and fluids, placenta and aborted foetuses, so it is very important for zoonosis.

""Cows can shed  [the bacteria] through lactation via the vagina mucus, milk and faeces, and apparently healthy-looking animals can shed and also be sero-negative,"" he adds.

""A cow shedding at calving can release up to 10bn bacteria. But it is poorly understood why some cows shed and others don't. We need to understand the disease and look for it.""

Infection routes

The main route of infection in both animals and humans is through inhaling contaminated air particles.

There is a low risk of transmission via milk, while infection is also possible through a vector (ticks) and the venereal route in livestock.

The dose to infect a human is fewer than 10 bacteria, and 40% of people get an acute infection with flu-like symptoms.

About 4% ended up being hospitalised with lung disease, hepatitis, or meningitis; chronic fatigue syndrome can follow.

Control

Once confirmed in a herd, control centres on vaccination, hygiene at calving and biosecurity, says Renzo.

""[Maintain] spotless calving pens. Anyone working with the cows should use protective gloves, sleeves and a face mask. Pick up loose materials in the parlour before pressure washing and opt for a low-pressure washing system to reduce the spread of particles.""

He adds that muck from infected farms should not be spread when it is windy: the bacterium can fly 11 miles on a windy day.

And all placenta and aborted foetuses must be collected, stored and destroyed.

Vaccination will protect non-infected cows and heifers by increasing their immunity - only treating heifers takes longer to clear the herd of infection. However, Renzo says that the effects might not be seen for 3-5 years.

A Spanish study showed vaccination gave an improvement in first service with a conception rate of 41.9%, compared with 30.1% in unvaccinated cows.

The number of days open was also lower in protected stock, at 92, whereas unprotected cows had 106 days open, he adds.

Renzo Di Florio was speaking at the Total Dairy conference (6-7 November, Stratford-upon-Avon)

Snails may not be a regular choice in British and Irish diets, but in mainland Europe they remain popular as an everyday staple and delicacy.

Yet, in Ireland, snail farming (also known as heliciculture) has seen increased interest from landowners in the past decade, as rising temperatures in European growing areas make snail production more challenging.

See also: Wildflower seed diversification gives arable tenants security

Suckler producer and snail farmer Peter Monaghan, of Maghera, County Cavan, wanted to farm from a young age.

But with only 10ha (25 acres) of land, he knew he needed something that would not take up much room and suit Ireland's temperate climate.

While working in the transport industry for 15 years, Peter also ran a 25-head suckler herd of Limousin and Belgian Blue cows, producing top-quality weanlings.

He knew beef production would not sustain him full-time, so he set about researching diversification options.

Peter Monaghan © Inis Escargots

After much fact-finding, he found that snail farming could work in Maghera's mild and wet conditions, did not require much land and could be run single-handedly. ""It ticked all the boxes,"" he says.

It was also a relatively low-cost system to establish, especially when the infrastructure could be erected in-house, with initial set-up costs of a half-acre site in the region of £10,000 - including the first crop of snails.

Getting started

In 2017, Peter set up Inis Escargot with his first batch of juvenile Irish snails. He opted for the species Helix Aspersa Muller, one of the most popular eating snails in Europe.

He now rears, fattens, finishes and exports more than three million snails a year, with building work currently under way for a processing plant on the farm.

""The more I researched, the more I realised snail farming was the right option for me,"" he says. ""However, I came across so many different methods of snail farming, I had to choose something right for me and my farm.""

The two main types of snail farming adopted in Ireland are the semi-intensive method, which provides a controlled environment for breeding and rearing, and the more extensive method, which has fewer inputs and works with the natural cycle of the snails.

Peter opted for the semi-intensive route to help guarantee output from his farm.

The operation is run separately from the beef cattle, with 0.8ha (two acres) of land set aside for snail production.

Snail setup

Regardless of operation type, it is vital to have secure, pest-free pens positioned on the correct ground.

Pens should be sited on well-drained land with a pH of 6.5-7.5.

Once fields are selected, electric mesh perimeter fencing is erected to ensure pests (rats and mice) stay out, with netting to cover the pens for bird control. This should consist of galvanised mesh along with corrugated sheeting.

The ground must also be prepared so the pens are ridged in the centre to aid drainage. In both situations, separate pens are used for breeding and fattening snails.

About 700 raised wooden boards measuring 1.2×0.6m, angled off the ground and spread across the pen, provide shelter from the sun, and snails are fed on top.

Crops are planted in the pens to provide cover and food for the snails. Peter uses forage rape for cover.

""Laying paddocks out correctly and planting a strong crop is critical. Snails don't like weeds, so if you have a strong forage rape crop, this will help suppress weeds.

""However, this year, we struggled due to the weather, so we had to go in and manually pull the weeds out, as you can't go in with the mower. Managing paddocks is key,"" he says.

Stocking rates and yields

In semi-intensive systems, the typical production cycle consists of breeding between January and March, which Peter now does in a specialised 93sq m breeding room.

Juvenile snails are reared in a polytunnel, and sprinklers are turned on between 8-9pm daily to keep conditions moist.

They are housed under cover until frosts have passed in May before being let out.

Snails are stocked at a rate of 200-300/sq m, something he says is key to a successful site. ""If you overpopulate a paddock, it will stunt growth.""

They are fed a special high-protein, high-calcium meal each day, starting at about 5kg a night for the group at juvenile level, to 100kg of feed at semi-fattening stage.

To feed his 1-1.2 million snails at peak in August, Peter is using about 150kg of feed a day. 

Snails are usually ready to harvest by September/October when their shells are completely hard. At this stage, they will weigh 10-12g; any snails bigger than this are kept for breeding.

In his first year, Peter produced more than 4t of snails off the farm. He is now averaging 8-10t a year.

""For farmers setting out, it's important to be realistic about how much you can produce off the farm in the first year,"" he says.

With limited land available, Peter Monaghan settled on snails as a compact, efficient diversification © Inis Escargot

Breeding snails

In his second year, he decided to breed his own snails and set up a temperature- and humidity-controlled breeding room, but admits it was initially a disaster.

""After more research, I fine-tuned the breeding and changed the lighting and heating. After that, it started to go quite well.""

In his third year, Peter kept back 50% of his own snails for breeding. He achieved a lower mortality rate compared with bought-in stock, so now he breeds all his own.

Snails are hermaphrodites (with both male and female reproductive organs) and breed by mating with another snail before they lay eggs. They usually start mating when they are 5-6 months old.

""Breeding snails is labour-intensive as you have to pick eggs daily from January to March and wash the room out every three days to get the results,"" Peter says.

""Every minute you put in with the snails, you get back with your return. That's not something you get with the cattle.

""You also know the price you are going to receive from your sales in advance,"" he says.

Peter now sells breeding stock to other snail farmers, by keeping back 900kg of his best snails for replacement breeding, which are picked in early September.

He also provides training and advice on system setup for individuals interested in diversifying into snails.

Marketing produce

Marketing of the end product is also key. Peter sends most of his snails to mainland Europe but is also selling a small proportion into high-end restaurants in the UK and Ireland.

He was recently granted planning permission to build an on-site processing plant, which will enable him to produce a range of products including beauty creams using the mucin (slime) produced by snails.

Recent research has found that snail mucin could potentially help protect against melanoma (skin cancer), so it is a product he believes will increase in popularity as more is learnt about it.

""Snail farming is a profitable enterprise if you have the right conditions and route to market.

""It's a way of life, but it is allowing me to see the kids every day, and there's no comparison in profitability compared with beef production.""

With the latest iteration of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) due to open for applicants on Monday (18 September), a growing number of farmers in England will be asking themselves ""is it time to take the plunge?""

The window to register expressions of interest in the SFI actually opened at the end of August, with would-be claimants invited to sign up via the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) portal.

See also: NFU urges Defra to ""˜do the right thing' and halt BPS cuts

Those that have done so will have been asked a number of basic questions - about the land they manage, the ""actions"" they might be interested in, mapping updates, etc - as a prelude to joining the scheme.

In reality, however, Defra's ""controlled rollout"" approach means that, for the next few weeks at least, the numbers of farmers who can apply will be seriously limited.

According to a recent Defra Funding for Farmers webinar, the RPA will start by inviting ""just a small number of people"" to begin the application process from 18 September, ""to tell us where it is not working and where we can make it better"".

Once any issues are sorted, the RPA will invite a larger pool of people to join in and check for glitches.

""Then, when we get to a position where we're confident everything is working, we'll open it up for everybody to take part,"" says a Defra spokesman. ""This might be a few weeks, it might be a bit longer.""

Financial hole

One consequence of these delays is that, for many farmers, land will have already been planted, limiting the SFI options immediately available.

The greater concern, however, is that many English farmers will not now receive any SFI payments until well into 2024 - leaving a big financial hole where once they would have received a full BPS payment.

The NFU is so dismayed, it has demanded Defra call a halt to any further cuts in BPS - which are due to fall by £720m in England this year alone - until all SFI delivery problems are resolved.

""The SFI should have been up and running to deliver payments by December, but critical delays in the roll-out mean that most farmers are unable to access it,"" says the union.

""With farm input costs through the roof and interest rates soaring, this leaves farmers in a perilous place.""

The Tenant Farmers Association (TFA) is equally angry and its representatives recently met Defra farming minster Mark Spencer to demand swifter access to the SFI, or ""other measures"" to help farmers weather the cashflow crisis - namely a freeze on further BPS cuts.  

“Farm businesses are already being hit by significant inflation and a downturn in market returns,” says TFA chief executive George Dunn. “The lack of progress in the delivery of SFI means business planning has become virtually impossible.”

Flexibility

While the stuttering start to SFI is disheartening, south-west based Kelly Farm Consulting is adamant that everyone should still be looking at the options, citing a number of positives about the new support scheme.

Top of the list is the flexibility it offers compared with previous schemes.

""The application window will be open all year around, so there is less pressure to apply within a deadline, and time to ensure the chosen actions are best suited to the individual farm's system,"" says Kelly Farm Consulting agricultural consultant Laura Cureton.

The fact that the new SFI is a three-year rather than a five-year scheme also improves its flexibility compared with Countryside Stewardship (CS).

""There is also the opportunity to amend and/or add to SFI agreements at the end of each year, which is especially useful as new actions are added going forwards,"" Mrs Cureton adds.

For example, it is understood that there will be an agroforestry option in 2024 and an on-farm woodlands option in 2025.

With 23 SFI actions to choose from in 2023, there is no mandatory combination required, and there is freedom to decide how to deliver them within a 12-month period, ""as long as you do it in a way that can reasonably be expected to achieve the action's aim"".

""Many of the SFI options can be stacked on existing stewardship schemes, although farms will not be paid for delivering the same thing twice,"" says Mrs Cureton .

""For example, you cannot be paid for a herbal ley (SAM3) in SFI on the same land parcel as delivering legume and herb-rich swards (GS4) in Countryside Stewardship.""

Regular payments

Despite the ongoing delays, once up and running, the scheme will improve cashflow compared with historic agri-environment schemes, as payments will be made quarterly.

""It is anticipated that the first payment will be received in the fourth month following the agreement start date,"" says Mrs Cureton .

""This will be automatic and there will be no need to ""˜claim' each quarterly payment, though there will be a requirement to submit an annual declaration.""

How does SFI stack up financially?

Every farm business will be different, but model farm calculations by Kelly Farm Consulting suggest that, initially, the SFI may well make good the BPS payments lost so far.

Charlie Davies © Kelly Farm Consulting

But they do not begin to match its original value and will be totally insufficient by the time BPS is removed altogether in 2027.

For example, a 250ha dairy farm with some arable land and plenty of hedgerows is shown to achieve an annual income from 11 different SFI actions, plus a management payment and animal health and welfare review, of £29,941 (see Table 1).

While this is similar to the BPS lost so far, it is well short of the £58,305 the BPS was worth prior to the cuts starting in 2021.

Similarly, a 200ha arable unit, with existing Countryside Stewardship options and 10km of hedges, could achieve an SFI income of £21,515.

This compares with a BPS cut of over £24,000 so far, but does not come close to the £46,660 the BPS was worth in 2020 (see Table 2).

""Our concern is that, as BPS continues to decline to zero in 2027, these SFI revenues will become insufficient,"" says Kelly Farm Consulting's Charlie Davies.

""Furthermore, there will be costs involved with delivering SFI actions, such as soil tests, seed and establishment costs, or paying for Basis or Facts advisers, which will eat into margins.

""So the SFI is not expected to replace the lost BPS on its own, and farmers would be well advised to tap into some of the other areas where BPS money is going, such as the new grants for farm improvements, including slurry infrastructure and calf housing for health and welfare.""

Should I put the whole farm into flowers or bird food?

Some of the highest payment rates under SFI are for encouraging wildlife on arable land - with £614/ha available for sowing a pollen and nectar flower mix and £732/ha for providing winter bird food.

With no restriction on the area of land that can be allocated to these options, some farmers are considering adopting them big time.

But Laura Cureton of Kelly Farm Consulting is convinced that, even with fairly low establishment and maintenance costs, the margins do not usually match those available from growing winter wheat or barley.

Calculations show that a pollen mix might deliver a gross margin of £445/ha after the cost of seed and fertiliser, while a bird food mix, grown for two years, could achieve a gross margin of £613/ha.

But even at an average yield of 9.2t/ha and a price of £180/t, Mrs Cureton estimates that winter wheat should achieve a gross margin (after seed, fertilisers and sprays) of £1,097/ha, while barley at 7.5t/ha and £160/t would deliver £750/t.

""Considerations should be given to other factors, not just the gross margins,"" she says.

For example, larger areas of pollen mix may fit well with an integrated pest management approach, or it may work well for someone looking to reduce their workload or contain market volatility.

Overhead costs and yield expectations should also be taken into account.

Defra is set to publish the final versions of six new standards added to the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI), which will be available for farmers in England to apply for later this summer.

Detailed information on the six new SFI 2023 standards will be released in mid-June, with an official announcement possibly timed for the Cereals event at Thoresby Estate in Nottinghamshire (13-14 June).

Rules on how farmers and land managers will be able to combine different options within the SFI and with Countryside Stewardship (CS), the transition from the 2022 to 2023 SFI scheme, and how the management payment will work, will also be revealed.

See also: Defra adds six new standards to SFI scheme for 2023

""Everybody will have all the information they need to be able to choose between CS and the SFI and work out what they're going to do,"" said a Defra source. ""It's a big manual with everything in it, and that's coming shortly.""

The six new SFI standards, which include payments for actions on hedgerows, pest management and nutrient management, will open for applications later this summer, but before September - quashing industry rumours that the launch of the scheme would be delayed until the autumn.

Defra will launch the new standards with a controlled rollout to ensure the online application process is working correctly, followed by a rolling window that will allow farmers to apply at a time that suits them.

Confidence is high within Defra that the IT system used by the Rural Payments Agency to process applications will work effectively. For example, some SFI 2022 scheme applications are now being processed in less than two weeks.

The additional six standards, added to the existing three 2022 SFI standards that are mainly based on improving soil health, will provide a ""much broader offer"" to enable farmers to build resilience into their farming systems and benefit the environment, added the source.

In September, Defra will announce its plans for CS and the SFI in 2024.

70% target

To help the UK government reach its environmental goals, Defra has set a target of enrolling at least 70% of eligible farmers in England to its Environmental Land Management programme by 2028, of which the SFI is the first component.

David Exwood, vice-president of the NFU, said: ""We look forward to the scheme detail of the SFI 2023 offer being announced in the next week or two.

""There are many more standards and significant amounts of money available under the new offer. We want farmers to look at the detail when it's announced, study it and understand what it might mean for their businesses.

""If they think there is something for it, then plan how you might work that into your cropping for next year and apply when the application window opens.""

I didn't know much about attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) until recently.

After having been diagnosed as a severe case, I suddenly find myself learning a lot about it, and realising for the first time why I behave the way that I do.

I have mixed feelings about it, to be honest. On the one hand, I'm disconcerted and a little sad that it took me 44 years of wondering ""what the hell is wrong with me?"" to find out.

See also: Alex Dunn: Dyslexic farmers can succeed in a world of words

About the author

On the other, it's a huge relief to realise that, actually, there isn't anything ""wrong"" with me after all. I'm just, well, different.

There's a long list of symptoms, and I have all of them. One of the main ones is that I badly struggle to take in information via conventional methods because I just can't focus for long enough.

I'm naturally quite careless and have a lack of attention to detail, poor organisational skills, don't deal with stress well, have a high degree of social anxiety, never sleep very well, and I'm permanently restless and fidgeting with things.

If you didn't realise before that the present Mrs Evans qualifies for sainthood, then you know now.

Learning curve

Of course, I've worked out coping mechanisms for all of this over time, and I mostly get by just fine. But I do wonder how different things would have been if I'd known about it early in life.

For a start, I could've told all those teachers who repeatedly called me stupid, which resulted in me spending my school days feeling misplaced and resentful and taking the very first opportunity to leave.

I think it would also have been far easier for my family and friends, who must have got terribly frustrated with me over the years.

Strangely, one of the worst aspects is that ADHD gives me extreme levels of empathy for others, and a strong caring instinct.

That obviously sounds like a good thing, and it can be, but it means that I desperately want the people around me to be happy at all times and take it hugely to heart if they aren't.

I also tend to get very badly affected by sad stories in the news, and they can play on my mind for weeks.

Chronically low levels of self-esteem are another classic symptom. Alongside dwelling almost pathologically on personal failures rather than successes, it has undoubtedly been a major contributor to my bouts of depression.

Thankfully, there are positive traits too, especially for a farmer. I'm a good problem solver, have strong instincts, and think outside the box. I'm loyal, have high levels of creativity and energy, and a propensity for a good sense of humour (handy for this page!).

Family values

A friend of mine has a theory about the farming community having far higher percentages of people with conditions such as ADHD, dyslexia and autism than the rest of society.

He reckons that, over hundreds of years, the children with these conditions - which were obviously not known by those names at the time - stayed at home on the farm, while their seemingly brighter siblings went off to do ""better jobs"" in towns and cities.

I suppose that's a PhD study waiting for someone far cleverer than me. But my cursory Google searches do suggest that others have had similar thoughts.

I even found one stat claiming that farmers are four times more likely to have these disorders than the general population. It kind of makes sense, when you think about it.

672,"How to reduce mastitis ahead of spring calving","https://www.fwi.co.uk/livestock/dairy/how-to-reduce-mastitis-ahead-of-spring-calving","How to reduce mastitis ahead of spring calving

In spring-calving herds, environmental pressures of housing can create a greater risk of mastitis, with cows very susceptible to new infections a few weeks before they calve.

Losses from mastitis can cost about £400/case. As well as being a financial drain, it is a cow welfare issue, which is often underestimated.

More than 90% of cases are predominantly environmental pathogen infections.

So, it is well worth focusing on dry period management ahead of calving and reviewing practices to see where improvements can be made to reduce these.

See also: How to dry off cows to treat mastitis successfully

Analysing mastitis patterns for the previous season is a key starting point, says James Breen, a vet and associate professor in cattle health and reproduction at Nottingham University.

""The [most important] thing you can do for mastitis control is to calve down an uninfected cow. It is always more difficult to cure an infection when cows are milking.""

Most infected cows will cure with antibiotic dry-cow therapy, he adds. ""With mastitis, you can wipe the slate clean during the dry-cow period."" He explains what data points to analyse.

1. When and what infections are occurring?

As a starting point, it is critical to establish when mastitis cases are happening on your farm - during lactation or during the dry period.

To understand this, you need cell count data from individual cows at least every six weeks (every month is best).

All cows in-milk should be present at milk recording, including those under treatment or with clinical mastitis.

Some block-calving herds may wait a few months until all cows have calved, but this leaves gaps in data.

If cows and heifers are grouped separately, review the data separately to help target management practices. Heifers are a good sentinel for infection because they generally do not receive dry-cow therapy.

2. What pathogens are causing mastitis outbreaks?

There are two types of pathogens:

Bacteriology can help point to the right treatment plan, but is not very useful when trying to identify trends to prevent mastitis.

Always sample clinical cases - this tells you the pathogen profile cows are exposed to - but testing cows with high cell counts can be misleading.

""If you milk-sample high-cell-count cows that don't have clinical signs, the recovery rate for pathogens is poorer. What you need to do is understand the infection pattern,"" explains Dr Breen.

3. Record clinical cases

Record cows with clots/bits in their milk, irrespective of whether you treat that animal or not. Ideally, score cows according to the following grades:

If you milk-record with NMR, CIS or QMMS, you can fill out a form to request a summary of your mastitis patterns.

James Breen was speaking at a recent AHDB event at The Farm, Longnor, Shropshire

Infection targets

Case study: Tim and Louise Downes, The Farm, Longnor, Shropshire

Producing antibiotic-free milk means mastitis prevention is key for the Downeses.

They place great focus on cleanliness at drying-off and milk-record monthly so they can monitor infection and look for patterns in mastitis prevalence.

Cows are dried off 60 days before calving using surgical spirit, cotton wool and teat sealant only.

Heifers have also been given internal teat sealant for some time because Mr Downes says mastitis infection in heifers had become their Achilles’ heel.

Treatment

At the first sign of clinical mastitis, they will use udder mint, homeopathic remedies and fluids. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are also used strategically.

""We assess if it has got worse or if we had one a week ago that should have had Metacam [NSAID],"" explains Mr Downes.

He adds: ""If any have clots or problems, we will wait until they are better before we dry them off. We wouldn't dry off a cow that has clinical signs.""

Data

At The Farm, Longnor, the new infection rate during lactation (more than 30 days in milk (DIM) and above 200,000 cells/ml) was 4% in 2020, but this climbed to 7% in 2021 and 11% in 2023.

Another issue that milk recording data flagged up was that 20% of heifers, and one-third of cows that dried off with a low cell count at the end of 2021, calved in with a high cell count in 2022 (less than 30 DIM).

This infection will have originated in the dry period because these animals had cell counts above 200,000 cells/ml at their first milk recording, says James Breen, vet and associate professor in cattle health and reproduction at Nottingham University.

Farm facts

Peaks and troughs of infection during lactation will also be environmental, Dr Breen explains: ""If you had a truly contagious and transmissive infection between cows, the new infection rate will always be high.""

The Downeses believe overcrowding in the dry cow shed on the back of a TB outbreak caused a larger proportion of cows to have high cell counts.

Higher infection in heifers was probably because not all of them received teat sealant. This was because later calvers had not bagged up enough for the sealant to be administered.

Improvements

Dr Breen assessed the data, and suggested ways in which the Downeses could make improvements:

""If you don't use antibiotics at drying off, you must be even better at prevention, because you have a limited opportunity to cure cows,"" he says.

New resistance genes for clubroot and phoma will offer growers better varietal control of these two costly diseases in oilseed rape crops.

Both are welcome additions as existing genes have become less effective in recent years, with increasing reports of disease overcoming the plant's defences.

See also: How technology lets crops turn pollution into fertiliser

For clubroot, all the specialist varieties rely on the same gene and the disease is being seen in some of these.

And with phoma, there are suggestions that there is too much reliance on the RML7 gene, which has become less effective.

Here, Farmers Weekly looks at how OSR growers will benefit from the two new genes as varieties enter UK National List trials.  

Clubroot

A new clubroot resistance gene offers farmers greater varietal control of the disease, which is becoming a more widespread problem in the UK.

Changing weather patterns, tight rotations and the increasing popularity of cover crops are all thought to be behind the increasing incidence of clubroot (see panel).

The disease is even being seen in known resistant varieties, overcoming varietal resistance. This leaves growers with limited options, as all the current varieties rely on the same Mendel gene.

Club root © Aleksa/Adobe Stock

That is until now, as DSV is set to introduce a new gene called CRE1, which stands for Clubroot Resistance Enhanced 1.

Alex Doering, the company's UK managing director, explains that it is a novel trait that was introduced by crossing with the distant relative Brassica rapa.

However, as with the current resistance gene, it is only partial with resistance to specific races, so it doesn't protect against all races in the soil.

Six races have been identified, of which P1, P2 and P3 are the most important.

In the UK, the Mendel gene offers resistance in more than 80% of cases, says Dr Doering.

In the fields where it doesn't work, investigations often reveal a history of turnip growing that has led to a change in the races present.

The good news is that the new gene is resistant to more strains, and infection experiments in the greenhouse with various isolates demonstrate enhanced resistance over the existing Mendel gene.

He believes this takes it up to resistance in 90% of cases.

An integrated approach

Even with enhanced resistance, the advice for growers will remain unchanged - they should not rely solely on varietal resistance and other measures should also be deployed.

That's because growing these varieties will select for races that overcome resistance.

The measures include:

The first variety, is expected to be registered in the EU this coming winter and is for UK National List application in 2023 at the earliest.

Why is clubroot getting worse?

Clubroot is such a difficult disease to manage because its spores can rest in soil for many years.

In the presence of susceptible plant roots, these resting spores germinate and infect the root hairs, causing the characteristic distortion.

Alex Doering says spores have a half life of 3.6 years. Combined with its unbelievably high replication rate, even after 30 years, you can still have infection.

Within one generation, which takes less than six weeks in optimal conditions, the spores can multiply 100,000-fold.

These spores are exceptionally hard wearing and can even survive a cow's digestive tract. Once established, clubroot is very difficult to eradicate or even stop from spreading.

He believes the reason farmers are seeing more of the disease is because of tight rotations, along with the increasing popularity of cover crops, which often contain brassicas.

There are also many weed hosts, such as hedge mustard and shepherds purse, ""so it's impossible to have a field without any host plants for clubroot"".

For this reason, Dr Doering advises against having any brassicas in cover crops where there is OSR is in the rotation.

Brassica weeds and crops show virulence on the most aggressive clubroot strains, he says.

Oil radish cultivars should also not be used as they could promote the strains that may overcome resistant varieties.

Phoma

Oilseed rape growers are set to benefit from varieties with enhanced resistance against phoma, containing a brand new gene.

Current varieties rely on a single gene, the most popular being RML7 resistance. This gene has been on the market since 2010 and an over-reliance on it has seen its effectiveness fall in recent years.

DSV international OSR product manager Simon Kroeger estimates that about 70% of the current UK OSR area relies on the RLM7 gene.  

Consequently, the disease is overcoming it and you are starting to see stem canker despite having this gene, and scores are getting weaker, he warns.

Mr Kroeger points to trials in Denmark where phoma varieties without any qualitative resistance showed an average score of 7.5, with a range of 6.5 to 8.5.

This is on a score of 0-10, with 0 being excellent resistance with no phoma spotting in evidence and 10 being highly susceptible.

Varieties with the RLM7 resistance had a wider range of phoma susceptibility scores from 4-9, but of real concern is that the average was the same at 7.5

The good news for growers is that a new gene, LepR1, from DSV offers much greater resistance.

While LepR1 by itself has shown to have the best resistance to the most common strains in fields across Europe, DSV believes it is most effective when used in conjunction with other resistance traits.

Therefore, the breeder says all future varieties with the new gene will also have the RML7 resistance.

This combination offers protection against all the strains seen in Europe and will be marketed as Combination Phoma Blocker.

In the same Danish trial, varieties with Combination Phoma Blocker had an average score of just 2.3. He says the first variety will be available for UK growers to drill in summer 2024.

Mode of action

""LepR1 is already being used in Australia and Canada, so we know how the resistance works,"" he says.

The plant responds to infection with a ring of callose and lignin around the infection, stopping any spread at the early stages. This wall/barrier is a different mechanism to other genes.

Mr Kroeger believes this new resistance will be especially helpful in min-till and direct drill situations, as research shows it can significantly reduce the level of spores released to the soil.

Decreasing resting spores will be valuable. Ideally, debris should be buried. Decreasing resting spores will help where crop debris remains on top of the soil.

Spores mature and are released to potentially infect new leaves if given the right conditions.

Changing weather patterns, tight rotations and the increasing popularity of cover crops are all thought to be behind the increasing incidence of clubroot (see panel).

The disease is even being seen in known resistant varieties, overcoming varietal resistance. This leaves growers with limited options, as all the current varieties rely on the same Mendel gene.

That is until now, as DSV is set to introduce a new gene called CRE1, which stands for Clubroot Resistance Enhanced 1.

Alex Doering, the company's UK managing director, explains that it is a novel trait that was introduced by crossing with the distant relative Brassica rapa.

However, as with the current resistance gene, it is only partial with resistance to specific races, so it doesn't protect against all races in the soil.

Six races have been identified, of which P1, P2 and P3 are the most important.

In the UK, the Mendel gene offers resistance in more than 80% of cases, says Dr Doering.

In the fields where it doesn't work, investigations often reveal a history of turnip growing that has led to a change in the races present.

The good news is that the new gene is resistant to more strains, and infection experiments in the greenhouse with various isolates demonstrate enhanced resistance over the existing Mendel gene.

He believes this takes it up to resistance in 90% of cases.

An integrated approach

Even with enhanced resistance, the advice for growers will remain unchanged - they should not rely solely on varietal resistance and other measures should also be deployed.

That's because growing these varieties will select for races that overcome resistance.

The measures include:

The first variety, is expected to be registered in the EU this coming winter and is for UK National List application in 2023 at the earliest.

Why is clubroot getting worse?

Clubroot is such a difficult disease to manage because its spores can rest in soil for many years.

In the presence of susceptible plant roots, these resting spores germinate and infect the root hairs, causing the characteristic distortion.

Alex Doering says spores have a half life of 3.6 years. Combined with its unbelievably high replication rate, even after 30 years, you can still have infection.

Within one generation, which takes less than six weeks in optimal conditions, the spores can multiply 100,000-fold.

These spores are exceptionally hard wearing and can even survive a cow's digestive tract. Once established, clubroot is very difficult to eradicate or even stop from spreading.

He believes the reason farmers are seeing more of the disease is because of tight rotations, along with the increasing popularity of cover crops, which often contain brassicas.

There are also many weed hosts, such as hedge mustard and shepherds purse, ""so it's impossible to have a field without any host plants for clubroot"".

For this reason, Dr Doering advises against having any brassicas in cover crops where there is OSR is in the rotation.

Brassica weeds and crops show virulence on the most aggressive clubroot strains, he says.

Oil radish cultivars should also not be used as they could promote the strains that may overcome resistant varieties.

Phoma

Oilseed rape growers are set to benefit from varieties with enhanced resistance against phoma, containing a brand new gene.

Current varieties rely on a single gene, the most popular being RML7 resistance. This gene has been on the market since 2010 and an over-reliance on it has seen its effectiveness fall in recent years.

DSV international OSR product manager Simon Kroeger estimates that about 70% of the current UK OSR area relies on the RLM7 gene.  

Consequently, the disease is overcoming it and you are starting to see stem canker despite having this gene, and scores are getting weaker, he warns.

Mr Kroeger points to trials in Denmark where phoma varieties without any qualitative resistance showed an average score of 7.5, with a range of 6.5 to 8.5.

This is on a score of 0-10, with 0 being excellent resistance with no phoma spotting in evidence and 10 being highly susceptible.

Varieties with the RLM7 resistance had a wider range of phoma susceptibility scores from 4-9, but of real concern is that the average was the same at 7.5

The good news for growers is that a new gene, LepR1, from DSV offers much greater resistance.

While LepR1 by itself has shown to have the best resistance to the most common strains in fields across Europe, DSV believes it is most effective when used in conjunction with other resistance traits.

Therefore, the breeder says all future varieties with the new gene will also have the RML7 resistance.

This combination offers protection against all the strains seen in Europe and will be marketed as Combination Phoma Blocker.

In the same Danish trial, varieties with Combination Phoma Blocker had an average score of just 2.3. He says the first variety will be available for UK growers to drill in summer 2024.

Mode of action

""LepR1 is already being used in Australia and Canada, so we know how the resistance works,"" he says.

The plant responds to infection with a ring of callose and lignin around the infection, stopping any spread at the early stages. This wall/barrier is a different mechanism to other genes.

Mr Kroeger believes this new resistance will be especially helpful in min-till and direct drill situations, as research shows it can significantly reduce the level of spores released to the soil.

Decreasing resting spores will be valuable. Ideally, debris should be buried. Decreasing resting spores will help where crop debris remains on top of the soil.

Spores mature and are released to potentially infect new leaves if given the right conditions.

New resistance genes for clubroot and phoma will offer growers better varietal control of these two costly diseases in oilseed rape crops.

Both are welcome additions as existing genes have become less effective in recent years, with increasing reports of disease overcoming the plant's defences.

For clubroot, all the specialist varieties rely on the same gene and the disease is being seen in some of these.

And with phoma, there are suggestions that there is too much reliance on the RML7 gene, which has become less effective.

Here, Farmers Weekly looks at how OSR growers will benefit from the two new genes as varieties enter UK National List trials.

Europe's first Redekop seed control unit (SCU) fitted to a Fendt Ideal 10T combine, aimed at controlling weed seeds, is being put to the test this harvest in Leicestershire at the Belvoir Farming Company.

The Canadian-built unit attaches to the rear of the combine and uses a non-chemical approach to destroy up to 97% of harvestable weeds.

In a single pass, the device mills chaff to a fine dust and so destroys any potential weed seeds.

See also: Why blackgrass is so bad in 2023 and what to do about it

The company's manager, Keith Challen, has been battling blackgrass and other weeds on the farm's 1,200ha of heavy clay soils for more than a decade and hopes the SCU will add yet another tool to the box to get on top of his weed problems.

""Like many heavy land farmers, we suffer with a lot of blackgrass, bromes, wild oats and now even a little ryegrass.

""We've been used to prescriptive solutions out of a can, but as chemistry fails, we are looking at cultural control methods,"" he says.

""We have delayed drilling, increased seed rates, and opted for vigorous varieties, but it is still not enough.

""That's why we were keen to get involved with the SCU trial as it is part of the bigger picture of weed management,"" Keith adds.

How the SCU works

Any material that comes off the back of the combine sieves whether it's weed seeds or chaff drops into a mill and is passed between sets of counter-rotating and stationary drums.

The high-speed mill then destroys the weed seeds and blows the fine dust out the back of the combine, while the straw comes out as usual.

Keith explains that the unit is easy to use and simple to monitor via a tablet in the combine cab.

""Its engagement is automatic with the chopper and there is a manual disengagement to the drive should you wish not to run it,"" he says.

Although there is additional horsepower and fuel use requirements associated with running the mill, Keith notes the benefits of weed seed control far outweigh any potential extra fuel cost.

""In good combining conditions you forget it's even there and the extra fuel use is minimal.

""In wetter, damper conditions, when the mill has to work harder, I would expect no more than a 15% increase in fuel,"" he says.

Multi-year trial

The SCU is being trialled as part of a multi-year investigation in collaboration with the British On-Farm Innovation Network (Bofin) and independent crop research group Niab.

""We are fortunate to have been approached by Redekop to get involved with the trial. This is the only SCU in Europe to be fitted to a Fendt Ideal 10T and the second one in the world,"" says Keith.

The trial is comparing areas where the SCU has been engaged and disengaged to identify any differences in weed counts in following crops. Fuel use is also being monitored.

Keith admits that a significant proportion of blackgrass sheds before harvest, which may limit the efficacy of grassweed control from the SCU.

However, this year has seen a number of blackgrass plants at various development stages, so he remains hopeful the SCU will have a positive effect.

Variable yields

Harvest at the Belvoir Farming Company is now 75% complete, but with very variable yields.

Persistent wet weather from November to March caused soils to become waterlogged, and that caused crop root development to stagnate, pushing winter wheat yields below the farm's five-year average.

""Wet soil conditions prevented crops from developing significant root architecture. We normally get crops with huge root biomass, but this season I suspect roots were 10% of their usual size,"" says the company's manager, Keith Challen.

He adds that it's been a disappointing harvest, with third and fourth wheats achieving 7.5-8t/ha. However, on better draining land, yields are looking more promising, with first wheats hitting 10t/ha.

Peer-reviewed preliminary research suggests groups of wild deer roaming on Exmoor may be linked to outbreaks of TB in local cattle herds.

Retired medical scientist Keith J Collard used lateral flow blood tests to look at the incidence of bovine TB in 106 wild red deer (Cervus elaphus) across Exmoor, ranging from less than one year to 10 years old. 

In total, 30 deer tested positive for TB (28.3%), of which stalked deer had a higher incidence (19 out of 55; 34.55%) than hunted deer (11 out of 51; 21.57%). 

See also: Charlie Flindt: We need to talk about deer numbers

Although the study only examined a small number of deer and areas in the UK, the results suggest TB could be more prevalent in wild red deer than previous studies had found, said Dr Collard, a former associate professor at the University of Plymouth and an expert in physiology.

He observed a ""significant correlation"" between the number of farms with TB reactors and the number of TB-positive deer in the regions. This indicated a ""strong likelihood"" of cross-species infection and supports previous studies that deer could be vectors for TB in cattle.

The National Trust-owned Holnicote Estate in the north-east of Exmoor National Park was the region with the highest incidence of cattle TB relative to the number of farms.

The trust banned deer hunting with hounds on their land in 1997 and its sole deer management strategy is stalking.

Dr Collard suggested the lack of disturbance due to hunting with hounds has had a ""major effect"" on the tendency for deer to congregate in high concentrations on the 5,026ha estate, which has contributed to the high level of TB in deer. This finding is supported by previous studies in Europe and New Zealand.

This theory could be tested scientifically with the reintroduction of hunting with hounds on the estate, he said.

Badgers are thought to be the main wildlife reservoir of TB, and farmers have raised cattle water troughs to stop them using them. 

Deer can still access these water troughs. However, Dr Collard says the most likely cause of infection between deer and cattle is shared grazing, either on farmland pasture or on the moor.

Oral vaccination

The study was published in the European Journal of Wildlife Research and it was funded by the Badgworthy Trust for the Preservation of Exmoor and the Badgworthy Land Company.

It concludes that a recently developed oral vaccination is the best method of limiting TB incidence in all host species. 

Blood samples were obtained from deer culled by the Devon and Somerset Staghounds, the Quantock Staghounds and from registered stalkers operating in the area.

All animals were culled as part of a deer management strategy on Exmoor and not specifically for this study. 

A Defra spokesperson said: ""Wild deer are susceptible to TB infection, but in Great Britain they are generally considered to be spillover hosts - meaning they are unlikely to sustain the infection within their own population in the absence of infected cattle or a wildlife reservoir. There are usually only a few isolations of M bovis from wild deer each year.

""We continue to work with the farming community in Exmoor on this and are conducting a survey of TB in the wild deer population in the region.""

Set-stocking is easy, it gives animals choice, and it is cheap because no investment in infrastructure is needed, yet its major downside is constant overgrazing, says LIC consultant Bess Jowsey.

""Animals can choose where to be, in shade or shelter, but there is no chance to replace energy in the plant root stock. Livestock keep grazing the first leaf before it's had a chance to photosynthesise,"" she explains.

Bess points out that set-stocked fields have 33-50% lower productivity than rotationally grazed paddocks.

See also: Rotational grazing allows farmer to up stocking rate by 40%

One step better, she says, is simple paddock grazing where livestock graze one field and move on in a rotation of up to 10 days.

However, although this option is relatively easy and inexpensive - and grows more grass - regrowth can be grazed, which affects overall productivity.

""[Full] rotational grazing where you measure and monitor growth, allocate grass, and move every one to two days means you never regraze regrowth and grass has at least 21 days to recover.""

Infrastructure

The downside is the infrastructure needed, from dividing fields and upgrading water supplies to installing tracks to protect soils from regular cow traffic.

However, by growing more grass, less supplementary feed needs to be bought.

The Achilles heel, adds Bess, is the use of fertiliser to make this system work. Strategic applications of manufactured nitrogen would benefit regenerative agriculture, she says.

""A step on from this is mob- or cell-grazing, where livestock are given a fresh area every 12 hours and moved at least once a day.

""The mentality is also to go into higher covers and leave higher residuals: graze one-third, leave one-third and trample one-third - and usually with multispecies [swards],"" she says.

Unfortunately, there is no research to back up the belief that mob-grazing gives leaves a chance to photosynthesise and roots to grow deeper, while surface trash protects soil from sun, rain and erosion, she says.

""You have to trial things on your own business and learn what works and fails, and tweak accordingly. Give it a go and find other farmers who are doing it, as research seems to be behind,"" she advises.

Bess Jowsey was speaking at the recent Down to Earth regenerative farming event in Somerset.

Dairy cows' lying behaviour is considered a sign of their wellbeing and comfort, with 12 hours a day often used as the benchmark.

Yet lying times vary between individual cows and are affected by a range of factors, from milk yield and parity, to milking times and bed comfort.

See also: Advice on dealing with high mycotoxins in silage

Some cows lie down for fewer than nine hours, others enjoy more than 15 hours, and the average take 10-12 hours, says Dr Laura Solano, a dairy welfare specialist with Lactanet, in Canada.

In addition, there is no simple relationship between lying time and milk yield, she points out.

Lying time and milk yield

An oft-quoted study showing one extra hour of lying a day returns 1.7kg more milk was just a ""good marketing strategy"", she says, because it was one trial using fewer than 100 cows.

Her Canadian study involving 5,000 cows revealed that high-yielding cows eat more, lie less and spend more time being milked than average-yielding cows.

""We always strive for longer lying time, but it doesn't necessarily show greater comfort: old cows, lame cows and late-lactation cows all lie for longer,"" she adds.

""If we only focus on an average lying time without considering other factors, we might conclude that longer lying times indicate greater cow comfort when they may indicate more lame cows,"" she stresses.

""Variations in lame cows' behaviour depends on the severity of lameness, the extent of pain and their interactions with housing and management factors.

""Cow comfort plays an important role in lameness recovery, as a comfortable environment can influence duration and aggravation of hoof lesions.""

How much is too much standing time?

With 20 years' experience in researching standing and lying behaviour, Laura says that prolonged standing on hard surfaces produces more sole haemorrhages, sole ulcers and white line disease.

""Studies have shown that after calving, an increase of one to two hours in daily standing time and bout duration can increase the chance of developing lesions by 25-50% because of the trauma it causes inside the hoof structure,"" she explains.

""Standing behaviour and hoof lesion development account for 12-22% of hoof lesions, and 80% of lameness can be attributed to a previous lameness case.""

Lying duration can be increased, however, by improving cubicle comfort through design, bedding softness, cleanliness and dryness, says Laura.

""Soft and dry lying surfaces are the two key factors to optimise lying behaviour, while achieving a positive financial return.""

Her research shows that cows prefer sand cubicles, deep bedding and wide (more than 114cm) cubicles.

She also says cows particularly dislike lying in wet areas, citing research that revealed they spent just 4.6 hours lying on a wet bed, compared with 10.6 hours on a dirty-but-dry bed, and 12 hours on a clean, dry bed.

Waiting at robots

Long waiting times to be milked have a big effect on cow lying time. The average cow in the US waits 2 hours 40 minutes a day, says Laura.

Yet she discovered that even robot milking systems - seen as the ultimate in freedom of choice for cows - result in cows waiting one and a half hours a day to be milked.

This was the same whether there was a guided setup or free-flow system.

""Recent studies suggest that lameness prevalence in [housed] automatic milking systems is either similar to, or even higher than, that observed in conventional herds, despite these systems offering several behavioural advantages that should presumably have a positive effect on hoof health.

""Again, the longer cows wait to be milked, the less time they have to rest,"" she says.

In collaboration with scientists at the University of Wisconsin, Laura used cameras to monitor animal behaviour in a 180-cow herd milked through three robots, averaging 43kg and between 2.6 and 2.7 milkings a day.

She observed that some cows were standing around for up to five hours and, unsurprisingly, they had the shortest lying time.

Time waiting to be milked was associated with frequent use of the fetch pen because cows were held back by others from the waiting area pushing in front.

Natural herd behaviour also produced longer waiting times because there were peaks of use at 4-6pm, whereas no cow wanted to be milked at 2-3am.

Laura says that better design of the robot entry and exit areas could help prevent dominant cows pushing subordinates out of the way, as well as exiting cows being unable to interfere with cows waiting to access the robot.

The alarms on guided-flow systems should be switched on to signal when cows are waiting too long. Grouping strategies may reduce waiting times, she says.

In her research, running heifers separately and training them to the robot pre-calving led to 0.5-1 more milkings a day and 3-5kg extra milk yield.

""Maintaining an adequate stocking rate of cows per robot may lessen the dominance effect, decrease standing time and decrease the impact of failed attempts to access the robot,"" she adds.

Dr Laura Solano was speaking at the TotalDairy conference (6-7 November, Stratford-upon-Avon)

Flexible grazing, stores of good-quality silage and better ewe body condition are among measures used to mitigate against increasingly unseasonal weather at a research farm in the Grampian foothills.

Glensaugh research farm is part of the James Hutton Institute and home of its Climate-Positive Farming Initiative.

""We're living with climate change,"" says Donald Barrie, farm manager of the 1,000ha (2,471-acre) farm for the past 20 years.

""Instead of winter lasting from December to February, it now usually kicks in from early March and runs until May,"" he says.

See also: How good grass management can cut costs by up to £40,000/year

Farm facts: Glensaugh Research Station, Lawrencekirk

Donald Barrie © MAG/Judith Tooth

Grass was growing in January this year, so Mr Barrie took some of the ewes off their winter diet and rotated them round the paddocks for a fortnight, saving on conserved feed.

This can then be fed beyond lambing in April if needed - a scenario that was ""almost unheard of"" previously, except in 2013 when there was a severe winter storm in March.

He knows from experience that having reserves of silage is far preferable to buying it in.

When the farm suffered a disastrous late winter in 2021 and ran out of silage, there was plenty of baled silage to be bought, but the quality was poor.

""The problem became quite acute,"" he says. ""We were plate-metering, but [growth] levels were minimal. So, we had hunger, failure of milk supply, mastitis, dead lambs""¦

""The point is, the weather has become less predictable and more unseasonal. We can have a horribly wet and late spring or get a spring drought with excessively cold night temperatures and dried out pastures.""

© MAG/Judith Tooth

Adaptation

To build resilience and insure against these extremes, Mr Barrie has adapted management at Glensaugh in three ways:

""As hill farmers, we're not making dairy-quality silage - for us, a metabolisable energy of 11MJ/kg dry matter is quite good, with a digestibility value of 70%. Our cattle and sheep thrive on this,"" he says.

""[However,] the protein is never as high as we would like because silage-making is a compromise here.

""If we were making two cuts, we would be okay, but we are making only one cut because we graze before shutting up for silage and we need to graze aftermaths.""

Great care is taken when covering the silage clamp, pit losses are very low and there is never any effluent, he adds.

Making good silage is all part of using energy more efficiently, says Mr Barrie.

Other mitigation measures include replacing bracken with oak trees to mop up nutrients and some of the greenhouse gas emissions produced and substituting some of the farm's hydrocarbon inputs with green hydrogen power (see “Green hydrogen power at Glensaugh”, below).

Reseeding

Fields used to be reseeded after seven years but taking fields out of production always left the farm short of grass for silage-making and for midsummer grazing.

In addition, the window for reseeding is quite short and all the land is sloping, creating a risk of soil erosion in a summer storm.

Mr Barrie was also ""disinclined"" to use a plough if there was a viable alternative, so instead is focusing on:

""In fact, the more damaged the sward is, the more it will respond to overseeding. The challenge is how to add diversity to the sward,"" he says.

""If you simply drop seed into a quite healthy sward, it won't take. You have to do intentional damage to the sward.""

Late last summer, the James Hutton Institute trialled a machine that injected jets of steam to cause short-term damage to a sward before it was overseeded in strips.

""The result was similar in appearance to winter frost damage, but it is too early to tell how effective the treatment was. ""It's why we're here - to try things out,"" he says.

© MAG/Judith Tooth

Fertiliser

It is tempting in paddock grazing systems to increase nitrogen (N) applications, says Mr Barrie. Even with hikes in fertiliser prices, you still get your money back, and more.

He has settled on about 30kg/ha of N at the beginning of April, and another 60kg/ha on silage ground in mid-May. This leaves some in store to apply to individual paddocks if needed.

""If the season goes well and we start selling lambs in July, there is less need to use more fertiliser.""

Straw is bought in from farms 15 miles away, and muck is composted and spread on grass in a ""drip-feed"" fashion during the summer at a rate of 5t/ha after grazing.

Lamb production

The farm is switching from bought-in Scotch Mules to home-bred white-faced Logies from Inverurie-based Logie Durno.

These tend to produce fewer lambs (170-180% lambing percentage, compared with 190-195% for the Mules) but they are hardier and will have a longer flock life.

""We're moving to a slightly lower-input, lower-output system because labour is scarcer,"" explains Mr Barrie.

Green hydrogen power at Glensaugh

Part of the Climate-Positive Farming Initiative at Glensaugh is a green hydrogen power demonstration project.

Funded by the Scottish government's Just Transition Fund, the aim of HydroGlen is to explore the potential for green hydrogen to displace the use of fossil fuels in farming communities.

To produce green hydrogen, an energy source such as wind or sun is used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is then stored ready for use.

""It's early days, but already we have had great interest from a range of farmers and farmer co-operatives,"" says HydroGlen's project leader and senior scientist at the James Hutton Institute, Alison Hester.

The aim is to have a hydrogen fuelling station, using easily transportable Calor gas-type bottles, and a battery electric vehicle fuelling station, to allow farms to run a mix of electric- and hydrogen-fuelled vehicles as suits them best, says Prof Hester.

""This gives maximum flexibility into the future as technologies for both these types of vehicles continue to develop.""

A pioneering project that aims to get hospitality businesses of all kinds selling local food is being trialled in Yorkshire.

The initiative, a collaboration between NFU North East and the York and North Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce Hospitality Forum, was launched at a roundtable discussion in May.

It follows the publication of the NFU's Food, Farming and Hospitality report earlier this year (see panel), which showed how the public had favourable perceptions of the use of British and local food in the hospitality sector.

The Yorkshire project is the first of its kind in the country and has ambitions to shorten supply chains for the benefit of the agriculture and hospitality industries.

See also: Foodie Farms: A celebration of the best of British food

Rachel Hallos, NFU North East's regional chairman, told Farmers Weekly the end game was to ""reconnect people with food"".

""It's something there is a lot of passion for here in Yorkshire,"" she said.

""If we can spark an interest in food and where it comes from, it gives a real sense of belonging, community, and support in the area.

""We're a big county. We've got just about every single food you could possibly think of. Gorgeous strawberries to hill lamb - we've got it.""

Challenges

The hospitality sector has for years now struggled to attract workers, and more recently has been hit by the challenges associated with the cost-of-living crisis, as well as soaring input cost inflation.

Philip Bolson, chairman of the York and North Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce Hospitality Forum, explained that the industry was also grappling with a heavy tax burden.

But he is still keen to make sure the project targets hospitality businesses selling at all price points.

""People talk about Michelin stars and that's great, but the majority of hospitality isn't that,"" he said.

""It's your bars, your restaurants, your cafÃ©s, your burger vans on the A1. That's going to be the challenge - and the opportunity - to get in front of that lot and say, ""˜have you thought about this?'.

""Their first response will be, ""˜it's too expensive', and the second one might be, ""˜where do I go?'. It's a challenge, but it needs to be done.""

Mrs Hallos agreed. ""There is no reason why people who are spending less money in takeaways shouldn't have the quality product,"" she said.

""We need to do it for every single price point. We can't turn our back on the people that have got to think more carefully about how they spend their money. We've got to respect that not everybody can make the same choices.""

Brainchild 

The idea of bringing the hospitality and farming industries together was the brainchild of NFU president Minette Batters, who is, in addition to being a farmer, a qualified chef and a wedding venue owner.

""This, for me, is really important, because we have been talking about self-sufficiency and food security for a very long time,"" Mrs Batters said.  

""The out-of-home market is 50%, effectively, of the value of the food market. Our members tend to focus all of their attention on retail, but the out-of-home market matters just as much.

""Actually, the negative impact of trade deals will be felt first of all in the out-of-home market. Ministers talk about the importance of labelling, but it means nothing at all in this market.

""This has been a long piece of policy work for us, in considering how we make sure we get more British food on more British plates in the out-of-home market.""

Early stages

While the project is still in the preliminary stages, the plan is to roll out a programme over the winter, when business owners are starting to think about the changes they can make in the new year.

""Step one is to get people round the table,"" said Mr Bolson.

""We need to get those businesses, suppliers and maybe the middlemen, whoever they are, together and figure out how this works.""

And while the Yorkshire project is still in its infancy, there is hope that, if successful, it can be replicated elsewhere in the country. ""It's what happens next that counts,"" said Mrs Hallos.

Wagyu beef is for everyone

Tom Richardson, managing director of Yorkshire-based Warrendale Wagyu, which works in partnership with more than 500 farmers across the UK, spoke at the Great Yorkshire Show about how the business was catering for everyone.

""We've been successful over time in catering for all markets, whether it's Michelin star restaurants or local pubs around Yorkshire,"" he said.

""We've got the ability to balance our carcass through being really targeted with different cuts and being customer-focused - giving people what they want.

""Key to that has been really consistent supply, so we've got the volume of product to offer so they can always keep things on their menus, and also consistent quality.""

Public support for British out-of-home food

Despite the cost of living crisis, research published in the NFU report found that 87% of out-of-home consumers want to support British food production and believe local food sourcing is the most important element of sustainability when eating out.

NFU regional director David Hall suggested the Yorkshire initiative would help in this regard, supporting businesses that want to reduce their carbon footprint.

""Through its drive to reach net zero by 2040, farming has the potential to make a huge contribution to the efforts of the hospitality sector to become more carbon friendly,"" he said.

""In return, creating demand for more home-grown produce could help small family farms and horticultural growers develop a local market for their produce and boost their income at a time when many are struggling to cope with soaring prices.""

Transparency on the sourcing of food was also considered ""very"" or ""somewhat important"" by those surveyed as part of the NFU research.

The report went on to suggest that, by stocking locally produced food, businesses would be able to stand out from the competition and appeal to customers, with more than half of consumers willing to pay extra for meals where the main ingredient was British and where the origin of the product was promoted.

711,"Upland farms face 37% funding hole under ELM, warns NFU","https://www.fwi.co.uk/business/business-management/agricultural-transition/upland-farms-face-37-funding-hole-under-elm-warns-nfu","Upland farms face 37% funding hole under ELM, warns NFU

Upland farms in England are facing a serious collapse in their incomes under Defra's post-Brexit agricultural support schemes, modelling by the NFU has revealed.

Senior NFU officials said ministers repeatedly told farmers in the uplands that they would be recognised for the work they do and be no worse off after Brexit, but this is not borne out by the figures.

The NFU used real data from six farms in the English uplands to compare how they would fare financially under the transition from direct payments to Defra's Environmental Land Management (ELM) programme.  

See also: Defra figures spell looming disaster for the uplands

They found that on average, the upland farming businesses lost 37% of their support payments under the current Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) - the first component of ELM - and Countryside Stewardship (CS) options.

Only one of the six case study farms was found to not be any worse off under ELM - this was mainly because it did not claim the BPS.

Government under fire

NFU uplands forum chairman Thomas Binns said the modelling shows Defra's current ELM scheme offer falls short of providing a viable future for upland businesses.

""The government needs to be held to account. You would not have expected the uplands to be in this situation given when we started the new mantra was public goods for public money,"" he added.

""You would have thought the uplands would have had oodles to offer in that space. Yet we are trying to struggle to get to par, never mind any increase""¦ We have started with £1 and we are only left with 70p, and that is not good business.""

Mr Binns said upland farmers were struggling to make up the funding shortfall, as many businesses relied heavily on the BPS payments that are being phased out and not properly replaced under ELM.

Many are also already heavily involved in environmental schemes.

""You pull the BPS away and the viability of the whole operation becomes very questionable,"" he added.

Mr Binns fears some upland farmers will choose to ""farm their way out of a crisis"" by ramping  up productivity to make up the deficit, which could leave the environment worse off. Others will seek additional income streams through diversification or by entering into large-scale environmental schemes.     

Asked what Defra needed to do reverse the situation, Mr Binns said the simplest solution would be to increase payment rates for upland options under ELM and agri-environment schemes.

Other solutions include further grassland options under the SFI, more flexibility for those in Higher Level Stewardship agreements to stack options under the SFI and bundling together of some options with premiums offered.

Payments parity

Back in May, the NFU successfully lobbied Defra to restore parity on SFI payment rates for managing grassland with low inputs (£151/ha).

But Mr Binns said Defra must ""pull a rabbit out of the hat"" with its final SFI offer, which is due to be released ahead of Christmas and introduced sometime next year, to ensure upland farm businesses can remain viable.

Last week, the Green Alliance think tank called on the government to reform payment schemes to provide more support for smaller grazing and upland farms.

The latest Defra farm business income figures revealed an average 12% increase from March 2022 to February 2023. However, grazing livestock farms in less-favoured areas had the biggest decline year on year, falling by 41% to £25,400.

A Defra spokesperson said: ""Upland farmers play a critical role in our rural communities and natural environment, and there is something on offer for every business to support them to produce food sustainably while protecting nature and enhancing the environment.

""We are continuing to work closely with farmers and landowners as these schemes are rolled out.

""We've already increased payment rates under Countryside Stewardship and SFI to make sure that upland farmers are paid the same as lowland farmers for carrying out the same action.""

5 must-knows about feed efficiency indexes

Provided by

VikingGenetics contributes to feeding the world's population and preserving natural resources through innovative breeding of healthy, efficient cows. VikingGenetics delivers science-based bovine genetic solutions to dairy and beef producers.

Paying more attention to feed efficiency indexes when selecting sires for dairy herds will help compensate the escalating costs of feed being witnessed today.

With that in mind, dairy farmers are being urged to consider all options to help mitigate these high costs and one perfect tool for doing so is a more targeted and efficient use of genetics.

Two Holstein cows with the same production level may have quite different feed intake levels.

Research showed in one case the more efficient cow consumed 861kgs less dry matter than the other cow, which corresponds to a 12% reduction in feed costs.

What is the feed efficiency index?

By selecting genetics with a high index for feed efficiency, dairy farmers can use sires that breed cows as better feed converters.

This means cows produce more milk and meat on less feed and at the same time ensure that cows have good health and reproduction performance, and long productive life.

That helps improve the profitability and sustainability of the business.

The feed efficiency index shows how efficient a cow is in turning feed into milk.

While some cows are good at this, others use too much feed for maintenance and are less efficient when it comes to utilising the feed.

The development of a reliable index for feed efficiency requires direct and accurate measurements of individual cows’ feed intake in a large number of lactating cows under the conditions in which they are expected to perform.

The cows sired by the bulls with a high index for feed efficiency use fewer feed resources, as they convert feed more efficiently and require less energy for maintenance.

That means the resources are used more efficiently and dairy farmers can produce more milk and meat with fewer inputs, reducing the environmental impact.

Decoding feed efficiency indexes: 5 critical questions for informed decision-making

There are five straight questions a farmer should ask his or her genetics rep when considering feed efficiency indexes.

1. Is the data collected from commercial herds with different production systems and management levels without disturbing cows' natural behaviour and daily routines on the farm?

Herds have different production systems and management levels; therefore, the data should be collected from a number of farms to give a more reliable index.

2. Is the data on feed intake collected on lactating cows?

Some genetic companies offer data collected from heifers. Research from Pryce et al in 2014 reported a genetic correlation of 0.67 between heifer and first-lactation-cow efficiency.

This means that heifer efficiency only explains 45% of the variation in cow efficiency. This makes the value of making heifer registrations to predict cow efficiency very inefficient.

3. Is the feed intake measured throughout the whole lactation and over cows’ lifetime?

A cow's physiology and production changes dramatically through lactations.

Feeding requirements and performance varies for different periods in lactation. Therefore, data should be collected from various stages of the cow's life.

4. Does the index allow to breed for better feed efficiency without the negative impact on production, health and fertility?

Breeding solely to save feed is not enough as production levels need to be sustained to secure farm's profits.

When breeding for more feed-efficient cows, farmers need to be careful and not favour the cow that depletes its body reserves for milk production.

5. Does the feed efficiency index account for metabolic efficiency?

Metabolic efficiency is a crucial element in feed efficiency as it measures how efficient the cow is in converting feed energy in her body.

This is energy used, for instance, for supporting milk production.

© VikingGenetics

Feed efficiency index advantages

Breeding for higher feed efficiency helps reduce the environmental impact of dairy and beef industries, as more feed-efficient cows have lower methane emissions.

It is important to reduce the environmental impact that each dairy farm has.

And if the farmer can achieve this by making relatively simple changes in the genetics that they use in the herd in order to reduce the amount of feed that cows intake, and reduce the amount of waste produced but still maintain the desired production level, that results in more efficient farming.

Jan Lassen, MSc., PhD, and senior research manager at the nordic genetics company VikingGenetics, owned by the cattle breeders in Denmark, Sweden and Finland, is encouraging farmers to consider the value of Saved Feed Index that is part of Nordic Total Merit index.

Mr Lassen said: ""Breeding for improved efficiency is a win-win situation. Higher production occurs when we select the most efficient animals. There are no negative consequences on health, reproduction and longevity traits.""

The Saved Feed Index is based on data from the Cattle Feed Intake System (CFIT), a state-of-the-art system where 3D cameras and artificial intelligence are used to identify the cows, estimate their weight, and quantify how much they eat.

Backed by more than nine years of research and development, CFIT provides real-life data for individual cows’ feed intake collected in the cow's natural environment 24/7 year-round:

By including the Saved Feed Index into the breeding goal, dairy farmers get an excellent tool to optimise their business and meet the demands for sustainable food production.

Dairy farm set to save thousands thanks to solar thermal installation

The recent energy crisis has pulled into sharp focus for all businesses the rising cost of gas and electricity; but for dairy farms, where the energy need has always been high, the current spikes in unit costs could force thousands of UK farmers out of business. 

With the government's energy price guarantee set to end in August, the global supply of gas still disrupted and energy firms enjoying record profits, a fall in utility bills for farmers is unlikely to happen any time soon.

For such farms to survive, there needs to be a dramatic rethink on how they get their energy, and this is something a Dairy Farm near Bala, North Wales, has done, with the support of Remote Power UK, and their partners at Horisun Renewable Energy.

Rhiwlas Farm has 450 cows on a daily milking cycle and was seeing an electricity bill nearing £12,000 per year.

The majority of the electricity usage was in the 900L Cotswold Dairy Heater which uses two 6kW immersion heaters to heat the tank to 85 degrees Celsius daily, for wash downs.

Already in place at Rhiwlas was an FGAS heat recovery system and milk heat exchangers, as you'd expect, but the farm needed a more cost-effective way to get that heat into the store in the first place without having to compromise or replace any existing equipment.

The solution - solar thermal 

You probably know that solar energy can be turned into electricity by using solar panels, but there's another popular application to the sun's power. Solar thermal panels can turn sunlight into heat (instead of power).

Whilst everyone has heard of standard solar panels (solar PV), solar thermal actually carries a number of benefits for dairy farmers, including:

Solar thermal panels heat water using evacuated tube technology which makes them approximately 65% efficient, compared to Solar PV which is only approximately 17% efficient.

This process of converting electricity to heat suffers efficiency losses, whereas the heat produced by a solar thermal system is used directly within the hot water tank.

For example, 1kW of sunlight captured using PV panels will only convert to approximately 0.17 kW of heat in water, whereas 1kW of sunlight captured via solar thermal will equate to approximately 0.65 kW of heat in water.

You would need to quadruple the area of Solar PV to achieve the same gain as Solar Thermal.

If water heating is the desired outcome there is no more efficient and affordable renewable technology on the market than solar thermal.

The solar thermal system is set to save approximately £1400 per year on water heating costs. At the current tariff rate that will see a return on the initial investment of £12,000 in 8 years.

It will be faster if (when) gas and electricity prices from energy firms rise.

In the month of May this year alone, it has generated just under 1000kWh of heat.

Farmer Ian said: ""I am delighted with the system. I wish we had thought of it sooner. Why these systems are not more commonplace on dairy farms, I don't know?

""Perhaps it is because farmers are not aware it is an option or think they need to spend a fortune on Solar PV [electric] panels instead?""

The installation at Rhiwlas Farm

4x Navitron evacuated tube solar collectors, totalling x120 tubes in banks of x30, were installed on the south facing roof of the dairy.

Giving an aperture area of 11.32 m2 absorbing the sun's rays during daylight hours 365 days a year.

Inside a pumping station sends the heat generated from the solar panels primarily to the 900 litre Cotswold tank via a 20kW heat exchanger externally fitted.

This pump is operated by a temperature difference controller which looks at the temperature on the panels against the temperature in the store and as long as it is 10 degrees higher than the tank, starts pumping that heat in.

Also installed was a 320 litre thermal store with a diverter valve, operated by the same controller. This acts as both a heat dump and a buffer vessel and is integrated with the existing heat recovery system.

When the Cotswold tank has reached the desired 85 degrees Celsius needed for wash downs, the solar heat is diverted to the thermal store.

When the Cotswold needs re-filling, water from the heat recovery unit also passes through the new thermal store to act as a pre-heat.

Meaning the requirements for heating the Cotswold are already partly satisfied before it has even started, further lessening the requirements of the immersion heaters if and when they need to be used.

Horisun Renewable Energy are specialists in solar thermal technology and have been involved in the industry since it became a mainstay on the UK market in the early 2000s.

They offer solar thermal systems, solar PV and heat pumps nationwide on both a domestic and commercial scale.

Chris Steele, installation manager for Horisun Renewable Energy said, ""We were delighted to work on this project with Remote Power UK and Rhiwlas and get to spend some more time in Wales.

""I have always maintained that solar thermal should be considered a no-brainer where large hot water needs must be met. It is great to see this dairy farm getting on board with the technology.""

An unfair characterisation or otherwise, farmers historically have had a reputation for being reluctant to co-operate with each other, often lagging behind other industries when it comes to working together.

Largely driven by economics, collaboration is now gaining traction within agriculture.

Farmers are finding new and different ways of working with their peers and buyers to ease some of the financial pressure they are under from higher input costs and price stagnation.

At a seminar at the 2023 Royal Welsh Show, HSBC deputy head of agriculture Euryn Jones advised farmers that collaborative ways of working could be the way forward for many of them and that doing so could make a positive difference to their businesses.

In an interview with Farmers Weekly, he expands on that theme.

""The benefits are multiple,'' he says.

""In my experience, farmers who collaborate effectively with others, whether that be with other individual farmers or organisations in the supply chain or elsewhere, often become more efficient and successful.''

See also: Farm collaboration: Examples and tips for success

Benchmarking

In its more basic form, Mr Jones says collaboration can mean something as simple as benchmarking.

This system allows farmers to gain a more accurate picture of how much room there is for improvement on their own farms by comparing the results achieved in their own businesses with what other producers are attaining on similar farms.

""Being challenged by peers is such a powerful way to improve business efficiency, a simple comparison with one's own peers enables farmers to understand how their inputs and outputs compare,'' says Mr Jones.

""I can think of very few other actions a farmer can take that will provide more benefit than benchmarking and having that support and challenge from their peers. Benchmarking is a good thing, however they do it.''

The dairy industry, he suggested, led the field on this with a number of well-established grazing discussion groups operating in the UK.

""I have seen so many farmers benefit from this model, gaining an outside perspective on their business from people they genuinely respect,'' he says.

Industry bodies, including AHDB and, in Wales, Hybu Cig Cymru (HCC), generate and publish performance data and that can be a very useful means of benchmarking, says Mr Jones, but he believed it was even more powerful to have face-to-face interaction with peers and in confidence.

Buying groups

Buying groups bring farmers into a conglomerate to help them secure a better deal on inputs, perhaps a discounted price or better payment terms than they would get as individuals.

Mr Jones says this arrangement can add considerable power when negotiating deals, often on feed, fertiliser and fuel.

""The factors being negotiated don't have to be based purely on price, they can include a range of other elements that provide buyers with the best value,'' he explained.

This arrangement can also allow haulage costs to be optimised, with significant potential savings on full loads, particularly for deliveries to remote locations, since it allows hauliers to operate their fleet more efficiently. As a result, they can offer more competitive prices.

Joint ownership of machinery and equipment

When considering how to fund machinery, joint ownership or sharing with a neighbour can be an economical option, particularly when it involves high-value kit.

This arrangement has been relatively commonplace in the arable sector for many years, but more dairy and livestock farmers are now recognising the benefits too.

""Many farmers use contractors and that often works well, but in some cases sharing with several neighbours can be a sensible alternative,'' says Mr Jones.

""There are also examples where family businesses have split, but they see the merit in sharing machinery rather than doubling up.''

Differences in farm scale can be ironed out at the purchase stage and with ongoing costs.

In the case of a combine harvester, for example, outlay could be weighted according to acreage farmed, applying that to maintenance and repair too, and with the diesel tank topped up before it leaves each farm.

To overcome tensions that can come with every farm needing to use the machine at similar times, it is a model that can work better for farms growing different crops, or those with different systems.

""I know of an example of four dairy farmers who jointly purchased a forage wagon - two use it to feed in the morning, two in the afternoon,'' says Mr Jones.

This arrangement can have additional benefits too, he has observed.

""One of those farmers suffered a health problem and was really struggling, but the other three farmers were able to step in to help,"" he says.

""A situation like that can give additional resilience to all those businesses.''

Pooling resources within a joint venture can produce considerable benefits

Agricultural consultant Jamie Gwatkin calculates that savings in labour and machinery costs of £100/ha are achievable by pooling resources in combinable crop regimes and up to £170/ha where root crops are involved.

In a climate of high interest rates, merging resources also allows for capital release from machinery, which means debt can be reduced, says Mr Gwatkin.

Other benefits he has identified include:

Collaboration in the supply chain

As evidenced by some of the past crises caused by price volatility in different farming sectors, businesses with contracts aligned to their cost of production more or less sailed through, while others floundered.

These models remove much of the risk for farmers, allowing severe price troughs to be avoided.

Producers must accept they might feel disadvantaged when there are price peaks, but Mr Jones believes overall they work in a supplier's favour.

""Having some indication of what the price is going to be, even if just a band within which the price will be fixed, will avoid the severe troughs and is worth the loss of those peaks when they do arrive,"" he says.

He cites the example of the potato sector, where prices were historically extremely volatile, but are less so now since cost of production contracts have become more commonplace.

In the financial supply chain, borrowing money at a fixed interest rate is a form of collaboration, says Mr Jones.

""When a fixed rate is agreed with a lender, it is not necessarily about borrowing at a lower rate but at a known rate.

""The key is to avoid high interest rates and if a borrower does miss out on low interest rates when they occur it might be a price worth paying.''

This outlook can also apply to utility contracts, such as energy.

Case study: AgrisgÃ´p

Huw Thomas collaborated with other farmers to progress the New Zealand Polled Wiltshire breeding programme © Farming Connect

Collaboration has allowed a group of Welsh farmers to introduce new genetics into their flocks.

The farmers - Huw Thomas, John and Hedd Davies and Dafydd Evans - all run flocks of EasyCare sheep, but were keen to use genetics from the southern hemisphere to further advance their breeding programmes.

To help progress that ambition, they collaborated as a group under AgrisgÃ´p, a Farming Connect initiative that is unique to Wales and encourages farmers to get together to develop their businesses.

Through that programme, the farmers connected with a Shropshire-based sheep breeder who is involved in embryo transfer and AI programmes globally, and he imported four Polled Wiltshire rams from New Zealand in November 2022.

Semen was taken from these and the AgrisgÃ´p group used it to inseminate their ewes with the first lambs born last spring.

Mr Thomas, who had a 60% success rate on the 20 ewes he inseminated and achieved a scanning percentage of 145%, says using imported Polled Wiltshires will add to the existing gene pool and possibly allow the introduction of an extra degree of hybrid vigour.

With direct subsidies ending in 2024 and significant changes to agricultural support ahead, he suggests that sheep farmers will have to think outside the box.

""We wouldn't have been able to achieve what we have without the contacts we gained through AgrisgÃ´p,'' he says.

I've been looking at the Royal Agricultural Benevolent Institution's Big Farming Survey, which revealed one-third of us are likely depressed, and almost half are experiencing anxiety, with a strong connection between loneliness and mental health issues.

It's easy to attribute the long hours spent working alone and the isolating nature of our rural settings as the culprits behind this.

However, our roles within farming, with their respective burdens, can contribute to a sense of loneliness in everyday life.

About the author

Many of us have grown up seeing our fathers bear the weight of daily stresses, constant demands and unpredictable challenges on the farm, while our mothers shoulder the immense responsibility of managing the household and raising children.

Those of us venturing into agriculture find ourselves navigating high expectations and readjusting to a secluded lifestyle after school or university.

As responsibilities shift between generations, it's natural to feel isolated.

Older generations may struggle to embrace change and relinquish control, and the younger generation may feel unheard and untrusted.

It helps everyone to have open communication and decision-making, and recognise the value of partners and different generations.

Empowering the older generation as mentors to share their wealth of experience, while also embracing fresh ideas and perspectives strengthens our relationships and cultivates a shared sense of purpose.

No matter how busy we are, prioritising our wellbeing is essential - you can't farm without farmers.

To confront loneliness head on, it's vital that we reach out for support from friends, family or professional counsellors.

Engaging in hobbies and local events provides opportunities to meet others and have an outlet from daily pressures.

By acknowledging the unique struggles faced by different farming groups, we can foster understanding, camaraderie and overall wellbeing.

Let's build stronger bridges between generations, promote the benefits of inclusivity and provide the support to make a positive difference in combating loneliness in our communities.

Mental Health Awareness Week runs from 15-21 May and farmers across the country are being urged to break down the stigma surrounding mental wellbeing.

A recent survey carried out by the Farm Safety Foundation found 94% of farmers aged under 40 agreed poor mental health is one of the farming sector's greatest hidden problems.

Gauging the scale of the crisis, the same study used the Warwick Edinburgh mental wellbeing scales to evaluate mental health in the industry, and found that wellbeing has deteriorated year-on-year over a three-year period.

Mental health charity helplines

See also: Top tips from three multitasking farming mums

The survey of 900 people also found that farmers over the age of 40 reported lower mental wellbeing than their younger counterparts.

Stephanie Berkeley, manager at the Farm Safety Foundation (Yellow Wellies), said: ""Levels of mental wellbeing are deteriorating, and it's important to recognise when you are not finding joy. Help is out there, and nobody is ever going to judge you.

""We are only here once; reach out to people, and know that you are not alone. You might be surprised by how many people feel the same as you.""

Farmers Weekly spoke to farmers across the country to get their tips for improving their mental wellbeing.

Self-care

Not originally from a farming background, Milly Fyfe met her husband through YFC, and the pair are based in Northamptonshire on a mixed arable and livestock farm.

Milly has always spoken openly about her mental health challenges, and is passionate about encouraging others to look after their mental wellbeing.

""Being on a farm and looking after two young children generally on my own led to a lot of anxiety and loneliness,"" said Milly.

""I'm a social person, and because I'm quite capable, people perhaps don't think I would struggle with my mental health.""

Milly is a big advocate of the benefits of self-care, and makes time to get off farm each week to attend a pilates class or have a family day with her children.

""Having that short break really helps, and makes life a lot more manageable,"" she said.

""Reaching out and asking for help has meant that I now have some crucial friends that I can speak to if I'm having a tough time, and I can mull things over with them and make sense of a situation.""

She also advises finding a hobby that can provide a welcome break from work stresses.

""My escape is my garden, and I love growing things. For me, it represents taking that break and having a hobby that isn't work related,"" says Milly.

""It is something you can enjoy as a family. It is part of self-care and taking a break, and it helps to recharge your batteries.""

Reach out and talk to friends

Tom Ware, a young farmer from Nottinghamshire, is passionate about inspiring fellow young farmers to reach out for help and get talking about their mental health.

After working alongside Leonard Eadon, a young farmer who took his own life on New Year’s Day in 2022, Tom established the Just Talk Agri initiative, and has since been working closely with the Farming Community Network (FCN) and the Yellow Wellies “Mind Your Head” campaign to promote mental health awareness among young farmers.

""The biggest message we are trying to get out is that no one is alone. We are all here for each other, and it is OK not to be OK. Someone is always at the end of the phone,"" says Tom.

""We need the younger generation of farmers to know that they can talk and help others.""

For Tom, calling a friend and making time to meet up and talk are essential to maintaining his mental wellbeing. 

Keep moving

Lincolnshire arable farmer Charles Anyan says physical activity has strong links to mental wellbeing.

As an FCN ambassador and judge of this year's Britain's Fittest Farmer competition, his relationship with physical and mental wellness is well documented.

Once a self-professed ""trainer hater"", Charles has found exercising is a key tool for managing stress and promoting a healthy mindset.

""My biggest tip is to buy a pair of trainers and keep moving,"" he says. ""Physical and mental health are very closely interlinked, and exercise is a wonderful stress remover. A healthy body equals a healthy mind.

""You've also got to back yourself and have a bit of faith in what you can achieve.""

Embrace your surroundings

Young farmer and Manchester University politics student Hannah Cuthbert, from Lincolnshire, says with the everyday pressures farmers are facing, it is easy to lose sight of the joys of the job.

Hannah Cuthbert © Hannah Cuthbert

""It's important to contextualise where you are. Go and take a walk through a few of your fields and remember the rewarding elements of the job,"" she says. 

""You are providing the country with food and looking after the special environments for other people to enjoy. There is a lot to feel proud about, and it's good to acknowledge that.""

Farmers across the UK are encouraged to capture field slugs for feeding analysis this spring, as part of a farmer-led research project exploring new ways to manage slug damage.

The ultimate aim is to develop a future wheat variety with slug-resistant traits.

Led by the British On-Farm Innovation Network (Bofin), the project plans to gauge how palatable a range of different wheat varieties is to slugs, in order to help farmers reduce reliance on chemical control measures and potential environmental impact.

Scientists at the John Innes Centre in Norwich are hoping farmers will trap and send in about 1,000 slugs from their fields for feeding trial analysis at the centre's insectary.

The costs of slugs

Slug damage costs UK arable farmers £100m every year and is a key cause of cereal damage.

Oxfordshire farmer and Bofin founder Tom Allen-Stevens explains: ""As slugs get active this month, rather than let them graze on crops, we're keen for farmers to join our group of ""˜slug scouts', who will trap the pests and send them in for this important study.""

The volunteer farmers will be provided with a pack, including containers and postage-paid envelopes. Instructions on how to set up an effective trap known as a “slimery” will be provided.

""The ""˜slimery' is what you will use to attract and trap slug populations - it will want to be in the most slug-infested spot of your farm,"" explains Mr Allen-Stevens.

Slug-resistant wheat

The project follows initial studies that indicated one landrace wheat variety, known as Watkins 788, may be resistant to slug damage.

Watkins 788 is one of a collection of landrace wheats currently being screened for traits by scientists working on the Defra-funded Wheat Genetic Improvement Network programme.

Simon Griffiths, the project's lead researcher at the John Innes Centre, highlights how the initial feeding trials showed Watkins788 was consistently spurned by slugs.

""We multiplied up enough of the variety for farmer-led trials that took place on farms across England over the autumn and winter,"" explains Dr Griffiths.

These were then conducted by 10 trial farmers, who followed an in-field trial protocol drawn up by slug behaviour expert Professor Keith Walters of Harper Adams University.

Results are currently being assessed and are due to be published at a webinar taking place on 16 March.

The Slug-Resistant Wheat project is a farmer-led study that started in April 2022. Co-ordinated by Bofin, anyone can join for free and get involved with the group of 60 farmers and scientists.

Farmers across the UK are encouraged to capture field slugs for feeding analysis this spring, as part of a farmer-led research project exploring new ways to manage slug damage.

The ultimate aim is to develop a future wheat variety with slug-resistant traits.

Led by the British On-Farm Innovation Network (Bofin), the project plans to gauge how palatable a range of different wheat varieties is to slugs, in order to help farmers reduce reliance on chemical control measures and potential environmental impact.

Scientists at the John Innes Centre in Norwich are hoping farmers will trap and send in about 1,000 slugs from their fields for feeding trial analysis at the centre's insectary.

The costs of slugs

Slug damage costs UK arable farmers £100m every year and is a key cause of cereal damage.

Oxfordshire farmer and Bofin founder Tom Allen-Stevens explains: ""As slugs get active this month, rather than let them graze on crops, we're keen for farmers to join our group of ""˜slug scouts', who will trap the pests and send them in for this important study.""

The volunteer farmers will be provided with a pack, including containers and postage-paid envelopes. Instructions on how to set up an effective trap known as a “slimery” will be provided.

""The ""˜slimery' is what you will use to attract and trap slug populations - it will want to be in the most slug-infested spot of your farm,"" explains Mr Allen-Stevens.

Slug-resistant wheat

The project follows initial studies that indicated one landrace wheat variety, known as Watkins 788, may be resistant to slug damage.

Watkins 788 is one of a collection of landrace wheats currently being screened for traits by scientists working on the Defra-funded Wheat Genetic Improvement Network programme.

Simon Griffiths, the project's lead researcher at the John Innes Centre, highlights how the initial feeding trials showed Watkins788 was consistently spurned by slugs.

""We multiplied up enough of the variety for farmer-led trials that took place on farms across England over the autumn and winter,"" explains Dr Griffiths.

These were then conducted by 10 trial farmers, who followed an in-field trial protocol drawn up by slug behaviour expert Professor Keith Walters of Harper Adams University.

Results are currently being assessed and are due to be published at a webinar taking place on 16 March.

The Slug-Resistant Wheat project is a farmer-led study that started in April 2022. Co-ordinated by Bofin, anyone can join for free and get involved with the group of 60 farmers and scientists.

Last season, many growers bought fertiliser, or at least a proportion of it, before the prices rocketed in September 2021.

With high commodity prices following, it meant, in the end, there was little incentive to cut fertiliser applications.

This season looks different.

Unless some nitrogen (N) was saved from last season, or you have alternative sources, most will have had to pay more for N than ever before.

This is being coupled with, currently, a wheat grain market that fell to an 11-month low of £223/t in late January.

So, how are farmers reacting?

North

James Pick, North Yorkshire

Aiming to reduce synthetic nitrogen requirements is standard policy on James Pick's family farm as they transition towards a regenerative style of farming.

He cut last season's nitrogen - bought well in advance for £180/t - by about 10% across the farm and is planning to further reduce applied N this season.

© James Pick

This year's N has been bought at £700/t, with another lorry load still to purchase, but price isn't a factor in the policy.

""Historically, we've applied about 200-210kg N/ha in wheat. Last year, we were between 156kg N/ha and 190kg N/ha, and this year I expect some fields will be down to 130kg N/ha.""

The reduction has been primarily towards the end of the season, with the first two applications standard rates.

""We then use Yara's N Tester to assess the crop, look at soil conditions, weather forecast and judge our yield potential to base the last two applications off.""

While the first application will be bagged N and the second liquid N, the last two applications on a proportion of the farm are likely to be foliar nitrogen made on farm by melting urea to a concentration of 5%.

""Some research says foliar N can be up to seven times more efficient than soil applied. I'm not sure it is quite as high as that, but it could be 2.5 to three times more, so it's really utilising what we have on the farm,"" he says.

Underpinning the reductions is wide use of organic manures and compost across the farm.

Around three-quarters of the potato area receives farmyard manure

From last year half of the arable area will receive application of 10t/ha composted manure, having previously had farmyard manure.

Midlands

Will Oliver, Leicestershire

About 160t of fertiliser bought at £274/t ahead of last season, plus poultry muck and digestate from the broiler business and sewage sludge, has left Will Oliver in a place where he feels confident to push to produce 1,000t of Skyfall milling wheat this season.

© Tim Scrivener

""With milling wheat premiums where they are, and domestic feed wheat demand falling with pigs and poultry struggling, I think the opportunity to grow milling quality is too good to dismiss.""

Poultry muck applied at 6t/ha accounts for about one-third of his N requirements in wheat and will be applied, weather permitting, as the second application to wheat, following ammonium nitrate or ammonium sulphate as the initial top dressing.

""If I think the crop needs the N, I'll go ammonium nitrate, which I'll do this year as we've got some later sown crops that I will want to get growing.""

Fertiliser bought at £630/t has been purchased as a back-up plan in case it is too wet to spread organic manures.

""We're on 36m tramlines but spread digestate and poultry muck at 18m so we don't want to make a mess. But if conditions are right, you can do it, and a week later you don't know you've been there.""

How the crop reacts to the organic manures will then dictate when and how a third and sometimes fourth dose of N is applied, he says. An N tester is used to help with decision-making.

""It gives an index number relative to the situation, and what it thinks you need to apply to reach your target end market. I use it as a guide.""

On the milling wheat last year, he also applied a foliar, slow-release N product MZ28, which is supposed to replace about 50kg N/ha.

""We did a tramline trial and there was no difference in yield despite applying 50kg N/ha less, and the proteins were fine.""

East Anglia

James Sills, Essex/Suffolk border

Most of James Sills' nitrogen requirements were purchased ahead of the season, with, for the first time, a proportion of a granular urea sulphur compound part of the mix.

""While spread quality and overlaps are a concern, the price discount to liquid urea ammonium nitrate was too large to ignore last summer,"" he says. ""We prefer the accuracy of liquid so hope this will be a one-off.""

Wheat has established on the farm without any major limitations, meaning there is good potential.

Ultimately, the total dose of N applied to his hard feed wheats Champion, Gleam and Dawsum will be determined by any abnormal spring weather at the time of the final application and the cost of the additional purchased N required for it, which will be made this spring.

""It's important to distinguish between the average and marginal price of N when determining total N dose,"" he suggests.

""The price I've paid for the initial 125kg N/ha is immaterial to the decision about how much additional N to purchase.

""What's more important is I've made the decision of when to buy, to buy more until the marginal cost of that additional unit of N roughly equals the marginal revenue.""

Mr Sills is aware, with current volatility in both grain and input prices, that having bought most of his inputs without selling a lot of the output raises the chances of a big mismatch.

""We will need to check where our limits are to avoid unacceptable risk.""

He is less concerned about trying to tailor N inputs to the nearest kg.

""It's annoying, but the N response is both flat and has an optimum that is difficult to predict beforehand. It's easy to fall into the trap of being exactly wrong rather than approximately right.""

Instead, he's looking at low-tech ways of improving efficiency, but where he can be more confident of a positive impact. One such example is blocking off holes in the fertiliser nozzles to avoid applying fertiliser to tramlines.

""This has probably saved a few percent - perhaps 3% in the best case of our overall fertiliser use, which given current prices is at least worth an hour with some superglue.""

Scotland

Amy Geddes, Angus

Liquid fertiliser tanks are leased from Yara, which limits purchasing options.

But with supply not guaranteed for last spring, Amy Geddes bought some urea at £708/t and polysulphate, which ultimately was not needed after the Yara liquid N25+S and N35 was delivered.

© Amy Gedes

""So we've got that urea to use, and it is in the fertiliser plan for coming season,"" Mrs Geddes says.

That plan involves melting it with the help of an experienced neighbour and using it as the second application on wheat, with liquid N25+S - mostly bought at £573/cu m - used for the initial application.

""It's going to be a different season for us, and will require a bit more attention to detail as a new experience. But if it is successful, it might be something we continue with.

""Our feeling is the market might move towards urea rather than ammonium nitrates, so if it is easy to manage, better value and the result's consistent then it might be a transition for us.""

Mrs Geddes uses a simple, home-produced Excel nutrient planning tool, which uses soil analyses every five years and cropping information to build a balance-sheet approach and help guide applications within the nitrate vulnerable zone they farm in.

""Using that, I feel confident we are applying what the crop needs based on solid evidence, and the yield results have been consistent. So I think what will influence applications this season will be the wheat price.""

So far, none of the wheat for the coming season has been sold following historical practice, although Mrs Geddes is not averse to changing that in future.

South West

Emma Foot, Dorset

Nitrogen management has taken a much more complicated turn this season for Emma Foot, with the publication of Environment Agency targets for maximum nutrient losses across the farm, as part of the plan to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus loading in Poole Harbour catchment.

Nitrogen losses across the farm must be no higher than 18.1kg/ha/year from this year, with two tools - a nitrate leaching tool (NLT) and agricultural compliance tool (ACT) - provided to help calculate nutrient losses and ensure compliance with existing regulations.

Using the nitrate leaching tool, at least initially, is not straightforward, Miss Foot says. ""There's an 80-page guide to explain how to use it.""

A training session run by Catchment Sensitive Farming has helped, with tips on using soil samples to calculate soil nitrogen supply rather than the calculated values likely to be followed.

A decision, once the final loss figure has been calculated, will be made about further mitigations or whether to join a scheme with a defined path to meeting the targets by 2030, costing £150/year.

The farm uses overwinter phacelia, clover and buckwheat cover crops for their nutrient holding ability before all spring crops, and bought protected 46% N urea for this season at £804/t, which will also reduce risk.

Miss Foot also bought Nitram (£630/t) and is trying liquid 24N+S (£517/t) for the first time this season, after good performance on two neighbouring farms.

""We're about half liquid, half granules this season. It will also give us extra capacity to apply when the weather is good.""

West

Mark Wood, Herefordshire

Ammonium nitrate for the coming season has cost between £1.83-£2.08/kg, topped up with unprotected urea at £1.64/kg - like many others, easily the highest prices he has ever paid.

© Richard Stanton

The urea will be used as the initial application in February, which lessens the need to use protected product.

With dry springs in recent years, Mr Wood has increased the dose of that application on wheat to 60kgN/ha from 30kg N/ha, balancing building biomass with lodging risk.

He is budgeting on using up to 180kg N/ha on his wheat - that's less than the 200kg N/ha typically used on the crop about three seasons ago, but potentially slightly more than the 170-175kg N/ha used last year.

""We will target where is good and where is bad rather than do a blanket treatment across all fields.

""So if something doesn't have the potential, we will cut our losses and pull back, whereas if some of our heavier ground is looking great, we can up that.""

Potential is judged by eye rather than using any tools, while in-field, variable-rate applications of nitrogen have been nullified by using variable-rate seed and are no longer used.

Foliar N worked well last season in the extremely dry conditions for the later application. ""We found the crop did stay greener and I'm not sure if we had put solid N on in early May we would have seen the same benefits.

""If we do hit these dry times, it's the right way to get nitrogen into the crop, so protecting that supply for this season was important to us. But I have an open mind and we will probably do a field trial this season to check it.""

Northern Ireland

Simon Best, County Armagh

Granular 46% urea, which will be dissolved on farm to apply as a liquid, was bought by Simon Best for £780/t in August.

That should meet at least 90% of his nitrogen requirements for the season, but 85% is more expensive than last year's average price.

© Steffan Hill

Last season, a mild winter meant crops were forward coming into the spring, with a lot of soil nitrogen carried through, which allowed him to cut N to 175kg N/ha from the traditionally applied 200-210kg N/ha.

""But I will only reduce N this year if the season allows, and the winter has been wet and colder, so crops aren't as forward. I'm budgeting on 185-190kg N/ha.

""I'll judge it as the season goes and could top this up as I don't want to compromise on yield and quality.""

A soil nutrient health scheme launched in Northern Ireland means the whole farm was soil sampled for organic matter, P, K and magnesium in January for free, as a condition for direct support payments.

He uses NovaCropControl sap analysis three or four times a season to understand, adjust and balance nutrient levels in the crop through the season.

""The philosophy is to manage everything in the crop so there are not any limiting factors and know that when we apply nitrogen it is going to be used efficiently by the crop. It's been productive for us.""

Research by Teagasc in Ireland that shows a lower amount of N than suggested by RB209 is required for milling oats. ""It's more like 125 kgN/ha rather than 160kg N/ha,"" he says.

""We've been at that level for a while, which helps prevent lodging to protect quality, but it's hard to come back much further.""

South East

Doug Wanstall, Kent

Doug Wanstall has been developing multiple methods of creating his own fertiliser and crop nutrition on the farm, which is minimising his bagged fertiliser requirements in his regenerative system.

© MAG

Mr Wanstall is hopeful that next year he might not need to buy any synthetic fertiliser.

This year, he bought sufficient bagged N to apply 40kg N/ha to his wheat, and another 40kg N/ha of foliar nitrogen, which is equivalent to about 80kg N/ha out of a bag.

Last year, the maximum he applied was 120kg N/ha, resulting in above-average yields, but a failure to make milling quality.

""We're not growing specifically for milling now. There's a distillery on farm, so we're growing blends and some heritage grains for them for a premium.""

Growing lucerne in the rotation provided 60-70kg N/ha residual nitrogen in the soil last season, with soil tests ongoing to confirm supply this spring.

Compost to feed soil biology is applied in the autumn with a second application likely on one field of second wheat.

Mr Wanstall is also experimenting with fermented fish products that will supply amino acids and a carbon source to the plants and soil biology, and insect frass fertiliser.

He has neither in the quantity required for the whole farm this spring, but will trial on individual fields, while scaling up production of both for next season.

This year, he bought sufficient bagged N to apply 40kg N/ha to his wheat, and another 40kg N/ha of foliar nitrogen, which is equivalent to about 80kg N/ha out of a bag.

Last year, the maximum he applied was 120kg N/ha, resulting in above-average yields, but a failure to make milling quality.

""We're not growing specifically for milling now. There's a distillery on farm, so we're growing blends and some heritage grains for them for a premium.""

Growing lucerne in the rotation provided 60-70kg N/ha residual nitrogen in the soil last season, with soil tests ongoing to confirm supply this spring.

Compost to feed soil biology is applied in the autumn with a second application likely on one field of second wheat.

Mr Wanstall is also experimenting with fermented fish products that will supply amino acids and a carbon source to the plants and soil biology, and insect frass fertiliser.

He has neither in the quantity required for the whole farm this spring, but will trial on individual fields, while scaling up production of both for next season.

Last season, many growers bought fertiliser, or at least a proportion of it, before the prices rocketed in September 2021.

With high commodity prices following, it meant, in the end, there was little incentive to cut fertiliser applications.

This season looks different.

Unless some nitrogen (N) was saved from last season, or you have alternative sources, most will have had to pay more for N than ever before.

This is being coupled with, currently, a wheat grain market that fell to an 11-month low of £223/t in late January.

So, how are farmers reacting?

North

James Pick, North Yorkshire

Aiming to reduce synthetic nitrogen requirements is standard policy on James Pick's family farm as they transition towards a regenerative style of farming.

He cut last season's nitrogen - bought well in advance for £180/t - by about 10% across the farm and is planning to further reduce applied N this season.

© James Pick

This year's N has been bought at £700/t, with another lorry load still to purchase, but price isn't a factor in the policy.

""Historically, we've applied about 200-210kg N/ha in wheat. Last year, we were between 156kg N/ha and 190kg N/ha, and this year I expect some fields will be down to 130kg N/ha.""

The reduction has been primarily towards the end of the season, with the first two applications standard rates.

""We then use Yara's N Tester to assess the crop, look at soil conditions, weather forecast and judge our yield potential to base the last two applications off.""

While the first application will be bagged N and the second liquid N, the last two applications on a proportion of the farm are likely to be foliar nitrogen made on farm by melting urea to a concentration of 5%.

""Some research says foliar N can be up to seven times more efficient than soil applied. I'm not sure it is quite as high as that, but it could be 2.5 to three times more, so it's really utilising what we have on the farm,"" he says.

Underpinning the reductions is wide use of organic manures and compost across the farm.

Around three-quarters of the potato area receives farmyard manure

From last year half of the arable area will receive application of 10t/ha composted manure, having previously had farmyard manure.

Midlands

Will Oliver, Leicestershire

About 160t of fertiliser bought at £274/t ahead of last season, plus poultry muck and digestate from the broiler business and sewage sludge, has left Will Oliver in a place where he feels confident to push to produce 1,000t of Skyfall milling wheat this season.

© Tim Scrivener

""With milling wheat premiums where they are, and domestic feed wheat demand falling with pigs and poultry struggling, I think the opportunity to grow milling quality is too good to dismiss.""

Poultry muck applied at 6t/ha accounts for about one-third of his N requirements in wheat and will be applied, weather permitting, as the second application to wheat, following ammonium nitrate or ammonium sulphate as the initial top dressing.

""If I think the crop needs the N, I'll go ammonium nitrate, which I'll do this year as we've got some later sown crops that I will want to get growing.""

Fertiliser bought at £630/t has been purchased as a back-up plan in case it is too wet to spread organic manures.

""We're on 36m tramlines but spread digestate and poultry muck at 18m so we don't want to make a mess. But if conditions are right, you can do it, and a week later you don't know you've been there.""

How the crop reacts to the organic manures will then dictate when and how a third and sometimes fourth dose of N is applied, he says. An N tester is used to help with decision-making.

""It gives an index number relative to the situation, and what it thinks you need to apply to reach your target end market. I use it as a guide.""

On the milling wheat last year, he also applied a foliar, slow-release N product MZ28, which is supposed to replace about 50kg N/ha.

""We did a tramline trial and there was no difference in yield despite applying 50kg N/ha less, and the proteins were fine.""

East Anglia

James Sills, Essex/Suffolk border

Most of James Sills' nitrogen requirements were purchased ahead of the season, with, for the first time, a proportion of a granular urea sulphur compound part of the mix.

""While spread quality and overlaps are a concern, the price discount to liquid urea ammonium nitrate was too large to ignore last summer,"" he says. ""We prefer the accuracy of liquid so hope this will be a one-off.""

Wheat has established on the farm without any major limitations, meaning there is good potential.

Ultimately, the total dose of N applied to his hard feed wheats Champion, Gleam and Dawsum will be determined by any abnormal spring weather at the time of the final application and the cost of the additional purchased N required for it, which will be made this spring.

""It's important to distinguish between the average and marginal price of N when determining total N dose,"" he suggests.

""The price I've paid for the initial 125kg N/ha is immaterial to the decision about how much additional N to purchase.

""What's more important is I've made the decision of when to buy, to buy more until the marginal cost of that additional unit of N roughly equals the marginal revenue.""

Mr Sills is aware, with current volatility in both grain and input prices, that having bought most of his inputs without selling a lot of the output raises the chances of a big mismatch.

""We will need to check where our limits are to avoid unacceptable risk.""

He is less concerned about trying to tailor N inputs to the nearest kg.

""It's annoying, but the N response is both flat and has an optimum that is difficult to predict beforehand. It's easy to fall into the trap of being exactly wrong rather than approximately right.""

Instead, he's looking at low-tech ways of improving efficiency, but where he can be more confident of a positive impact. One such example is blocking off holes in the fertiliser nozzles to avoid applying fertiliser to tramlines.

""This has probably saved a few percent - perhaps 3% in the best case of our overall fertiliser use, which given current prices is at least worth an hour with some superglue.""

Scotland

Amy Geddes, Angus

Liquid fertiliser tanks are leased from Yara, which limits purchasing options.

But with supply not guaranteed for last spring, Amy Geddes bought some urea at £708/t and polysulphate, which ultimately was not needed after the Yara liquid N25+S and N35 was delivered.

© Amy Gedes

""So we've got that urea to use, and it is in the fertiliser plan for coming season,"" Mrs Geddes says.

That plan involves melting it with the help of an experienced neighbour and using it as the second application on wheat, with liquid N25+S - mostly bought at £573/cu m - used for the initial application.

""It's going to be a different season for us, and will require a bit more attention to detail as a new experience. But if it is successful, it might be something we continue with.

""Our feeling is the market might move towards urea rather than ammonium nitrates, so if it is easy to manage, better value and the result's consistent then it might be a transition for us.""

Mrs Geddes uses a simple, home-produced Excel nutrient planning tool, which uses soil analyses every five years and cropping information to build a balance-sheet approach and help guide applications within the nitrate vulnerable zone they farm in.

""Using that, I feel confident we are applying what the crop needs based on solid evidence, and the yield results have been consistent. So I think what will influence applications this season will be the wheat price.""

So far, none of the wheat for the coming season has been sold following historical practice, although Mrs Geddes is not averse to changing that in future.

South West

Emma Foot, Dorset

Nitrogen management has taken a much more complicated turn this season for Emma Foot, with the publication of Environment Agency targets for maximum nutrient losses across the farm, as part of the plan to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus loading in Poole Harbour catchment.

Nitrogen losses across the farm must be no higher than 18.1kg/ha/year from this year, with two tools - a nitrate leaching tool (NLT) and agricultural compliance tool (ACT) - provided to help calculate nutrient losses and ensure compliance with existing regulations.

Using the nitrate leaching tool, at least initially, is not straightforward, Miss Foot says. ""There's an 80-page guide to explain how to use it.""

A training session run by Catchment Sensitive Farming has helped, with tips on using soil samples to calculate soil nitrogen supply rather than the calculated values likely to be followed.

A decision, once the final loss figure has been calculated, will be made about further mitigations or whether to join a scheme with a defined path to meeting the targets by 2030, costing £150/year.

The farm uses overwinter phacelia, clover and buckwheat cover crops for their nutrient holding ability before all spring crops, and bought protected 46% N urea for this season at £804/t, which will also reduce risk.

Miss Foot also bought Nitram (£630/t) and is trying liquid 24N+S (£517/t) for the first time this season, after good performance on two neighbouring farms.

""We're about half liquid, half granules this season. It will also give us extra capacity to apply when the weather is good.""

West

Mark Wood, Herefordshire

Ammonium nitrate for the coming season has cost between £1.83-£2.08/kg, topped up with unprotected urea at £1.64/kg - like many others, easily the highest prices he has ever paid.

© Richard Stanton

The urea will be used as the initial application in February, which lessens the need to use protected product.

With dry springs in recent years, Mr Wood has increased the dose of that application on wheat to 60kgN/ha from 30kg N/ha, balancing building biomass with lodging risk.

He is budgeting on using up to 180kg N/ha on his wheat - that's less than the 200kg N/ha typically used on the crop about three seasons ago, but potentially slightly more than the 170-175kg N/ha used last year.

""We will target where is good and where is bad rather than do a blanket treatment across all fields.

""So if something doesn't have the potential, we will cut our losses and pull back, whereas if some of our heavier ground is looking great, we can up that.""

Potential is judged by eye rather than using any tools, while in-field, variable-rate applications of nitrogen have been nullified by using variable-rate seed and are no longer used.

Foliar N worked well last season in the extremely dry conditions for the later application. ""We found the crop did stay greener and I'm not sure if we had put solid N on in early May we would have seen the same benefits.

""If we do hit these dry times, it's the right way to get nitrogen into the crop, so protecting that supply for this season was important to us. But I have an open mind and we will probably do a field trial this season to check it.""

Northern Ireland

Simon Best, County Armagh

Granular 46% urea, which will be dissolved on farm to apply as a liquid, was bought by Simon Best for £780/t in August.

That should meet at least 90% of his nitrogen requirements for the season, but 85% is more expensive than last year's average price.

© Steffan Hill

Last season, a mild winter meant crops were forward coming into the spring, with a lot of soil nitrogen carried through, which allowed him to cut N to 175kg N/ha from the traditionally applied 200-210kg N/ha.

""But I will only reduce N this year if the season allows, and the winter has been wet and colder, so crops aren't as forward. I'm budgeting on 185-190kg N/ha.

""I'll judge it as the season goes and could top this up as I don't want to compromise on yield and quality.""

A soil nutrient health scheme launched in Northern Ireland means the whole farm was soil sampled for organic matter, P, K and magnesium in January for free, as a condition for direct support payments.

He uses NovaCropControl sap analysis three or four times a season to understand, adjust and balance nutrient levels in the crop through the season.

""The philosophy is to manage everything in the crop so there are not any limiting factors and know that when we apply nitrogen it is going to be used efficiently by the crop. It's been productive for us.""

Research by Teagasc in Ireland that shows a lower amount of N than suggested by RB209 is required for milling oats. ""It's more like 125 kgN/ha rather than 160kg N/ha,"" he says.

""We've been at that level for a while, which helps prevent lodging to protect quality, but it's hard to come back much further.""

South East

Doug Wanstall, Kent

Doug Wanstall has been developing multiple methods of creating his own fertiliser and crop nutrition on the farm, which is minimising his bagged fertiliser requirements in his regenerative system.

Mr Wanstall is hopeful that next year he might not need to buy any synthetic fertiliser.

This year, he bought sufficient bagged N to apply 40kg N/ha to his wheat, and another 40kg N/ha of foliar nitrogen, which is equivalent to about 80kg N/ha out of a bag.

Both Corteva and Syngenta are offering growers biological products aimed at fixing nitrogen from the air for crops to use.

While both can help farmers raise yields or trim their nitrogen fertiliser rates, a key difference is that Nuello iN from Syngenta is a seed treatment and Corteva's BlueN is a foliar product applied at growth stage 32.

See also: How six farmers hope to earn regen farming premium

We take a look at what they are and how farmers can benefit from their use next season.

Syngenta

Formerly known as Tiros, Syngenta has exclusive rights to market Nuello iN in north-west Europe and has spent the past two seasons trialing it, which reveal a number of benefits.

Dr Jonathan Ronksley, Syngenta's field technical manager, says biological products can have a role in helping farmers reduce their carbon footprint.

Artificial fertiliser is made using a very energy-intense process, but endophyte bacteria fix nitrogen from the air.

One key feature of Syngenta's product is that the endophyte bacteria are applied as a seed treatment, which has been proven to fix nitrogen in US trials.

Recommended for use in winter wheat and barley, Jonathan says it contains a mix of two endophyte bacteria - Pseudomonas siliginos and Curtobacterium salicaceae.

The bacteria were discovered in giant poplar and willow trees along the nutrient-poor river banks of the Washington State mountains.

They were responsible for fixing up to 65% of the nitrogen to these giant trees.

Once drilled, the bacteria enter the roots and colonise the rooting system and leaves.

They remain in the plant, fixing nitrogen for the rest of the season.

Replicated winter wheat nitrogen response trials in 2022 demonstrated an average benefit equivalent to 30kg/ha extra N.

So how can farmers use this benefit? Jonathan believes there are three situations:

Jonathan says it is also a good insurance policy for when dry conditions result in fertiliser sitting on the soil surface and not being taken up by the plant.

He points to a trial last year near Newark looking at winter wheat and hybrid barley.

Half was applied in April, but the prills sat on the surface and were not taken up until May, after the rain. He saw a 0.5t/ha yield boost in wheat and 0.3t/ha extra in barley.

In Adas trials, researchers adopted a fertiliser-saving approach over 15 split fields.

Despite reducing nitrogen by 30kg/ha, the yield was unchanged at 10.83t/ha versus 10.80t/ha. This gave a return on investment of 3:1.

Corteva

Making its debut at Cereals, BlueN is a biostimulant that contains the natural bacteria Methylobacterium symbioticum, which fixes nitrogen from the air for the plant to use.""‹

When sprayed on the crop, the bacteria enters the plant through the stomata and colonises inbetween the leaf cells, explains Corteva category manager John Sellars, who looks after company's biologicals portfolio.

The bacteria converts nitrogen gas into ammonium, resulting in a constant supply of nitrogen to the plant.

Overall, using the product equates to about 30kg/ha of N fertiliser, and John says farmers can either use it in addition to an existing fertiliser programme or to maintain yield when trimming back fertiliser rates.

However, trials show a yield benefit of about 1-2% when used with a fertiliser programme.

For sugar beet, he recommends going with a lower overall fertiliser programme to avoid high nitrate levels in the root.

In oilseed rape, although the optimal approach is for an autumn application, crops can lose leaves in a harsh winter.

So for the Midlands and North, John advises an early spring application instead.

The discovery of the first strain of potato blight that is resistant to a carboxylic acid amide fungicide has highlighted the need to use mixes and alternate between different ones in 2023 spray programmes.

One Scottish expert says it also underlines the need for near-market research such as the Fight Against Blight campaign, which has an uncertain future after the AHDB withdrawing from the potato sector.

On 6 January 2023, researchers from the University of Aarhus in Denmark released the results of a study on the disease.

It shows that five geographically diverse isolates sampled from Danish crops in 2022 and belonging to the genotype named EU_43_A1 were completely resistant to mandipropamid.

EU_43_A1 was first identified in Denmark in 2018 and subsequently accounted for 21% of samples in 2021 and 45% of samples in 2022.

Last year, it was also detected in the Netherlands and Belgium. And it is expected to spread to the UK.

So what does this mean for UK potato growers this season?

Mandipropamid, the active substance contained in Revus, is a member of the carboxylic acid amides (CAA) group, which also contains other actives used for protection against late blight. 

Cross-resistance

EU_43_A1 is the first strain of blight reported to have resistance to a CAA fungicide. Cross-resistance to others in the CAA fungicides group is likely, including dimethomorph, benthiavalicarb and valifenalate. 

This means that the finding has a bearing on 50% of fungicides used in a typical late blight programme during the season.

Eric Anderson, senior agronomist at Scottish Agronomy, says that while actives with different modes of action are still fully effective against late blight, it is critical that the over-reliance on a single substance does not exacerbate the likelihood of resistance developing to the remaining fungicides.

""Mixes of products from different mode of action groups are essential to protect crops and preserve the efficacy of these products for future seasons. Alternation between mixes is equally essential to prevent resistance developing."" 

Fungicide advice

Therefore, alternation and mixtures are required to be able to prevent and fight late blight and at the same time maintain the effect of the remaining modes of action.

For this reason, Mr Anderson says growers should avoid using products such as Shirlan, Ranman Top, Revus or Carial Flex without inclusion of another at an effective dose and belonging to an alternative mode of action.

Actives

Mr Anderson says while it's not surprising that the new resistant strain should first occur in Denmark given the limited products available to farmers, there are lessons still to be learned.

""It's a basic principle of integrated strategies that products containing only a single mode of action should be mixed before application to reduce the risks of resistance and preserve efficacy for future years.""

Mr Anderson says that UK growers are fortunate to have enough products to alternate between applications.

""In Denmark, there are fewer actives approved for late blight protection in potatoes, so it is perhaps not surprising that resistance has been detected to one,"" he says.

""It should serve as a warning to other growers of the risks that come when we apply selection pressure by over reliance on single products.""

He says the latest case is an exact repeat of what happened with fluazinam in 2016 and is another reason why near-market research of the sort undertaken by the Fight Against Blight is vital to sustaining the economic viability of the sector.

Fight against blight

Last season, the work by researchers at the James Hutton Institute continued thanks to funding from the Scottish government for the Fight Against Blight campaign.

But its future remains uncertain following the end of AHDB Potatoes operations last year.

Data from the Food and Environment Research Agency‘s Pesticide Usage Survey for 2020 - the last year in which potatoes were surveyed - reveals that almost 29,000kg of mandipropamid was applied.

This compares with nearly 25,000kg of cyazofamid, another widely used active substance valued for its role in the rapid crop canopy phase of the season and when crops need protecting against tuber blight.

A deployable vaccine and new diagnostic test to tackle bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in cattle herds has moved a step closer, according to the UK government.

Defra says field trials for its CattleBCG vaccine and the Detect Infected among Vaccinated Animals (Diva) skin test have moved to the next phase.

The second phase of the field trials will assess the safety of the vaccine and the safety and performance of the Diva test in vaccinated cattle.

See also: TB cattle vaccine on target for 2025 rollout says chief vet

Until now, laboratory studies have indicated that the vaccine and Diva test - which can distinguish between infected and vaccinated animals - are safe and that the test performs well, under controlled Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha) facility environments.

The field trials are taking place on commercial livestock farms across England and Wales and these are due to be completed in 2023.

Phase two will involve at least five farms with 600 animals participating, 300 of which will be vaccinated with CattleBCG, whilst the remaining half will receive a placebo. 

If the second phase is successful, Defra says it will be closer to being able to vaccinate cattle against this endemic disease.

‘Significant milestone’

Dr Phil Hogarth, Apha's lead scientist for TB said: ""This next step represents a significant milestone, building upon many years of research, and Apha will continue to be led by science, and work tirelessly in the fight to eradicate this disease.""

It is hoped that the combination of CattleBCG vaccine and the Diva test will be deployable in the next few years, as early as 2025, adding significant tools to those currently available. 

Wildlife campaigners hope the successful introduction of a cattle vaccine and Diva test could see the end of the government's controversial badger-culling policy in England.

The first phase of trials started in England in July 2021, which focused on the safety and performance of the Diva test in unvaccinated animals.

The test works by identifying proteins present in infected animals that are not present in vaccinated cows, allowing the cattle vaccine to be used alongside.

Performed on 10 farms with 524 participating animals, phase one was completed in May 2022 and analysis of the results is in progress. 

‘Substantial progress’

England, Scotland and Wales's chief veterinary officers said in a statement: ""We are making substantial progress in developing an additional tool to help eradicate this disease with the new cattle vaccine and Diva skin test - and are very grateful to the vets and farmers taking part for their efforts in making this work on the ground.

""If this next phase is successful, this project takes us one step closer to a vaccine to be used in conjunction with other measures to tackle this insidious disease, which impacts livestock farmers across the globe."" 

BTB is one of the most difficult and intractable animal health challenges that the UK faces today and costs taxpayers in England around £100m every year.

More than 38,000 cattle in England and Wales were slaughtered in 2021 to tackle the disease.

A new 3D app allows farmers to step inside a virtual reality calf house and see the features that are essential for rearing healthy calves.

The free app, called Optihouse, offers farmers two options: to build their own calf house, or tour houses modelled from real farms using 360deg movement and compare them with their own.

See also: Pros and cons of 5 dairy calf housing options

The technology was developed as part of a four-year research project in response to data showing an average mortality rate of 6% in UK dairy calves, with up to 40% suffering from pneumonia.

Housing essentials

Good ventilation, keeping young calves warm and dry, and ensuring consistently high levels of hygiene, were among the key findings of researchers who visited 66 farms across Northern Ireland.

""While most farmers are aware that calves need to be kept warm, there has never been a real understanding of what the environmental conditions are in Northern Irish calf houses,"" says senior research scientist and project manager Gillian Scoley.

“Obtaining this information has been key to seeing what improvements can be made to housing facilities for calves to thrive.""

Calves suffering ill health in early life can struggle with delayed growth, leading to delays in breeding, calving age and a depressed level of milk production, she adds.

See the new 3D app

Development of Optihouse

The app was developed by Belfast tech company Sentireal and involved a team of researchers from Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI) Hillsborough, Queen's University Belfast, the dairy advisory team at the College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise, and a group of international veterinary, academic and industry experts.

It was funded by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and led by the AFBI.

Farm facts

Fourth-generation young farmer Luke Conway has recently taken the reins of the family's 73ha farm, which he runs in partnership with his aunt and uncle.

After studying for a diploma in agriculture at Houghall College, he found his passion for farming and was set on improving the farmland to build a viable business and diversifications upon.

In the past five years, he has reintroduced cattle to the farm and has built a pumpkin patch business.

Establishing a herd

Luke says one of his proudest achievements to date has been establishing his own herd of cattle, reintroducing them to the farm after a 35-year absence.

He set out his criteria for the herd, knowing he wanted something that required little input and would calve easily outdoors.

""We don't have any shed space, so I knew I needed to pick a good hardy cattle breed,"" he explains.

After swiftly deciding on native breed Belted Galloways, Luke bought his first two cattle in 2018, and has since been breeding them to build up his herd numbers. He now has a herd of 23 cattle on the farm, including some Highlands that he picked up from another local farmer.

""The cattle are making good use of land that was out of work,"" he says. ""They are helping bring it back into high productivity.""

A longer-term goal is to establish a boxed beef business to sell the farm's produce direct to the consumer - something that Luke hopes to set up within the next year.

Pumpkin patch

One of the newest additions to the business is Kinley Hill Pumpkin Patch. Beginning last year, with the guidance of his Agrovista agronomist, Luke and his family planted 4,000 pumpkins by hand, nurturing and watering each plant with a watering can to ensure it survived last summer's drought.  

Something that had never been done on the farm, or in surrounding areas, Luke had faced a lot of adversity, but he was determined to see his vision through to completion.

The pumpkin patch was a huge success last year and attracted thousands of visitors to the farm throughout October.

This year, Luke has scaled up the patch, and is currently growing 9,000 plants, each planted by hand, with several different varieties. To make watering easier this year, Luke extensively researched, and installed, a new irrigation system to keep up with the extra volume of plants.

He is also growing a maize maze to go alongside the patch to create more of an attraction, so that visitors to the farm can have a family day out.

Stewardship

Improving the farmland and environment has been another of Luke's priorities. He has entered the farm into a Mid Tier stewardship scheme to benefit both the wildlife and soil health, and has focused on parcels of land that have not grown crops for more than 20 years.

Admitting that removing roots and shrubs and ploughing was an extreme task, he says the overall benefits have been boundless.

He has also recently planted 4,000 new hedge plants as part of a stewardship scheme, replacing areas where they had become sparse, as well as coppicing where needed.

In the near future Luke hopes to construct a steel-framed shed to house the 500 bales of hay he makes each year, with one aim being to cut down on the amount of plastic he currently uses wrapping each bale to store ­outside. n

What the judges say:

Alongside embracing his passion by introducing cattle back to the farm, Luke saw a gap in the market for a local pumpkin patch and is exploring sustainable operations to bring land back into production.

Farm facts

Reuben Powell's interest in the broiler industry first piqued when he was studying for a diploma in agriculture at Walford and North Shropshire College.

Originally from a mixed livestock background, with cattle and sheep on his family's farm in Newbridge-on-Wye, he had no prior experience of the broiler sector, and subsequently found a job at a local unit to gain knowledge and begin looking into having his own setup.

Renewables

After taking on a 40ha site that his parents had bought in the early 2000s, Reuben went about the painstaking process of getting planning permission for his broiler unit.

Enlisting the help of a poultry business consultant and utilising Welsh farming grants, he was able to make decisions on every element of the new unit, including how it would be heated and ventilated.

With broiler farming being relatively power-hungry, made worse by the soaring energy prices seen in the spring of 2022, Reuben invested in an 80kW solar array for the roof of one of the sheds, and a further 150kW system to feed into 250kW of battery storage.

This accompanies a 480kW ground-source heating system.

While this was initially a daunting investment, Reuben hopes it will provide between 60-70% of the electricity needed to run the site, and will also ensure that the meat is produced using 100% renewable heat, which should appeal to more climate-­conscious consumers.

High standards

After introducing the first chicks in October 2020, Reuben's keen eye for detail and focus on high welfare has already paid off.

Last year he was awarded a prestigious Aviagen Ross 420 Gold Award.

To qualify, producers must have three consecutive crops with an EPEF score of 420 or above - something that Reuben has maintained for five consecutive crops.

Gold award winners are considered to be in the top 1% of broiler farmers in the UK, which Reuben says is hugely gratifying after the work and focus he has channelled into bird welfare and business results.

Family affair

When the Covid-19 pandemic hit and agricultural shows across the country were forced to close, Reuben's family's longstanding diversification, the Welsh Sheeptacular, also closed its doors.

Run by his uncle Clive, the showcase of 20 different breeds of sheep and a demonstration of shearing had been a huge part of Reuben's childhood, and one he was reluctant to let go.

""It was always something I was proud of and looked forward to each summer, giving people an insight to the sheep industry and a brief education on why we do what we do, year on year,"" says Reuben.

When life slowly began to return to normal after the pandemic, Reuben approached his uncle and agreed to revive the Sheeptacular, taking on the organisation and running, and immediately needing to source rams from 20 different breeds.

""This was no mean feat, because I'd missed the autumn ram sale season,"" he says.

Under Reuben's guidance, the Sheeptacular returned to the Royal Welsh Show in 2022.

While he freely admits it is a labour of love, Reuben has created a social media account and has set about boosting the profile of the display, and hopes to book three or four events each year to raise public awareness and interest in the sheep industry and promote Welsh agriculture.

What the judges say:

Reuben was willing to take the risk of a substantial investment in the poultry unit to develop a profitable business. Alongside this, he has taken on the Welsh Sheeptacular, showcasing the industry to the public.

Hannah Reddaway

Tuckenhay Farm, Devon

Hannah Reddaway, Young Farmer of the Year 2023 finalist © Emily Fleur

Farm facts

Hannah Reddaway grew up on her family's dairy, beef and arable farm in south Devon, but after studying for a degree in civil and structural engineering at the University of Sheffield, she went on to work as a chartered structural engineer in London for five years.

Admitting that working in agriculture was never a part of her plan, Hannah says she returned to the family farm when the pandemic struck, to work alongside her father and brother, while maintaining her engineering work on a part-time and remote basis.

Diversification

After learning the ropes on the family farm and spending time lambing with a neighbour, Hannah had the confidence to build up her own flock.

On land that she rents from her parents and a neighbour, she set about establishing a flock of 200 breeding ewes, and, after attending a talk by the Royal Countryside Fund, was inspired to diversify and safeguard the farm throughout the BPS transition period.

Her flock is at the heart of her meat box business - Tuckenhay Farm - but she is also keen to ensure that the business blends seamlessly with the beef and dairy enterprises run by her father and brother. 

Learning the business

Using her business knowledge to secure local grant funding, Hannah set about taking courses in butchery and food hygiene, and used remaining funds for marketing, creating a website, and purchasing a commercial refrigerator.

She rents a small studio in one of the farm's outbuildings and has established a premises from which she sells beef, from cattle that she purchases from her father, along with lamb and mutton directly from the farm.

""I'd never started a business on my own before,"" Hannah admits, ""so there have been a lot of different elements to learn about.""

Hannah's boxed meat business has created a direct route to market for the family farm, and enables her to supply the local community and beyond, capitalising on the number of tourists visiting the area during the summer. 

She says the business model allows her greater flexibility to meet customer needs, while also being able to reach a price point that is mutually agreeable as she sells products ranging from individual cuts through to a whole lamb.

Customers have the option of collecting their orders from the farm, while Hannah also makes deliveries herself throughout south and east Devon.  

Future expansion

Now that the business is established, Hannah hopes to expand her flock numbers and introduce more native breeds of sheep and cattle, such as Grey Faced Dartmoors and Aberdeen Angus, both of which should thrive on the farm's grassland.

""I'd also like to be able to promote the use of the whole animal,"" she says. ""But this will come in time, with me being able to do the butchery myself and have more control over the process.""

She is also moving more towards organic processes and farming sustainably.

""I'd like to expand the farm business into camping and farm tours,"" she says. ""Promoting the agricultural industry is really important to me, and these ventures will give people from outside the industry an insight and offer unique experiences to customers while contributing positively to the environment.""

Hannah has also just bought a sheepdog, and has been training her using videos from Emma Grey's Sheepdog School.

What the judges say:

Hannah has achieved a lot in a short amount of time. She has developed her own business, using a variety of routes to market, and is keen to explore other diversifications to maximise future opportunities.

This week, the Red Tractor farm assurance scheme is embroiled in controversy after asking farmers to measure their carbon footprint.

Farmers say the ‘green commitment’ proposal will mean more expense and red tape - and the only real winners will be supermarkets.

Red Tractor bosses say the alternative is even greater costs as supply chains are told to demonstrate their environmental credentials.

But the National Farmers Union says farmers should have been properly consulted on the proposal, which will mean higher costs. Who is right?

As a devastating bluetongue outbreak engulfs almost 2,000 sheep farms in the Netherlands, we ask: how long before it reaches the UK?

New research shows how farmers can successfully tackle the growing problem of free-living nematodes, and the subsequent spraing damage to tubers when they transmit tobacco rattle virus.

Tobacco rattle virus leads to brown streaks (known as spraing) inside tubers, as well as surface lesions and malformations.

It can prove costly for growers, as potato crops with spraing symptoms can be rejected for sale.

Trials undertaken by agronomy and root crop research specialist Produce Solutions have shown a 160% increase in the proportion of tubers that meet processing standards with a key nematicide used at the label rate.

In a field trial looking at a commercial crop of Pentland Dell on a high-risk site in Shropshire, less than 24% of harvested tubers from untreated areas hit the grading acceptability for a processor, compared with more than 60% meeting the specification with the nematicide Nemathorin (fosthiazate).  

Tuber assessments ranked 56% of untreated area tubers in the more severely damaged categories, with over 12.5% of surface area affected by spraing symptoms, says Produce Solutions’ team lead, James Lee.

That compared with just 8% of treated tubers exceeding 12.5% of damage, and zero in the highest damage category of 50% surface area affected.

Increasing problem

Syngenta technical manager Andy Cunningham says that the change in climate has led to increased free-living nematode activity in recent seasons.

The nematodes move more easily in a film of soil moisture between soil particles. Lighter sandy soils, favoured for potato cropping, are the most susceptible in a wet early spring season after planting.

Furthermore, stubby root nematodes can proliferate on some plants in green cover crops.

Therefore, new generations of nematodes can pick up tobacco rattle virus from specific host weed species and have the potential to infect through any rotational break.

Tubers are most susceptible to more damaging effects of spraing from early tobacco rattle virus infection, he says.

""Nemathorin can effectively protect the crop by paralysing nematodes for long enough to reduce initial tobacco rattle virus infection and for crops to develop past the danger period,"" he adds.   

The Shropshire site was specifically selected for its history of free-living nematodes.

Pre-trial testing revealed a population of 433 stubby root nematodes in each litre of soil, including the nematode species Trichodorus and Paratrichodorus, most widely associated with spraing.

Testing also showed the free-living nematodes to be carrying tobacco rattle virus.

Researchers at the University of Nottingham have discovered a protein in plant roots which optimises nutrient uptake and could be engineered to make crops tolerant to drought and less reliant on artificial fertilisers.

The team of scientists identified new dirigent (""directing"") proteins in the endodermis of plant roots that regulate the uptake of nutrients and water from the soil.

See also: Grower reveals yield and margin data from intercropping trial

Dr Gabriel Castrillo, a researcher at the University of Nottingham's School of Biosciences, explains that the discovery shows how plant roots regulate their uptake of water and nutrients through the deposition of lignin, which is regulated by dirigent proteins.

""Without these proteins, proper root sealing is not completed and the nutrient balance in the plant is compromised,"" Gabriel says.

""We can use this knowledge to engineer plants to be able to grow with less water and chemical fertilisers.""

Correct balance of soil nutrients

Plant roots function by absorbing mineral nutrients and water from the soil via a specialised layer of tissue known as the endodermis.

An impermeable barrier composed of lignin blocks the uncontrolled movement of material into the root by forming a tight seal between cells and ensures the endodermis is the only root entry for nutrients and water.

Dirigent proteins were found to work with other root regulatory components to deposit lignin in the endodermis, allowing the plant to ensure it receives the correct balance of soil nutrients.

Gabriel says: ""It is ever more important to understand the mechanisms of plants, so we can future-proof them to secure future food supplies.""

781,"Scab data show seriousness of problem for NI ","https://www.fwi.co.uk/livestock/health-welfare/scab-data-show-seriousness-of-problem-for-ni","Scab data show seriousness of problem for NI 

Results of a Northern Irish sheep scab project have sparked concern after 75% of surveyed farms tested positive for the costly disease.

The alarming figure relates to 80 farms involved in the £220,000 Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland initiative co-ordinated by the Northern Ireland Sheep Scab group.

See also: Two lamb castration methods that put focus on animal welfare

Key points

However, vets have stressed that the proportion of farms suffering from the disease was expected to be high, because those taking part in the project anticipated finding an ectoparasite of some kind in their flock.

Sheep scab expert and project lead Stewart Burgess of the Moredun Institute said: ""The level of responses to tests on blood samples from sheep in NI indicates that some flocks may have been infested with sheep scab mites for a prolonged period and that a high percentage of animals in these flocks are likely to have been infested.

""This unexpected level of ongoing infection to a wide extent in some flocks means that there is significant potential for local and onward spread of the disease.""

Scab facts

Department criticised

Farmers have been advised to seek veterinary advice as early as possible if they suspect scab in their flocks, to reduce having to deal with the disease in lambs as well as ewes.

Voicing frustration, one farmer said: ""Live markets see a lot of itchy sheep sold through them and nobody seems to be bothering, including the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera).

""There is a lack of dipping courses available, hence the reason I opted for injectables and not dip. Although, if I was to do it again, I would dip and get a contractor in, but hopefully next year is better.""

A Daera spokesman said that disease prevention, detection and eradication was among Daera's ""primary objectives"".

The spokesman added: ""Sheep scab is a notifiable disease in Northern Ireland and cases must be reported to Daera under The Sheep Scab Order (NI) 1970.

""Officials keep control of the disease under review in partnership with industry stakeholders, affected flock keepers, and through co-operation with our colleagues in Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland.""

Trading issues

National Sheep Association regional development officer Edward Adamson said some smaller businesses, which were common in Northern Ireland, were dependent on buying, feeding, improving, and selling sheep into a rising market as an income stream.

""Stock are moving about so much over here, it's just the way it's been traditionally,"" said Mr Adamson.

""It's difficult to point the finger at anybody. It's a good scheme and ultimately, we hope to eradicate scab one day.""

Sheep scab surveillance project details

Under-reported

Vet Paul Crawford, Northern Ireland Sheep Scab group chair, said despite being a notifiable disease in the province, a lot of sheep scab goes under the radar.

""We have been lagging behind the rest of the UK in both research and piloting control strategies for decades,"" said Mr Crawford. ""We hope this project will act as a catalyst for change.""

He said just nine cases of sheep scab were confirmed by Daera between 2016 and 2021, from 29 investigations.

This was one of the findings of his 2021 doctorate Sheep scab in Northern Ireland: its distribution, cost and farmer knowledge about prevention and control.

The paper, published in Preventative Veterinary Medicine, featured a survey that found the following from 122 respondents:

About Biodiversity

This October, join Farmers Weekly live for a look at biodiversity net gain agreements. Our expert panel will discuss where potential income can be found and the issues to watch out for.

From November 2023 there will be a legal obligation for developers to increase the biodiversity on their sites by at least 10%, known as biodiversity net gain (BNG).

It will often not be possible to achieve this on the building site itself, so farmers and landowners are already being approached by developers looking for additional land to help them meet this.

There will be payments for biodiversity units and long-term agreements for managing the BNG land.

There are many considerations, not only the legal and tax implications but also the impact on the long-term future of a land holding.

Discussion will include:

Refreshments will be available throughout the day and lunch will also be provided.

Farming unions have raised serious concerns after EU member states failed to reach agreement on an EU Commission proposal to renew the licence for glyphosate for 10 years.

EU member states voted on whether to renew the herbicide's licence on Friday 13 October through the Standing Committee on Plant, Animal, Food and Feed (Scopaff).

But the vote failed to reach a qualified majority of 15 countries, representing at least 65% of the bloc's population, which is needed to either support or reject the proposal. France, Germany and the Netherlands were among six countries that abstained.

See also: Efsa glyphosate review finds ""˜no critical areas of concern'

A second vote will be held in the first half of November and if it too fails to reach a clear decision, the decision will be left with the commission.

A decision on the future of glyphosate is needed before its EU licence expires on 15 December.

The commission's recommendation to extend glyphosate's EU licence to 2033 follows a three-year risk assessment and peer review which was carried out by the European Food Safety Authority (Efsa) and the European Chemicals Agency.

""˜No health risk' - Efsa

Efsa found that there were ""no critical areas of concern"" around glyphosate and the world's most widely used herbicide did not pose ""unacceptable"" risks to human health.

A spokesman for Bayer, the manufacturer, said: ""Bayer remains hopeful that at the next step in the approval process, sufficient additional member states will support the renewal of the approval of glyphosate. 

""Glyphosate remains a critical tool for farmers to establish crops and manage weeds sustainably and economically while the positive conclusions of Efsa regarding safety confirm it can be safely used."" 

Commenting on Friday's vote, the NFU pointed out that Efsa's study was based on 11,000 pages of evidence and completed by independent regulatory experts.

NFU vice-president David Exwood said: ""Glyphosate has long been one of those essential products to control weeds before planting and is vital due to the popularity of a regenerative, no-till or minimum-till approach - farm practices shown to be good for climate change mitigation, as well as decreasing soil erosion.

""Britain's farmers and growers will continue to use glyphosate as long as it is safe and legal to do so to ensure environmental sustainability and a secure supply of high-quality, affordable food.""

The Irish Farmers Association described the failure of member states to reach a qualified majority as ""very concerning for EU agriculture"".

However, anti-pesticides lobby group Pesticides Action Network Europe welcomed the decision.

A spokesman said: ""This is an important signal. It goes right to the concerns of a majority of Europeans about the impact of pesticides on health and environment."" 

Coffey pledge

Since Brexit, Great Britain is free to make independent decisions on pesticide approvals, while Northern Ireland must comply with EU law under the Northern Ireland Protocol.

Defra secretary Therese Coffey has promised British farmers will have continued access to glyphosate once the UK's post-Brexit pesticide regime is developed, describing it as ""critical for regenerative farming"".

But if Labour wins power at the next general election, it could choose to follow EU pesticide legislation more closely.

Hartpury College is set to receive almost £2.4m of government funding in order to purchase specialist equipment and facilities ahead of its new T-level course opening.

The Gloucestershire agricultural college will be launching new qualifications in land-based engineering, crop production, and livestock production from the 2024-2025 academic years.

It will use the Department of Education funding to refurbish engineering workshops and purchase new equipment.

See also: Is an agricultural degree worth doing?

T-levels are a technical qualification and form a new two-year post-GCSE study option, aimed at preparing students before they progress to skilled employment.

Students enrolling for the courses at Hartpury will spend 80% of their time in academic studies, while the remaining 20%, at least 45 days, will be spent undertaking practical work-based training each year.

The college has confirmed that further T-level courses in animal management and equine subject areas are in development.

Hartpury deputy principal Claire Whitworth said the college was grateful for its share in the government’s £100m national funding scheme.

She said: ""We're always looking to align our curriculum with industry needs, and remain poised to contribute to the growth and success of the agricultural sector in Gloucestershire and beyond.

“We're grateful for the government's recognition of our expertise and commitment to advancing vocational training and are delighted to have been successful in securing a share of this UK-wide T-level investment funding.”

805,"Retrofit combine yield monitor provides low-cost crop data","https://www.fwi.co.uk/machinery/harvest-equipment/combines/retrofit-yield-monitor","Retrofit combine yield monitor provides low-cost crop data

From decision-making on crop dryer settings to variety choices for the next cropping year, there is value to be had in being able to quickly access and make use of yield stats harvested by the combine.

And whether you are running an elderly or basic-spec machine, or a modern model with all the bells and whistles, retrofit combine data collection technology and a cloud-based digital management platform can provide just that.

Bayer's FieldView, for example, aims to bring together data collected from various field operations, including harvesting grain and oilseeds, and make it readily available for analysis.

See also: Agronomist-built combine attachment helps monitor losses

As Max Dafforn, Bayer's digital campaign manager for FieldView, explains: ""A lot of farmers collect harvest data on a memory stick in the combine cab but that's where it stays - at least until after the rush to get cultivations and drilling done.

""It just means the opportunity to evaluate and make decisions based on the data is pushed further down the line, and so it loses value.""

Introduced three years ago in Britain, where it is available on a £300 a year subscription, FieldView is reckoned to be one of the most widely used digital farming platforms globally, covering some 80m hectares.

Max Dafforn © Bayer

It can be used to bring together data collected from tractors, sprayers, spreaders and drills, as well as combines, that are otherwise likely to be held in different locations and formats.

The key hardware item is FieldView Drive, a data-collection and transfer device priced at £280 that connects to an Apple iPad by Bluetooth.

On combines, it can be plugged into an existing yield mapping system and for harvesters without that resource a data gathering kit is available for around £4,400.

Reckoned to take around three hours to install, the Yield Kit comprises a GPS receiver for position and speed data, a moisture sensor and a mass flow sensor installed on the clean grain elevator to measure grain or seed volume, plus the wiring needed to connect to the Drive unit.

A FieldView cab app for the iPad - an Android version is in development - provides the means of inputting parameters such as the cutting width, a table height trigger to start and stop recording, and other related settings to achieve accurate yield calculations.

And because the system knows where the combine has cut thanks to the GPS signal, it can also take partial-width cuts into account at angled headlands and the like.

Field stats

With data points taken every second, the yield mapping process is detailed, and with a data connection, the iPad will stream to the cloud-based FieldView platform, enabling information to be accessed and viewed on a real-time basis remotely on a mobile phone.

""Spot yield and the average for the field are shown, along with an estimate of the time remaining to finish a field, which can be useful for organising moves to another location,"" explains Max.

""Real-time moisture content is also shown, and that can be helpful to whoever manages intake at the store if a change of moisture level needs a response in terms of dryer setting.""

In addition, users can opt for a text alert if the moisture level exceeds a particular value, and a daily harvesting progress report is available in PDF form.

Yield maps generated on the FieldView platform are purposely presented in raw data form rather than “prettified” by smoothing, and within the app, simply drawing around areas of interest with a finger enables users to see comparative yields.

""For example, users can select a red block indicating an area of lower-yielding crop and see by how much it falls short of the field average, or compare yields between individual passes of the combine,"" notes Max.

""That function also makes it quick and easy to explore on-farm trials of different varieties, which could influence choices for the following crop, and different strategies for nitrogen and other fertilisers, including variable versus flat rate applications.""

Moreover, in addition to its yield mapping role, the Drive unit can be plugged into the diagnostics port of a tractor's isobus system to capture data while drilling, applying fertiliser or spraying crop protection products to create records of these operations.

It also has a task manager function, creating variable-rate application maps for spreaders and sprayers, for example.

Case study: Cloud Farming, East Lothian

Grower Chris Leslie's summary of his experience of the FieldView Yield Kit is that it's easy to install, works seamlessly and provides useful data without having to spend hours in front of a computer.

The Cloud Farming business he operates with partners provides fellow farmers in south and central Scotland with strategy and agronomy advice, with a focus on regenerative farming solutions and soil management.

Grain storage and machinery resources are also supplied, including two New Holland CR combines for harvesting.

""We needed only the FieldView Drive unit for one of the combines because it already had a yield mapping system, but the other needed the full kit,"" recalls Chris.

The biggest problem is keeping the iPad charged because the app consumes a fair bit of power, he says, so a USB port was wired in to keep the single power outlet in the cab available for charging the operator's mobile phone.

""One thing that has impressed me is that when we're running both combines in the same crop, FieldView automatically populates the field record with data from both machines - you don't have to touch it,"" says Chris.

""Apart from gathering data for monitoring our own trials, such as different spray programmes, it's useful to be able to access information that can be used on the day.""

""One of our clients grows wheat, aiming for a milling premium, and malting barley, and by logging-in from the store he can monitor what's coming off the combine and be more selective about storage rather than putting everything in one big heap.

""For others, being able to access the tonnages coming in enables them to plan budgets at an early stage.""

Case study: Oxton Estate, Nottinghamshire

Richard Cross © Tim Scrivener

At the Oxton Estate, Southwell in Notts, estate manager Richard Cross has data captured by a FieldView Drive unit transferred into the Green Light Gower Management system to help with crop financial benchmarking.

His three years of records held in the FieldView platform itself will also be used to help define the next steps in the estate's environmental schedule and to create application maps for variable-rate granular and liquid fertiliser application.

Since the New Holland CR combine used to harvest wheat, barley and oilseed rape already had mapping resources, the only work needed was to create a connection into the canbus data streaming cable and plug in the Drive unit.

""The yield maps are very useful in the way you can alter the definition from coarse to fine, depending upon how much detail you want to see,"" explains Richard.

""Being on the estate many years means I know where there are issues with clay caps and the like, but the yield map defines those areas so we can create prescription maps for variable rate seeding, which we're planning to do this year, to hopefully bring the yield in those areas up to the rest of the field,"" he says.

Variable-rate prescriptions are already being created and used successfully for nitrogen application through a Chafer self-propelled sprayer using John Deere precision farming technology.

""The prescription map is created in FieldView, transferred to the MyJohnDeere platform, and then exported to the sprayer, so it's quite straightforward,"" says Richard.

Precision farming applications apart, there are practical benefits during harvest from being able to remotely access the FieldView Cab app, he adds.

""When I'm in the grain store, I can see exactly what's coming in and if the moisture content is changing by the trailer load, I can speed up or slow down the dryer ready for when it arrives,"" explains Richard.

""And I can see when the combine's scheduled to finish a field and get the header trailer in position ready for a move; some people say this is like spying on the operator, but he can see on the app display when I've connected and we still communicate by mobile phone.""

At the Oxton Estate, Southwell in Notts, estate manager Richard Cross has data captured by a FieldView Drive unit transferred into the Green Light Gower Management system to help with crop financial benchmarking.

His three years of records held in the FieldView platform itself will also be used to help define the next steps in the estate's environmental schedule and to create application maps for variable-rate granular and liquid fertiliser application.

Since the New Holland CR combine used to harvest wheat, barley and oilseed rape already had mapping resources, the only work needed was to create a connection into the canbus data streaming cable and plug in the Drive unit.

""The yield maps are very useful in the way you can alter the definition from coarse to fine, depending upon how much detail you want to see,"" explains Richard.

""Being on the estate many years means I know where there are issues with clay caps and the like, but the yield map defines those areas so we can create prescription maps for variable rate seeding, which we're planning to do this year, to hopefully bring the yield in those areas up to the rest of the field,"" he says.

Variable-rate prescriptions are already being created and used successfully for nitrogen application through a Chafer self-propelled sprayer using John Deere precision farming technology.

""The prescription map is created in FieldView, transferred to the MyJohnDeere platform, and then exported to the sprayer, so it's quite straightforward,"" says Richard.

Precision farming applications apart, there are practical benefits during harvest from being able to remotely access the FieldView Cab app, he adds.

""When I'm in the grain store, I can see exactly what's coming in and if the moisture content is changing by the trailer load, I can speed up or slow down the dryer ready for when it arrives,"" explains Richard.

""And I can see when the combine's scheduled to finish a field and get the header trailer in position ready for a move; some people say this is like spying on the operator, but he can see on the app display when I've connected and we still communicate by mobile phone.""

805,"","https://www.fwi.co.uk/machinery/harvest-equipment/combines/retrofit-yield-monitor","Retrofit combine yield monitor provides low-cost crop data

From decision-making on crop dryer settings to variety choices for the next cropping year, there is value to be had in being able to quickly access and make use of yield stats harvested by the combine.

And whether you are running an elderly or basic-spec machine, or a modern model with all the bells and whistles, retrofit combine data collection technology and a cloud-based digital management platform can provide just that.

Bayer's FieldView, for example, aims to bring together data collected from various field operations, including harvesting grain and oilseeds, and make it readily available for analysis.

As Max Dafforn, Bayer's digital campaign manager for FieldView, explains: ""A lot of farmers collect harvest data on a memory stick in the combine cab but that's where it stays - at least until after the rush to get cultivations and drilling done.

""It just means the opportunity to evaluate and make decisions based on the data is pushed further down the line, and so it loses value.""

Introduced three years ago in Britain, where it is available on a £300 a year subscription, FieldView is reckoned to be one of the most widely used digital farming platforms globally, covering some 80m hectares.

It can be used to bring together data collected from tractors, sprayers, spreaders and drills, as well as combines, that are otherwise likely to be held in different locations and formats.

The key hardware item is FieldView Drive, a data-collection and transfer device priced at £280 that connects to an Apple iPad by Bluetooth.

On combines, it can be plugged into an existing yield mapping system and for harvesters without that resource a data gathering kit is available for around £4,400.

Reckoned to take around three hours to install, the Yield Kit comprises a GPS receiver for position and speed data, a moisture sensor and a mass flow sensor installed on the clean grain elevator to measure grain or seed volume, plus the wiring needed to connect to the Drive unit.

A FieldView cab app for the iPad - an Android version is in development - provides the means of inputting parameters such as the cutting width, a table height trigger to start and stop recording, and other related settings to achieve accurate yield calculations.

And because the system knows where the combine has cut thanks to the GPS signal, it can also take partial-width cuts into account at angled headlands and the like.

Field stats

With data points taken every second, the yield mapping process is detailed, and with a data connection, the iPad will stream to the cloud-based FieldView platform, enabling information to be accessed and viewed on a real-time basis remotely on a mobile phone.

""Spot yield and the average for the field are shown, along with an estimate of the time remaining to finish a field, which can be useful for organising moves to another location,"" explains Max.

""Real-time moisture content is also shown, and that can be helpful to whoever manages intake at the store if a change of moisture level needs a response in terms of dryer setting.""

In addition, users can opt for a text alert if the moisture level exceeds a particular value, and a daily harvesting progress report is available in PDF form.

Yield maps generated on the FieldView platform are purposely presented in raw data form rather than “prettified” by smoothing, and within the app, simply drawing around areas of interest with a finger enables users to see comparative yields.

""For example, users can select a red block indicating an area of lower-yielding crop and see by how much it falls short of the field average, or compare yields between individual passes of the combine,"" notes Max.

""That function also makes it quick and easy to explore on-farm trials of different varieties, which could influence choices for the following crop, and different strategies for nitrogen and other fertilisers, including variable versus flat rate applications.""

Moreover, in addition to its yield mapping role, the Drive unit can be plugged into the diagnostics port of a tractor's isobus system to capture data while drilling, applying fertiliser or spraying crop protection products to create records of these operations.

It also has a task manager function, creating variable-rate application maps for spreaders and sprayers, for example.

Case study: Cloud Farming, East Lothian

Grower Chris Leslie's summary of his experience of the FieldView Yield Kit is that it's easy to install, works seamlessly and provides useful data without having to spend hours in front of a computer.

The Cloud Farming business he operates with partners provides fellow farmers in south and central Scotland with strategy and agronomy advice, with a focus on regenerative farming solutions and soil management.

Grain storage and machinery resources are also supplied, including two New Holland CR combines for harvesting.

""We needed only the FieldView Drive unit for one of the combines because it already had a yield mapping system, but the other needed the full kit,"" recalls Chris.

The biggest problem is keeping the iPad charged because the app consumes a fair bit of power, he says, so a USB port was wired in to keep the single power outlet in the cab available for charging the operator's mobile phone.

""One thing that has impressed me is that when we're running both combines in the same crop, FieldView automatically populates the field record with data from both machines - you don't have to touch it,"" says Chris.

""Apart from gathering data for monitoring our own trials, such as different spray programmes, it's useful to be able to access information that can be used on the day.""

""One of our clients grows wheat, aiming for a milling premium, and malting barley, and by logging-in from the store he can monitor what's coming off the combine and be more selective about storage rather than putting everything in one big heap.

""For others, being able to access the tonnages coming in enables them to plan budgets at an early stage.""

How to eliminate costly transition cow diseases on your farm

Provided by



Predicta GUARDIAN, for farmers who don't wait till it's too late! 
Visit our website here

The three weeks before and after calving, also known as the transition period, are full of changes for the dairy cow which make her very vulnerable.

Such changes include hormonal, metabolic, immune, nutritional, environmental and reproductive changes.

In this sensitive period, if a cow gets sick with diseases known as transition cow diseases, it can impact milk production, reproductive performance, and overall herd profitability.

Undiagnosed transition cow disease

Detecting and managing transition cow diseases is a crucial aspect of successful dairy farming. The earlier they are detected the less side effects there are with less impact on the herd.

However, vets and farmers are often not aware of the level of transition diseases in a herd.

The cow looks fine and is giving a healthy amount of milk, so the assumption is that there is no disease.

However, a recent study carried out in the UK in 2019 on 1,748 dairy herds by Macrae et al. found on average a herd had a 28.5% incidence of subclinical ketosis (undiagnosed) in the first 20 days of lactation. 

Could this also be the case on your farm? Could 28% of your cows not be reaching their full genetic potential without you knowing? Could you be having a higher milk yield?

The cost of ketosis for your herd

A study conducted in the Netherlands found that the cost of both clinical and subclinical ketosis combined in their sample cost a dairy farm an average of â‚¬3,613 per year for a standard farm and â‚¬7,371 per year for a high-risk farm.

The costs for a single case of clinical ketosis was â‚¬709, while the costs for a single case of subclinical ketosis were on average â‚¬150 (Steeneveld et al. 2020).

These are significant numbers and with the market being so volatile, and also with ever-increasing demands, they should not be taken lightly.

The benefits of detecting transition diseases early

Part of good herd management implies that the vet/farmer is detecting transition diseases very early on.

Early identification and proactive management of these diseases are vital to achieve higher milk yields, enhanced reproductive performance and reduced culling rates because:

Prevention over cure

As you can see early detection can have a lot of positive effects for your herd. However, prevention is always better than cure.

One way of preventing these diseases would be to preventatively treat all transition cows.

This, however, would mean high costs and some of these prevention treatments would of course be administered unnecessarily.

Technology has now advanced further and taken us to the next level.

What if we told you, you can now know which cows are at high risk for a particular transition disease weeks before it actually happens?

Over recent years a lot of data has been collected on farm from sensors such as milking machines, health and veterinary records, reproduction and breeding rates, feed and so much more.

When a large number of data is collected over time and over thousands of herds, a predictive model can be created using artificial intelligence.

Data from milk recordings or milk meter data, together with reproduction data from previous lactations, is collected to determine whether a given cow is at risk of a transition cow disease.

Namely, retained placenta, milk fever, ketosis and displaced abomasum.

Don't wait till it's too late

© Dairy Data Warehouse

Predicta GUARDIAN connects with the current herd management software on farm and using predictive modelling sends alerts to farmers/vets on their WhatsApp, email or SMS during the dry period well before the cow's vulnerable stage.

This gives a lot of time for great farm management and to ensure cows are healthy and reach their full genetic potential, and for higher farm profitability.

A career in the film industry is not the typical entrÃ©e to the world of agriculture, but for Cambridgeshire arable and regenerative farmer Tom Martin, aka Farmer Tom, this was his exact path.

After 10 successful years working in film distribution for Universal Pictures, and with previous experience in business strategy and consultancy, Mr Martin decided it was time to return to the family arable farm and give farming a go.

See also: The benefits of integrating trees into productive arable land

He is now applying knowledge gained from his previous career to promote British agriculture and share his farming journey.

""I left university and became a consultant and analyst,"" he says.

""Then I worked in news and magazine distribution, before working in licensing at Universal Pictures.

""But growing up on farm in north-west Cambridgeshire, I always loved the countryside, so I thought one day I would come back to farm.""

Transfer of skills

Since returning to Village Farm in Haddon, Mr Martin has applied his wealth of business, marketing and communication knowledge to the farm, which grows wheat, barley, rapeseed, linseed and beans.

""There's certainly a range of transferable ""˜soft skills' which you learn in all kinds of careers that can be taken from business to business, and this includes agriculture,"" he says.

During his early career, Mr Martin recalls spending a lot of time in marketing meetings discussing customer engagement and product branding.

This got him thinking how he could apply this to the world of farming - particularly connecting people with their food.

As a farmer, grower and seller, his first port of call was to market himself in a way that would be engaging to members of the public.

From this came the name Farmer Tom, which has proved successful on social media, where he shares regular farming content with more than 17,000 followers on Twitter and 11,000 on Facebook.

Farmer Time

Next, he wanted to portray the passion of farming people to the general public, connecting them with those who produce their food.

His background in film and public speaking produced his next idea: Farmer Time, which has proved a great success in promoting British agriculture in UK schools.

The Farmer Time initiative (formerly called FaceTime a Farmer) is a video call between one farmer and their matched classroom, which typically lasts 10-15 minutes every two or three weeks.

It currently connects 20,000 schoolchildren each fortnight with their own UK farmer - 800 farmers are signed-up, each with their own dedicated class.

""School teachers typically e-mail the farmer ahead of the scheduled call, detailing what the students have been recently studying.

""Whether it's soils, the natural environment or genetics, this can provide a potential talking point for farmers,"" says Mr Martin.

""We currently have more demand from schools than we have farmers signed-up, so we are always looking for more farmers to join.""

Walk the Farming Year 

Having virtually showcased his farm, he also wanted to welcome people face to face. This prompted him to sign up for Open Farm Sunday, which attracted a range of locals of all ages.

However, he soon realised that opening the farm for just one day a year gave the public only a limited snapshot of what life on the farm was really like.

From this, he came up with a small diversification business called Walk the Farming Year, which enables members of the public to come on to the farm for eight guided walking tours throughout the calendar year, in return for a small fee.

He talks them through the farm's cropping rotation, the use of various bits of machinery and details of some of the agronomy.

""We are now in our second year and currently have a group of 15 people, consisting of wildlife enthusiasts, local villagers and agronomists who are all interested in agriculture and rural life.

""It is a real opportunity to bring people on farm and explain first-hand what farming life is all about, while also generating an income,"" he says.

Another initiative Mr Martin and his wife Lisa created is a small community garden, which enables a number of locals to work together and get involved with producing home-grown produce. 

Public speaking and overseas ambassador 

Mr Martin is also a keen public speaker, giving a variety of talks to farming groups which include AHDB Monitor Farm meetings and Groundswell discussions. One of his latest talks involved a trip to Norway.

""I had the absolute pleasure of sharing my farming journey, mistakes and successes, with 150 Norwegian farmers and ag professionals interested in regenerative farming.

""I love the culture of being open, accepting mistakes, and learning from them and sharing this with others. It is so refreshing,"" he says.

Farming journey and learning from mistakes

Eight years into his farming journey Cambridgeshire farmer Tom Martin explains how he accidentally fell into the world of regenerative agriculture.

""I've never been ""˜on trend' with anything, but regen ag makes sense for us,"" he says.

""It's all about doing what's right for you and using the tools available to help you achieve your aims in a flexible way.

""This is why we're aiming to make our soils more resilient. We cannot change the weather but we can adapt our farming systems to tolerate this better.""

The five regenerative principles that fit well with his farming system and are as follows:

Companion crops in OSR

For 15 years the farm operated a min-till system and has since slowly moved to direct drilling.

The use of a Sky Easydrill allows him to drill rapeseed and a companion crop mix, and apply di-ammonium phosphate simultaneously. ""We've essentially merged five operations in just one pass,"" he says.

Buckwheat, berseem clover and fenugreek (a herb commonly used to flavour curries) are planted as a companion mix alongside rapeseed to mitigate cabbage stem flea beetle attacks.

""The buckwheat grows quickly to cover the ground, while the fenugreek masks the smell to disguise the OSR,"" he explains. ""We aim to drill as early as possible, in July if possible.""

© Lisa Miosi Photography

The pest has proved a big issue for the farm, but a combination of healthy soils, companion crops and silica sprays strengthening crops has proved effective over the years.

""No insecticides are applied and a recent flea beetle pyrethroid resistance test revealed 25% of flea beetles to be resistant. We still find a flea beetle in every field, but crops are no longer damaged.""

Blackgrass remains another significant challenge, and every decision made on farm takes blackgrass into consideration.

Reducing tillage to stop the seed-bed from being disrupted and incorporating more spring crops into the mix, such as beans and linseed, is helping tackle the issue.

826,"Inatreq: Needless risk or essential wheat fungicide?","https://www.fwi.co.uk/arable/crop-management/disease-management/inatreq-needless-risk-or-essential-wheat-fungicide","Inatreq: Needless risk or essential wheat fungicide?

An estimated 5-7% of users of Inatreq-containing fungicides experienced problems with sprayer component damage after applying them last year, putting products such as Univoq under intense scrutiny this year.

In its first full year of commercial use, a volley of complaints was received by manufacturer Corteva about the T2 fungicides, which the company has since explained as being caused by a complex of factors, all of which had to converge before issues occurred.

See also: Will arable farmers opt for Sustainable Farming Incentive?

After a lengthy investigation, Corteva has highlighted five key areas for attention, as well as emphasising the importance of good sprayer hygiene.

The materials used for sprayer seals and diaphragms, the age of these parts, the concentration of the spray solution, the duration of contact between the spray solution and the sprayer parts, along with individual user practices, are all possible reasons for the failure of anti-drip mechanisms.

Products containing Inatreq (fenpicoxamid)

The guidance covers the following products:

As a result, it has issued new best practice application advice and sprayer hygiene guidance ahead of the 2023 spraying season (see “Corteva's application advice for 2023”).

Corteva has also come up with a “stewardship support” offer - a £200 goodwill gesture towards the cost of sprayer parts purchased in conjunction with products containing Inatreq. This is limited to 5,000 applicants and will cost the company £1m.

""The vast majority of users didn't have a problem,"" points out a national distributor. ""Where they did occur, the common factor was a long period of time between changing parts on a sprayer.""

The other issue that arose in such an ideal spraying year was the temptation to leave the product in the tank after a late finish and in anticipation of an early start the next day, so bypassing basic hygiene procedures, he adds.

Corteva's application advice for 2023

Case study: Ashley Jones, Saltash, Cornwall  

It will be business as usual for farmer and agronomist Ashley Jones in Cornwall this year, who used Univoq at T2 in 2022 and experienced no problems whatsoever.

He plans to repeat his use of the product in 2023, as septoria is the main disease target in the South West in most years and he is convinced about the fungicide's superior activity on the pathogen.

He also welcomes the opportunity to use a different mode of action in his fungicide programme, as it helps to take the pressure off older active ingredients and builds some much-needed resilience into his disease control strategy.

Mr Jones, who has just completed his stint as the AHDB's Saltash Monitor Farm host, applied the product in 100 litres/ha of water to winter wheat on both his farm and those of his customers, without any unexpected damage to his sprayer or unwanted effects on the crop.

""I don't know anyone in Cornwall who had problems with applications of Inatreq-containing fungicides last year,"" he says.

While he used a very simple mix of Univoq plus Bittersalz, those who did see damage were using very complex tank mixes, he believes, which may have contributed to the problems they encountered.

In total, he applied Univoq to just over 100ha of wheat through a trailed John Deere sprayer.

Although disease levels were low in such a hot, dry season, crops did stay greener for longer and Mr Jones picked up a YEN award for the highest-yielding wheat crop in the South West, with a remarkable 15.4t/ha.

He is aware of the guidance that Corteva has issued for the forthcoming season, but hasn't studied it in detail yet.

Water volume is the one area he may adjust, as he is reluctant to go too low and not follow advice. ""Univoq is a very good product and it's one that we really need in the South West,"" he points out.

""In most years, we face a real onslaught of septoria, so it's important that we have the best products at our disposal. Having had a very good experience with it in 2022, I have no reason not to make good use of it again.""

Case study: Matt Redman, Cambridgeshire

Despite using Univoq at T2 without any adverse effects last year, Farmer Focus writer and AHDB Cambridge Monitor Farm host Matt Redman has made the decision to avoid it this year.

Having studied the new application guidelines and considered how they would work in practice, he has decided not to take the risk of any downtime or changes to his fungicide strategy.

The main stumbling block is the water volume of 200 litres/ha, which is higher than he would normally use, but he is also keen to keep his sprayer working all season - as it covers his own farm and those of his contracting clients.

""It's not the right time to be taking on any more risk or causing my customers additional concerns,"" he says.

""We didn't see any problems last year, but I don't want to jeopardise our operations, especially in the current economic climate.""

Agronomist's view

Using Univoq comes with caveats this year, says Farmers Weekly Arable Adviser of the Year, Jock Willmott of Ceres Rural.

For this reason, he understands why some growers won't want to take the risk, especially those with large areas to spray and where downtime would put them under even more pressure.

Jock Willmott © Tim Scrivener

""It won't be as popular,"" he says. ""That's a shame because it is a good product and we need it in the market, but whether you use it or not is a conversation that every grower needs to have with their agronomist.""

While there's a very slim chance that problems will occur, the final decision must be taken by the grower, he insists.

""If they are aware of the pros and cons, have weighed up the potential risk and are used to spraying at high volumes, then they may wish to go ahead.

""That's their decision, but no agronomist wants to sell it to a farmer only for them then to have an issue.""

Where Univoq is not going to be part of the 2023 disease control programme, growers need to decide on their alternatives and get organised, he suggests.

""If your spray timing is spot on, you can still achieve the same result on septoria with products such as Revystar [fluxapyroxad + mefentrifluconazole].

“But bear in mind that switching to other fungicides is going to put pressure on supplies, so get your orders in.""

An estimated 5-7% of users of Inatreq-containing fungicides experienced problems with sprayer component damage after applying them last year, putting products such as Univoq under intense scrutiny this year.

In its first full year of commercial use, a volley of complaints was received by manufacturer Corteva about the T2 fungicides, which the company has since explained as being caused by a complex of factors, all of which had to converge before issues occurred.

After a lengthy investigation, Corteva has highlighted five key areas for attention, as well as emphasising the importance of good sprayer hygiene.

The materials used for sprayer seals and diaphragms, the age of these parts, the concentration of the spray solution, the duration of contact between the spray solution and the sprayer parts, along with individual user practices, are all possible reasons for the failure of anti-drip mechanisms.

The guidance covers the following products:

As a result, it has issued new best practice application advice and sprayer hygiene guidance ahead of the 2023 spraying season (see “Corteva's application advice for 2023”).

Corteva has also come up with a “stewardship support” offer - a £200 goodwill gesture towards the cost of sprayer parts purchased in conjunction with products containing Inatreq. This is limited to 5,000 applicants and will cost the company £1m.

""The vast majority of users didn't have a problem,"" points out a national distributor. ""Where they did occur, the common factor was a long period of time between changing parts on a sprayer.""

The other issue that arose in such an ideal spraying year was the temptation to leave the product in the tank after a late finish and in anticipation of an early start the next day, so bypassing basic hygiene procedures, he adds.

It will be business as usual for farmer and agronomist Ashley Jones in Cornwall this year, who used Univoq at T2 in 2022 and experienced no problems whatsoever.

He plans to repeat his use of the product in 2023, as septoria is the main disease target in the South West in most years and he is convinced about the fungicide's superior activity on the pathogen.

833,"How to manage difficult calvings in beef cattle","https://www.fwi.co.uk/livestock/husbandry/calving/how-to-manage-difficult-calvings-in-beef-cattle","How to manage difficult calvings in beef cattle

A growing evidence base can be used by farmers to pre-empt difficulties in the calving shed and stay a step ahead of issues.

Once a hygienic and safe environment is provided for man and beast through provisions such as ample clean bedding, calving gates and lighting, there are five areas to evaluate for easy calving.

This is according to Rachel Bragg, farm animal clinician at the University of Edinburgh's Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies.

Dr Bragg draws on experience from UK and New Zealand farms as well as a 2020 study she was lead author on, Risk factor analysis for beef calves requiring assisted vaginal delivery in Great Britain.

Below, she discusses how to manage difficult calvings.

See also: How a Yorkshire suckler herd is achieving 96% calves weaned

1. Thin and fat cows

One of the biggest take-home messages from the study is that a thin cow can be as bad as a fat cow when it comes to calving difficulties.

Thin cows may not have the energy to push their calf out, while fat cows may deposit fat in the birth canal.

When to intervene

A natural calving can take two hours. General advice is to intervene:

2. Sire selection

A balanced view of maternal and terminal traits, functionality and type can help find a bull, with each farm having its own unique requirements.

3. Twins and bull calves

Some farms are using skilled scanning technicians to identify twin-bearing cows and bull calves, as both increase risk of dystocia, although early scanning is required.

4. Big calves

 Calf weight has a ""sweet spot"" where calves are developed and strong, but not so big that they cause protracted calvings. 

Calf size is also relative to cow size and pelvic dimensions.

Breedplan uses 41kg as a mid-point, but in this study, 49kg was the average weight of a newborn calf, with a range of 25-96kg (excluding dead calves and caesareans), and cow weights were 528-860kg.

5. Heifers

Statistically, a heifer is far more likely to have trouble calving on her own. She may need help both calving and suckling her calf.

Keep records to inform herd management decisions

Keep them alive

Post-mortem vet Ben Strugnell, of Farm Post Mortems, County Durham, says the most frequent reasons for dead newborn calves are:

Land is a finite resource, offering relatively stable, long-term growth, hedging and wealth preservation opportunities.

But there has been a changing picture of ownership over the past 100 years, directing many of those benefits into the hands of a select group of stakeholders.

The biggest driver for this was the introduction of supportive food and farming policies after the Second World War, according to property specialist Savills.

See also: Splitting a farm business: Tax, legal and practical matters

Greater profitability and stability attracted investors, both domestic and foreign, to UK land, replacing some of the more traditional landlords such as royalty and the church.

In more recent decades, the shift towards environmentalism and conservation has served to increase the appeal of land again.

So of the UK's 60m acres, who owns what?

It's suprisingly hard to get a definitive answer, and there are some unknowns, including exactly how much of the countryside is farmed - although large owners will naturally own and work swathes of farmland.

Author and campaigner Guy Shrubsole has done much to clarify the situation.

Biggest land owners

According to his research, land ownership is dominated by the aristocracy, who hold almost one-third of the area.

Next come large corporations, which may have invested in land for its tax-saving opportunities, followed by tycoons and the public sector.

In comparison, the Crown and the Church of England now hold less than 2% of the area between them - similar to the area held by charities.

Within this area, figures suggest a small number of individuals, charities and companies own huge swathes of land. About 12% of the UK land area or 7.2m acres is in the hands of the top 50 owners.

As the top 10 below shows, royalty and titled gentry still account for large acreages of the UK.

Included in their ranks, but just outside the top 10 in 11th place overall is the Duchy of Cornwall with its 135,000 acres - recently passed from King Charles III to his eldest son, William.

Top 10 biggest UK landowners

Private investors

Within this list only one private investor - Anders Holch Povlsen - nudges shoulders with the establishment, UK government, charities and organisations.

But private investors do loom large in the top 50, so we've broken out the top five UK and foreign entrepreneurs below.

Top five British investors

Top five foreign investors

While the UK's top landowners have considerable acreages, the world's largest hold mind-boggling areas. 

The list is headed by the Catholic Church and a Chino-Russian farming venture, thereafter it is dominated by a string of Australian farmers.

The area of farmland publicly marketed across Great Britain rose during the first half of this year to 85,606 acres, according to Savills research.

This is 16% higher than in the same period last year and a similar level to that last seen in 2018 and to the 10-year average.

However, there are some significant regional variations, with the East seeing a fall of 22% in the area launched, the North down 4% and the South East down 13%.

See also: Top tips on avoiding inheritance tax pitfalls

Despite this, the areas in the East and North were both above their 10-year averages.

The 2022 figures for the East were skewed by the launches of the Coldham Estate in Cambridgeshire and the Goole Estate in South Yorkshire.

These offered 8,000 acres in total and were bought in 2014 by the Wellcome Trust from the Co-op's Farmcare business.

More smaller farms and parcels of 50 to 120 acres are coming to the market, says Savills, possibly as a result of higher interest rates.

Anecdotally, there are also more farms being put on the market as a result of retirement.

Acreages launched (January-June 2023)

Values

Values for all types of GB farmland in the year from June 2022 to June 2023 rose by an average of 10%, says Savills.

The biggest increase being 13.5% for poor livestock land, which now averages more than £8,100/acre.

Grade 3 livestock land in Wales saw the largest increase, at 19.2%, followed by poor-quality pasture in England, at 15.6%, suggesting demand for nature-based solutions continues to be a market driver for these land types.

Prime arable land average values have risen above their previous 2015 high, with England at £10,290/acre, Scotland at £9,885/acre and Wales £8,000/acre.

Alex Lawson, head of Savills' rural agency, says that rollover funds which must be invested within a specific timeframe are often competing for well-equipped commercial farms across Great Britain.

""This demand has supported values, and there have been cases where the prices paid are significantly more than the current averages from our farmland value survey,"" he says.

However, farms and estates where a significant proportion of the value is accounted for by the residential element are in some cases being more affected by rising interest rates, he says.

""It is now critical for new launches to have the right marketing strategy, possibly including flexible lotting, as well as realistic guide prices.

“That said, best-in-class rural properties in the popular locations - whether residential or mainly agricultural - are still highly sought after and deals have been agreed within a few weeks of launch at prices in excess of the guide price.

""One of the biggest challenges we face is the length of time it now takes from agreeing a sale through to completion.""

April-June 2023 values - England

Knight Frank's latest English farmland index has values rising by 1% during April-June 2023, and by 8% year-on-year to give an average of £8,845/acre.

The index takes into account actual transactions, market valuations and other insights from the firm's agents.

""Farmland continues to rise in value, albeit at a slower pace than the past two years.

“The slowdown is due to an increase in the volume of land coming up for sale, combined with the rise in the cost of borrowing,"" says Andrew Shirley, the firm's head of rural research.

A slowdown in the volume of new housing developments is likely to have cut the number of farmers with rollover funds to reinvest, he says.

""But there is still considerable demand from purchasers looking for nature-based solutions and natural capital opportunities.""

England - blocks larger than 100 acres

Strutt & Parker's farmland database records only farms and blocks of land of more than 100 acres publicly marketed in England.

The firm puts the average sale price of arable land in England for the first half of 2023 at a new high of £11,100/acre, a rise of 2% on the year.

More than 50% of arable land sold went for more than £10,000/acre, while average pasture prices have shown a slight decline from the record levels of 2022.

""It remains to be seen if this is a temporary blip or a lasting trend,"" says Matthew Sudlow, head of estates and farm agency at Strutt & Parker.

The supply in England of blocks larger than 100 acres is at historically low levels, says the firm.

On this basis, it has recorded fewer acres on the open market in the first half of 2023 compared with the same period last year, at 30,800 acres in January to June 2023 compared with 47,100 acres in 2022.

""The rise in the cost of borrowing and tighter margins does seem to be making farmer-buyers more cautious, and consequently they have accounted for a smaller number of sales than normal during the first half of 2023.

“This has also signalled a slight cooling in the market for properties which appeal only to farmer-buyers.

""The jump in average values is being driven by private investors who have been increasingly active since the end of 2021. We are also seeing signs of greater activity from institutional investors.""

As a result, there is emerging evidence that a two-tier market may be starting to open, with the average value of land bought by farmers at £9,700/acre, compared with an average paid by investors of £11,800/acre, says the firm.

Scotland

Buyers looking for environmental solutions and opportunities have become a regular feature in the farmland market across Great Britain.

However, the demand for hill planting land In Scotland has softened, says Evelyn Channing, head of Savills' rural agency in Scotland.

""Offers made subject to bird surveys are becoming the norm. This may impact timeframes for both buyers and sellers and underlines the necessity for early conversations for anyone considering a sale,"" she advises.

Activity so far this year in the Scottish land market has been for all types of property, with rollover funds, lifestyle interest and those from south of the border looking for value representing the bulk of buyers.

""With a further recent increase in interest rates we are likely to see less appetite from those who are not predominantly cash buyers, particularly during the current period of uncertainty over our future agricultural policy, coupled with volatile commodity prices and the high cost of inputs,"" says Evelyn.

""Despite these challenges, and given the positive start to the year in terms of activity, we are optimistic for the remainder of this year, particularly for blue-chip units with good productive land.

""Strong pre-emptive offers are being received and thwarting plans for units that were destined to come to the open market in the coming months.

“This was the case for the 457-acre arable farm East Garleton in East Lothian, which went under offer after six weeks of private marketing.""  

Last month saw the launch of two Scottish Borders holdings: Shoestanes, a 579-acre stock farm near Heriot, saw interest from farmers and forestry planters, while Nottylees, a 461-acre arable unit in the Tweed Valley, generated multiple viewings within the first week of marketing by buyers originating from both England and Scotland.

847,"Red tape burden increases for farmers, survey shows","https://www.fwi.co.uk/business/business-management/red-tape-burden-increases-for-farmers-survey-shows","Red tape burden increases for farmers, survey shows

Paperwork linked to farm assurance schemes, regulatory bodies and supply contracts is keeping some farmers in the office for more than 15 hours a week, with a new survey showing that the time and cost burdens of administration are increasing.

That survey, by farm management software provider Sum-IT, shows that the number of hours farmers commit to administration has increased in the past three years, although the findings don't appear to identify Brexit as a reason.

See also: How to save time, stress and cash in farm office routines

However, greater compliance demands in different sectors - for example, the extensive crop production record-keeping now required from arable growers - is pushing up the workload.

Dairy farmers seem to be the hardest hit, with 86% of 242 British farmers surveyed reporting an increase in farm administration, due in part to the expectations of milk buyers.

The phasing out of the Basic Payment Scheme in England, with the requirement for more paperwork to qualify for various stewardship schemes, is another factor.

Compliance

The most time-consuming tasks seem to be associated with assurance scheme compliance - 63% of dairy farmers said this accounted for the highest proportion of their office work - and with regulatory compliance, such as the requirements of HMRC and the British Cattle Movement Service.

Invoicing, creditor and debtor management, financial planning and payroll also take time to administer.

What is telling is that the majority of farmers don't share the admin workload with others: only 16% said they used a farm secretary. For small businesses in other sectors this figure sits at 46%.

Lynn Briggs, council chairwoman of the Institute of Agricultural Secretaries and Administrators (IAgSA), said concerns about confidentiality might be a reason why some farmers resist bringing in someone outside the family to help.

""There can be a lot of secrecy in a farming businesses because it is predominately a family business and there is a distrust of outsiders,"" she added.

For that reason, many agricultural secretaries don't work in their local area where they are more likely to know the farmer they are employed by.

Fresh blood

Although the survey authors suggest that a shortage of agricultural secretaries could be a factor, Ms Briggs said that while this situation might once have existed, it had since been addressed.

IAgSA membership numbers are relatively stable, but the average age of secretaries is increasing.

Those who might have studied a secretarial course when most agricultural colleges ran these are now in their fifties and, as those courses no longer exist, it has been a challenge to get fresh blood into the industry.

Since the pandemic, the IAgSA has updated its training programme, which has been in existence for more than 10 years, to a streamlined online format with pre-work assessments prior to joining a virtual classroom. 

""This has proved to be extremely successful, attracting individuals who are looking for a career change from other professions, or who want to upgrade their current skill set,"" said Ms Briggs.

Digitisation

While some farmers might be resistant to employing a farm secretary, the majority are embracing digitisation.

Most of the farmers surveyed said 90% of their admin is now in digital format, perhaps due in part to the launch of HMRC's Making Tax Digital initiative in April 2022; only 7% of respondents had less than half of their admin digitised.

Many of the farmers surveyed, from small to large operators, confessed to a lack of certainty about their legal obligations against a backdrop of new legislation applying to exports to the EU, environmental stewardship, and the employment of migrant workers.

Only 36% said they were confident they understood their legal requirements, 16% said they did not understand as much as they should, and 1% admitted to having no understanding at all. n

What else the survey revealed

The survey asked farmers in what direction they planned to take their business in the next five years.

Only 34% said they are planning expansion, 48% are seeking to maintain the status quo, 5% intend to downsize and 2% plan to sell their farm.

When asked about the future of their businesses, 40% said they were worried, with arable and sheep farmers and those aged over 45 expressing the greatest concern.

Many responses showed apprehension about government policy and frustrations around finding suitable employees.

But the younger generation was slightly more optimistic – 44% of respondents said they were excited about the future, compared with just 20% of older participants.

Hamill Farms in Canada diversified their traditional grain farm into Alberta's first craft malthouse in a bid to add value to barley crops and ignite the family's succession plan.

It was a decade ago when John Hamill, wife Susie and their two sons, Joe and Matt, wanted to expand the business.

This sparked the establishment of Red Shed Malting, which today produces a range of speciality malts grown from barley on the family's 850ha grain farm in Central Alberta.

See also: So you want to… farm in Canada

After extensive research, Joe and Matt identified a gap in the market for locally sourced, traceable malt barley as the majority of breweries were importing malts from either the US or Europe.

An on-farm malt plant was established which converts barley grain into specialty malt by steeping, germinating, kilning and roasting.

Grains are bagged on-site and sold to breweries and distilleries across western Canada.

How the malting process works

Post-harvest, the first step of malting is cleaning and steeping the grain, explains Matt.

""The grain goes into a handling system, which drops into a vertical steeper. Here, it is soaked in water to increase the moisture level from 13% to 42%, over a course of 36-48 hours."" 

The grain absorbs oxygen, which starts the growth of the kernel, mimicking the environment of a planted grain.

Next, the grain enters a germination and kilning vessel where the roots continue to grow.

Here, the grain kernel converts carbohydrates into starch, which the brewers will turn into sugar and ferment into alcohol.

""During this process, the enzyme levels change - alpha amylase goes up and beta glucan goes down.

Once the enzyme and starch profiles are right, we begin the kilning process,"" explains Matt.

""The kiln removes excess moisture and prevents further germination. We dry the grain down to 5% moisture before bagging as a shelf-stable base malt in 22.7kg bags, which is sold to breweries.""

Grain to malt to beer

About 10t of barley grain will produce 8t of finished malt. Each bag will produce about 100 litres of beer.

Currently, 350t of the farm's 1,500t crop of barley is processed into malt so there is plenty of room for expansion.

The business also malts other crops such as wheat, oats and rye.

The farm's high-temperature roaster can create unique malt flavours, such as chocolate and caramel.

""It is a lot of fun to be involved with different product developments,"" Matt adds.

His advice for any farmers considering diversifying their business into an-farm malthouse is that ""you've really got to love it and be involved in the industry to get the most out of it"".

Hamill Farms crop production

The Hamill family © David Dinan

For John Hamill, who manages the farming operations at Hamill farms, the planting season usually begins mid-May. Average yields of spring barley are about 6.5t/ha.

When it comes to varieties, John opts for crops with good vigour, disease profile and straw strength, working closely with brewers to ensure optimum malting characteristics are met.

Spring crops are predominately grown on the farm due to the cold autumns and winters, which can see snow on the ground for up to six months of the year.

As demand from brewers continues to rise, the Hamills are now growing autumn rye, ensuring the crop is established early before freezing winter temperatures arrive.

Did you know?

Alberta produces half of all Canadian barley, and a third of the barley in North America. Just under 50% of Alberta's barley is grown for malting; the remainder for livestock feed.

854,"How growers can produce maize and protect environment","https://www.fwi.co.uk/arable/maize/how-growers-can-produce-maize-and-protect-environment","How growers can produce maize and protect environment

Maize is a crop often perceived to be damaging to the environment, causing issues such as soil compaction, erosion and nutrient losses, which can lead to run-off, affecting nearby watercourses.

A ""maize charter"", pioneered by the Maize Growers Association, is aiming to tackle concerns, by providing field evaluations to encourage best practice when it comes to growing the crop.

The Maize Growers Association (MGA) Maize Charter project was launched in 2017.

See also: 6 top maize growing tips to help livestock producers

Maize Charter project

It was designed to help farmers carry out field-by-field assessments to determine maize production suitability, based on a score that incorporates risk factors such as soil type, likely drilling and harvest date, as well as altitude and aspect of the field.

Based on that score, the charter then provides advice on the most suitable varieties, with the overall aim of de-risking growing the crop, explains John Morgan, consultant at Devon-based Creedy Associates, which provides technical support to the MGA.

""If we know it's a high-risk field for soil erosion, for example, the charter will direct growers towards very early maturing varieties that should be ready for harvest in September, rather than October or November.

""Maize grown in the right field has very strong environmental credentials - it has low nutrient and agri-chemical use. It's part of the solution as I often say.

“But maize grown in the wrong fields poses all sorts of risks, including soil compaction at harvest and then subsequent soil erosion and run-off linked to rainfall over the winter.""

This is on top of the management-type problems such as heavy tractors driving on weak, wet soils late in the autumn - normally around harvest time - as well as the overapplication of nutrients, he adds.

""My take is that we can tackle all of the issues by responsible maize growing - and the Maize Charter is one of the tools that can help growers do that.""

Since the launch of the MGA Maize Charter in 2017, projects have been completed across Wiltshire, Dorset and Cornwall, and over this time has grown to incorporate nutrient management planning in a bid to reduce issues with phosphorus in watercourses too, explains Mr Morgan.

""In the right place, [phosphorus] is great, but in the wrong place it's bad news in that it encourages algal blooms and eutrophication in watercourses.

“So we started adding a section on nutrient management to the charter, looking at soil indexes and phosphorus supply, via manures and fertilisers, to try and balance the two.""

Sussex partnership

Most recently, a partnership between the MGA and South East Water enabled a charter to be rolled out in the East Sussex region.

The East Sussex Maize Charter involved six farms, with a full maize charter completed for five of them - equivalent to a total maize area of 190ha.

Dairy farmer Chris Appleton is among those involved. He also has a long-standing relationship with South East Water, working closely over recent years to improve maize production and minimise soil losses at Primrose Farm, near Arlington, while also protecting local watercourses.

The farm is home to a 450-head herd of autumn block-calving Holstein-Friesian cows.

They are grazed through the summer and housed over winter, fed on a diet of predominantly grass and maize forage. Most of the maize, 73ha, is grown on-farm with the rest grown on contract locally.

The relationship with South East Water began about five years ago, explains Mr Appleton.

""We started off experimenting with different cover crops, trying to establish what worked and what didn't.

“The express aim at the beginning for us was just trying to establish green cover and to work out what the best way of doing that was.""

Funding for this was provided by South East Water, he adds. About three years ago, Mr Appleton then moved on to experiment with undersowing maize crops with Italian ryegrass, again supported by South East Water.

""This was also to try to get a more certain green cover across the fields over winter.""

With the combined support from the water company and the MGA, Mr Appleton says they have been able to take that one step further and now either undersow or oversow - or a combination of both - all of their maize ground.

Last year, the farm also invested in a strip-till cultivator. ""We've got the aim of establishing green cover figured out, so now we're trying to look at how we can minimise the work that goes into establishing our maize crops in the spring,"" says Mr Appleton.

Nutrient gains

The primary aim of all of these measures is to hold onto soil and nutrients better, to the benefit of both the farm and the River Cuckmere, which runs through the middle of the land, he adds.

""We're also about half a mile upstream from Arlington reservoir. So there's a benefit for South East Water because if [soil and nutrients] stay in our fields, then they don't have to clean it up.""

Though he has arguably been taking steps to protect soils and the watercourses for some time, Mr Appleton believes the biggest advantage of being part of the charter is the advice and guidance provided by the MGA.

""None of what we're doing is particularly new or groundbreaking, but it has been really helpful having John Morgan, in particular, on the other end of an email to pick his brain about what we're doing.

“The combination of the MGA and South East Water has been really beneficial.""

And further changes to the farm have been made as a result of the charter.

""A successful maize season for us starts off before we've even put anything in the ground,"" explains Mr Appleton.

""It begins the previous autumn, making sure we've got good green cover, but the next step is selecting earlier maturing varieties.""

Over the past four years, the farm has moved to growing predominately Group 9 varieties, and now with advice from the MGA, Mr Appleton is going to have a go with some Group 11 types too this year.

The driver behind this ensures crops are drilled by the end of April and harvested in September to avoid travelling at the wetter times of the year.

This minimises the risk of soil issues, as well as allowing ample time to establish green cover while conditions are still favourable.

""The earlier we can get it drilled, provided conditions are right, sets us up to harvest as early as we reasonably can at the other end of the season.""

This has proven to be a particularly beneficial strategy in some of the higher risk fields, which were identified as part of the charter.

Mr Appleton adds that conditions dictate drilling and harvesting over date, and the MGA stresses that earlier is not always better.

""We have found that with our strip-tilling, the fields stand up a lot better now to heavy machinery, so that helps too [with drilling and harvesting earlier]. We're seeing a lot less soil compaction and damage now.""

In terms of how all of this has affected watercourses, anecdotally Mr Appleton says he now notices water running off fields is near enough clear, highlighting the reduction in soil erosion that these measures have made.

""This is particularly noticeable in fields where we would have traditionally seen soil wash. Now we don't.""

Future plans

Over the past few years, the farm has been carrying out fairly comprehensive soil analysis work and Mr Appleton says this is something he wants to continue.

This will help yield some concrete data on if and what benefits the changes to his farm are having on soil. Building on the success of his strip-tilling, he is also looking to experiment with precision slurry application this year.

""Most of the muck on the farm was already applied through a dribble bar or a trailing shoe - some sort of low-emission applicator. But this year, we're looking at whether or not we can inject the slurry into the row as we drill it.""

Mr Appleton adds that he will also be continuing to ""fiddle"" with nutrient applications, seed rates and row spacing as he believes there is still more he can do to improve the efficiency of his maize growing.

In terms of working with organisations such as South East Water and the MGA, Mr Appleton says it is really important and beneficial to continue to get different viewpoints to understand what is sustainable for different parties and perhaps prompt a mindset change, where needed.

""There's no doubt we started off with practices - such as winter ploughing - that are very different to what we do now.

""I think the UK dairy industry would fall apart without maize as an energy feed - we can't afford not to find a way of growing it sustainably and responsibly,"" he says.

""If we don't, then ultimately the way it will go is that [farmers] will be banned from growing it. So that is the key driver behind everything we're trying to do here. As a business, I'm not sure what we'd replace it with.""

Mr Morgan says he hopes to extend the charter further, too. ""I'm currently in conversations with Welsh Water about doing more this spring. [The charter] is there and is a tool that's ready to go and ready to be used.""

The latest maize trials and research work will be discussed at the Maize Growers Association annual conference at Reading University on Wednesday 8 February.

Maize is a crop often perceived to be damaging to the environment, causing issues such as soil compaction, erosion and nutrient losses, which can lead to run-off, affecting nearby watercourses.

A ""maize charter"", pioneered by the Maize Growers Association, is aiming to tackle concerns, by providing field evaluations to encourage best practice when it comes to growing the crop.

The Maize Growers Association (MGA) Maize Charter project was launched in 2017.

Maize Charter project

It was designed to help farmers carry out field-by-field assessments to determine maize production suitability, based on a score that incorporates risk factors such as soil type, likely drilling and harvest date, as well as altitude and aspect of the field.

Based on that score, the charter then provides advice on the most suitable varieties, with the overall aim of de-risking growing the crop, explains John Morgan, consultant at Devon-based Creedy Associates, which provides technical support to the MGA.

""If we know it's a high-risk field for soil erosion, for example, the charter will direct growers towards very early maturing varieties that should be ready for harvest in September, rather than October or November.

""Maize grown in the right field has very strong environmental credentials - it has low nutrient and agri-chemical use. It's part of the solution as I often say.

“But maize grown in the wrong fields poses all sorts of risks, including soil compaction at harvest and then subsequent soil erosion and run-off linked to rainfall over the winter.""

This is on top of the management-type problems such as heavy tractors driving on weak, wet soils late in the autumn - normally around harvest time - as well as the overapplication of nutrients, he adds.

""My take is that we can tackle all of the issues by responsible maize growing - and the Maize Charter is one of the tools that can help growers do that.""

Since the launch of the MGA Maize Charter in 2017, projects have been completed across Wiltshire, Dorset and Cornwall, and over this time has grown to incorporate nutrient management planning in a bid to reduce issues with phosphorus in watercourses too, explains Mr Morgan.

""In the right place, [phosphorus] is great, but in the wrong place it's bad news in that it encourages algal blooms and eutrophication in watercourses.

“So we started adding a section on nutrient management to the charter, looking at soil indexes and phosphorus supply, via manures and fertilisers, to try and balance the two.""

Sussex partnership

Most recently, a partnership between the MGA and South East Water enabled a charter to be rolled out in the East Sussex region.

The East Sussex Maize Charter involved six farms, with a full maize charter completed for five of them - equivalent to a total maize area of 190ha.

Dairy farmer Chris Appleton is among those involved. He also has a long-standing relationship with South East Water, working closely over recent years to improve maize production and minimise soil losses at Primrose Farm, near Arlington, while also protecting local watercourses.

The farm is home to a 450-head herd of autumn block-calving Holstein-Friesian cows.

They are grazed through the summer and housed over winter, fed on a diet of predominantly grass and maize forage. Most of the maize, 73ha, is grown on-farm with the rest grown on contract locally.

The relationship with South East Water began about five years ago, explains Mr Appleton.

""We started off experimenting with different cover crops, trying to establish what worked and what didn't.

“The express aim at the beginning for us was just trying to establish green cover and to work out what the best way of doing that was.""

Funding for this was provided by South East Water, he adds. About three years ago, Mr Appleton then moved on to experiment with undersowing maize crops with Italian ryegrass, again supported by South East Water.

""This was also to try to get a more certain green cover across the fields over winter.""

With the combined support from the water company and the MGA, Mr Appleton says they have been able to take that one step further and now either undersow or oversow - or a combination of both - all of their maize ground.

Last year, the farm also invested in a strip-till cultivator. ""We've got the aim of establishing green cover figured out, so now we're trying to look at how we can minimise the work that goes into establishing our maize crops in the spring,"" says Mr Appleton.

Nutrient gains

The primary aim of all of these measures is to hold onto soil and nutrients better, to the benefit of both the farm and the River Cuckmere, which runs through the middle of the land, he adds.

""We're also about half a mile upstream from Arlington reservoir. So there's a benefit for South East Water because if [soil and nutrients] stay in our fields, then they don't have to clean it up.""

Though he has arguably been taking steps to protect soils and the watercourses for some time, Mr Appleton believes the biggest advantage of being part of the charter is the advice and guidance provided by the MGA.

""None of what we're doing is particularly new or groundbreaking, but it has been really helpful having John Morgan, in particular, on the other end of an email to pick his brain about what we're doing.

“The combination of the MGA and South East Water has been really beneficial.""

And further changes to the farm have been made as a result of the charter.

""A successful maize season for us starts off before we've even put anything in the ground,"" explains Mr Appleton.

""It begins the previous autumn, making sure we've got good green cover, but the next step is selecting earlier maturing varieties.""

Over the past four years, the farm has moved to growing predominately Group 9 varieties, and now with advice from the MGA, Mr Appleton is going to have a go with some Group 11 types too this year.

The driver behind this ensures crops are drilled by the end of April and harvested in September to avoid travelling at the wetter times of the year.

This minimises the risk of soil issues, as well as allowing ample time to establish green cover while conditions are still favourable.

""The earlier we can get it drilled, provided conditions are right, sets us up to harvest as early as we reasonably can at the other end of the season.""

This has proven to be a particularly beneficial strategy in some of the higher risk fields, which were identified as part of the charter.

Mr Appleton adds that conditions dictate drilling and harvesting over date, and the MGA stresses that earlier is not always better.

""We have found that with our strip-tilling, the fields stand up a lot better now to heavy machinery, so that helps too [with drilling and harvesting earlier]. We're seeing a lot less soil compaction and damage now.""

In terms of how all of this has affected watercourses, anecdotally Mr Appleton says he now notices water running off fields is near enough clear, highlighting the reduction in soil erosion that these measures have made.

""This is particularly noticeable in fields where we would have traditionally seen soil wash. Now we don't.""

Future plans

Over the past few years, the farm has been carrying out fairly comprehensive soil analysis work and Mr Appleton says this is something he wants to continue.

This will help yield some concrete data on if and what benefits the changes to his farm are having on soil. Building on the success of his strip-tilling, he is also looking to experiment with precision slurry application this year.

""Most of the muck on the farm was already applied through a dribble bar or a trailing shoe - some sort of low-emission applicator. But this year, we're looking at whether or not we can inject the slurry into the row as we drill it.""

Mr Appleton adds that he will also be continuing to ""fiddle"" with nutrient applications, seed rates and row spacing as he believes there is still more he can do to improve the efficiency of his maize growing.

In terms of working with organisations such as South East Water and the MGA, Mr Appleton says it is really important and beneficial to continue to get different viewpoints to understand what is sustainable for different parties and perhaps prompt a mindset change, where needed.

""There's no doubt we started off with practices - such as winter ploughing - that are very different to what we do now.

""I think the UK dairy industry would fall apart without maize as an energy feed - we can't afford not to find a way of growing it sustainably and responsibly,"" he says.

""If we don't, then ultimately the way it will go is that [farmers] will be banned from growing it. So that is the key driver behind everything we're trying to do here. As a business, I'm not sure what we'd replace it with.""

Mr Morgan says he hopes to extend the charter further, too. ""I'm currently in conversations with Welsh Water about doing more this spring. [The charter] is there and is a tool that's ready to go and ready to be used.""

The latest maize trials and research work will be discussed at the Maize Growers Association annual conference at Reading University on Wednesday 8 February.

A rapid test is set to be launched in March that will identify two of the most damaging diseases in barley before visible symptoms appear.

The SwiftDetect test from Microgenetics has already proved to be invaluable in identifying diseases such as septoria in wheat, and the team has now developed tests to identify net blotch and rhynchosporium in barley.

See also: 6 steps to growing better spring barley for 2023 season

Net blotch has the potential to cause yield losses of 10-40% if it is not controlled, and rhynchosporium, the most damaging disease affecting UK barley, can inflict several infection cycles during a single growing season.

Rebecca Sanders, principal scientist at Microgenetics, says: ""We decided to focus on these pathogens because they're a particular concern for the British farming industry - we know they cause the biggest crop yield failures and have the biggest financial impact.""

By identifying the presence of net blotch and rhynchosporium before they are visible, farmers can act quickly to control either disease before it becomes a more serious problem.

""These diseases have a long latent period when the disease is present but not yet visible,"" Dr Sanders says.

""By the time visible signs do appear it is too late to recover the full yield and aggressive fungicides will need to be used.""

By using SwiftDetect, farmers are given an early warning that treatment is necessary, she says.

It allows them to use it as part of their integrated crop management, and spray according to what is actually in the field, rather than a pre-emptive campaign.

""It saves money. It saves the environment. And it prolongs the life of fungicides because, like antibiotics, the more fungicides we use, the more likely it is that pathogens will develop resistance to them.""

How to use it

SwiftDetect is easy to use - farmers simply collect 10 leaves from across a barley field for their sample, and post them to the SwiftDetect laboratory using a prepaid envelope that can be ordered from the Microgenetics website.

The results are sent back quickly by email, usually by the next business day, if not sooner.

""A traffic light warning system will tell a farmer whether the sample was low-, medium- or high-risk"", says Charles Grant, research scientist at Microgenetics.

""They will also receive a SwiftDetect score, which is determined by the amount of pathogen identified in the sample.""

864,"Analysis: How can the small abattoir sector be saved?","https://www.fwi.co.uk/business/markets-and-trends/meat-prices/analysis-how-can-the-small-abattoir-sector-be-saved","Analysis: How can the small abattoir sector be saved?

It is estimated that only 49 small red meat abattoirs remain in England, Wales and Scotland and, if closures continue at the current rate, none will be operating by 2030.

A 2021 survey by trade body National Craft Butchers (NCB) indicated that almost 60% of abattoirs processing less than 1,000 livestock units a year would close within two to five years without intervention, and that analysis appears to be spot on.

Megan Perry, head of policy and campaigns at the Sustainable Food Trust (SFT), says 13 have been lost in the past three years alone and it is now ""reaching a catastrophic situation"".

See also: Why local abattoirs are at risk and how farms are affected

Among last year's closures was Mettrick's abattoir in Glossop, Derbyshire, which came as a major blow to the 200 local farmers who used it.

The Tottingworth abattoir in East Sussex was another casualty in 2022 - unable to find the £100,000 needed to modernise the facility.

Regulation

One of the main reasons for these closures is the burden of regulation and inspection, with critics suggesting that it is often due to an inexperienced official veterinarian (OV).

John Mettrick, who is chairman of the Abattoir Sector Group (ASG) and legislation director of NCB, has said inexperienced vets was a significant reason behind his decision to close his abattoir last year.

How many abattoirs and their value

Small abattoirs in England killed 14,616 cattle and 11,230 sheep in 2021, according to AHDB figures, producing meat with a retail value of £53m-£58m.

This does not include pigs, or animals killed in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, so the numbers and value are much higher for the UK as a whole.

Although this is a small proportion of the total herd and flock killed in the UK, it is seen as a valuable financial asset to local rural economies.

The ASG and its members have been pressing the government for an overhaul of this system, urging risk-based and proportionate regulation and inspection instead of the current ""one-size-fits-all"" approach.

For example, OVs must currently inspect both the live animal and the carcass, yet meat hygiene inspectors once had this job.

Flexibility

Another example is the failure of the UK government to implement the EU's so-called ""5% rule"".

Currently, operators slaughtering less than 1,000 livestock units a year - classed as ""small"" - only require part-time OV supervision.

But once an abattoir exceeds the 1,000 livestock units limit, they transfer to full-time OV supervision.

Without the 5% flexibility allowed in Europe, many small abattoirs elect to operate at a less than full capacity, because they don't want to exceed that 1,000-head limit.

""The 5% rule is something the ASG has been calling for and the Food Standards Agency have said they see no reason not to allow it from a logistical, animal welfare or food hygiene point of view,"" says Ms Perry.

And then there is the shortage of experienced, qualified vets.

Mr Mettrick describes this as a ""recipe for disaster"", as an inexperienced vet who has only worked in large, single-species abattoirs will be ""out of their depth"" in a small abattoir, which has the complexity of slaughtering lots of small batches and multiple species, he says.

How abattoir closures affect farmers

One farmer, who also runs a pub and restaurant in Sussex, is calling on UK governments and regional assemblies to spend some of their farm support budgets on grants for small abattoirs, or risk losing a vital piece of the local food jigsaw.

Since the closure of the Tottingworth abattoir near Heathfield in October 2022, Farmers Weekly columnist Stephen Carr has had to travel to Henfield in West Sussex to slaughter cattle and lambs destined for his pub, the Sussex Ox, in East Sussex.

That drive can take more than an hour on often congested roads compared to the previous 25-minute journey to Tottingworth.

Mr Carr's story of longer journeys is becoming commonplace, and it risks undermining the local provenance and low food miles message, he says.

""Local abattoirs are a crucial part of the farm-to-fork appeal, as shorter journeys emit less carbon and offer obvious animal welfare benefits.""

Small abattoirs also cater for single animal consignments and native and traditional breeds.

""These don't really fit into the large processor model,"" says Mr Carr. ""Some native breeds have thick skins or long horns and these present special challenges at slaughterhouses.""

If the abattoir at Henfield closed, Mr Carr's journey time to the next nearest plant would rise to three hours and the cost would become unsustainable.

""This is where the local food network crumbles,"" he says. ""We are in an endless, vicious cycle that not only affects businesses like mine, but every farm shop, every farmers' market.""

Mr Carr wants governments in all parts of the UK to ""look beyond the plain commercial aspect"" of the role of local slaughtering facilities, and help them compete with larger industrial facilities.

""There is £3.3bn in the UK kitty from recycled EU subsidies to redistribute into agriculture and rural infrastructure and job creation.

""If governments are prepared to fund initiatives such as large, individual rewilding projects, it would be a small but crucial investment to provide grants to small local abattoirs for them to upgrade their equipment and subsidise some of their costs. 

""They must find some money from their rural budgets for these vital facilities.""

Funding issues

In addition to the regulatory challenges, soaring costs and an absence of government help for investment in modernisation have forced many small abattoirs out of business.

The 2021 NCB survey showed that the most urgent funding requirements are for maintenance and equipment, but also for extensions, waste management and staff training.

Although the details are not yet clear, Defra farming minister Mark Spencer has said that funding will be available ""later this year"" to help small abattoirs invest in new technology and improve productivity and animal welfare.

The announcement, made at last week's NFU Conference, has been warmly welcomed by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust (RBST), which has lobbied hard for greater assistance to small abattoirs.

""The sustainable livestock sector is made up largely of small farms keeping small numbers of animals, often local breeds particularly suited to their area,"" says RBST chief executive Christopher Price.

""Those farms depend on the existence of a network of abattoirs capable of processing these small numbers of non-standard animals to high welfare standards and returning all the by-products, the skins and the horns, all of which have a market.

""More industrial-scale operations have proved themselves incapable of delivering on this. Hopefully, we may now see the start of real change.""

Can mobile units offer a solution?

Mobile abattoirs could help plug some of the gaps left by the closures of small abattoirs and provide a solution for many producers and retailers.

Such facilities successfully operate within tight regulatory regimes in European countries, as well as Canada, New Zealand and the US.

Used in combination with CCTV cameras and constructive government and regulatory engagement, the industry believes this model has advantages for animal welfare.

One mobile slaughter unit is already in operation at Fir Farm in Gloucestershire and also at Elston Farm in Devon, but it was a lengthy process to work through the regulation.

For example, a Food Standards Agency licence is not only needed for the mobile unit itself, but for each farm using it; there is also a requirement for those farms to have certain facilities available.

Whether mobile units can be financially viable with the current business model is yet to be established, though setting up farmer hubs is one idea being explored by Fir Farm - for the unit to be sited in one location with local farmers travelling to it.

In 2020, the Scottish government also commissioned a study looking at the economics and sustainability of mobile abattoirs.

This showed the capital cost associated with this model was, at that time, more than £800,000.

The challenge from the absence of local slaughtering services in Scotland is particularly acute, especially so in the Highlands and Islands.

The payment rate of £69/ha on offer to Welsh farmers under the Habitat Wales Scheme (HWS) has been described as an ""insult to nature"".

The Nature Friendly Farming Network (NFFN) is the latest body to publicly criticise the HWS, the scheme that will bridge the gap between Glastir and the new Sustainable Farming Scheme (SFS).

Its steering group chairman, Carmarthenshire livestock farmer Hywel Morgan, who currently has a Glastir contract, calculates that he stands to lose £3,200/year.

See also: ""˜No more cash' for Habitat Wales Scheme, says Griffiths

""£69/ha is an insult to nature,"" said Mr Morgan, who farms beef and sheep at Esgairllaethdy Myddfai, Llandovery, in Carmarthenshire.

He is not alone. Joint research by NFFN, the Soil Association and other organisations points to ""massive reductions"" in payments ranging from 47% to more than 90%.

The organisation is now warning that farmers who have done the most for nature will be penalised.

It suggests that the reductions in payments are so severe that some may cease working on their land.

""I'm looking at a fair drop from around £5,000 in payments to about £1,800, while organic farmers are facing a double blow with the end of both organic and Glastir payments,"" said Mr Morgan.

""Some farmers who have been organic for years are looking at allowing intensive dairy farming and fertiliser use on their land just to get income in, while others are thinking of planting their whole farm with trees.""

Organic scheme fears

NFFN worries that the loss of a whole-farm organic scheme will lead to farms de-certifying.

Under the current proposals for the HWS, payments will be capped, which means that only the first 200ha of habitat land will be eligible for 100% of the payment rate, according to NFFN.

It will fall to 50% for between 200-400ha and 10% for bigger land areas.

NFFN is now urging the government to extend current Glastir contracts until 2025, when the SFS begins, and offer the HWS payments to new entrants who have not previously been in agri-environment schemes.

It also wants organic support payments to be maintained.

But the Welsh government said it was facing an ""incredibly difficult financial situation'' and had been clear that Glastir could not be extended due to EU funding ending. 

""We want all farmers in Wales to have the opportunity to apply for support to protect habitat land and contribute to meeting our climate change and biodiversity commitments ahead of the Sustainable Farming Scheme opening in 2025. 

""This is why we have opened the Habitat Wales Scheme for 2024,'' said a spokesperson.

""Organic farms, especially extensive grassland systems, are well placed to apply for the Habitat Wales Scheme.""

Should the days of farmers targeting 13% grain protein for milling wheat quality be over?

After all, typically at least 50% of the greenhouse-gas footprint of growing wheat is associated with nitrogen fertiliser, with higher total emissions for milling wheat than feed.

They also count as Scope 3 emissions within any baked good using milling wheat flour, meaning it is also a problem for millers and bakers.

See also: Ukraine export disruption creates gap in UK millet market

The result is meeting net-zero targets without some combination of a reduction in grain protein, use of alternative sources of nitrogen, or much improved nitrogen-use efficiency, which is likely to be a challenge for the milling and baking industries.

Add the pressure from the direct environmental impact of N use, and higher fertiliser prices, albeit ones that have been supported by milling wheat premiums allowing the continued justification of the use of rates by growers to target 13% protein, and some would argue it should be a recipe for change.

But how easy will the milling and baking industry find it to change, while continuing to mass produce the bread the consumer likes and buys?

It is not straightforward, according to Joe Brennan, technical manager for the millers' trade association, UK Flour Millers.

A trend away from Group 1 varieties started before the fertiliser price hike, partly due to the high input nature of milling wheat production, with last year acting as a further catalyst for growers to rethink how they are using nitrogen, he says.

""But unfortunately, it is not easy for millers to just use grain below 13% protein.""

Gluten is key

Protein is the key driver of flour functionality, he explains, with two in wheat - gliadin and glutenin - forming gluten when in contact with water. ""Gluten is what gives the end product its structure and shape.""

Both protein quality and quantity are important to millers and bakers, as either too little or weak gluten leads to a dense, coarse, crumbly, poor-quality loaf.

Bread made with lower protein content will also likely have a reduced shelf life, while the interaction between salt and protein means salt reduction targets in bread requires stronger protein.

But wheat quality at intake is measured in protein percent and is effectively a surrogate test for functional quality, Mr Brennan says.

That is partly due to time. Grain-protein levels can be quickly analysed at intake, while doing functional quality tests require the grain to be milled, make a dough, tested, and then baked - a much longer process that is not practically feasible.

Nevertheless, millers often show a degree of flexibility by offering fallbacks on contracts in the event protein targets are missed, and some contracts will even specify a lower level of protein where the miller has a specific use that doesn't require the standard range.

Why 13% protein?

Consistency of supply is crucial to millers, stresses George Marriage, director of miller's W&H Marriage & Sons, based in Essex, with the 13% level proving a much more consistent proxy for quality than a lower level.

""Millers are trying to supply a product that is reasonably good for the whole market, and it's clear that 13% protein is pretty much universal for what's needed.

“You only need to look at the current £60/t premium for 13% protein over feed wheat to see what the market wants.”

He adds that if there was an ability for millers to use much lower protein wheat, you would see them doing that, especially this year when proteins have been generally low.

Milling industry customers are wedded to using protein level as a proxy for quality, Mr Brennan points out.

""That's quite difficult to manage. We've seen this year some flours even at lower protein provide the functionality to give the quality the baker wants, but they still want the higher protein percentage.

Functionality not protein

""I think there's an educational piece for the milling industry to talk to its customers and explain to them about stopping thinking in terms of pure protein and think more in terms of functionality.""

But until there's a quick test for functionality, it's unlikely there will be much change to how quality is measured from farm to mill.

There is also seemingly not much impetus to reshape the breadmaking process within the industry currently.

""I suspect there needs to be more market or regulatory pressure to get the ball rolling,"" suggests Mr Brennan.

""Perhaps a consistently lower protein wheat crop might provide the impetus on the raw ingredient side. But what equally could happen without any other changes is we'd increase the proportion of high-protein imports.

""I don't think anyone wants that - it doesn't benefit farmers or millers as they have to pay more for their wheat, and it won't benefit the environment as Canadian or German growers are still applying nitrogen, and then there's the carbon cost of transport.""

Breeding solution?

That probably leaves wheat breeders, rightly or wrongly, as being seen as the main source of solutions.

There are two potential angles researchers and breeders are looking at: finding traits that improve nitrogen-use efficiency to help use lower amounts of nitrogen to reach 13% protein, and finding ways to improve the functional quality of the protein produced, which might allow lower grain protein to be used.

An example of how researchers are looking to improve nitrogen-use efficiency is through a trait known as grain-protein deviation.

Typically, there is a negative trade-off between yield and protein - increasing one, usually decreases the other.  

Grain-protein deviation is a way to break that trade-off, by getting more protein into the grain for the amount of N added, explains Rothamsted Research's Peter Shewry.

""Some varieties consistently have higher protein than you would expect from their yield at the same fertiliser level, so we know it's a genetic trait.""

Molecular markers

Through quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, researchers are trying to identify molecular markers for genes that could be used in breeding, which lead to a change in grain-protein deviation, he explains.

It is a slow process despite all the genetic resources that have been generated by John Innes Centre and through the Niab Diverse Magic project.

Ultimately, the current aim is to have varieties where nitrogen could be optimised for yield while not needing extra nitrogen to make breadmaking quality.

Nitrogen-use efficiency could also potentially be improved by understanding what controls senescence, Prof Shewry says.

""The reason that crops staying green gives higher yields is you delay senescence, but it also delays protein transport into the grain, so you end up with lower protein.

“So what you want is a late senescence, but a complete breakdown in the leaves to get as much protein transported as possible.""

Grain-protein quality

When it comes to grain-protein quality, a higher proportion of glutenin, which determines dough strength, is key, says Nick Fradgley, who has recently completed a PhD on the genetic control of milling and baking quality, while at Niab.

Elasticity or dough strength has traditionally been a weakness of older wheat breadmaking varieties, so over time breeders have aimed to breed varieties with a higher proportion of glutenin to make the gluten stronger so bakers can get away with less protein overall, he explains.

That has resulted in protein levels dropping from 14-15%, sometimes achieved in much lower yielding heritage wheats to the 13% target currently used.

""But the aim now is to increase the strength of glutenin even more, which might allow protein to drop a bit further,"" Dr Fradgley suggests.

German quality wheats show there is potential for greater elasticity or strength at lower protein contents, Prof Shewry notes.

""I think there is enough variation to make it a viable target, if you can develop a way of economically breeding for it,"" he concludes.

Elasticity or dough strength has traditionally been a weakness of older wheat breadmaking varieties, so over time breeders have aimed to breed varieties with a higher proportion of glutenin to make the gluten stronger so bakers can get away with less protein overall, he explains.

That has resulted in protein levels dropping from 14-15%, sometimes achieved in much lower yielding heritage wheats to the 13% target currently used.

""But the aim now is to increase the strength of glutenin even more, which might allow protein to drop a bit further,"" Dr Fradgley suggests.

German quality wheats show there is potential for greater elasticity or strength at lower protein contents, Prof Shewry notes.

""I think there is enough variation to make it a viable target, if you can develop a way of economically breeding for it,"" he concludes.

Farmers should think of calf management in the same way as looking after a baby, ensuring they are provided with a dry, draught-free bedroom, warm living room and clean kitchen. 

This is the advice of independent calf specialist Stuart Fry of the Complete Calf Consultancy.

Stuart, and Alison Clark from Progiene Dairy Hygiene, suggest the following ways farmers can ensure calves are housed correctly and remain healthy:

See also: Advice on supportive care of scouring calves

If a calf gets a poor start, it will never reach its full potential.

Case study: Highbury Holsteins, County Tyrone

Hygiene is key to keeping calf mortality below 2% at Dr Amanda Dunn's family farm in County Tyrone.

Amanda is the calf rearer on the farm, which runs a 130-head autumn block-calving Holstein herd.

She puts her calves’ good health partly down to housing them in an open-fronted shed in groups of six, following building alterations six years ago.

The farm takes a ""regimental"" approach to rearing youngstock.

Boots are washed and dipped on entry to the calf housing and disinfectant is renewed regularly.

Cows are milked immediately after giving birth, using a portable milker, and calves are licked dry and then transported to the calf house.

Every calf receives 4 litres of colostrum within one hour of birth and, at the next milking, is offered 2-3 litres via a teat bucket.

They are then fed transition milk for 12-14 days before moving on to a milk replacer from 15 days until five weeks. They are gradually weaned at between five and 10 weeks.

Simple system

“It’s a simple system,” says Amanda. “The feeder’s height is so important [so] calves are reaching up, opening their [oesophageal] grooves [to avoid the risk of ruminal bloat]. Consistency is key.""

All calves are individually penned using hurdles that are then removed after the first week of life.

This means they are housed from the start with the calves they will be grouped with, eliminating the stress of moving between pens.

Calves are kept warm with coats and heat lamps in extreme cold when needed.

Hygiene is essential in keeping calves healthy, with feeders washed after every feed and then dipped in acid. The youngest calves are also fed first.

Dry feed is offered from the start, and clean water is provided on a daily basis. “We also fill half-blue barrels with eating straws to discourage calves from eating off the floor,"" she says.

“You’ve got to be good all round to keep calf mortality low,” she adds.

Stuart Fry, Alison Clark and Amanda Dunn were speaking at a Calf Chat webinar, organised by Bonanza Calf Nutrition.

Farmers and vets are being called on to be more inclusive and provide positive experiences during placements for student vets to increase the number of farm vets.

It follows a survey carried out by the student-led National Farm Animal Veterinary Society (FAVS), which found students who experience negative experiences while on placements are less likely to consider a career as a farm vet.

See also: 4 ways to improve farm vet recruitment and retention rates

Poor retention and recruitment rates are already plaguing the profession.

Farmers Weekly carried out a survey of 400 vets and farmers in 2021 and found similar concerns.

FAVS surveyed 180 UK vet students to find out why more new graduates were deciding not to work in large animal practices.

When questioned, 86% of students said they had considered becoming farm vets, with the remaining 14% undecided.

Students said the following points deterred them from becoming farm vets:

Positive experiences are vital

The survey found students who had positive experiences while on extramural study placements were more likely to become farm vets.

In fact, 74% of students said positive experiences while on placement had made them consider this role.

In comparison, 6% reported negative experiences and said they were less likely to become a farm vet because of them.

Students who had negative experiences listed:

Lack of diversity

A lack of diversity within the veterinary industry could also be discouraging students, with 57% of students believing the industry is not diverse enough.

A further 21% said they did not feel represented, and 20% felt unsure.

Reasons for under-representation included:

Georgia Owen, a student at the Royal Veterinary College and national FAVS president, said while it is promising that many students are still considering a career as a farm vet in the UK, it is concerning that many feel unrepresented and believe the profession lacks diversity.

""To encourage the widest possible range of graduates into farm vet practice, employers and vets should be conscious of student experiences while on placement and aim to provide a supportive and welcoming environment, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or socioeconomic background,"" she advised.

How can the industry make a change?

Frontier investigates ""˜greener' fertilisers

Provided by



Frontier's commitment to sustainability is woven into all of our operations and the work we do with farmers, suppliers and partners.

At the very heart of this is sustainable crop production; working with farmers to support long term, viable farming systems that increase the longevity of arable businesses, encourage high-quality food production and help our farmed landscape to become more resilient.""¯""¯

The implementation of a sustainable crop production system requires a holistic approach to overall farm management. What works on one farm may not always be right for another.

We have created a crop production sustainability model that covers""¯seven focus areas: soil health, crop growth cycle, environmental management, compliance, carbon management, digital solutions and regenerative agriculture. By exploring the ways they are linked, we help farmers to take a considered, whole-farm approach to achieving sustainability objectives.

Find out more at frontierag.co.uk/sustainable-crop-production

Whether enhancing nutrient use efficiency or reducing emissions associated with production, several technologies and products are being developed to make fertiliser more sustainable.

At Frontier Agriculture, national crop nutrition technical manager, Edward Downing and lead on sustainability, Jim Stotzka, look at what's available now and what else is being explored.

""The common aim across these ""˜greener' products is to reduce the environmental impact of the fertiliser used to grow a crop,"" explains Edward. ""Although most involve nitrogen as that's the biggest burden for carbon emissions, we're also looking at some P&K products.

""Different types of products can reduce emissions in different ways, so with that comes the need to adopt different approaches.""

One product already available is Nutrino Pro, a crop safe second-generation foliar product which also contains biostimulants to improve nitrogen uptake and assimilation by the plant.

""It works very well in crops such as oilseed rape and maize by extending canopy duration to improve crop yield and quality,"" says Edward. ""It allows you to replace a proportion of soil-applied nitrogen for the same crop performance.""

Organo-mineral products are another option. These take existing materials, such as poultry manure or digestate, and process and fortify them into spreadable pellets so they can be accurately applied like normal mineral fertiliser, but with a significantly lower carbon footprint.

""We tested two new products last year and they looked very promising, although higher usage rates due to a lower nutrient content need to be considered,"" adds Edward.

Microbial biostimulants, like BlueN, use endophytic bacteria to fix atmospheric nitrogen inside non-leguminous plants, so they could have a role to play in reducing N rates to support more sustainable crop nutrition too.

BlueN is currently in trials with Frontier, and findings so far show that it could have exciting potential.

""I've been working with microbial biostimulants for almost 10 years and BlueN is the most promising product I've encountered,"" says Frontier lead on sustainability, Jim Stotzka.

""Finding a bacterium that can be sprayed on crops such as wheat and which fixes nitrogen in a field situation is something of a Holy Grail – the process is fraught with difficulties.""

With decades of academic research and more than 15 years spent trying to make the concept available, one of the reasons BlueN is interesting is that its bacterium (Methylobacterium symbioticum) is different from other products which have been investigated.

BlueN's bacterium is motile, so when it is sprayed onto the plant canopy it moves across the leaf surface and enters the plant via the stomata. It then forms a symbiotic relationship with it, fixing atmospheric nitrogen into ammonium and then amino acids.

Unlike some other products, it colonises the entire plant and stays active for the duration of the crop's life.

Frontier will trial BlueN this year to investigate its efficiency and if successful, the product may be available for growers' own trials next year.

""If the product is effective then significant savings in applied nitrogen applications may be possible,"" adds Jim.

Jim Stotzka © Frontier

Fertiliser manufacturers are also working to reduce the carbon footprint of conventional nitrogen production, with the ultimate aim of producing blue ammonia (where carbon emissions are captured) and green ammonia (where ammonia is produced from green hydrogen using renewable energy). ""These developments are coming but are understandably a huge investment,"" comments Edward.

""Finally, there are other biostimulants aimed at improving nitrogen assimilation and uptake, such as IntraCrop's Status. These products can be used alongside any fertiliser product to improve nitrogen use efficiency and minimise the amount of fertiliser required. Going forward, we'll have to use a combination of all these approaches.""

While demand for products with a lower environmental impact grows, Frontier is committed to trialling and testing them thoroughly to help farmers understand how they best fit into different crop production systems. ""Ultimately, it's vital to base adoption on sound trials and science,"" Edward concludes.

921,"Farmland values continue to rise in early 2023","https://www.fwi.co.uk/business/markets-and-trends/land-markets/farmland-values-continue-to-rise-in-early-2023","Farmland values continue to rise in early 2023

Land values have continued to rise in the first quarter of 2023, with most agents expecting the slightly increased supply to continue through the year.

January to March saw values for bare land rise by between 1.6% and 2%, according to Savills and Knight Frank respectively.

See also: Keep up with energy efficiency rules for commercial lets on farms

More land was marketed in all English regions than their 10-year averages, except for the East Midlands, says Savills, whose figures now include tenanted acres.

The first quarter of 2023 saw 16,700 acres launched across Britain, the most since 2016, and 30% more than in the same period of 2022.

In contrast, just 1,600 acres have been put up for sale in Scotland, compared with the 10-year average of 2,600 acres.

The area in Wales has fallen 21% compared with January to March 2022.

Pasture leads the rise

The rise in in value for both grade 3 pasture land and poorer quality pasture continues, reflecting that nature-based solutions on these land types are still driving values, says Savills.

Compared with March 2022, poorer quality pasture in Great Britain was worth 12.9% more in March this year, the highest rise across all land types.

Prime arable land in the north and east of England is the most valuable, at £10,800/acre and £10,500/acre respectively.

""Interest in commercial farms and land has been encouraging and plenty has been from farmers with rollover funds to invest, who have a limited timescale for reinvestment,"" said Alex Lawson, Savills' head of rural agency.

Scotland continues to draw strong interest from English buyers and the firm has several good commercial holdings to launch from April to June.

Evelyn Channing, Savills' head of rural agency for the country, said that English buyers tend to account for 25-30% of viewers of farms marketed by the firm, with this rising to 40% in the Borders.

Reasons for selling

The reasons for selling remain varied, said Strutt & Parker.

The high market level and further cuts in basic payments are factors, as is the opportunity to benefit from delinked basic payments after 2024, even after selling land.

A change in government and possible shift in capital tax policy is a driver for some.

""Given this outlook, we expect prices for both arable and pasture land to remain at their current record levels, and possibly increase further,"" said Matt Sudlow, head of estates and farm agency at Strutt & Parker.

Just 20 whole farms covering 4,300 acres were publicly marketed in the first quarter of 2023, one of the lowest numbers in the past 20 years, according to the firm's database.

""The market is expected to return to more normal levels in the spring and summer, as we are seeing a number of instructions from a range of landowners with some quite sizeable farms to sell,"" said Mr Sudlow.

Knight Frank's Farmland Index shows a 2% January-to-March rise in the average value of bare land in England and Wales, to a record £8,728/acre.

""Prices continue to vary significantly, even at a local level, and farms and blocks of land are regularly selling for over £12,000/acre,"" said head of rural research Andrew Shirley.

While there is great interest from environmentally focused buyers, more often than not, they are being outbid by more traditional tax-driven, farmer or amenity buyers.

2022 market values updated

Strutt & Parker's Farmland Database records the sale of all farms, estates and blocks of publicly marketed land in England larger than 100 acres.

With reports from all 2022 sales now in, the revised data shows prices rose more than in the earlier analysis:

Bare land value increases over time

Kent farm manager Jack Woolley is using a grain protein prediction test to help him meet milling wheat protein requirements and so use valuable nitrogen fertiliser as efficiently as possible and protect the environment.

He uses the test in mid-June to assess whether he needs to apply a liquid nitrogen top-up on the ears of his wheat crops to make sure his breadmaking varieties meet the 13% protein content most of the industry demands.

See also: Nitrogen and soil focus helps Norfolk grower win wheat prize

The Velcourt manager, based in east Kent, has hit milling specifications over the last three seasons when using the test across the 300ha of breadmaking varieties he is growing on chalk-based soils just inland from the White Cliffs of Dover.

""We are looking at reducing the risk of not getting the milling premium, while taking into account the cost of nitrogen fertiliser and minimising the environmental impact of the fertiliser,"" he tells Farmers Weekly.

Jack Woolley © MAG/David Jones

Wheat budget

He budgets for an average milling wheat yield of 11t/ha at 13% protein, and last season yields averaged 11.75t/ha with proteins over 13.2% across all his milling wheats, with the variety Crusoe often grown as a first wheat and Skyfall a second.

Velcourt had sometimes struggled to meet milling wheat proteins on this unit, and now sees this as the first useful test to solve what was seen by many as the holy grail of milling wheat production - being able to calculate just the right amount of nitrogen needed to meet milling specifications.

The farming group is now using the prediction test over the 3,600ha of milling wheat it grows on the 56,000ha it farms across the UK, with the cost of the test being £32.50/sample.

The test was devised by Mechteld Blake-Kalff at the independent laboratory Hill Court Farm Research which analyses the roots of the wheat plants rather than take a sample of leaves or young grain, and has proved successful with wheat growers.

Three solid splits

This season, Jack has already applied 270kg/ha of nitrogen in three splits, so will take 10 plant samples across his milling wheat fields in mid-June and look for results within a week as to whether he should apply a further 30kg/ha of nitrogen in liquid form on the wheat ear.

Last season, in the dry spring and early summer his eight results from the test predicted protein levels at 12.1-12.2%, and so it was worth spending an extra £60/ha on 30kg/ha of liquid nitrogen Nufol (20%).

Nick Anderson, the group's head of crop technology, says the foliar urea product when applied at the milky ripe stage (GS71) is likely to show an increase in grain protein content of about 1%.

He adds that 60 separate tests by the company over the past three years have shown the test to be accurate to within 0.4% of grain protein, which is sufficiently accurate to help guide whether or not to apply foliar urea.

Key advantages

He sees three key advantages. Firstly, if the protein prediction test comes back with a low reading, of say 10-11% protein, it will be a waste of money to apply Nufol and the crop should go as feed wheat.

Secondly, it allows Velcourt to manage wheats to be within 1% of the 13% target and then it can top up. Thirdly, in the rare cases when the predicted protein is well above 13% then it can hold back and save on nitrogen.

This season the winter wheats at the four farms which the group manages from Martin Lodge Farm, Martin Mill, just north of Dover, were largely drilled in the first week of October.

In January, soils were analysed with a soil nitrogen supply plus (SNS-plus) test to ascertain three values - nitrogen in the soil, nitrogen in the growing crop and finally nitrogen likely to be mineralised through the growing season.

""An accurate understanding of SNS is the starting point for good nitrogen fertiliser decisions,” says Nick.

The wheat crops of Crusoe and Skyfall received 70kg/ha of solid urea at the end of February, then 100kg/ha of liquid urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) in mid- to late March, and finally 100kg/ha of solid ammonium nitrogen in mid- to late April.

There was no application of nitrogen at the traditional flag-leaf timing in May.

Nitrogen spread 

The spread of nitrogen types is to fit in with farm workloads on the sprayer or fertiliser spreader, and the ability of the crops to take up the different forms at different times of the year.

""Work with YEN has shown that crop biomass has been a limiting factor in some cases, especially during recent dry early spring conditions.

We have found that sufficient early applications have helped to reduce this risk,"" adds Nick. The Yield Enhancement Network (YEN) is a yield competition run by crop consultants Adas.

The farm is achieving more than 65% nitrogen use efficiency with its wheat crops, which it calculates as nitrogen removed (grain nitrogen multiplied by yield) divided by total nitrogen inputs (SNS-plus applied nitrogen) multiplied by 100. 

Fungicide regimes are devised to counter Skyfall's susceptibility to yellow rust and that of Crusoe to brown rust.

Skyfall receives a T0 of the azole tebuconazole and a T1 of Elatus Era (SDHI benzovindiflupyr + azole prothioconazole) plus multisite folpet and a T2 of Univoq (picolinamide fenpicoxamid + prothioconazole).

Crusoe has no T0, and a T1 and T2 both of Revystar (SDHI fluxapyroxad plus azole mefentrifluconazole) plus folpet. T3 sprays have yet to be confirmed.

Protein prediction test

Dr Blake-Kalff says her laboratory tested about 500 samples last season and says that most growers who use the test come back every season due to the accuracy of the results.

""The beauty of the test is that you can sample through the month of June and then be able to adjust a final fertiliser application to make up any potential protein shortfall identified, or cut out the application and save money if the predicted protein is sufficient,"" she says.

Her initial work had focused on testing wheat leaves for sugar content, which accumulates if there is insufficient nitrogen from the protein. Unfortunately, results varied depending on how sunny the weather was at the time of sampling, so the focus then switched to the roots, and how much nitrogen is being taken up from the soil.

Examination of cleaned wheat roots gives a very accurate indication whether the rest of the plant has enough nitrogen to produce the required protein in the grain.

With the samples being taken six-to-eight weeks before harvest, there is still a need for good sunlight levels and therefore good photosynthesis for the added nitrogen to be assembled into protein, she adds.

“We cannot control the weather conditions, but by getting the nitrogen supply right we give ourselves the best chance to achieve milling specification,” adds Dr Blake-Kalff.

Traditional breadmaking standards

Crusoe has no T0, and a T1 and T2 both of Revystar (SDHI fluxapyroxad plus azole mefentrifluconazole) plus folpet. T3 sprays have yet to be confirmed.

Protein prediction test

Dr Blake-Kalff says her laboratory tested about 500 samples last season and says that most growers who use the test come back every season due to the accuracy of the results.

""The beauty of the test is that you can sample through the month of June and then be able to adjust a final fertiliser application to make up any potential protein shortfall identified, or cut out the application and save money if the predicted protein is sufficient,"" she says.

Her initial work had focused on testing wheat leaves for sugar content, which accumulates if there is insufficient nitrogen from the protein. Unfortunately, results varied depending on how sunny the weather was at the time of sampling, so the focus then switched to the roots, and how much nitrogen is being taken up from the soil.

Examination of cleaned wheat roots gives a very accurate indication whether the rest of the plant has enough nitrogen to produce the required protein in the grain.

With the samples being taken six-to-eight weeks before harvest, there is still a need for good sunlight levels and therefore good photosynthesis for the added nitrogen to be assembled into protein, she adds.

“We cannot control the weather conditions, but by getting the nitrogen supply right we give ourselves the best chance to achieve milling specification,” adds Dr Blake-Kalff.

Kent farm manager Jack Woolley is using a grain protein prediction test to help him meet milling wheat protein requirements and so use valuable nitrogen fertiliser as efficiently as possible and protect the environment.

He uses the test in mid-June to assess whether he needs to apply a liquid nitrogen top-up on the ears of his wheat crops to make sure his breadmaking varieties meet the 13% protein content most of the industry demands.

The Velcourt manager, based in east Kent, has hit milling specifications over the last three seasons when using the test across the 300ha of breadmaking varieties he is growing on chalk-based soils just inland from the White Cliffs of Dover.

""We are looking at reducing the risk of not getting the milling premium, while taking into account the cost of nitrogen fertiliser and minimising the environmental impact of the fertiliser,"" he tells Farmers Weekly.

Wheat budget

He budgets for an average milling wheat yield of 11t/ha at 13% protein, and last season yields averaged 11.75t/ha with proteins over 13.2% across all his milling wheats, with the variety Crusoe often grown as a first wheat and Skyfall a second.

Velcourt had sometimes struggled to meet milling wheat proteins on this unit, and now sees this as the first useful test to solve what was seen by many as the holy grail of milling wheat production - being able to calculate just the right amount of nitrogen needed to meet milling specifications.

The farming group is now using the prediction test over the 3,600ha of milling wheat it grows on the 56,000ha it farms across the UK, with the cost of the test being £32.50/sample.

The test was devised by Mechteld Blake-Kalff at the independent laboratory Hill Court Farm Research which analyses the roots of the wheat plants rather than take a sample of leaves or young grain, and has proved successful with wheat growers.

Three solid splits

This season, Jack has already applied 270kg/ha of nitrogen in three splits, so will take 10 plant samples across his milling wheat fields in mid-June and look for results within a week as to whether he should apply a further 30kg/ha of nitrogen in liquid form on the wheat ear.

Last season, in the dry spring and early summer his eight results from the test predicted protein levels at 12.1-12.2%, and so it was worth spending an extra £60/ha on 30kg/ha of liquid nitrogen Nufol (20%).

Nick Anderson, the group's head of crop technology, says the foliar urea product when applied at the milky ripe stage (GS71) is likely to show an increase in grain protein content of about 1%.

He adds that 60 separate tests by the company over the past three years have shown the test to be accurate to within 0.4% of grain protein, which is sufficiently accurate to help guide whether or not to apply foliar urea.

Key advantages

He sees three key advantages. Firstly, if the protein prediction test comes back with a low reading, of say 10-11% protein, it will be a waste of money to apply Nufol and the crop should go as feed wheat.

Secondly, it allows Velcourt to manage wheats to be within 1% of the 13% target and then it can top up. Thirdly, in the rare cases when the predicted protein is well above 13% then it can hold back and save on nitrogen.

This season the winter wheats at the four farms which the group manages from Martin Lodge Farm, Martin Mill, just north of Dover, were largely drilled in the first week of October.

In January, soils were analysed with a soil nitrogen supply plus (SNS-plus) test to ascertain three values - nitrogen in the soil, nitrogen in the growing crop and finally nitrogen likely to be mineralised through the growing season.

""An accurate understanding of SNS is the starting point for good nitrogen fertiliser decisions,” says Nick.

The wheat crops of Crusoe and Skyfall received 70kg/ha of solid urea at the end of February, then 100kg/ha of liquid urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) in mid- to late March, and finally 100kg/ha of solid ammonium nitrogen in mid- to late April.

There was no application of nitrogen at the traditional flag-leaf timing in May.

Nitrogen spread 

The spread of nitrogen types is to fit in with farm workloads on the sprayer or fertiliser spreader, and the ability of the crops to take up the different forms at different times of the year.

""Work with YEN has shown that crop biomass has been a limiting factor in some cases, especially during recent dry early spring conditions.

We have found that sufficient early applications have helped to reduce this risk,"" adds Nick. The Yield Enhancement Network (YEN) is a yield competition run by crop consultants Adas.

The farm is achieving more than 65% nitrogen use efficiency with its wheat crops, which it calculates as nitrogen removed (grain nitrogen multiplied by yield) divided by total nitrogen inputs (SNS-plus applied nitrogen) multiplied by 100. 

Fungicide regimes are devised to counter Skyfall's susceptibility to yellow rust and that of Crusoe to brown rust.

Skyfall receives a T0 of the azole tebuconazole and a T1 of Elatus Era (SDHI benzovindiflupyr + azole prothioconazole) plus multisite folpet and a T2 of Univoq (picolinamide fenpicoxamid + prothioconazole).

Crusoe has no T0, and a T1 and T2 both of Revystar (SDHI fluxapyroxad plus azole mefentrifluconazole) plus folpet. T3 sprays have yet to be confirmed.

Wheat variety Theodore has been placed on the AHDB's first brown rust watch list, with growers advised to remain vigilant for the disease and treat with rust-active fungicides where disease pressure merits it.

Based on trial data, the Recommended List (RL) ratings reveal what has happened in recent seasons, not what will happen.

See also: Why grain maize is key break crop in arable farmer's rotation

To help bring a more predictive element to wheat growing, the AHDB released the first yellow rust watch list in 2021.

This year sees the first brown rust watch list, and it highlights Theodore, bred by DSV UK.

It is one of two varieties with a brown rust resistance score of 8 (on a scale from 1 to 9, where 9 shows the most resistance), only bettered by Skyfall with its 9 rating.

Catherine Harries, AHDB senior crop protection scientist, said the list aimed to highlight any varieties that appear to be “misbehaving” in RL trials.  

The Group 4 wheat stood out at an RL trial site in Devon with a relatively high level of brown rust (18.8%). At this site, only Crusoe, with a brown rust rating of 3, had more disease (25%).

Interestingly, the UK Cereal Pathogen Virulence Survey (UKCPVS) received a brown rust sample from Theodore just down the coast (Dorset).

""The sampler noted infection levels of 3%, in addition to relatively high disease levels (up to 10%) in some patches. This is much higher than would be expected for a variety with a disease rating of 8,"" said the AHDB.

UKCPVS growth room screening tests, conducted in 2022, suggest that the Dorset isolate may be able to unlock a specific resistance gene.

DSV UK wheat breeder Matt Kerton said after monitoring DSV brown rust nurseries across the country, the company has noticed a clear pattern emerging, with some breeding lines susceptible to a Crusoe race of brown rust and others to a Stigg race.

He added that the Crusoe race was much more prevalent, but researchers were starting to see more of the Stigg race occurring, and Theodore appeared to be susceptible to this rarer race.

“We believe Theodore remains a sound choice for growers looking for excellent yellow rust and septoria resistance, but urge them to be vigilant about the new races of brown rust being seen in some parts of the country, and not miss later fungicide applications.""

How to profit from your surplus lambs in 2023

Provided by



Volac the maker of Ecosyl - a silage additive independently proven to increase milk yield from silage*.

As well as providing scientifically-researched additives for a range of silage crops, Volac conducts research into other aspects of silage-making - such as wilting, and the benefits of multi-cut grass.

Volac's UK team of silage experts is well-placed to offer guidance on enhanced silage techniques - whether cutting, wilting, treating, harvesting, clamping or feeding.

Learn more at: www.ecosyl.com or www.cuttoclamp.com. Or e-mail: info@ecosyl.com

* Based on independent dairy cow trials which have shown that feeding a range of silage crops preserved with Ecosyl boosted milk yield by an average of 1.2 litres/cow/day.

With UK lamb prices expected to mirror the trend of the last couple of years and remain firm into 2023 due to low domestic supply against solid demand within the EU, sheep industry commentators believe it will pay farmers to rear as many healthy lambs as possible come lambing time.

Stacey Bruna from Volac says that each year every flock will have some lambs that either need to be adopted onto another ewe or be reared off another mother.

But deciding which rearing route to take will depend on the availability of a suitable foster mother and the physical condition of the lamb.

""Cross-fostering will only be successful if the lamb is fit and healthy, has had adequate colostrum, and is fostered onto a healthy ewe with plenty of milk and good maternal instincts,"" she explains.

""However, surplus lambs can be reared very effectively and without all the inherent practical problems of fostering onto an unwilling ewe.

""With good husbandry, organisation and Lamlac ewe milk replacer, there's no doubt you can produce good quality lambs to sell in 2023 alongside those reared on any ewe, as well as save hours of effort and hassle.""

© Volac International Limited

How to rear surplus lambs:

Feeding enough Lamlac alongside fresh water, roughage and small amounts of a good quality creep feed refreshed daily is the key to healthy, profitable growth. When using Lamlac, it really is as easy as one, two, three:

To rear a surplus lamb effectively, simply feed 10kg of Lamlac (across the milk feeding period) mixed with water at the rate of 200g per litre; and then wean the lamb abruptly when it reaches 35 days of age.

Ad-lib feeding of surplus lambs

Stacey Bruna explains that with ad-lib feeding, milk replacer is fed using a teated bucket such as the Volac Ewe2 (for up to 20 lambs) or the Ewe2 Plus (for up to 40 lambs).

""The Ewe2 and Ewe2 Plus bucket feeders sit outside the lamb-rearing pen, ensuring optimum safety and avoiding wasteful spillages.""

She suggests starting lambs on restricted warm milk until trained (1 litre split into four or five 200-250ml feeds per day).

""Training normally takes one to three days, after which time you can allow your lambs ad-lib access to milk.""

© Volac International Limited

Using a computerised feeder

Alternatively, using an automatic computerised feeder such as the Volac ECO Feeder can dramatically cut the time spent mixing milk and feeding lambs.

""However, a high level of management and hygiene is essential.

""With computerised feeders, milk is consumed little and often, which means faster lamb growth rates and less risk of digestive upsets.

""However, the machine should be cleaned daily and calibrated at least once a week, and between batches of milk powder,"" she advises.
