Happy farmers keep our environment healthy

Why import food from the other side of the world when it can be produced, responsibly, in Britain?

Sheep, cows, goats, pigs and chickens are all variously blamed for their contribution towards climate change. Those who are against eating meat are vocal in their insistence on this issue, but the data does not necessarily support their argument. 

Until around 100 years ago, the human population had remained reasonably steady, but since then it has exploded: from over a billion to more than eight billion in a century. To survive and move forward, we use every resource we can find from our planet to make our lives easier and more comfortable. Everything is for us: we keep changing, restlessly improving things, rarely contemplating what we already have. 

While we acknowledge that we cannot yet map our own brains with all their infinite connections and imaginative possibilities, we are less good at admitting that neither can we map, let alone replace, the infinite intricacies of the natural world on which we are so dependent. We try: some of us study fungi; others observe the patterns of butterfly migration; some research the importance of coral reefs; others are experts in ancient oak pastures. The diversity and beauty of our planet is unparalleled. 

The earth and its climate has undoubtedly changed over time, but it has become impossible not to admit that we are forcing the pace of that change. At this rate, neither those with whom we share our world nor we ourselves will be able to continue as we are. Some may not survive. Hollywood and those who seek new pastures talk about moving off planet once we have laid waste to this one. Once again, however, that is a scenario that puts us first rather than thinking about the world we would leave behind. Nor is it likely in the near future. 

The question is how we restore balance to the natural world - and in few areas is the debate as fierce as over what we eat. Food production is not only necessary for our survival, it is a central part of most human cultures. Eating together has been the essential heart of human life for millennia: of politics, of mating habits and of entertainment. Think how many scenes in Downton Abbey were set around the Dining Room table, exciting much interest about both the etiquette of dining and the menus. 

Ingredients, however, do not just magic themselves onto the shiny metal and glass shelves of supermarkets. The flour and eggs for baking, beef for a stew, lamb for a shepherd's pie, apples for a lunchtime snack, plums for jam and so on all come from our farms. 

As visitors arrive at Highclere, where food - afternoon tea, for example - is often part of their tour, they drive through a landscape dotted with sheep. They cannot see the little herd of pigs, but just over the horizon and all around are fields of wheat, barley and oats. In the spring, there might be rape, beans to put nitrogen back into the soil, and borders of maize, as well as wild flowers, wandering hedges and peaceful woodland. 

It is all interrelated and the land benefits from the diversity. The number of wild bird species is increasing, deer and hedgehogs are free to roam, and most visitors see at least some of the wildlife with which we share this space during their visit. It is all about balance and long rotation. There is shade and space, shelter in the winter, and useful fence posts for a long slow scratch by the pigs: a farmer's care for the land. 

As farmers, Geordie and I try to balance stewardship with profitability. Everyone needs to be able to earn a living and all countries should at least be partially self-supporting. The service industries and manufacturing are only part of the equation. It not only adds to the environmental impact to import food from the other side of the world. It is not sensible to be almost solely reliant on imports to feed your population. 

Rewilding is part of the countryside story but we cannot eat the trees that politicians propose we plant. We should grow at least some of our own food and for that farmers need support. As farming support dies away, it has been estimated that the UK could lose 75 per cent of its wheat production over the next five years. Will we import from Ukraine or the US? The wheat would have to travel miles and it would give us no food resilience. 

In the UK, farmers look after their animals well, nurture the land, sell locally and share their traditions. Farms are just as important as factories and are infinitely better for both the environment and for the land. The clearing of the skies, rivers and streams, the drop in pollution levels and increase in wildlife that occurred when so much human activity ceased during Covid surely proved that farm animals, who continued to go about their business, were the least of the environment's problems.

Science our best bet to fight and beat food insecurity

It is critical that global leaders invest in the tools needed to make the agriculture sector more resilient and foods more nutritious

In July this year, India halted the export of basmati rice to prevent domestic shortages, triggering global spikes in prices. Argentina's worst drought in 60 years cost the agricultural sector $20 billion. And the war between Ukraine and Russia has led to major disruptions of grain exports. 

With changing weather patterns, increased climatic shocks and rising inflation, the confluence of the food and climate crises demands global action. 

This is why now, more than ever, it is critical that global leaders invest in the tools and technologies needed to make the agriculture sector more resilient and foods more nutritious. 

Earlier this week, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak paved the way by announcing a new partnership, at the UK hosted Global Food Security Summit, to drive cutting-edge research on innovations like flood-tolerant ""˜scuba' rice and disease-resistant wheat. 

To back this up, at next month's Dubai based COP meeting, the global food emergency will be a major part of the world's climate agenda. 

Unpredictable and extreme weather patterns are destroying crops and damaging the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and other food producers around the world. 

Global agricultural productivity has declined by nearly 21 percent in the past 60 years due in large part to our climate breakdown and its associated social and economic impacts. Some 780 million people around the world are affected by hunger, a number that will grow millions larger with every degree the world heats. And experts say that by 2050, food production will have to increase 60 per cent to meet growing populations.

Lower-income countries are particularly susceptible to climate change - like Pakistan, which saw a third of its land submerged during devastating floods just over a year ago. Around the world, climate extremes and food insecurity are fueling migration, both within borders and between countries.

But decades-long efforts in agricultural innovation have yielded critical tools and technology. From biofortified sweet potatoes to techniques for better managing soil, water, livestock, and fishstock, there are real examples that when fully realized strengthen food security and reward farmers. 

By increasing investment in research and development, world leaders can foster and scale these groundbreaking solutions to transform food systems and turn the tide on what has become the largest hunger crisis in modern history. 

As the world's largest publicly funded agricultural research network, the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) is uniquely positioned to address these compounding challenges.

Over the past five decades, this unique organization has delivered some of the most important tools to improve agricultural productivity and transform the way we use our land and water. 

Nobel Laureate Dr Norman Borlaug and Professor M.S. Swaminathan, for example, led the creation of a high-yielding rice variety that drove vital increases in food production in the second half of the 20th century - averting a global famine and saving a billion lives.

That research sparked further advances. 

The development of hardier and more nutritious crop varieties, for instance, has reduced infant mortality by 30 percent across the developing world, preventing between three and six million deaths each year. For the 500 million smallholder farmers who produce a third of the world's food while facing severe droughts, flooding, and other erratic weather, producing more climate-resilient crops can now protect growth and economic yields. 

Other new projects are gathering critical data to inform food production, like a regional evapotranspiration network that measures real-time water loss data to foster smarter water management in some of the world's most arid countries across the Middle East and North Africa. 

Scientists are even working on ways to sequester more carbon in land used for agriculture, aiming to provide smallholder farmers with supplemental income by removing the gas from the atmosphere. 

The myriad challenges facing our increasingly scorching world underscore that funding groundbreaking research is a key component to building food security. This week the UK government stepped up, and at COP28 next month other governments will match their commitments. 

A comprehensive new case for $4 billion in investments in CGIAR science explains just how much of a difference more money will make; helping to develop and scale cutting-edge innovations so that they can be readily available to food producers around the world. 

The world has revolutionized the way we produce food before. Today, we must transform our food, land and water systems in the context of a climate crisis to deliver a more secure, sustainable and resilient future. 

This year's emergencies were not anomalies - they reflect a new normal. Science is our best bet to not just fight back against food insecurity, but to beat it.

Kenya's transition to sustainable farming could transform fortunes - and alleviate hunger

Food producers turn hunger to hope with techniques that boost cash crops and secure staples for their own consumption

Justus Ndemwa is sitting on an empty plastic water canister. He looks away. His voice is soft and faltering. ""For five years the rains have failed,"" he says. 

Some days, the 72-year-old, who suffers from anaemia, eats only rice or beans. He is not alone. Now because of the high cost of food and the impacts of climate change, millions of Kenyans face hunger every day. As the situation persists, something, surely, has to change. 

Ndemwa and his three children live in a brick and mud hut no larger than a double bed in a field a few miles from Kauwi town in Kitui County. 

The landscape is sparse: the odd failed corn field, thorny scrub and patches of dry grass. The family lives largely off handouts from people in Kauwi. Ndemwa is waiting for cash transfers from the World Food Programme. Otherwise, he prays. ""I pray so much,"" he says, ""more than five times a day.""

High numbers of people in Kenya have been experiencing hunger, partly because of food shortages and prices being far above their five-year average. In addition to the lack of supply, food price rises are also due to the lingering effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, which caused labour shortages and constrained supply chains. 

On top of this, the war between Russia and Ukraine thwarted fertiliser supplies. It also prompted countries to impose food export controls. Energy price volatility has also created problems for farmers globally. 

In this choppy geopolitical context, some agribusinesses in Kenya are buffering farmers' risks while maintaining food production. One of the largest exporters of green beans to Europe, Frigoken, for example, has for decades created contracts with each of the tens of thousands of smallholders growing the crops.

Well before the harvest, the company agrees on a pre-set price with each farmer for their beans, thereby assuring them a reliable market. Frigoken helps the farmers access inputs like fertiliser on a credit basis. It also exposes the growers to technical knowledge through training programmes delivered by extension workers. As such, both the farmers and the company boost their yields and income. 

""˜I wish my parents farmed this way'

In his lush plot in Muranga County, surrounded by banana and eucalyptus trees, Peter Joroge shares his success growing beans with Frigoken for the past decade: ""In the beginning,"" he says, ""I would get 80 to 100 kg per unit annually. But it has gradually increased to 200 kg per unit. I wish my parents had farmed the way I do,"" he adds, ""because I would have gone to school for longer.""

As well as supporting them with growing cash crops, Frigoken also helps farmers produce staples such as maize for their own consumption. This strengthens smallholders' household food security alongside their longer-term viability as food producers. 

At the Frigoken processing factory in Nairobi, meanwhile, 85 per cent of the workforce is women. Staff receive decent pay, health care and pension plans. There's even a crÃ¨che. Contrary to perceptions of corporate agribusinesses exploiting workers to maximise profits, Frigoken supports them and incurs their risk while delivering a commercial return. 

Yet beyond the fallout of the pandemic and the Ukraine war, there's another factor causing hunger in Kenya: climate change. According to data shared by the Kenyan meteorological department, average annual temperatures in Kitui County have risen by 1.9C over the past 40 years. That's more than double the global average. Combine this heat with a prolonged lack of rainfall and no wonder crops are struggling to grow. 

According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis covering the period between March and June 2023, there were 5.4 million ""acutely food insecure"" people in Kenya.  

These people would often go a day or more without eating anything at all. The main cause was drought; in the worst areas, the rains had failed for at least four successive years. This is why the number of people facing such severe hunger had risen steadily since 2020. 

In this desperate situation, farmers, technocrats and politicians must respond to environmental as well as financial challenges. Fortunately, some initiatives offer hope. 

Rosemary Waweru is hoisting a four-metre-high stick into the foliage of a colossal avocado tree. Soon they begin to fall. Thump. Thump. In less than a minute, eight oval fruits have thudded to the ground. She gathers them into a pile, smiling. As large as ostrich eggs, their skins gleam emerald green. 

The 62-year-old manages her own three-acre farm in Kiamuchwe, a village in Kirinyaga County. The countryside is dense with plots of maize, peas, barley and wheat as well as cash crops like avocados, mangoes and bananas. 

Waweru is now crafting her own natural plant-based pesticide as well as a fertiliser made by fermenting chicken feathers in water. She has adopted these practices through the Maendeleo project, a pilot launched in 2022 as a collaboration between the Aga Khan Foundation (AKF) and Frigoken. In switching from chemical to organic, Waweru's methods are improving her soil, plant and native species health.

""Regenerative agriculture is about giving back to the soil,"" says Leigh Winowiecki, a soil scientist at CIFOR-ICRAF in Nairobi. ""For far too long, we have been taking soil for granted. We need to think of soil as our bank account, we cannot continue to draw from it without giving back."" 

Healing bodies and land

In Kenya, the Maendeleo project is giving back. At a national scale, the practices adopted by farmers like Waweru could regenerate entire ecosystems and regulate the water cycle. They can also mitigate greenhouse gas emissions: by dropping chemical inputs, the Kenyan is also helping to reduce the emissions that occur from the manufacture and transport of these synthetic products.

Waweru's new farming practices are not just greener; they're also more productive. Her trees have gone from producing an average of 250 avocados each year to over 350 today. Better still, now that she produces them naturally, she sells them for up to double the amount she could before. 

In less than two years, Maendeleo has had extraordinary results: average maize yields amongst the initial 2,500 farmers targeted in Kirinyaga and Embu counties have grown by 30 per cent, while coffee production has jumped by 60 per cent. Farming ecosystems are flourishing. 

The farmers under the pilot have virtually no input costs anymore. This is the main reason why they're saving around 20 per cent on bills for each crop cycle. Another saving comes from fewer medical bills. Before going organic, many farmers were visiting clinics regularly to treat illnesses caused by exposure to synthetic pesticides.  

Regenerative agriculture is healing bodies as well as the land. It is cheaper for farmers and potentially more productive. Maendeleo is now attracting ""huge"" interest from research institutions, donors and the private sector, says Didier Van Bignoot, the AKF global advisor in sustainable agriculture, food security and climate resilience. Over the coming years, it plans to reach three million smallholder farmers in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.

But the road to end hunger is long. Millions of Kenyans are suffering every day. Tackling such widespread deprivation requires decades-long investments into the building blocks of society: education, health, infrastructure and social protection. And agriculture, too, matters. As Peter Joroge implied, good farming has always been central to development. 

As I write this, some months after visiting Kenya, I remember my impressions from that final day visiting Kitui County. Herders leading bony cattle along dirt tracks. Threadbare fields of maize. Clouds overhead, but no rain. Most of all, that conversation with Justus Ndemwa. It was so muted. Words seemed pointless. 

Yet some extraordinary initiatives are changing things on the ground. Regenerating ecosystems and sustaining livelihoods, they are helping food systems to flourish. Donors, government and business need to get behind them. Not with more words, though; with action.

Underground colonies of fungi could help us grow stronger, more plentiful food crops

Climate change and booming fertiliser prices prompt scientists to look at natural alternatives, with a little help from genetic modification

Imagine a farmer's field and you're already missing half the picture. Just like the tip of an iceberg, these fields hold a secret underground: vast communities of beneficial microbes in our soil. These microbes are vital to how our crops grow, yet they offer even more potential in helping to sustainably feed a growing world population in the future.

Symbiotic fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria, perhaps the best known of these beneficial microbes, help crops access key nutrients in the soil in exchange for carbon provided through the plant's photosynthesis.

In doing so, they offer a viable, sustainable alternative to the use of chemical fertilisers, which can be expensive and damaging to both the environment and the climate. This is important because, since 1960, global fertiliser consumption has more than quadrupled in order to keep up with rising demand for food, yet this model has come with many trade-offs, including more polluted waterways and significant greenhouse gas emissions.

By helping crops better interact with soil microbes, scientists can reduce the current dependence on fertiliser and help deliver more sustainable and productive farming for the future - from smallholder plots to large commercial farms.

First and foremost, all plants already have the ability to engage with beneficial mycorrhizal fungi, which expand the surface area of their roots to capture critical nutrients, such as nitrates and phosphates, in greater quantities and more efficiently.

However, crops often ""˜turn down' this connection to fungi if they sense sufficient nutrients already in the soil in order to prevent wasting energy. Doing so means that more fertiliser needs to be applied since root systems are less efficient in absorbing nutrients on their own.

If scientists can ensure continuous colonisation of plants by fungi, even where sufficient nutrients are present, by using modern genetic engineering techniques, it could result in substantially less chemical fertiliser being needed, as more will be absorbed after each application.

Likewise, researchers are looking to better understand a soil bacteria called rhizobia, which has a unique ability to convert, or ""˜fix', nitrogen from the air into a form that can be absorbed by plants.

Currently, these bacteria only bond with legume crops like beans, peas and lentils. However, researchers are working towards transferring this same nitrogen-fixing ability to all of our major food crops worldwide, including staple cereals such as maize and rice, as well as those crops which are vital for smallholder farmers across the developing world, such as cassava.

While this is an ambitious goal, with any future nitrogen-fixing cereal still years in the making, its success could transform the face of agriculture across the world, reducing fertiliser usage while still supporting highly productive farming.

It would also have vital implications for climate action. For instance, the synthetic nitrogen fertiliser supply chain alone was responsible for an estimated 10.6 per cent of agricultural emissions, and roughly two per cent of total global GHG emissions in 2018.

And for countries where fertiliser has been either too expensive or difficult to access, supporting plants to better recruit the help of soil microbes could deliver the increased nutrients needed to overcome historically low yields and worsening food insecurity.

For instance, fertiliser use in sub-Saharan Africa is around one-quarter of that used in the United States, and two-thirds of the continent's agricultural land is already categorised as degraded.

As a result, crop yields remain stubbornly low at a time when food security pressures are rising. For instance, average maize productivity in sub-Saharan Africa stands at just two tonnes/ha, as compared to nine tonnes/ha in the United States.

As the world looks to cross this divide of feeding a global population without adding to existing environmental burdens, the invisible communities of symbiotic soil microbes therefore offer a vital bridge.

Decoupling food production from fertiliser usage is not only more sustainable, but it is also more equitable since innovations involving microbes can be accessible to even the world's most vulnerable or remote farming communities.

By maximising the benefits these microbes offer, by enhancing plants' ability to recruit them, and potentially extending their use to new crops, scientists have the potential to deliver a fundamental breakthrough in how the world produces food, in a way that will benefit both people and the planet.

Genetic breakthrough promises cheap crop costs for world's poorest farmers

After decades of attempts, researchers create clones of high-performing hybrid varieties that maintain bumper yields

A long sought-after genetic engineering breakthrough will allow farmers in the developing world to produce high-yield and disease-resistant rice more cheaply, scientists have said.

Researchers have managed to create clones of high-performing hybrid varieties that end the need for farmers to buy expensive new seeds every year.

The resulting rice plants maintain their bumper yields for at least three generations, in an advance that came after decades of attempts.

First-generation hybrids of crop plants often show better yields and performance than their parent strains - a phenomenon called hybrid vigour.

But the effects are then lost when the hybrids are bred together for a second generation, so farmers wanting to keep getting the best harvest must buy new seed each season. The extra cost means that the benefits of rice hybrids have yet to reach many of the world's farmers.

An international team of researchers from institutions including the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development and University of California have now found a way to reproduce the hybrid vigour generation after generation.

Hybrid seeds ""˜accessible to everyone'

Scientists have been trying to get the high-yield hybrids to propagate as clones which remain identical without further breeding.

Many wild plants can produce seeds that are clones of themselves, in a process called apomixis.

""Once you have the hybrid, if you can induce apomixis, then you can plant it every year,"" said Gurdev Khush, of the department of plant sciences at the University of California.

The researchers managed to create clones by tweaking genes that control the cell division cycle, so that cells divide into two exact copies. The cloning process was 95 per cent efficient.

""Apomixis in crop plants has been the target of worldwide research for over 30 years, because it can make hybrid seed production become accessible to everyone,"" said Professor Venkatesan Sundaresan at the University of California.

""The resulting increase in yields can help meet global needs of an increasing population without having to increase use of land, water and fertilisers to unsustainable levels.""

Rice is the staple crop for half the world's population. The results could now be extended to other agricultural staples such as wheat or maize, the researchers said.

The pressures of climate change and the challenges of feeding booming populations mean scientists predict a growing demand for genetically modified crops in the developing world.

The world is precariously dependent on just a handful of staple food crops - we must diversify

Just six crops account for 75 per cent of the world's plant-derived energy intake. These underused foods could help to end malnutrition

The underlying reason why the war in Ukraine has had such a significant impact on global food security is because the world is precariously dependent on only a handful of staple food crops.

Just six crops - rice, wheat, maize (or corn), potato, soybeans, and sugarcane - account for more than 75 per cent of total plant-derived energy intake globally.

So, there is no wonder that the conflict between major exporters of wheat and maize has contributed to rising levels of food insecurity. New UN figures indicate that around 735 million people are currently facing hunger, an increase of 122 million from 2019.

More worrisome than the rise in overall hunger, though, is the increase in rates of malnutrition, especially the rising level of micronutrient deficiencies - a more complex challenge that contributes to stunting and wasting in young children, and prevalence of anaemia in women and adolescent girls.

And yet, spikes in global hunger and malnutrition do not need to be the inevitable outcome of shocks like conflict and climate change. A range of alternative solutions exist that can improve the quality of diets and nutrition, while also reducing global dependency on a few staple crops and the countries that dominate their export.

In the first instance, global food supplies would be more resilient and nutritious if they were diversified beyond the ""big three"" - rice, maize and wheat.

While increases in production and productivity for these crops have played a fundamental role in averting famine and bringing down hunger, they are not suitable in every climate nor the first food of choice for every culture.

Instead, many of the countries left exposed by the grain shortages would have traditionally relied on other, now neglected crops such as millets, teff, manioc, quinoa, cowpea, guar, mustard, and pigeon pea. Millets, celebrated this year by the UN, is a versatile and nutritious group of grains that have long been grown in arid landscapes.

Not only are millets climate-resilient and drought-tolerant, but research has also shown that their nutritional content is key in boosting growth in children and adolescents compared to rice.

In India, where declines in rice production have triggered export bans and sent shockwaves through food markets, millets are enjoying a revival as an affordable, locally adapted and healthy alternative.

Quinoa is another crop worthy of attention and with huge growth potential. It can thrive in extreme soil and climatic conditions, contains all nine essential amino acids, twice as much protein as maize, barley and wheat, and more micronutrients than most staples. Quinoa seed, stems and foliage can be used as livestock and poultry feed and the use of quinoa oil, starch, saponin and colorings are being explored for use in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.

With more investment and support for crop breeding programmes that select the most nutritious and sustainable varieties, crops like millet and quinoa could bolster staple production in other countries, and regions facing food and nutrition security challenges.

From the soil to the sea

Beyond grains, other hardy food crops offer enormous opportunities to diversify and improve diets, particularly through varieties biofortified with micronutrients.

For example, just 125 grams of orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP), developed by CGIAR researchers, can meet the daily vitamin A requirement of preschool children. OFSP vines have been disseminated and cultivated in more than 20 countries across Africa and Asia. Aside from directly consuming OFSP, it can also be processed into food products, such as OFSP flour, providing a more nutritious alternative to wheat flour.

Similarly, low-cost, high-yielding and nutritious varieties of beans can contribute to healthier diets. Many iron-biofortified varieties of beans have been disseminated to low-income, rural communities across Africa, where iron deficiency contributes to anaemia in pregnant and lactating women and young children.

Biofortification can also be used to enhance the nutritional quality of diverse, local vegetables and fruit, maximising the health benefits from these foods that are already widely grown and eaten.

Finally, the potential of fish and other aquatic foods has yet to be fully embraced as a key solution to malnutrition challenges worldwide.

While the consumption of aquatic foods in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease is well recognised, more effort is needed to fully integrate the diversity of aquatic foods into global diets.

Some 3,700 aquatic species are shown to offer a broad range of vitamins, minerals and essential fatty acids, with research indicating that sustainably increasing and diversifying supply could prevent micronutrient deficiencies for a projected 166 million people.

Seaweed is fast gaining recognition as a food with high nutritional value as well as low environmental footprint. However, there needs to be further research and investments to explore opportunities to scale production and consumption of diverse seaweed species, sustainably.

Aquatic food systems are a perfect illustration of how water truly is food and sustains life globally - as the theme for this year's World Food Day reminds us. With both hunger and malnutrition levels on the rise, food, land and water systems urgently need de-risking and reinforcing. It is imperative for the global community to diversify food production and consumption.

And by embracing diverse, underused, nutritious foods, countries can transform their food systems to become healthy and sustainable.

A crop pandemic could devastate the Global South. Here's how to limit the risk

Just as the movement of people is linked to the spread of disease, the global transit of seeds risks transferring harmful plant pathogens

The movement and trade of crop seeds around the world is a thriving industry - with global seed exports growing more than 50 percent between 2015 and 2020 to now stand at roughly $15 billion in value.

Yet, just like the movement of people is intrinsically connected to the spread of diseases, this global movement of seeds and planting material makes the spread of harmful plant diseases - which can damage economies and threaten food security - all but inevitable.

In much the same way that governments are now looking to improve pandemic preparedness in the wake of Covid-19, countries have at their disposal a range of tools to prepare for, manage, and mitigate the threat of plant diseases spreading worldwide. However, further investment is needed to ensure that low- and middle-income countries - which are more likely to struggle with hunger and malnutritional challenges - are also equipped with these tools.

When it comes to preparing for and preempting plant pandemics, countries can never afford to be complacent. Centuries-old diseases in potatoes, such as late blight, continue to pose threats through new, more resistant strains. Late blight remains among the most devastating diseases impacting potato production, causing losses of $10 billion around the world each year.

Elsewhere, the emergence of diseases such as purple top - a bacterial disease which can cause significant losses for potato farmers - show just how easily crop diseases can move from one region to another. First emerging in north Mexico in the 1980s, the disease has since spread to the southwest United States, New Zealand and areas of Central America, including Honduras, and more recently Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru.

While the spread of plant disease may be difficult to prevent, the consequences on food security and economies needn't be. Donors, particularly in developed countries, which have access to many of these tools, must support the scaling up of essential disease monitoring and prevention systems in low- and middle-income countries.

After all, as we saw during the Covid-19 pandemic, preventing outbreaks anywhere is in everyone's interests everywhere.

To begin with, donors and aid-giving countries should support low- and middle-income countries to develop and adopt vital monitoring and surveillance systems. This is because, just as in human diseases, monitoring and surveillance systems are the first line of defense against the spread of plant diseases.

In the case of harmful diseases like late blight, countries need support in developing systems allowing them to identify which strain is spreading, helping them either to confine it to a small area and eradicate it, or begin to introduce resistant varieties and integrated pest management to prevent further spread.

This includes systems which allow for regular testing of plant samples, as well as extensive monitoring on the efficacy of fungicides in the field, allowing farmers to change doses and applications as required by disease challenges.

A changing global climate

Alongside monitoring systems, countries require further support and investment into plant disease diagnostics.

Climate change is accelerating the spread of plant diseases to new, non-endemic areas where farmers lack deep knowledge about how to deal with diseases, such as purple top, which has spread across the Americas since it first emerged in the 1980s.

In this context, farmers increasingly need diagnostic systems to guide more impactful and informed responses to new threats. For instance, the International Potato Center (CIP) has helped to implement rapid diagnostic methods for zebra chip disease, allowing countries to recognise if the disease has spread to new areas, supporting them to respond earlier, more effectively minimising its knock-on effects.

Finally, farmers in low- and middle-income countries need greater support in accessing and deploying disease- and pest-resistant varieties earlier and more effectively.

Institutions like CIP have developed a range of resistant varieties of potato to combat the world's most damaging plant diseases, which countries can adopt pre-emptively - yet farmers in many developing regions traditionally lack access to the most up-to-date varieties.

Therefore, more support from funders is needed towards placing resistant varieties in the hands of farmers directly. In the case of late blight, resistant varieties must first be adapted to deal with the various strains of the disease, meaning early adoption of any resistant variety is essential. Ultimately, countries and farmers that are prepared ahead of time stand to reap the most rewards from protected harvests.

Global trade has shortened supply chains between countries, opening new markets for the trade of seeds at the expense of raising the risk of plant diseases spreading between countries.

Yet, although the spread of disease can be expected, countries should continually work to mitigate the impact of any emerging plant pandemic. Programs such as the Plant Health initiative of CGIAR, the world's largest publicly funded agricultural research network, and USAID's Current and Emerging Threats to Crops Innovation Lab, show that significant work is under way.

Now, countries, particularly in the Global South, need greater investment in accessing and building monitoring and diagnostic tools, alongside resistant varieties, to minimise the impact of plant disease spread, safeguarding food security and livelihoods for their populations amidst a changing global climate.

The cult of prizewinning veg - and how to supersize your crop

Monster pumpkins, giant zucchinis and the longest turnips - investigating the growing social media community of big veg enthusiasts

I'm looking at pictures of a prizewinning half-stone aubergine and a leek as tall as a human. This is the world of giant veg, a sport where the clichÃ© is that mid-to-late-life-crisis men on allotments compete to show theirs is bigger than the next inedible specimen.

Gardener Kevin Fortey, a 45-year-old NHS project manager from south Wales, wants to shatter the belief that big veg is a warfare substitute for ultra-competitive pensioners who only care about size rather than taste. We've all heard the stories about the military campaigns and sabotage strategies that have been engaged upon to beat the enemy and win a gong, but it's not really like that, he says.

He believes that post-Covid, and thanks to social media, giant veg growing has taken off and is now more about community and younger people, and also that there are now an increasing number of women involved, all connecting and sharing giant veg growing tips via platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. Rather than taking your growing secrets to the grave, sharing successes and failures is where it's at now.

Growing the community

Fortey, who runs a 6,000-strong Giant Veg Facebook group, boasting worldwide members from Australia to Alaska, says growing prizewinning big veg is less aggressive than it was: 

""It used to be quite a macho thing, but due to social media, more women are involved now. I've tried to bring more women into the community and make it more attractive to them as a Facebook group. My aim is to connect growers from all over the world.""

He has even been named as a ""global gamechanger"" by Facebook, and works hard to build connections in his role as a social media influencer. He has been on Countryfile, worked with various different brands, and has an online shop selling a mycorrhizal rootgrow product, but he stresses that with his challenging and rewarding full-time NHS job, building communities rather than bank balances is his primary aim.

""My dad started the UK giant veg championships in 1980, and my motivation is to maintain that legacy he left behind and grow that community,"" he says. ""The only difference that Dad used to use a typewriter, whereas I use Facebook.""

It's not about the money

We're in peak giant veg season, with world records set to be broken at the UK National Giant Vegetables Championship at the Malvern Autumn Show taking place this weekend. Tens of thousands of visitors will watch the elite growers display their colossal cabbages and titanic tomatillos. They do it for awards and kudos, not money. Top prize is £100. The sixth biggest pumpkin wins a fiver.

The 2022 Malvern show totted up a record-breaking number of Guinness World Records, with 11 new titles set for everything from the heaviest field pumpkin (121.6kg by Mark Baggs from Dorset) to the longest turnip (4.605m from Joe Atherton from Nottinghamshire).

They're an industrious bunch. Cornish farmer David Thomas uses a mini digger to shift his cabbages. Forklifts are useful to transport pumpkins, which can weigh as much as a Mini. Gerald Stratford spends five hours a day giving advice online to his 306,000 X (formerly Twitter) and 164,000 Instagram followers. He used to be an angler. Giant veg for him is just like catching the biggest fish.

Fortey is an eight-time Guinness World record holder and hopes for another for a tallest plant he wants to keep secret until Malvern. He reveals the mystery monster is half a metre taller than the US record holder. He expects the first picture of the record breaker to go viral.

Size matters, but so does quality

The UK's best-known veg grower, Medwyn Williams, a veteran 13-time Chelsea Flower Show gold winner, is at Malvern, but not competing. Instead, he was gunning for prizes at the recent Harrogate Autumn Flower Show's National Vegetable Society competition (he is NVS president). 

The difference is he exhibits perfect veg, while the giant veg guys only care about weight (and height and width). Even Fortey admits the big veg guy's produce can be ""pretty ugly - but it doesn't matter what it looks like, it's what the scale says.""

Anglesey-based Williams disagrees that size is everything: ""I believe in quality. Giant veg is great fun, skilful as well, but if you can't eat them... well, there's not many you can."" He shudders that a seven stone prize-winning celery will be ""tough as old boots"".

Fortey responds that ""it's a myth"" that huge veg is inedible: ""I grow giant tomatoes for my kitchen table. Just one makes a pasta dish.""

Williams' carrots are grown in wheelie bins for perfect straightness and can be sliced up to eat after. Fortey says his 52lb record-breaker giant beetroot was good for juicing, powdering and pickling, while he's seen big chillies become sauce and massive cabbages go to schools.

The pair of Welsh growers do agree that prize veg can be a family activity: ""Children love it,"" says Williams. ""It's a great way to start off, like growing a giant sunflower head.""

You can't predict the weather

Fortey, whose family, like Williams', are involved in the veg production, also agree on method. The key is the right variety of seed, then time, patience and commitment, and finally to harvest at the perfect time.

The stop-start spring and summer has made growing tricky this year. Professional growers the Paton twins of Lymington, who beat the British record with a 2,656lb pumpkin in October 2022, saw their crop fail to reach such heights this year. Fortey says it's a global problem: ""There's heatwaves then disasters. The Patons have a perfect environment so if they can't do it, no one can. You can't control the sun.""

Fortey protects plants in a Keder greenhouse and says that in recent years the season has extended into September and October before frosts come. He marvels at what can be achieved, weights and sizes his late father could only have dreamed of, such as a 17lb tomato from Dan Sutherland in the USA. He has travelled worldwide to meet growers and hopes to set up shows in Chile and the Middle East, though admits Kuwait's hot climate is not ideal for many crops.

How to supersize your crop

Marcus Eyles, horticultural director of the UK's biggest garden centre group, Dobbies, gives a studied overview of how to do it: 

""Invest in the seed companies' varieties for show and size and then get off to an early start, straight after Christmas. Make sure the growing area's soil is warm by covering it in black material. Keep plants protected through early spring in case of frost. Feed and water consistently. If you're inconsistent, stops and starts can split the skin and create an ugly fruit. But whatever you produce might not be the most attractive.""

He recommends Dobbies' multipurpose plant food with its magic ingredient, Westland seaweed.

Keeping heated and lit seedlings at 10C through the winter, using hydroponics with plants growing in nutrient-filled water, and joining a group to share seeds and information are all top tips from the experts.

My own experience is a couple of marrows that swelled on my allotment while we were on a rainy holiday in August. The day before the allotment show they disappeared from the fridge, as they were getting a bit soggy. We won the kids' veg first prize instead, for a particularly heinous beetroot decorated with a carrot nose, runner bean mouth and cherry tomato eyes.

The joy of winning the rosette has fired us up. Next year we'll go bigger. Maybe a full-sized scarecrow veg man with a half stone beetroot head, leeks for arms and legs""¦ I can't wait to share my pictures.

Coming to a farm near you... the world's first manure-powered tractor

British firm unveils the eco-friendly New Holland T7, which it claims can give diesel counterparts a run for their money

The world's first manure-powered tractor has been unveiled by a British firm in a move that could prompt a green revolution on farms.

The New Holland T7 tractor is fuelled by farm slurry that would see farms become ""energy independent"" and ""carbon neutral"". 

Bennamann, its Cornish maker, claimed that the tractor matches the performance standards of its diesel alternative, at a time when the Government places mounting pressure on farms to decarbonise. 

Chris Mann, the co-founder of Bennamann, said: ""The T7 liquid methane-fuelled tractor is a genuine world-first and another step towards decarbonising the global agricultural industry and realising a circular economy."" 

The 270bhp tractor is powered by capturing the methane that would otherwise escape from cow manure - called ""fugitive methane"" - then treating and compressing the gas for use as liquid fuel. Its cryogenic fuel tank keeps the methane as a liquid at -162C. 

The technology has the potential to combat climate change by removing large amounts of methane from the atmosphere, which ""has more than 80 times the atmospheric warming power of carbon dioxide over 20 years"", added Mr Mann.

Gilles Mayer, a member of New Holland's global management team for alternative fuels, told The Telegraph: ""A 150-cow farm would balance the CO2 emissions of 140 households in the UK per year.""

He explained how the tractor is currently limited to using cow and pig manure, but that New Holland is working to expand the fuel's source to other livestock manure such as that of poultry. 

Last year, Bennamann conducted a pilot study in Cornwall which saw the T7 prototype tractor successfully reduce its carbon emissions from 2,500 tonnes to 500 tonnes, without sacrificing performance against its diesel alternative.

The British dairy farmer shaking up the milk world

After making a hefty fortune in the City, Oliver Hemsley decamped to Dorset, where his happy, grass-fed cows are key to a dairy revolution

Twelve and a half billion litres is a lot of milk. So much, in fact, that were you a giant cat, using Wembley Stadium as your bowl, there would be enough for 11 brim-high refills. For ordinary-sized Britons, meanwhile, this vast amount - the quantity of milk produced each year by our island's 1.9 million dairy cows - equates to an annual consumption of 185 litres, roughly a pint a day, for every man, woman and child.

On a hillside farm in Dorset, just 220 of these cows produce a little less than a million litres a year - a mere 0.006424 per cent of the nation's output. Even so their owner, Oliver Hemsley - a man used to taking on the established order and winning - thinks he and his herd can revolutionise the dairy industry as we know it.

It is the smell that provides the first great clue to his methods: not the pungent pee-laced tang of ammonia, so common around livestock farms, but the sweet smell of silage - summer grass pickled and preserved, like fruits in a jar, to last out the winter's bleakness. Most farmers supplement grass with protein-rich cattle ""˜cake' or cow ""˜nuts' to feed their animals. Not here. On Hollis Mead Dairy Farm, set across an escarpment of land a few miles south of Sherborne, Hemsley only feeds his cows grass grown free of pesticides, insecticides and herbicides. In the summer they wander the 1,500 acres of pasture that Hemsley has gradually acquired over the last two decades. On a fine day, he insists you can see the sea off Chesil Beach and the Jurassic Coast.

But this is not a fine day. At 800ft, it is hard to know whether we are being rained on or simply inside the clouds themselves. Visibility is so limited that the rich green of the fields into which the herd will soon be released after wintering indoors is quickly swallowed up by the mists.

Yet Hemsley, 60, striding energetically around his domain, does not allow the soaking weather to dampen his enthusiasm. ""˜We've planted 20km of hedges, hawthorn, blackthorn, beech, hazel, dog rose,' he says, striding up to an avenue of saplings. ""˜It makes such a difference to birds and mice and everything else.'

But if life is easier for wildlife, enclosed spaces make business harder for farmhands operating the giant lawnmowers (known as foragers) that gather the grass for silage. Hemsley doesn't mind. The environment is his priority, fruit of a love of the natural world instilled in him during childhood birdwatching walks with his mother. It is a passion that he shares with countless other activists. The difference is that Hemsley is no do-gooding, yurt-dweller lamenting economic growth; he is a fiercely competitive City heavyweight who set up Numis stockbrokers and now reckons there is a good-old capitalist buck to be made from producing what he calls the ""˜ChÃ¢teau Lafite of milk', while changing farming for the better.

""˜We built all this,' he says, spinning on his heel and pointing out not just the neat, clean barns where the cows overwinter and the milking parlour, but also the on-site creamery where dairy employees (there are 12, he hopes for many more in future) in hairnets, white wellies and lab coats store the milk in vats and syphon some off to turn into cream, ""˜Greek-style' yogurt, and a variety of cheeses, some laced with truffle oil.

As we wander among the pristine machinery, I can't help asking how much it all cost. Hemsley responds by holding out the palm of his hand, extending all five fingers significantly. ""˜Five million?'

He nods. ""˜My wife thinks I'm mad. Absolutely mad.' Not that her view prevents Charlotte, known as Charlie, who has been married to Hemsley for 30 years and with whom he has three grown-up children, from being occasionally pressed into service in the venture's cheese-making operation.

We cast off our welly boots and head to a small office where stickers are being stuck on dozens of boxes. Mail Order. Hemsley takes the opportunity to explain his business plan. ""˜I don't want you to think that this is a rich man's hobby,' he says. ""˜This is about building something.' He needn't have mentioned it, for there is nothing about his manner to suggest the dilettante. Quite the opposite. As if to underscore that, he runs through the figures. ""˜I want a £3 million turnover and £1 million profit a year. We can definitely do it.' Currently the farm is more or less breaking even. But it is when he begins to compare other figures - production not profit - with those of traditional dairy farmers that the scale of his ambition becomes truly apparent.

For him, less is more. Grass-fed, his cows produce about 12 litres of milk a day each, compared with 40 litres for what he calls ""˜industrial cows'. Yet while typical farmers get around 40p a litre from supermarkets for their milk, he wants, across his product range, to hit £3 a litre. On the Hollis Mead website, a litre of whole organic milk will cost £3.50, compared to around £1 at Tesco. What's the upside for the shopper, I ask? ""˜I have to get people to understand that there is a radical difference in taste,' he says, also talking evangelically of the health benefits to ""˜you, the cow and the environment' of his ""˜extensive', rather than ""˜intensive' farming. ""˜If we can't do that we're wasting our breath frankly.' In his head, online sales will make up a third of his £3 million target; sales to hotels and shops another third; with the final tranche from selling excess grass fodder. He reckons he'll get there in three years, whatever other farmers might think. ""˜They'll think I'm mad until they don't. They're part of an [industrial farming] system that I'd rather didn't exist. But if we create a brand and it really works, we might persuade them to farm on a similar basis. That's what success looks like. Besides, I never really worried about what other people think in any sphere.'

That was certainly the case in the pre-Big Bang City, where old-school contacts still mattered and he thrived despite not having gone to university. Or more recently, as a pro-Brexit figure in a City which was generally horrified by the prospect. Looking back on his early career now, it seems obvious to say that he was driven by the desire to make money, both in its guise as coin of the realm and marker of success, after having grown up in Rutland, son of a pig farmer, surrounded by wealth but being ""˜relatively poor'. And that need to prove himself certainly explains the diamond-hard edge that still lies beneath the easy charm, as if the country squire - farmer, foxhunter, angler - is somehow only a part he plays. When I ask him whether his grammar school education or his driven personality mattered most in his success he replies: ""˜I just wanted to win.'

As we finish our visit of the farm, I check my phone to find the Swiss banking system on the verge of collapse. He seems to fizz with delight at the prospect. At such moments, he admits even he wonders what he is doing surrounded by cows. ""˜There's definitely an element of ""what am I doing here?""' For moments of collapse and failure were always, for him, moments of maximum opportunity, the moments to capitalise on the weakness of others. ""˜There's a joy, isn't there, when they're defenestrated.'

He started Numis in 1990, in his mid-20s, after ""˜hitting a brick wall' trying to get into an investment bank, ""˜because I didn't have a degree, right?' Was that a punchy thing to do, so young? ""˜Very punchy.' By then he'd already worked for five or six years in insurance at Lloyd's of London, joining as a photocopier assistant. But the stock market was where he was in his element. ""˜I really loved it, the trading, the way stocks move, how they're analysed. So interesting. And I couldn't get in. So I started my own stockbroking firm.'

And just a couple of years after Numis was born, Lloyd's connections proved crucial. A series of disasters in the late '80s and early '90s had left many insurers financially reeling. Hemsley helped them turn to the market to raise capital. ""˜And most stockbrokers hadn't got any knowledge of Lloyd's at all. So that was great. We raised 50 million.' Having been frozen out, Hemsley was very much in. ""˜The thing that Lloyd's taught me was to put your foot on the accelerator when it was tough,' he says. ""˜That's when you can really make enormous market-share gains.' If he is a contrarian, then, it is because being so has made him very rich. When he stepped down as CEO in 2016, he was earning almost £900,000 a year, and owned a stake in Numis worth around £20 million.

Perhaps that is why he thinks he can win his big dairy bet. After all, it is a time when many traditional farmers, complaining of higher costs and lower prices, are getting out. In 2016, according to the Agriculture & Horticulture Development Board, there were 13,227 dairy farmers in the United Kingdom. Today, that figure is about 7,500. It's a tough time to be in the business. No wonder Hemsley sniffs opportunity, especially given its other vital statistic: 98 per cent - the proportion of us who have milk in the fridge. Milk is everywhere. Business may not be booming but it's still worth about £4.4 billion a year.

And the organic grass-only diet of his herd brings a host of benefits, Hemsley says. He uses ""˜hardly any' antibiotics or wormer, ""˜because you only get real worm trouble if there are too many cows on too small an area for too long'. That's hardly a problem for him. ""˜Normally you have four cows to an acre,' says Ian Andrews, Hemsley's farm manager. ""˜We've got more than four acres per cow.' It also gets round the sustainability concerns associated with soya feeds. ""˜A lot of people still think soya is the best way of getting in high levels of protein,' says Tim Davies, a specialist in bovine nutrition with Kite Consulting. ""˜But new research is that you need less protein.' That research shows that silage retains more energy than previously thought, allowing the cow to generate its own microbial proteins. ""˜That reduces nitrogen emissions, ammonia emissions,' says Davies. ""˜What you put in explains what you get out.' Grass, he notes, can perform ""˜like rocket fuel'.

""˜Since the war we've obviously had significant population growth,' says Hemsley. ""˜So obviously, you need higher food production. But on the other hand, you can still farm in a way that doesn't kill everything.' He laments ""˜chemicals sprayed on to the land, ending up in watercourses. That cannot be good for us.' Far better to sow disease-resistant GM crops. What about prices? ""˜You say, ""Oh the cost of living crisis."" The crisis is nature. We need to spend more, not less, on food.' It should, he adds, be priced ""˜radically differently from how it's priced now. Radically.' Which, at a time when food prices have increased by 19 per cent in a year, may be easy for a multimillionaire to say. But part of Hemsley's charm is precisely that he does not soft-soap. The real danger, he says, is not cost but dairy suffering a reputational collapse as ""˜the industrialisation of farming""¦ feeds this idea to more and more people that cows are bad for the planet'.

And from greenhouse gas cow farts to the culling of bull calves to antibiotic- use breeding bug resistance, to barn-reared animals that never go outside, it's true that dairy increasingly courts negative headlines. Numbers of vegans are rising rapidly, if from a low base, and now stand at between two and three per cent of the UK population. In polls, vegans overwhelmingly say that animal welfare and environmental impact are the two principal reasons they no longer consume dairy produce. All that in an industry in which, as Davies says, ""˜most farmers love their cows more than their wives'. It is a broken economic model that pushes them to extremes, says Hemsley. Supermarkets, he says ""˜are very good at what they do. Unfortunately they're immensely destructive to local, smaller purveyors, and they're immensely destructive to pricing, which ultimately is immensely destructive to nature. For the sake of the consumer they're destroying the planet.'

That's why he is determined to find a new economic model that works, not ""˜a theme park with grants' as he calls the rethink of intensive dairy farming at Knepp Estate in Sussex made famous by Isabella Tree's book Wilding. ""˜The grants are the only thing that really make it work, as well as theme park income,' Hemsley says. ""˜But it's not really about farming.' He warms to his theme as we climb into the car so he can drive me back to the station. ""˜I want to be able to demonstrate that you can farm profitably in a way which is going to produce plenty of food. I certainly don't decry rewilding, but that's not going to feed us.'

He is going to feed me, though. I return laden with Hollis Mead goodies: some Brie, rich yellow butter, four litres - £14 worth! - of milk. The next day, remembering his exhortation about staking the future of his farm, and his invested millions, on ""˜a radical difference in taste', I nervously unwrap the cheese. Will it really be so much better than the competition, that it can sustain an entire reformation of farming? There's only one way to find out. I smear a healthy dollop on a cracker and open my mouth""¦

""˜Jeremy Clarkson is right - badgers in the UK are over protected'

It's one of the most inflammatory debates in the British countryside - do the creatures deserve their untouchable status?

There is a scene in season two of Clarkson's Farm where Jeremy Clarkson wades into one of the most pressing challenges facing the British countryside; an inflammatory debate that has raged between farmers and conservationists for decades. 

""Right, kill the badgers,"" he says, brow furrowed, after learning that bovine tuberculosis - which he implies is spread by a thriving badger population - could threaten his newly minted cattle herd. 

""We can't kill the badgers,"" replies his long-suffering adviser.

That is the crux of the matter. Most beef and dairy farmers agree with Clarkson. Almost all conservationists do not.

For farmers, badgers are a threat: they spread bovine TB, an infectious respiratory disease that has the potential to wreak havoc on entire herds of cattle and, with it, a farmer's bottom line. 

In less extreme cases, badgers can be a nuisance: they damage land, eat crops and dig setts, or dens, in inconvenient places. But they are a protected species. Killing a badger or disturbing a sett is punishable by law with up to six months in prison and an unlimited fine. Unlike with foxes or deer, farmers must leave them alone. 

""I hate badgers,"" Clarkson said in a previous episode of the TV show, once again summarising the feelings of the entire farming population. ""Apart from the fact they've eaten just about every hedgehog in Britain, they're like teenagers. They lie in bed all day, get up at night, transmit diseases, knock walls over, and then when the sun comes up, they go back to bed again."" 

His recent comments, described as an ""ill-informed rant"" by the Badger Trust, have horrified conservationists. 

They argue that the Government's controversial badger culls are senseless, cruel and have the potential to wipe out badger populations in some areas entirely. Are badgers the countryside's most persecuted species - or are they overprotected?

Under the Protection of Badgers Act, cruelty towards badgers is illegal. The act was introduced in 1992, partly to crack down on badger baiting, a cruel blood sport where dogs are set on badgers. But farmers argue that the badger population has since exploded (although there are no official statistics to prove this) and rates of bTB have risen with it, from 1,075 ""new herd incidents"" in 1996 to 5,171 in 2012.

Bovine TB is devastating for farmers. If an animal catches TB, it is compulsorily slaughtered. Due to a bTB outbreak between October 2021 and September 2022, 22,934 cows were killed. In the series, Clarkson speaks to a neighbour who has lost half her herd to it and says she no longer has a viable business. 

Among farmers, this is a common story. 

Abi Reader, 41, is a third-generation dairy farmer from south-east Wales who lost 25 per cent of her cattle to bTB and had her farm ""shut down"" by the Animal and Plant Health Agency for four years (although it has recently been given TB-free status). She has 200 milking cows and would ordinarily have 160 younger cows on site. 

""It's driving farmers to suicide,"" she says. ""You start losing a huge amount of money, and then you get stressed and more emotional about it, and get on a downward spiral. Some people have had their entire herds [of cattle] taken out. The most heartbreaking tales you hear from farmers are when the pet cow has to go. Mine did, called Marjorie. She had been with me for 17 years."" 

The disease puts a huge amount of financial strain on farmers when margins are already paper-thin. Reader has made a loss of between £27,000 and £32,000 each year since the first case of bTB was found on her farm, due to increased mortality and overcrowding, as the backed-up livestock on the farm were banned from being sold. 

Financial devastation aside, people don't understand the connection a farmer has with their livestock and the impact of having animals removed, she says. ""My livestock are all descended from cattle owned by both sets of my grandparents and have been in my family for generations. I don't think people understand the connection."" 

Yet a farmer's complaints - especially about the financial impact - will likely fall flat with the many vocal critics of the Government's badger cull. 

It has been 10 years since culls were first introduced in a bid to control bTB outbreaks: first in pilot areas in Gloucestershire and Somerset, and subsequently in other ""high-risk areas"" in south-west England, the Midlands and Cumbria. More than 176,000 badgers have been killed since, according to the Badger Trust. There is no government-approved badger culling in Scotland or Wales. 

To conservationists (including high-profile campaigners such as Queen's Brian May, Dame Judi Dench and Chris Packham), culling is a travesty: badgers are much more than a common pest or predator. They are the shy, intelligent Mr Badger from The Wind in the Willows. A beautiful species, unfairly maligned and cruelly killed. 

Badgers bring up strong emotions at both ends of the spectrum. Last year, Packham penned a eulogy to his ""favourite"" badger, which was killed by a motorist, on Twitter. ""I called her the ""˜Golden Sow',"" he wrote, from the colour of her pelt. He praised her ""lovely, musty"" smell and ""long, perfect paws"".

I met this beautiful badger in the lockdown spring . I went to see her every night and slowly won her trust . I called her the 'Golden Sow' , she appeared haughty , was more standoffish than some of her group and this made her my favourite . Last night I found her . . . pic.twitter.com/I5JsA2S1R7

On the other hand, Clarkson, with characteristic belligerence, says badgers are ""b-----ds"" that should be ""hit over the head with a hammer"". It also wasn't great PR when a 2018 study revealed that hedgehogs were disappearing from the British countryside because they were being eaten by badgers.

But Peter Hambly, director of the Badger Trust, insists ""gentle, non-destructive"" badgers have been made the ""scapegoat"" and subjected to a smear campaign. 

He describes the cull as ""one of the biggest attacks on a wild animal in British history"", and says: ""We're not convinced any [bTB] is spread by badgers. The substantial majority is spread from cow to cow."" 

The farming community contests this. ""The level of [badger] protection is too high. There is no doubt at all that there is a significant link between badgers and transmission,"" says Tom Bradshaw, deputy president of the National Farmers' Union (NFU), which strongly supports badger culling. 

""We have the data and the evidence that where we've been controlling [badgers], outbreak numbers are falling. They're actually the lowest they've been for 15 years."" 

Government data shows the number of ""new herd incidents"" of bTB has fallen by almost 40 per cent between 2013 and 2022, from about 4,815 to 3,000. And Defra has confirmed that it has led to a ""significant reduction in this disease"". 

A study led by the Animal and Plant Health Agency, published in 2019, found the incidence of bTB declined by 66 per cent in Gloucestershire and 37 per cent in Somerset after four years of culling, compared with areas where no culling took place. But this evidence is hotly contested, too: another paper, published in the journal Veterinary Record, ""failed to identify a meaningful effect of badger culling on bTB in English cattle herds"". 

Like Clarkson, some farmers want to take matters into their own hands. ""No one gives out a [prison] sentence when my cows are removed, without my blessing, from my farm. No one gives out that sort of sentence when my sheep are taken out by dog attacks. So why is a wild animal put over me, as a farmer?"" says Reader. ""There are diseases around here that are carried by foxes, and when we get a problem with that, we control the fox population. I don't see any difference with a badger.""

Similarly, Bradshaw questions the logic of protecting an ""apex species"" at the top of the food chain - badgers have no natural predators, he argues, and so have little natural population control. 

He hopes badger vaccination and potential cattle vaccination will provide a long-term solution, but the ""ability to control infected wildlife"" (in other words, cull) will need to remain as part of a strategy for farmers. Where badger populations are controlled, he says, farmers see greater numbers of hedgehogs and ground-nesting birds.

On the other hand, the Badger Trust says some areas are reporting local extinctions in cull regions, and the ""demonisation"" of badgers is doing farmers no favours. 

To farmers, they're disease-ridden predators or, at the very least, a nuisance. To most others, badgers are the cute, cuddly mammal from the Wildlife Trusts' logo. As Clarkson has proved, this is an argument that will go on until the cows come home.

Wolves face being hunted across Europe under Brussels plan to weaken their legal protection

European Commission is accused of caving in to pressure from farmers who complain the wild animals endanger their livestock

Wolves risk once again being hunted across Europe, with strict EU protections set to be weakened after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's favourite horse Dolly was killed by a wolf.

The European Commission tabled a proposal on Thursday that would change the conservation status of wolves from ""strictly protected"" to ""protected"", which would allow greater flexibility in organising hunts.

Farmers have long complained that rising numbers of the carnivores, which came back from the brink of extinction through conservation efforts, are endangering their livestock.

""Carefully regulated"" hunts could be authorised, the commission said, provided they did not not endanger the ""favourable conservation status"" of the wolf population.

The European centre-Right has been engaged in a battle with Left-wing and Green parties over the burden of green legislation as June's European Parliament elections approach.

The European People's Party, which counts Ursula von der Leyen, the commission president, as a member, has been the most vocal in its demands to loosen the strict protections for the wolf under EU law.

In October, Mrs von der Leyen attracted criticism after Brussels shelved a planned ban on caged hens and pigs after Dutch farmers won a landslide victory in regional elections on a platform of opposition to EU climate legislation.

Some EU countries have more than 1,000 wolves after conservation efforts paved the way for the return of the animal to many parts of Europe. A European Commission study found the resurgent populations have begun posing a danger to farmers' livestock.

Limited legal wolf hunting is carried out in Finland, Norway, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovakia, but it could now become more widespread. Hunting of problem wolves is already allowed under exceptions to the EU protections.

LÃ©a Badoz, of Eurogroup for Animals, said, ""We are against weakening these protections. There are already existing derogations to allow the culling of problem wolves, which the commission has previously said are sufficient to control populations.""

""This is highly political with the European Parliament elections and the commission is now contradicting itself and the science.""

Wooing rural voters 

The Humane Society International said the commission had ""opened the door"" to more wolves being killed in the EU, under pressure from farming and hunting lobbies.

""If President von der Leyen believes that she is currying favour with rural voters with such decisions, she should think twice,"" said Dr Joanna Swabe, the HSI senior director of public affairs

""A recent survey conducted among rural communities in 10 Member States found that a significant majority are keen to see legal protections for wolves upheld""

Mrs von der Leyen's favourite horse Dolly was killed by a wolf last year at her home in Germany before EU officials began scrutinising whether the environmental laws should be relaxed.

The culprit was identified through DNA evidence as a wolf known as GW950m. But it remains at large after a permit to kill it expired before it could be hunted down.

Von der Leyen previously denied a mission to avenge Dolly

The commission, which had previously rebuffed calls to water down protections for wolves, has previously denied Mrs von der Leyen is on a mission to avenge Dolly.

Mrs von der Leyen said on Wednesday: ""The comeback of wolves is good news for biodiversity in Europe. But the concentration of wolf packs in some European regions has become a real danger especially for livestock.

""To manage critical wolf concentrations more actively, local authorities have been asking for more flexibility. The European level should facilitate this.""

Brussels urged member states to take advantage of existing EU support, funding and guidance to prevent wolves attacking livestock.

But it added it had given ""a clear perspective of further management flexibilities if existing possibilities prove insufficient"".

The commission asked for the international Bern Convention protections for the European wolf to be changed, which is a necessary preliminary step to weaken EU protections.

The decision has to be approved by member states and follows a European Parliament resolution, which divided MEPs.

Climate change provokes urgent action on food systems everywhere

It can no longer be a case of ""˜business as usual' when it comes to food production

As 2023 draws to a close, with the world hotter than ever and on track to exceed 1.5 degrees warming, world leaders are increasingly concerned and strive ever harder to agree on ambitious climate action. They have focused on an increasingly pressing issue: food.  

The interactions between food and climate had surfaced around the UN's Food Systems Summit in 2021, where it became clear that climate change threatens agricultural productivity, disrupts food supply chains, reduces resilience, erodes the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food workers, and threatens food and nutrition security (especially for women and children).""¯""¯The impact of these interactions on people has been exacerbated by the impacts of Covid-19, increased levels of conflict, and increases in the cost-of-living.   

 At the Cop28 annual climate meeting, in Dubai, the governments of 154 countries endorsed the groundbreaking Cop28 UAE Declaration on Sustainable Agriculture, Resilient Food Systems, and Climate Action. They committed to address both food system vulnerabilities to climate change and the impacts of food systems on climate and nature. This is an important first, and a sign of the concerns being felt everywhere.

In Europe the concerns are felt in higher food prices, and strained household budgets as a result of income poverty (which threatens more than 20 per cent of the population). In Sub-Saharan Africa, smallholder farmers whose communities depend on agriculture are bearing the brunt of record high temperatures and extreme weather events.  

In addition, modern food systems drive 90 per cent of deforestation and 60 per cent of biodiversity loss, and account for 70 per cent of the world's use of fresh water.""¯""¯They are also reliant on fossil fuels which are used for production of pesticides; synthetic fertilisers and plastics; and in processing, transport, distribution and cooking. Overall, food systems contribute over one third of global greenhouse gas emissions.  

A global collaboration

Cop28 has provided a remarkable opportunity for accelerating the transformation of food systems in ways that align with intentions for climate action, protecting nature, improving nutrition and safeguarding rural livelihoods.   

Everyone has a role: rethinking and innovating on how food is produced, stored, packed, processed, traded, distributed, marketed, consumed and disposed of. At Cop28, it was evident that farmers seek to be partners in the transformation ""” which should be informed by evidence and experience, and involve marginalised and vulnerable groups. Traditional agricultural approaches, which have produced food in harmony with nature for millennia, should also inform this process.""¯  

Improved weather forecasting is one example of a technology available today, with the potential to benefit 260-305 million farmers in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Multiple studies have shown that farmers across these regions adjust their behavior and investment decisions based on these highly specific forecasts, and the payoff is clear. In Benin, for example, farmers who received SMS forecasts earned $104-$356 more per year than farmers who did not.""¯""¯ 

Implementing transformation is not easy and will require a significant financial commitment. At Cop28, we saw some progress. Representatives of the half billion small-scale farmers and fisherfolk, many from the communities most vulnerable to climate impacts, pointed out during the Cop that they need support as they struggle to adapt to a warming world. Notably, several financial pledges were announced while others are in the making.   

Government representatives described their plans to incorporate action on climate and biodiversity within efforts to transform national food and water systems in ways that contribute to food and nutrition security for all and encourage the reliance of farmer livelihoods. Representatives of international organisations described how they will intensify collaboration to ensure intensified support for these national efforts. New multi-stakeholder partnerships for research, innovation and collective are being developed.   

Government involvement in transforming food systems is crucial since governments provide the enabling conditions for producers and consumers to make healthier and more sustainable food choices. School meal programs, for example, feed over 400 million children worldwide, providing a huge, predictable market for food. Large-scale public programs such as these offer a unique opportunity for governments to procure food that is nutritious and sustainably sourced, impacting food systems and improving diets on a national scale.""¯""¯ 

The potential prize is great. We are witnessing innovative solutions that help address food and nutrition insecurity while contributing to action on climate and biodiversity crises, but these solutions need to be adopted and deployed globally.""¯This must be done in close collaboration with farmers, businesses, civil society, local authorities, national governments, and international processes. It is anticipated that the UAE will encourage a constellation of convergent support during 2024, the year of its Cop presidency.

Left as they are, food systems will continue to accelerate climate breakdown and biodiversity decline, fail to nourish people and leave them exposed to future shocks. With concerted attention they can provide food that is healthy, affordable and nutritious, help halt and reverse biodiversity collapse, and insulate humanity from future climate shocks that are inevitable for the coming decades.

For humanity, everywhere, usual food business is no longer an option.

Global food security is in crisis - here's how to fix it

This is what's at stake as leaders gather at the Global Hunger Summit in London

Tackling hunger is a priority for the UK and Brazil.

In 2012 our two countries jointly hosted the Global Hunger Summit in London, on the closing day of the London Olympics, as the UK handed the baton to Brazil for the 2016 Rio Olympics. We produced an ambitious and decisive set of actions between us in the fight against hunger and malnutrition.""¯A decade on, our two countries once again stand together putting the fight against hunger at the top of the global agenda, at today's Global Food Security Summit in London.

Why, ten years on do we find ourselves here again? Despite decades of increasing global food production, the UN's goal - to achieve zero hunger and end all forms of malnutrition - is off track and will not be achieved by 2030. Instead, acute food insecurity remains at a five year high, with over 238 million facing high levels of acute food insecurity, a trend likely to worsen. Close to one billion people experienced severe food insecurity in 2022; 45 million children under five are currently suffering from acute malnutrition.  

Our optimism, our ambitions, our collective endeavours have not met the scale of the harsh realities of our age. Climate change is advancing, conflicts are escalating, world food prices are volatile, and a number of countries are on the brink of famine. Economies may have begun a steady recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, but in many cases the poorest are being left behind.  

The international community needs to reverse this unacceptable trend, as access to adequate and nutritious food is an unalienable human right. We require the proper allocation of resources, knowledge, social technologies and the experience of practical implementation to reach those who need them most.

For its part, the UK has reflected on its role and the impact it can have when it focuses on transformative, long-term, systemic change, through modern partnerships that prioritise mutual respect. This will be set out the UK's forthcoming International Development White Paper. On 20 November, you will see this approach in action when Prime Minister Rishi Sunak hosts the Global Food Security Summit: Toward Zero Hunger and Ending Malnutrition.  

This will be a rallying call to action in four key areas:  

Following today's summit, Brazil will assume the Presidency of the G20 on December 1. President Lula is a global leader who has known hunger personally as a child, and went on to become President for the first time, twenty years ago, and lead the country's successful fight against hunger. 

Now elected back to government, Lula has announced three priorities for Brazil's G20 Presidency:  social inclusion and the fight against hunger, poverty and inequality; facing climate change and promoting sustainable development in its three dimensions (social, economic and environmental); and reforming international governance. All three priorities subsumed in the motto: ""Building a just world and a sustainable planet"".  

To advance those priorities, President Lula has announced the creation of a special task force under the G20, whose mission will be to forge a new Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty. The Alliance will be a mechanism to raise financial resources and know-how where they are most abundant, and channel them towards where they are most needed, supporting the implementation and scaling up of pro-poor actions, policies and programmes, including in the four areas highlighted by today's Global Food Security Summit in London.  

Together, Brazil and the UK will significantly strengthen our cooperation on food security, through a new trilateral partnership with African countries that will fund research, development and innovation in sustainable agriculture and facilitate the transfer of climate-smart agricultural practices and technologies. 

We will champion robust, targeted and adaptive social protection networks in countries to shield the most vulnerable from the worst effects of crises before they hit. We will ensure the benefits of sustainable agriculture are protected from the worst impacts of climate change and environmental degradation. For example, the UK and Brazil's cooperation on Programa Rural SustentÃ¡vel is promoting low carbon and sustainable agriculture, improving food security and incomes of communities across 252 Brazilian municipalities and 21% of Brazil's territory.  

Surrounded as we are by divisive conflicts, it may be challenging to achieve lasting change. But achieve it we must. Widespread hunger, poverty, and lack of opportunities for decent livelihoods are drivers of war, uncontrolled migration, and societal disfunction, which in turn breed more poverty and hunger. We cannot change the past. But we can work now towards better futures that prevent the crises of tomorrow.

More from The Telegraph

Food banks are on the rise across the world - but are they the answer?

While proponents see them as central to tackling record levels of hunger, critics say the West is ""˜exporting a failed system'

The refrigerated trucks slowly edge out of the tight passageway in Bangkok's old town as they set off for another day ""rescuing"" the city's surplus food. 

By sunset, the fleet of five will have delivered more than two tonnes of products from hotels, restaurants and supermarkets to communities struggling across the Thai capital, in an operation which aims to both combat hunger and reduce food waste.

""In Thailand, food is everywhere, but access for many is limited - especially the urban poor,"" Nantaporn Thirapongphaiboon, a senior outreach manager at Scholars of Sustenance (SOS), told the Telegraph during a visit to the NGO's lowkey Bangkok headquarters. 

""The challenges are rising, first the pandemic hit Thailand hard, now inflation and debt,"" she said. ""So the need has definitely increased, and we're expanding to try to cover this.""

The situation in Thailand is far from unique; across low and middle-income countries these schemes are booming. According to a survey from the Global Foodbanking Network (GFN), 32 million people used food banks across 50 developing countries in 2022 - almost twice as many as before the pandemic.

The rise has been linked to a broader surge in food insecurity. The UN estimates that the number of people facing hunger jumped by 122 million between 2019 and 2022, driven by Covid-related disruption and the impact the war in Ukraine has had on global food supplies. 

As humanitarian aid budgets are squeezed, many see food banks as part of a solution which can also tackle the environmental consequences of waste - globally, around eight per cent of emissions are linked to unconsumed food. 

""There are not enough resources for international organisations to meet the need, especially in low and middle-income countries with a debt crisis and ""¦ where social protections are astonishingly weak,"" said Lisa Moon, chief executive of the GFN. 

""From our vantage point, we're seeing an organic expansion of the [food bank] model ""¦ I think people see that there's a tremendous amount of food that's not reaching people's plates, and they want to find a way to redirect that given the economic circumstances.""

Exporting a failed system?

But others are unconvinced that this is the right approach. They describe the spread of food banks as the West ""exporting a bad model"" which has failed to tackle the root causes of both overproduction and food poverty. 

The first food bank dates back to 1967 in Arizona, but it was not until the Ronald Reagan administration that the concept exploded across the United States, partly as a response to recession and welfare cuts. 

They soon became established in Canada, Australia, and much of Europe, too, while the oldest food bank programmes in Latin America can be traced to the 1990s. The formalised concept expanded in east Asia around 15 years ago, Ms Moon said, followed by southeast Asia, India and now sub Saharan Africa. 

But some experts point out that even in wealthy countries which have long used food banks, hunger has not reduced but skyrocketed. In the UK, the Trussell Trust said 130,000 people received food in 2011 - by 2017 that figure had surged to 1.35 million, while almost three million sought help in the year to March 2023.  

""I see the growth of food banking around the world as the US exporting a bad model,"" said Andy Fisher, author of ""˜Big Hunger'. In it, he argues that food charity has not solved the core problems in America, but has instead benefited the corporations who gain tax breaks and positive PR through donations. 

The existence of food banks has also ""undercut the rationale for stronger social assistance programmes"" from the government, he told the Telegraph, while obfuscating businesses' role in actually causing food poverty by ""paying lousy wages"". He added that not enough questions are being asked as to ""why people don't have money for food in the first place.""

Dr Gareth Haysom, an urban food systems researcher at the University of Cape Town's African Centre for Cities, also warned that food banks can ""mask the scale of hunger"" in communities, ""normalise"" poverty and become a ""significant PR project"" for businesses donating. 

But he added that they can be extremely effective when designed within a broader package to tackle food insecurity in cities - a challenge which will only grow as urbanisation accelerates. 

""They have a really key role in redistributing food and serving the vulnerable ""¦ but I think the problems come in when they are seen as the solution,"" he said. 

Dr Haysom pointed to Belo Horizonte, a city home to 2.5 million people in southeast Brazil, as a gold standard. Since the early 1990s, the government has rolled out a food security programme which combines immediate aid with programmes to boost production, create employment, and regulate prices for some staple products at markets. 

""Food banks are a part of it, but the city is also tackling the deeper systemic drivers of food insecurity,"" Dr Haysom said. Some efforts to replicate this in southern Africa, he warned, have focused on elements like food distribution, but failed to incorporate this into a broader package which drives ""fundamental change"". 

""˜Championing change'

In Thailand, food banks said they have not enabled the government or businesses to ignore the causes of food poverty, but have instead emerged in response to gaping holes in both the country's welfare state and food system.

""There are a lot of limitations on government support,"" said SOS's Ms Thirapongphaiboon. ""The government only supports those who register as vulnerable - for example people with disabilities or the elderly - but this means many people who live under the poverty line are not eligible for support.""

The Global Hunger Index estimates that almost nine per cent of the population - equivalent to roughly 6.2 million people - lack adequate nutrition, while Thailand has one of Asia's worst household debt crises, second only to South Korea and Hong Kong. 

People here owe the equivalent of 86.9 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent a decade ago, with millions teetering on the edge of financial ruin or already having to make difficult decisions about what they can afford. 

""Low pay and personal debt are big problems in Thailand, and with inflation driving up the cost of food, many people can't afford to feed their families,"" said Sasiwan Jaiarsa, a central community supervisor at SOS. ""We've seen a big increase in recent years in the number of people and communities calling us for help."" 

SOS is one of the oldest and most established food banking initiatives in Thailand. Launched in Bangkok seven years ago, it now works with 1,200 communities across the capital. The NGO has also opened in Phuket and Hua Hin in the south, and Chiang Mai in the north - as well as offices in Indonesia and the Philippines. 

The bulk of SOS's work focuses on its food redistribution system - according to the Pollution Control Department, two thirds of the country's total rubbish is made up of food waste. In an attempt to reduce this figure and combat hunger, the NGO works with restaurants, hotels and supermarket chains to ""rescue"" surpluses, delivering this food to between 30 and 40 spots each day. 

The NGO also runs smaller programmes providing healthy lunches for vulnerable children at schools and working with community kitchens to cook hot meals in certain neighbourhoods. 

The GFN's Ms Moon said that having initiatives like SOS so embedded within communities is part of why they are so effective. Within the network, 50,000 organisations - from homeless shelters to livelihood training centres - rely on food from members, and collectively these groups ""champion change"" in society. 

The role of food banks in tackling food poverty in cities and countries with fewer welfare resources should not be underestimated, Ms Moon added, and urged governments to introduce policies - including tax breaks for companies donating - to facilitate their spread.

""Our food system needs transformation ""¦ but while we address the root causes of hunger and food insecurity, there is a role for redistribution,"" Ms Moon said.

Back in the SOS headquarters in a converted school not far from Bangkok's famed Grand Palace, staff think it's unlikely that the need for their services will dissipate anytime soon - especially amid Thailand's current political turmoil. 

""Tourists come here and think of Thailand as a country with abundant food,"" said Ms Thirapongphaiboon. ""But we have a lot of food poverty, and if inflation continues to increase that's only going to get worse. 

""The government needs to introduce policies to target these issues, and also to facilitate food donations and food banks - Thailand needs both, not one or another.""

""˜Bankrupt' Birmingham held seminars declaring ""˜we can't survive without eating'

Labour-run council employs food justice experts despite being unable to meet financial responsibilities

Birmingham's effectively bankrupt council is employing food justice experts to warn the public they ""can't survive without eating"".

The Labour-run local authority held a virtual conference in October entitled ""Birmingham's Food Revolution"" which was addressed by the council's director of public health, Dr Justin Varney.

He said: ""Food is really important to all of us. We need it to survive""¦ we can't survive without eating"", before going on to discuss ""the importance of addressing food justice in urban settings"".

A YouTube video of one event at the conference has had 14 views online at the time of writing.

In September, the council issued a section 114 notice, meaning it cannot meet its financial liabilities amid an outstanding £760 million of equal pay claims.

Birmingham, which is Europe's largest local authority, confirmed all but essential new spending must stop immediately.

""˜Carbon literacy workshops'

To mark Black History Month this year, Birmingham City Council held an online event with two beneficiaries of its £5,000 Local Food Legends Fund, one the organiser of ""carbon literacy workshops"" and a ""Carbon Literacy Educational Space for Schools and Communities"". More than £150,000 worth of grants were made available.

Earlier this month, the council held a webinar on ""key issues within African, Asian, North American & South American regional contexts"" in partnership with The Food Foundation and Milan Urban Food Policy Pact (MUFPP). 

Last year, the same non-governmental organisation advertised for a senior research and policy officer on £30,555-£34,830 per year to work for the council's food team.

The council's ""food system team"" along with members of its public health division have together written a 74-page food system strategy which calls for leaders to ""eliminat[e] injustice from farm to fork"" and ""celebrate diversity"".

A ""food justice toolkit"" developed by the council, and posted online, explains: ""Food justice, with its origins in social and environmental movements and an emphasis on racial equality, provides a comprehensive framework to tackle these systemic issues"" and ""injustices are not confined within borders"".

The web page for the Birmingham food system strategy quotes an ""adult with a mental health condition"" as saying: ""There's a relationship between everything and climate change, isn't there? The butterfly effect. I think food is important for all. If we could all get enough to eat, enjoy our diet, enjoy our mealtimes, it would build us up to be stronger, better people and we could all work together towards saving the planet.""

Making ends meet

On Monday John Cotton, the leader of Birmingham City Council, complained that government cuts would see ""councils of all political colours struggle to make ends meet"" after Michael Gove approved a £64 billion funding boost for councils. 

The council's lead government commissioner said locals could face a council tax rise of more than10 per cent, and that this was ""par of the course"" to tackle the debt.

The council has invited locals to take part in an online survey to inform its future financial direction, which includes a page explaining what gender identity is - before inviting participants to input theirs.

Speaking about the council's spending, Ben Bradley, the Conservative MP and leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, said: ""In Nottinghamshire, we've done a really good job of making pragmatic decisions about protecting our vital services. 

""We try and avoid, wherever possible, getting dragged into stuff that is just not our remit. We've got core services to deliver.

He added: ""You see in these Labour City councils, such as Birmingham campaigning about food justice strategies, that they can't afford to deliver the basics.""

Birmingham City Council said: """"The food system team and its activities are funded through the ring-fenced public health grant which is allocated by the Department of Health and Social Care. 

""Local authorities are responsible for improving the health of their local population and reducing inequalities and this grant is ring-fenced and so can only be used for these activities. 

The public health grant is separate to the council budget and has no direct effect on Birmingham City Council's spend.""

Our love of American food is making us sick and sad - here's why

Britain has fallen hard for the US diet, which not only spells bad news for our waistlines, it's also been linked with depression

Chips with everything. Deep-pan pizza, fried chicken, tower burgers, fizzy drinks, crisps and sugary cereals. In the UK, 57 per cent of the food we eat is ultra-processed. We live in a country well-suited to producing fresh food: rich pastures for our animals, fertile soils for our crops. But we've fallen hard for SAD foods: the standard American diet. 

What started in the 1950s with the allure of the American fridge, the drive-thru and the baked Alaska, now threatens to destroy the fabric of our society. 

A diet of highly refined, high-sugar, high-fat and highly processed foods has proven toxic for humans; highly addictive but one that our bodies have not evolved to process. 

The consequences in the US are already dire; 70 per cent of the population is overweight or obese, and 40 per cent have metabolic syndrome, which means they suffer from obesity, bad cholesterol or elevated blood sugar. Seventy-three thousand limbs are amputated every year in the US because of diabetes.

""There are lots of ways of describing the modern diet in high-income countries like the US and the UK,"" says Dr Chris van Tulleken, author of Ultra-Processed People. ""It's high-fat, high-salt and high-sugar, but these ingredients have been combined into industrial products with exotic additives, which can't really be described as food. They're ultra-processed foods, a set of edible substances that are addictive for many and which are now linked to weight gain, early death and, yes - depression.""

The results of a study published this week suggest that eating too many fried snacks could make you depressed. The study was conducted by Chinese researchers, but based on a survey of 140,000 Brits, and it found that those who ate fried food regularly were 12 per cent more likely to have anxiety than those who didn't. 

The study, says van Tulleken, highlights the role of acrylamide, a molecule produced by deep frying, which is linked to brain inflammation. ""But acrylamide is just one of the ways our modern diet makes us feel sad,"" he explains. ""The emulsifiers affect our microbiome in ways that make our guts leak and change the release of molecules from our friendly bugs that affect our brains.""

But perhaps the biggest effect is that many of us aren't really in control of our consumption. ""These foods are engineered to get around our bodies' systems that tell us to stop.""

We've embraced the SAD diet in the UK faster than anywhere else in Europe, with the exception of Malta (an island with which the UK has long had a close alliance).

In 1950, 1 per cent of the UK population was obese. Today it's 28 per cent. The corresponding figure is in the teens in Spain, Italy and France - although they are arguably on the same trajectory, just a little bit behind us. McDonald's is now France's biggest restaurant group.

The reasons the UK has led the way in adopting the SAD diet are two-fold, according to Henry Dimbleby, cofounder of the Leon restaurant chain and author of the National Food Strategy.

The first takes us back to the Industrial Revolution and the severing of Britons from our food culture. ""We can track the disruption of our food system to when we moved into the city before any of those countries. We basically stopped producing our own food and produced textiles instead - and imported all of our food,"" says Dimbleby, who has recently written Ravenous: How to Get Ourselves and Our Planet into Shape. France, for a contrasting example, didn't reach the same percentage of urban population until the 1960s.

The UK's situation has been further exacerbated by our special relationship with America, both glorifying its consumer culture and its free market, which has allowed companies to make money at the expense of our health. 

""In this country, 85 per cent of the portfolios of the processed food companies are products that the World Health Organisation says are too unhealthy to market to children,"" says Dimbleby.

It is not a simple question of willpower. These kinds of food are typically calorie-dense, low in soluble fibre and high in sugar and fat. ""It gives you ecstasy and pleasure rewards from eating it, because we evolved to like that kind of stuff, and it doesn't fill you up as quickly.""

They're also cheap and convenient. ""Refined wheat, sugar and vegetable oil are the cheapest foods,"" says Dimbleby. ""A lot of these foods are things mixed in different configurations with a little bit of flavour added.""

Global food security might be an issue for your fresh salad and vegetables, but, says Dimbleby: ""Sadly the planet is going to be able to produce enough calories to keep enough people sick for a long time to come.""

As an NHS gastroenterologist, Dr Saliha Mahmood-Ahmed has spent her career working against the standard American diet and trying to educate patients about how to eat healthily.

Her new book, The Kitchen Prescription, which argues that food is medicine, contains over 100 recipes that are good for the gut.

While she thinks it would be misleading to say she never eats a red velvet cake or a burger and chips, they would only ever be an occasional treat. Not the everyday foods they've become for so many.  

""Our bodies were created for periods of hunger and starvation. They're made for processing plants and natural foods,"" she says of the mismatch between our biology and SAD foods. 

These foods have led to the disease of civilisation we see today: heart disease, strokes, high blood pressure, obesity, cholesterol problems and, it's thought, certain cancers.

The irony, says Mahmood-Ahmed, is that doctors are still not trained to talk to patients about good eating patterns or to give dietary advice. ""Despite us knowing that this is one of the key answers to preventing long-term disease. We don't address the root cause.""

Her dual credentials as a doctor and chef - she won MasterChef in 2017 - mean she's in a position to educate and guide people back towards a diet that is healthy and also tasty.

One that involves cooking from scratch and changing our palates. Coming from a South Asian background helps, says Mahmood-Ahmed, because she grew up in a strong food culture that was part of her family life. ""I genuinely crave a papaya salad over burger and chips.""

Although the burger and chips give an immediate sense of comfort, Mahmood-Ahmed tries to tell her patients that they actually do very little for long-term sustenance.

""You're getting an insulin spike and you're not getting the beautiful phytonutrients that you get in food: the vitamins, the minerals and the polyphenolic compounds. All the fantastic things you get when you're eating a rainbow.""

She has had patients tell her they've felt like a mental cloud has lifted when they've changed their dietary pattern. ""Although there's no scientific way of measuring that,"" states Mahmood-Ahmed.

She's seen people whose autoimmune health conditions have reversed because of what they perceive as changes in their food levels.

While change is possible, it's also important not to blame people if they struggle to break free of their dependency on SAD foods, both from an economic and mental-health perspective. 

""We know that because of the stigma associated with obesity, gaining weight is a risk factor for feeling sad,"" says van Tulleken. ""We need to reduce the shame around weight and start to understand that we are all victims of a food system designed to make us sick.""

He adds: ""The beauty of this system from the perspective of a food producer is that most of us respond to stress and unhappiness by eating more of the food that causes the problem.""

Vanquishing the toxic interaction between our evolved appetite and the commercial incentives of food companies might seem like an impossible task, but experts believe it is possible. 

Already, a first generation of weight-loss drugs promises to change our appetites. Although Dimbleby fears problems down the line. ""We've seen with the Covid vaccine that side-effects for a few people lead to a negative reputation, which means people who really need them don't take them.""

However, he believes that with the right focus from government and citizens, we can change our food culture. Not that he thinks the current Government is doing enough: having been the lead non-executive director at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) for five years, Dimbleby left the role last month, claiming the Conservative party had been inactive in tackling obesity.

""We need to stop bombarding children 24/7 with food adverts. Also, culturally, in schools and hospitals and at home, we need to start cooking better.""

We can hardly afford not to. The former chief economist of the Bank of England, Andy Haldane, warned in November last year that the worsening health of the British people is holding back economic growth for the first time since the Industrial Revolution. Haldane, now the chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts, said more than a century of progress on health and wellbeing was going into reverse, with a direct impact on the economy and the cost of living crisis. 

If you're attempting to make a change in your own eating patterns, Mahmood-Ahmed cautions taking up a restrictive diet, in favour of eating a lot of whole foods. 

""I'm not a vegetarian,"" she says. ""I eat a small amount of meat, but the majority of food I eat is fruit and veg, nuts and seeds, legumes and pulses and spices, all from scratch. The more we can do that, and the less we have sweet, sugary beverages and ultra-processed foods, the better it is for our long-term health.""

Soaring fertiliser prices ""˜causing more global hunger than Russia's grain blockade'

Rising costs caused by the Ukraine war gas price spike could result in an extra million malnourishment deaths, new research suggests

Soaring fertiliser prices caused by the Ukraine war gas price spike are resulting in more global hunger than Russia's grain blockade and could lead to an extra million malnourishment deaths, new research suggests.

Nitrogen-based fertilisers made from natural gas have jumped in price as Russia has restricted gas exports and the cost of supplies has leapt.

The rising cost of fertiliser will damage worldwide food insecurity far more than the impact of the Kremlin's blockade on Ukrainian grain exports, researchers at Edinburgh University said.

As many as 100 million people will be left undernourished if high fertiliser prices continue, with the greatest burden in Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and the Middle East.

The high prices will also fuel environmental damage including deforestation, habitat loss and dwindling biodiversity, as countries unable to afford the fertiliser needed for high yields will be forced to expand areas under plough.

Dr Peter Alexander, of the university's School of GeoSciences, said: ""This could be the end of an era of cheap food.

""While almost everyone will feel the effects of that on their weekly shop, it's the poorest people in society, who may already struggle to afford enough healthy food, who will be hit hardest.""

While the effect of Vladimir Putin's Black Sea blockade on grain exports to many developing countries has alarmed many, the researchers found fertiliser prices would have a bigger effect on food security.

Researchers modelled the combined effects of export restrictions, increased energy costs and mid-2022 fertiliser prices, which were three times higher than at the start of the previous year. Food costs could rise by 81 per cent in 2023 compared to 2021 levels, they found.

Yet the export restrictions ""account for only a small fraction of the simulated price rises,"" the team said, in a paper published in the journal Nature Food.

A double blow on food prices

Halting exports from Russia and Ukraine would increase food costs in 2023 by 2.6 per cent, while spikes in energy and fertiliser prices would cause a 74 per cent rise.

Russia is itself a significant fertiliser exporter. These exports have not been sanctioned by the West, though Moscow says schemes targeting its banking sector have made sales more difficult.

However it is the cost of natural gas which has most affected global fertiliser costs. Natural gas is estimated to make up around 60 to 80 per cent of fertiliser production costs in Europe.

The rising cost has landed a double blow on food prices in the developing world. Fertiliser costs are passed on to consumers, or if farmers use less fertiliser, then yields fall and prices rise as harvests shrink.

Dr Alexander said the grain deal allowing Ukraine to resume exports last year was welcome.

""But the immediacy of these issues appears to have diverted attention away from the impact of fertiliser prices.

""While fertiliser prices are coming down from the peaks of earlier this year, they remain high and this may still feed through to continued high food price inflation in 2023.""

Why India's export ban and the looming El NiÃ±o spell big trouble for global rice stocks

As panic buying begins in the West, spiralling prices threaten to push poorer countries towards hunger

India's decision to take 10 million tonnes of rice off the global export market has sent shock waves across almost every continent. 

Swapping loo rolls for rice, people have already started panic buying in the West, including in Canada and Australia, while the price of a 20-pound bag has more than tripled in parts of the US - forcing shops to introduce limits on purchases. 

If India, the world's largest exporter, sticks by its ban, millions of people are likely to be plunged into hunger by skyrocketing rice prices, which are already at an 11-year high, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

It comes at a time of acute food insecurity. Last year, as many as 783 million people went hungry - the result of conflict, Covid and climate, the UN said in a recent report. And only last week, the cost of wheat jumped by 13 per cent and corn nine per cent after Russia pulled out of the deal allowing Ukraine to export grains via the Black Sea.

Yet India's ban could mark just the beginning of a painful chapter for the world's poorest.

Looming in the background is the emerging El NiÃ±o phenomenon, which could further destabilise an already fragile food market and make matters much, much worse. 

""The full impact on agriculture yield is dependent on the severity of the El Nino event,"" said Elyssa Ludher, from the Climate Change in Southeast Asia programme at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, a Singapore-based think tank. 

""But the challenge is that it is coming on top of other other climate and geopolitical events that are already causing production losses and supply disruptions ""¦ so all in all, it's a concerning situation.""

Asia ""˜central to food security'

The El NiÃ±o phenomenon, which occurs every three to seven years, is an unusual warming of the eastern Pacific Ocean which affects seasonal weather across the globe. It's declared when sea temperatures in the region rise to 0.5C above the long-term average, driving surface air temperatures and pressure to change throughout the equator and altering seasonal weather trends across both hemispheres.

In Asia, the pattern is associated with reduced rainfall and soaring temperatures - bad news in a region which farms roughly 90 per cent of the world's rice. While India is by far the biggest exporter of rice, accounting for 40 per cent of the global market, some 15 per cent of supplies come from Thailand and 14 per cent from Vietnam.

They export to countries as varied as Iran, Saudi Arabia, Benin, Nepal and the United States (see chart), and experts said production shortfalls would have ""huge implications"" globally on food availability, affordability, and malnutrition. 

""Asia really is the global rice bowl, it's central when it comes to rice-based food security,"" said Nese Sreenivasulu, an expert at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines. ""If we are not able to manage both productivity and quality in the face of climate threats, such as the El NiÃ±o, it will create issues for food security worldwide."" 

Rice is a particularly sensitive crop. In the seedling stage, the optimum temperature is between 25 and 28°C, rising to between 28 and 30°C during germination - any significant increase, especially if prolonged, hits production. 

An IRRI study found that every 1°C spike in average night-time temperatures corresponded to a 10 per cent yield loss. Heat stress in the later stages also impacts quality, increasing starch accumulation and chalkiness. 

While this can be alleviated with good irrigation, the El NiÃ±o usually affects rainfall too - a concern after much of Asia has already been hit by scorching heat waves, which themselves delayed the rice planting season in some countries. India's monsoon season has been erratic - heavy in some places and exceptionally dry in others - while Thailand has seen 28 per cent less rainfall than usual this year. 

""Rice is a water intensive crop in general, so drier than normal weather is obviously negative for crop yields,"" said Charles Hart, an agribusiness analyst at BMI Research, which tracks commodities. ""And rice cultivation is relatively labour intensive. In Asia it is not particularly mechanised, so the heat effect on labour may also be pronounced.""

""˜Godzilla' El NiÃ±o

The effects of a particularly nasty El NiÃ±o on global rice production have been seen before. When the ""˜Godzilla El NiÃ±o' hit in 2015, bringing scorching temperatures and a prolonged drought to southeast Asia, the region's thirsty rice crop withered. 

The severe weather wiped out 15 million tonnes of the staple grain, around a quarter of global exports, and helped drive prices up by 16 per cent. Worldwide, the El NiÃ±o's impact on farming and affordability pushed 60 million people towards food insecurity. 

Countries are already taking steps to minimise the fallout, with importers including China and the Philippines aggressively stockpiling supplies. 

Meanwhile in Thailand, authorities have told growers to switch and grow more drought-tolerate produce instead of a second rice crop this year, to conserve water. And in Indonesia, farmers have tried to plant earlier, hoping the rice will be ready for harvest before the El NiÃ±o wreaks havoc on rainfall.

But the ramifications could go well beyond this year, said Ms Ludher. If extreme drought and heat bakes the soil, it can make it less productive for the next planting season, while a bad harvest may affect a farmer's ability to buy more seeds and fertiliser - some may even be pushed to sell land to pay debts. 

""Past studies have shown that a very strong El NiÃ±o could see repercussions for years, depending on how extensively it hits,"" she said, adding that diversifying diets and agriculture is critical. 

Efforts to develop drought and heat resistant varieties of rice are also ongoing. In Bangladesh, the IRRI, which has been at the forefront of breeding new rice varieties for decades, is rolling out a pilot of a seed bred to tolerate higher temperatures. So far the results are promising: the seeds produce yields of 4.6 to 4.8 per hectare, and are 1.5 tonnes/hectare higher than other varieties during hot weather.

""So we want to position these varieties across Asia in the future,"" said Dr Sreenivasulu, adding that while many countries have expressed interest, rollout is unlikely to be in time to withstand the coming El NiÃ±o. ""But the frequency of climate shocks is increasing, it's not just the El NiÃ±o, so we really need new interventions to ensure rice farming stays sustainable.""

""˜Rice is a political crop' 

But experts say it will be a few months before the severity of the El NiÃ±o, and the ramifications for rice supplies and other agricultural activities, will emerge. For now, India's export ban will pose a bigger shock to the global food chain. 

The country has seen prices rise by 11 per cent over the last 12 months, and last week introduced restrictions to non-basmati white rice - about a quarter of the country's exports - in an attempt to curb inflation at home ahead of elections next year. 

Combined with other restrictions on broken rice already in place, 40 per cent of India's exports are now offline - roughly 10 million tonnes. That equates to almost a fifth of the international market, which stood at 55.4 million tonnes in 2022. 

There are also concerns about India's domestic harvest; the planting of summer-sown rice is down 26 per cent from a year ago after monsoons hit some regions hard, and others not at all.

""Rice has been called the political crop, namely because government intervention in the global food market is pervasive,"" said Shirley Mustafa, an economist in the FAO's Trade and Market Division. 

""It's not a foregone conclusion that production will decline with the El NiÃ±o""¦ [but] government intervention in preparation for it, or for other factors, can have significant impacts on the supply side and affordability.""  

According to analysis from BMI Research, India's decision will have ""material implications"" for global rice trends, especially after a deficit in production in 2022/23. 

""In conjunction with the supply-side risks associated with El NiÃ±o, we expect the export ban to keep upside pressure on prices,"" the report said. 

""˜Perfect storm' for world's poorest 

The South Asian nation supplies rice to more than 100 countries, and it is not yet clear whether other producers will be able to fill the gaps created by India's policy.

But BMI's Mr Hart said that although global inventories of rice are expected to fall over the coming months - some have estimated a six-year low in stockpiles, of roughly 170 million tonnes by the end of the year - he does not think the biggest problem will be supply.

Instead, it is price rises which means many ""will not have the ability to pay"" for those staples, pushing them towards hunger and hitting both African countries and major importers, like Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia, especially hard. 

This will only be exacerbated by the breakdown of the Black Sea trade deal between Russia and Ukraine, which will impact wheat and corn supplies and push more people to seek alternative grains. 

Last year, price hikes as a result of constrained food and fertiliser supplies - Russia and Ukraine are also major producers - helped push the Horn of Africa close to famine. 

""We are sort of witnessing a perfect storm,"" David Ubilava, an associate professor of economics at the University of Sydney, told Channel News Asia. ""This political intervention [in India] happens to coincide with another political issue in the Black Sea region, which affects wheat, another major staple""¦ and this developing El Nino.

""When the price of key staples goes up, that just makes people's lives worse.""

How spiders could save the world from crop-eating pests - according to scientists

Study shows that releasing clusters of tropical web-building insects could provide an eco-friendly alternative to pesticides

Releasing large numbers of tropical spiders into the wild might seem like the stuff of nightmares, but scientists believe they could provide an environmentally-friendly alternative to pesticides. 

Experts around the world are currently struggling with new ways to battle the tomato leafminer moth, which is decimating commercially important crops such as tomatoes and potatoes. 

The moth has developed resistance to insecticides, leaving farmers helpless to stop the infestations.

Now a new study from the University of Portsmouth has shown that clusters of web-building spiders could be deployed en masse to eat the moths.

Scientists carried out laboratory tests and found that the spiders banded together to form webs which easily caught the flying insects, which they then devoured. 

The researchers chose the tropical tent web spider, Cyrtophora citricola, for experiments because they operate in large groups and can create giant joined-up webs to capture bugs. 

Dr Lena Grinsted, a senior lecturer in zoology at the university's School of Biological Sciences, and the lead author of the study, said: ""Our findings suggest that tropical tent web spiders have the potential to be an effective biological control agent of flying insect pests.

""Spiders that can form groups of hundreds, or even thousands, of interconnected webs can provide large surface areas of capture webs capable of intercepting high frequencies of airborne insects.

""This could potentially lead to a reduction of reliance on chemical pesticides, resulting in reduced pollutants in soils, waterways and food chains in the future.""

The tomato leafminer, Tuta absoluta, originates from Peru and is common throughout South America. However, it has spread through Europe since 2007 and has become one of the largest pests in Mediterranean growing regions, threatening food supplies.

The moth has infested 60 per cent of tomato-cultivated land throughout the world and can cause up to 100 per cent yield reduction if left untreated. 

Crop damage is caused by the larvae, which feed on most of the exposed plant parts, burrowing into the outer layer of plant and stalk, reducing the photosynthetic surface, which results in stunted plant growth and lower fruit yield.

The larvae can also directly attack the tomato fruit, causing aesthetic damage and making the crop unmarketable. The moth is also known to target other crops including potatoes, bell and chilli peppers, and aubergine.

Larvae live inside the leaf until they begin the process of turning into a moth, making them difficult to control when they are young. However, scientists expect that by targeting the adult moth population, it will reduce the number of eggs being laid. 

Biggest webs ""˜built during summer'

Web-building spiders are natural predators of flying insects, so scientists believe they could be harnessed as natural pest control. 

Tropical tent web spiders are found in colonies around the world and their global range overlaps with regions of moth infestations, including Mediterranean Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. They form large sheet webs capable of capturing large numbers of insects. 

The spiders also have the added advantage of building the biggest webs during the summer months, which would benefit the tomato planting and growing season in May and June.

The researchers said the study will ""open doors for the use of group-living arachnids to control agricultural pests"", but warned that more work was needed to check the spiders did not eat important pollinators or alter the ecology of regions. 

Dr Grinsted added: ""Future studies are now needed to investigate whether the spiders may negatively impact crop pollination by also catching and feeding on bees and other key pollinators."" 

The research was published in the journal Insects.

The man who has finally made baked beans British

A Lincolnshire farmer has grown and harvested the UK's first crop of a new bean variety - a project that has been 12 years in the making

They are as quintessentially British as scones or shepherd's pie. So, it may come as a surprise that every single baked bean in the two million tins consumed each day in the UK has been imported from the US, Canada, Ethiopia or China. But not for much longer: behold, the first baked beans grown on home soil. 

Lincolnshire farmer Andrew Ward, who has grown and harvested the UK's first crop of a new bean variety, has had a lifelong love affair with beans on toast. ""Right from my childhood,"" he says. ""When I was at boarding school, the food was appalling. What I used to do was get some tins of beans with sausages and I used to heat the tin up in the kettle. Another favourite of mine was to get a bag of crisps, smash them to smithereens in the bag, and have baked beans and crisps on toast."" 

Fast-forward roughly 40 years and Ward, 52, who took over the family business from his father, jumped at the chance to be Britain's first baked-bean farmer in partnership with researchers at the University of Warwick and the agricultural company Agrii. Ward sees the fact that this British staple is grown overseas as a vital food security issue. ""Obviously that's why I wanted to get involved in growing, because you clearly can't carry on just importing everything and be happy with our self-sufficiency dropping."" 

Far more than simply one component of a fry-up, baked beans are rich in protein and fibre and have a small carbon footprint - some have even gone so far as to suggest they could be a superfood. 

But the shorter British growing season and colder weather means the haricot beans in a typical tin on supermarket shelves can't be grown on home soil. However, 12 years ago, scientists from the University of Warwick started work on growing the first truly British baked beans. They bred thousands of varieties and then selected three that are designed to thrive in our cooler, damper climate and could be farmed commercially. The three are called Capulet (similar to other baked beans - named after Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet), Godiva (a blonde-coloured kidney bean) and Olivia (a black bean named after the Bard's Twelfth Night). Twelve years is an awfully long time to wait for a jacket potato filling or toast topping.

""It has taken years because of the time it takes for each generation to grow""¦ it's taken six years to actually get the variety to the stage where it can be registered,"" says prof Eric Holub of the University of Warwick. ""And then it's a case of increasing enough seed to be able to grow across two hectares. You need to go through a couple of years of producing more seed before you can start growing a crop."" 

The beans can be planted in May and harvested in September to fit this country's shorter growing season, and are resilient enough to cope with the vagaries of our weather. They can be drilled and harvested with equipment that British farmers already have access to.

""When we talk about haricot beans, we're actually talking about something called a navy bean, which is a particular type of common bean,"" says Holub. The new variety of Capulet bean that has been successfully trialled on Ward's farm was bred from a common North American navy bean and a Peruvian bean from South America. ""Through that cross, we've got a variety that's now able to work with the sunshine and the heat in a British summer,"" he adds. 

Though ultimately successful, the first British baked bean growing season has not been without its challenges. Ward, a second-generation farmer, has 16,000 acres of wheat, barley, oats and oilseed rape in Leadenham, Lincolnshire, and admits the relatively challenging new Capulet bean crop ""won't be for everybody""¦ it will require a certain amount of attention to detail.

""Everyone thinks farmers are always moaning about the weather,"" he says, but it did throw up a few challenges this year. ""They need a little bit of moisture when they're planted, like every crop. They need lovely sunny weather for June and July, with a bit of rain in between, and a good harvesting period at the end of August and September,"" says Ward. ""Everything we wanted, we didn't get - we got the opposite this year. But we have succeeded."" Most of this year's harvest will be funnelled back into next year's planting to increase future yields.

While they may now be a Sunday night suppertime staple - Heinz claims that nearly a quarter of Britons eat beans two or three times a week - they were once an exotic treat. Arriving in the UK from the United States in 1886, baked beans were initially sold in Fortnum & Mason as an imported luxury. To see the first beans tinned on home soil signals a bright future for one of Britain's favourite foods. 

Princes, the company that manufactures Branston Baked Beans (which the Telegraph's own thrifty buys expert, Xanthe Clay, says taste better than the classic Heinz), canned the first crop of Capulet beans in a signature tomato sauce in its Lincolnshire factory. 

But on to the most important question: how do they taste? Well, largely indistinguishable from any other tin of beans, which is good news. ""The flavour is all in the sauce and the spice,"" says Holub. ""Capulet is the same."" 

Taste-testers on the streets of Lincoln were more enthusiastic. ""There wasn't anybody who said, ""˜They were awful, I wouldn't buy those,'"" says Ward. ""A lot of people said, ""˜Well, they're just like baked beans,' which is great."" However, some also said they actually prefer them to ""normal"" baked beans. 

They are due to reach shelves - first as whole, dried beans - in select zero-waste stores before the end of this year, and will likely be available in tins towards the end of 2026. It's a baked bean breakthrough.

Meet Polly - the tech that's here to help save the bees

Innovative insect-tracking technology is creating a buzz for Tesco's apple growers - and could benefit wild bees and increase crop yields

We rely on wild bees and other pollinators for 75 per cent of global crops yet these unappreciated insects are in sharp decline. It is a dire situation that risks having a devastating impact on crop yields and the natural world. 

As part of their long-term partnership, Tesco and WWF have invested in a new pilot scheme that hopes to help farmers boost pollinator populations, restoring nature to farms while also increasing crop yields. 

David Edwards, director of food strategy at WWF UK, says we're not going to deal with the climate crisis unless we move to a ""more nature-positive approach to agriculture"". 

""We are facing a triple challenge: the need to create more food while also protecting nature and addressing the drivers and consequences of climate change. This frames everything we're doing with the Tesco partnership.""

Funded through its Innovation Connections Programme (see panel below), 50 AI listening devices known as Polly have been deployed across apple orchards in Kent this spring by AMFRESH, one of Tesco's fresh fruit suppliers, working in partnership with AgriSound. 

What is Polly and how does it work?

Casey Woodward, founder and CEO of AgriSound, explains that Polly is a ""simple and smart listening device"" that captures and counts the sounds of common pollinating insects, including honeybees, bumblebees and other bugs.

""Polly is able to recognise the sounds of insects in the environment and use that information to tell farmers and landowners how many pollinators there are in that area at any given time,"" says Woodward.

While the Polly technology is undoubtedly innovative, Alice Ritchie, Tesco's lead nature and forests manager, says its beauty lies in the fact that it's rooted in nature.

""At Tesco we want to go back to basics and invest in nature by supporting nature-based solutions. That's where AgriSound comes in: it isn't going to improve biodiversity by itself, but it gives us the tools to measure and understand what needs to be done on the ground and enhance the work that we do with nature,"" she says.

""Polly is a great example of what we're trying to achieve with the partnership and fits very nicely into the idea of revealing the natural impacts and what the effects of nature are,"" adds Edwards.

""Unfortunately, quite a lot of the aspects of nature's health can be invisible to farmers, such as the concentration of pollinators,"" he says. ""These insects underpin the entire ecosystem of farms and we cannot have food security without healthy pollinator populations."" 

Small, orange and solar-powered, Polly's design has been optimised to attract a range of pollinators, whose presence is detected through the use of a specialised acoustic sensor.

The data Polly collects allows growers to then make decisions on issues such as planting wildflower margins and creating bug-friendly habitats to help attract more pollinators. 

""Our data helps farmers work in conjunction with their agronomists to really take a holistic perspective on what should be done,"" explains Woodward.

""The trial is comparing different production systems to see how the different actions farmers take can either positively or negatively impact different pollinator levels. We're comparing conventional production against regenerative agriculture systems to see how pollinator activity varies, as well as looking at the impact of bringing in things like wildflowers and native vegetation.""

Edwards points out that in Britain we have more than 250 species of bees - bumblebees, solitary bees and others - and it's these wild pollinators that are most at risk, not honeybees. 

Woodward agrees, adding that pollinators do much more than protect our food security. 

""Pollination is crucial to maintaining healthy ecosystems by encouraging natural biodiversity, the removal of carbon from the atmosphere [from increased plant growth] and ensuring our food is jam-packed full of nutrients,"" he says.

Creating a buzz

For AMFRESH, the opportunity to partner with AgriSound came at the perfect time; biodiversity is one of its key sustainability targets, but there wasn't a ready tool to accurately measure populations of key pollinators in the field.

The first results from its trial in Spain, where it has been monitoring some 250 Polly units across three different environments - a conventional farm, a bee-friendly farm and one transitioning to organic - show promising results, according to Naomi Pendleton, AMFRESH's group sustainability director.

""The project first came to my attention via our chief technical officer, Nigel Jenner, who had met with AgriSound to learn more about the work Casey and his team were doing,"" she says.

""The bee-friendly farm has double the number of pollinators - there was a 100-per-cent uplift. That's incredibly positive, because I can now show our other growers the real impact that creating a bee-friendly environment can have,"" she adds. 

Ritchie is delighted with the results and is looking forward to the findings in Kent too, where 50 Polly devices are listening for pollinators in three orchards with wildflower margins and three without.

""This trial gives our growers the tools to start thinking in practical terms about what they're doing on their farms, how they can support their Tesco suppliers like AMFRESH, and to manage and support biodiversity. As Polly can also listen out for pests, that also contributes to our supply chain resilience by helping reduce our reliance on artificial pesticides and fertilisers and move to a much more sustainable form of farming,"" Ritchie says.

""The environment is at the heart of everything we're doing. Yes, it's about yields, and creating more profitable and efficient systems too, but ultimately what we're really trying to do is support the environment and biodiversity."" 

AMFRESH will certainly be flying the flag for boosting pollinators with its industry peers on the back of the first results of the trial. 

""We participate in sustainable agriculture working groups with WWF and Tesco and its supply base. The way we work together is very collaborative and we all share our own research and best practice. We're not proprietorial about anything because we're all trying to achieve the same goals in terms of sustainability,"" says Pendleton.

Electric collar ban ""˜will add to growing menace of dog attacks'

Rishi Sunak is warned by sheep farmers that the ""˜insulting' plans, due to take effect in 2024, will cause harm to livestock and pets

A ban on e-collars will worsen the ""growing menace of dog attacks"" on sheep, farmers have warned Rishi Sunak.

More than 400 sheep farmers have written to the Prime Minister ""demanding action to reduce dog attacks"" whilst offering a warning that the electric-shock training collar ban will increase livestock attacks and the number of out-of-control dogs being shot.

The letter, seen by The Telegraph, says that the ban - due to come into force in February - ""would alienate not just farmers but vast numbers of loving dog owners who use e-collars to protect their dogs and our sheep"".

On Monday, Phil Stocker, the chief executive of the National Sheep Association, who sent the letter to Mr Sunak, said: ""This is not a small matter to farmers or dog owners. Defra says that some half a million dogs are trained with e-collars. If that training is banned next February, the consequences during lambing season will cause fury around the countryside.""

He told the Prime Minister that he had been asked to send the letter because of farmers' ""alarm over the failure of government policy to help them protect their flocks from the growing menace of dog attacks.""

Mr Stocker described the ban as ""irresponsible and unnecessary"" as collars are an ""effective training aid, and in many cases an alternative to having to have a dog put down"".

The ban was first proposed in 2018 and last month the Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) laid draft regulations which proposed that it would take effect on Feb 1, 2024.

The move came after pressure from animal rights groups including The Kennel Club, Dogs Trust, RSPCA and Battersea Dogs & Cats Home.

The regulations note that a ""full impact assessment has not been produced ""¦ as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen"".

However, the letter points out that concerns have been raised by sheep farmers in Wales, where a ban on the training collars has been in place since 2010. They suffer four times more attacks and have to shoot three times more dogs than their counterparts in the rest of the UK, research has shown.

""Defra needs to listen to Welsh sheep farmers,"" the letter says. ""It is insulting that it has not done so.""

Coffey accused of ""˜ethics breach'

Separately, an animal welfare law to crack down on irresponsible dog owners involved in livestock attacks was scrapped by the Government last month.

The 441 signatories said that they welcomed government campaigns for people to keep dogs on leads, but it was not enough and noted that the Prime Minister was recently spoken to by police for having his own dog off a lead.

""Fines alone will not solve the problem,"" they said. ""Yet please do not make it even worse by banning e-collar training for high prey drive dogs.""

They added: ""Science shows that dogs trained with e-collars show no appetite for attacking sheep even when they have escaped from their owners.""

The letter says that Defra intends to ban the collars because they are ""cruel"". It has previously been revealed that an e-collar was used to train the family pet of ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey, the minister in charge of the department.

They said that if she did this ""believing they are cruel"" she should be ""held to account"". If, on the other hand, she believes they are not cruel but ""pretends"" that they should be banned she is being ""dishonest"", they tell the Prime Minister.

""Either way, we ask you to refer her to Sir Laurie Magnus for breaching ministerial ethics,"" they tell Mr Sunak.

The letter also questions the involvement of ""activists"" in bringing in the ban and asked why Defra had commissioned research on the impact of e-collars from researchers who had publicly opposed their use.

A Defra spokesman said: ""We want to protect dogs and cats from these harmful devices which can be all too easily open to abuse and proven to cause long-term harm.

""However, we recognise the impact attacks on livestock have on our farming community - which is why we are tackling this important issue by bringing forward new measures this Parliament.""

Vegan activist group in the running for Prince William's Earthshot Prize

Plant-Based Universities campaigns for more vegan options to be sold in educational institutions

A group of vegan activists campaigning for more plant-based food to be sold at universities is in the running for Prince William's prestigious Earthshot Prize.

Plant-Based Universities, which wants a transition to fully plant-based menus, has made it through the first stage of the rigorous selection process.

It has active campaigns in more than 70 universities in the UK and abroad and claims that student unions at seven British institutions, including Cambridge and UCL, have already voted to move towards 100 per cent vegan menus.

The group, founded by the Animal Rising activist movement in late 2021, claims that universities have an obligation to follow the scientific research they produce.

The nomination could prove controversial after Animal Rising, an affiliate of Extinction Rebellion, took part in many headline grabbing stunts, including the disruption of this year's Epsom Derby and the alleged theft of three lambs from the King's Sandringham estate.

It was nominated for an Earthshot Prize by Generation Vegan, whose tagline is ""unite, disrupt, transform"".

ðŸŒ WE'VE BEEN NOMINATED FOR PRINCE WILLIAM'S EARTHSHOT PRIZE ðŸš€

Plant-Based Universities are in with a chance of winning a £1 million environmental award!

It comes as Amazon announced a £14.5 million investment in Belterra, a Brazil-based 2023 Earthshot finalist, to generate carbon credits by restoring the Amazon rainforest while benefiting small farmers in the region.

Earlier this year, Generation Vegan ran a campaign calling on the Prince of Wales to add a vegan category to his environmental awards, which was backed by celebrities including Olivia Colman, Dame Emma Thompson and Chris Packham.

In an open letter to the Prince, more than two dozen actors, singers and green activists, warned that in order to achieve his goal of repairing and protecting the planet, people had to change how they eat.

They claimed that the current five categories of the Earthshot Prize fell short of what was necessary to make a difference.

The campaign was unsuccessful but as a concession, Generation Vegan was allowed to choose two experts to join the 2024 Earthshot judging panel for the Protect and Restore Nature category: Dr Joseph Poore, an Oxford University researcher and Dr Hannah Ritchie, a scientist for Our World in Data.

Generation Vegan was also given the chance to become an official nominator for the category, the first vegan organisation to do so, and chose Plant-Based Universities as one of its 64 nominations from all over the world. Another is Plant-based Treaty, a grassroots campaign designed to ensure that food systems are at the forefront of combating the climate crisis.

""˜Just and sustainable university catering'

Earthshot said nominators are chosen ""for their ability to identify the most impactful solutions to our five Earthshots across all countries and sectors, from grassroots and Indigenous communities to businesses and governments.""

Plant-Based Universities hailed the inclusion of Generation Vegan as a ""clear shift towards recognising the utmost importance of a plant-based food system"".

Michelle Farnham, the group's co-ordinator, said they were ""delighted"" to be nominated for Prince William's £1 million prize.

""This alone represents that we must take the transition to a plant-based food system seriously,"" she said.

""Students worldwide are stepping up and showing true leadership, with hundreds working to create just and sustainable university catering. We hope this sends a strong signal to other institutions that the time for change is now.""

She added: ""Young people are blazing a trail towards a brighter future. The world is changing and Plant-Based Universities is at the forefront of that transformation, making positive changes for students, staff, farmers, and other food producers alike.""

The list of nominations will be whittled down by the Earthshot judging panel early next year before shortlists are drawn up.

The ceremony is expected to take place towards the end of 2024 in Africa.

The Last Of Us 'bread theory' echoes a deadly psychedelic fungus outbreak from history

The apocalyptic HBO series may be fiction but the consequences of populations ingesting a mind-altering fungus are very real

The latest episode of The Last of Us, HBO's brilliant zombie thriller, explains in detail how a cordyceps fungus got into the food system and caused a global disaster. Last week we learnt that the fungus had mutated to live in humans. This week, Joel (Pedro Pascal) told his young charge Ellie (Bella Ramsey) that it had spread around the world via the global food supply (known to the show's fans as the 'bread theory' before the most recent episode spilled the beans on the source of the apocalyptic outbreak). 

The relentless, wriggling cordyceps of The Last of Us remains in the realms of speculation. Our body temperatures are too hot for those fungi to survive. But the plot is based in fact: history provides a chastening reminder of how a fungus can get into the food supply, with devastating consequences. One fungus with a rich lineage is ergot, which grows on rye grasses. Ergot has a range of effects on humans, some health-giving - it produces alkaloids that have been shown to treat migraines and stop post partum bleeding in new mothers. It was while researching lysergic acid, which is derived from the alkaloid ergotamine, that the Swiss chemist Albert Hoffman stumbled across lysergic acid diethylamide, better known as LSD, in 1938.

At the same time, however, ergot comes with great risk. Ingest too much and the condition, known as ergotism, can be horrible, even fatal. ""Ergotism is horrendous,"" says Dr Merlin Sheldrake, a biologist and the author of Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds & Shape Our Futures. ""You have twitching limbs, a sense of unbearable burning, terrifying dreams and nightmares and delirious visions. It's a horrendous state to be in. That's why there's a lot of fear there."" Long-term ergot poisoning has been associated with mystical or spiritual experience, both revelatory and nightmarish. Various historic episodes of delirium, madness and death have been blamed on ergot poisoning, usually through the consumption of contaminated rye bread.

Ergotism was also called St Anthony's Fire, for the burning sensation experienced by sufferers. (The St Anthony reference is to the order of monks who would offer its victims solace.) A single outbreak, in Aquitaine, France, in 944 AD, is thought to have killed as many as 40,000 people. Gangrene was possibly the worst of ergotism's many symptoms. During that outbreak, the French historian Flodoard wrote that: ""Several men had their limbs afflicted by sores in Paris and neighbouring towns. The limbs, burnt bit by bit, were consumed until death ended the torment.""

Ergot thrives on a cold winter followed by a wet spring, and some studies have pointed out that periods of rapid depopulation in Europe have coincided with wet conditions favoured by the fungus. In 1976, an influential paper suggested that ergot might have been involved in the Salem witch trials of the 17th century, as depicted by Arthur Miller's The Crucible, although subsequent research has debunked it. 

Whatever its presence in witchcraft, ergot - and ergot poisoning - has been entwined with civilisation, possibly for as long as we have cultivated grain. ""[Ergot] has a brutal horrendous part, the life-saving human reproduction part, and the psychedelic part,"" Sheldrake adds. ""It's a rich subject.""

One man who agrees is Brian Muraresku, an American writer and lawyer whose book, The Immortality Key, details his decade-long quest for a specific variety of ergot, thought to have been used in a potion used by initiates at Eleusis in Greece, who would have wild visions. Some academics - especially a classicist called Carl Ruck - had speculated that this potion was an ergotised beer drink, but nobody had been able to prove it. After more than a decade, Muraresku discovered that researchers had found evidence of hallucinogenic drinks at a site in Spain.

Ergotism had become less common in Europe since the 19th century, when farmers had learned how to spot infections and treat them. After Hoffman's discovery of LSD, ergot came back into discourse via the counterculture. For Muraresku, this may be one reason why scientists were slow to pick up on their therapeutic properties.

""In the 1960s and 70s psychedelics were not the province of august men,"" he says. ""They came in through the counterculture, and they were demonised, something to fear.""  

""But these things are reviled on the one hand, but also inspire awe and reverence,"" he adds. ""Much like raw ergot. It has been responsible for mass poisoning and hallucinations, but there's at least one chemical from it, LSD, which sometimes results in mystical unitive experiences."" The politics of earlier decades have had an effect on Muraresku. Unlike many other researchers into psychedelics, he has never tried them himself.

Even in the current fertile environment for fungi research, with well-funded psilocybin start-ups and research papers from serious universities around the world, ergot remains overlooked.

""There has been very little clinical research into ergot,"" he says. ""It's understudied, and under-talked about. There are three types of psychedelics: tryptamines are psilocybin, DMT, etc. There's the phenethylamines, which is mescaline. Then there are ergolines. And we tend to focus a lot on the tryptamines and the phenethylamines. But there's very little on the ergolines.""

With fungi-derived meat on supermarket shelves, fungi-derived drugs in our research labs, and mutated fungi making terrifying zombies on our screens, perhaps this will change. Growing on individual ears of wheat, ergot might be a little fungus but it has had an outsized effect on history.

Debt default risks 'worldwide panic', warns Yellen

Key moments

Chosen by us to get you up to speed at a glance

The US Treasury Secretary has warned that ""time is running out"" to avert an economic catastrophe from failing to raise the US debt ceiling, as Joe Biden prepares to meet congressional leaders over the standoff.

Janet Yellen warned the world is ""already seeing the impacts of brinksmanship"" as the President and Speaker Kevin McCarthy have been at an impasse since January over raising the government's $31.4trn (£25.1trn) borrowing limit.

Mr Biden tweeted that a default could lead to eight million job losses, adding: ""Default is not an option.""

Mr McCarthy himself warned ""we only have so many days left to deal with this"" ahead of his meeting with Mr Biden today.

A US default - where it would be unable to pay its debts - risks triggering a market selloff, a surge in borrowing costs and a blow to the global economy that could rival the 2008 crash.

Ms Yellen said: ""We are already seeing the impacts of brinksmanship: investors have become more reluctant to hold government debt that matures in early June.

""The impasse has already increased the debt burden to American taxpayers.""

Ms Yellen told a gathering of community bankers that the unprecedented economic and financial crisis would be exacerbated by possible disruptions to the federal government's operations, including air traffic control, law enforcement, border security and national defence, and telecommunications systems.

She said the accompanying financial crisis could multiply the severity of the downturn, adding: ""It is very conceivable that we'd see a number of financial markets break - with worldwide panic triggering margin calls, runs and fire sales.""

It comes as latest data showed US retail sales rose 0.4pc in April, lower than the 0.8pc forecast by economists.

Video game developer Ubisoft posts its largest operating loss ever

Ubisoft is pushing for profits this year after video game cancellations and delays have resulted in significant losses.

The French developer posted a full-year operating loss of â‚¬500m (£435m) on Tuesday, the biggest in the company's history.

However, the Paris-listed publisher still expects to turn its losses into an operating profit of â‚¬400m during the current financial year, which ends next March.

Ubisoft hopes to fuel this recovery by increasing the staff working on 'Mirage', the latest installment of its key franchise Assassin's Creed which has been delayed.

Chief executive Yves Guillemot said: ""As part of our progressive reallocation of resources, we notably plan to increase the number of talents working on the Assassin's Creed brand by 40pc over the coming years.""

The developer is down around 700 staff since last September, following its announcement of cost-cutting efforts to save â‚¬200m

Earlier this year, Ubisoft cancelled three unannounced games and pushed back several highly-anticipated titles amid weaker consumer spending.

Large US regional banks could face 'tougher rules', says Fed vice chair

The Federal Reserve is ""carefully considering"" imposing tougher rules on US regional lenders holding over $100bn in assets in the wake of several bank failures.

Michael Barr, the Federal Reserve's vice chair for supervision, told Congress that he expects to unveil proposals on reworking capital and liquidity rules for banks sometime this summer following a ""holistic review"" of existing requirements.

He added that any rule changes will go through the formal proposal and comment process.

Mr Barr also said that the Federal Reserve is ""intensively supervising"" banks for how they are managing interest rate risks.

This includes highlighting the ""heightened risk"" stemming from stalled negotiations over raising the US debt ceiling.

Greggs Leicester Square to open till 2am despite fears it will be antisocial ""˜hotspot'

London's late-night revellers will be able to stop off at Greggs for bacon baps and coffee as late as 2am, after the bakery chain fought off claims that the ""mega-Greggs"" would become a hotspot for crime.

Retail editor Hannah Boland has more details:

Greggs cancelled a planned appeal hearing that had been expected to decide whether it could keep serving hot food at its Leicester Square store for 24 hours, after it reached an agreement with Westminster City Council.

The store - dubbed Mega-Greggs because of the larger size of the flagship site - will now be able to serve hot food including potato wedges and pizza up until 2am.

Chief executive Roisin Murphy said this was ""over the midnight cusp"". It had aimed to be able to keep the store open round the clock but was forced to row back amid claims that it would become a ""hotspot for late-night disturbances and antisocial behaviour"".

The Metropolitan Police had argued that there was ""the likely effect of an increase in crime and disorder in the area and an increased demand on police resources which are already stretched"".

Aicha Less, deputy leader of Westminster City Council, said Greggs would be required to have CCTV at the site and door supervisors under the agreement - both steps Greggs had suggested.

It comes amid a wider push at Greggs to open stores later into the evening...

Blackstone calls staff back into the office

Blackstone has ordered employees to work from the office at least four days, after re-discovering the benefits from working together in-person following the pandemic. 

The New York-based asset manager told staff in a memo: ""We will shift to at least four days per week in the office, with the flexibility to work from home one day per week.""

Blackstone's chief operating officer Rob Goldstein and global head of human resources Caroline Heller also told staff that office-working benefits career development, Bloomberg reported.

They wrote to staff in a memo: ""Career development happens in teaching moments between team members, and it is accelerated during market-moving moments, when we step up and get into the mix.""

The private equity giant previously expected more than half of its personnel to work in the office at least three days a week. The new approach begins on the 11th of September. 

ChatGPT will 'entirely automate away' some jobs, says OpenAI boss

Testifiying before Congress, he added:

""I think it's important to understand and think about GPT4 as a tool and not a creature, which is easy to get confused and it's a tool that people have a great deal of control over and how they use it.""

Mr Altman noted that ChatGPT is good at doing tasks more efficiently, not whole jobs.

JP Morgan unlikely to rescue another regional lender, says Dimon

JP Morgan is unlikely to rescue additional regional lenders struggling through the US banking crisis, according to tchief executive Jamie Dimon.

Responding to a shareholder question at the Wall Street lender's annual meeting, Mr Dimon said the industry was hopefully ""coming back to stability"", Bloomberg reported. 

First Republic Bank was sold to JP Morgan earlier this month after becoming the third major US lender to collapse since March. 

His comments follow concerns that the First Republic deal strengthens JP Morgan's position as the US's foremost lender, but will potentially trigger concerns that it is becoming too systemically important. 

OpenAI boss calls for government intervention against 'powerful' AI systems

The chief executive of OpenAI has told US lawmakers that government intervention ""will be critical to mitigate the risks of increasingly powerful"" AI systems.

""As this technology advances, we understand that people are anxious about how it could change the way we live. We are too,"" Sam Altman testified at a Senate hearing.

His comments follow broader concerns about the ability of generative artficial intelligence - including OpenAI's ChatGPT - to mislead people, spread falsehoods, violate copyright protections and upend some jobs.

Earlier this month, Mr Altman and the bosses of Google, Microsoft and Anthropic were called to the White House to discuss the risks surrounding the technology. 

Senator Richard Blumenthal opened the Senate hearing with a recorded speech that sounded like him, but was actually a voice clone trained with artificial intelligence using previous floor speeches.

The voice clone recited a speech written by ChatGPT after the Connecticut Democrat, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on privacy and technology, asked the chatbot: ""How I would open this hearing?""

The result was impressive, said Mr Blumenthal, but he added, ""What if I had asked it, and what if it had provided, an endorsement of Ukraine surrendering or (Russian President) Vladimir Putin's leadership?""

The senator said AI companies ought to be required to test their systems and disclose known risks before releasing them.

Over-50s raise the bar at Marston's

Pub group Marston's has said recruitment pressures have eased as it has hired ""more over-50s"".

It came as the company hailed a rise in sales for the past six months on the back of strong drink trade despite pressure on customer budgets.

Hospitality bosses and trade bodies have cautioned over staffing shortages over the past year as vacancies in the sector struck record levels, impacting the ability of some businesses to trade.

However, Andrew Andrea, chief executive of the 1,440-strong pub group, staffing is in a ""good place"" after an improvement in the hiring market. He said:

The are finding the availability and quality of talent OK at the moment.

It's definitely different depending on locations, like city centres, but the situation is fairly good right now.

We have been employing more over-50s and it is very encouraging to see more in that market coming back into work.

Marston's also revealed that like-for-like sales grew by 10.7pc over the half-year to April 1 compared with the same period last year.

Sugar-free drinks help Britvic fizz

The maker of Robinsons and Pepsi Max has hailed a jump in sales following price rises and growing demand for sugar-free soft drinks.

Britvic, which also owns household brands including J20, Fruit Shoot and Tango, said total revenues in Britain jumped by a 10th over the six months to the end of March compared with the previous year.

This includes supermarket, restaurant and pub sales.

Sales for Tango alone rocketed by 37pc over the period, with low-sugar variants like ""berry peachy"" and ""paradise punch"" seeing strong demand.

Chief executive Simon Litherland said: 

Everybody wants more Tango at the moment.

Low-sugar flavours are really resonating well, particularly with young people. It's going to be a big driver of growth for us in the second half of the year.

The higher revenues in the latest period were largely because Britvic raised the prices of its products in the first quarter of its financial year, in a bid to offset double-digit cost inflation.

CBI appoints new executive to crack down on toxic culture

The scandal-hit Confederation of British Industry has hired a new executive to crack down on its toxic culture.

Chief people officer Elizabeth Wallace has been hired to implement a series of reforms at the under-pressure lobbying group.

It comes after the CBI fired its director general and other members of staff over alleged wrongdoing.

More than a dozen women who worked for the CBI have alleged to The Guardian newspaper they were sexually harassed by colleagues. Two say they were raped.

It has sparked a major crisis for the CBI, which has suspended most of its operations and promised to come back to members with a plan for the future in June.

The board also tasked lawyers at Fox Williams to investigate its internal culture, flag any issues and make recommendations for how it can improve.

Ms Wallace faces the task of implementing the lawyers' 35 recommendations, one of which was the creation of her position.

Coffey wants 'sustainable food production' in UK

Speaking outside Downing Street following the food summit with industry bosses, Environment Secretary Therese Coffey said: 

Bringing together the food sector today, whether it's retailers, people from hospitality, people who grow food, the processing, it's all been an important part of a discussion on what it is that we can do to make sure that we get on with farmers producing the best British food possible.

We discussed about regulation too, all of these elements as part of a constructive discussion.

We made a significant number of announcements today about a variety of investments about what we can do to help with exports around the world.

All those sorts of things help improve the profitability for farmers in order to make sure that we continue to have that sustainable food production here.

We will keep working together through the Food and Drink Sector Council. In order to keep some of the reflections from today on how we can make general improvements.

UK becoming a 'nation dependent on junk food'

Vicki Hird, head of sustainable farming at food charity Sustain, which was not invited to the food summit being held in Downing Street, said it was ""exasperating to hear the Government say it intends to support the horticulture sector"". She said:

They have been saying this for years without any serious action. 

We import much of our fruit and vegetables from climate stressed countries and earlier this year saw those supplies interrupted and shelves empty.

Outsourcing food supply policy to the private sector has resulted in us becoming a nation dependent on junk food. 

Food security is about ensuring we all have access to healthy and sustainable food. Government needs to get a grip and produce a decent strategy that coves our food system from farm to fork.

US retail sales lower than expected

US retail sales increased less than expected in April, but the underlying trend was solid, suggesting that consumer spending likely remained strong early in the second quarter, despite growing risks of a recession this year.

Retail sales rose 0.4pc last month, the Commerce Department said. Data for March was revised slightly lower to show sales dropping 0.7pc instead of 0.6pc as previously reported. Economists had forecast sales rebounding 0.8pc.

The rise in retail sales added to strong job growth in April in suggesting that the economy was experiencing a spring revival after activity slowed in February and March. Spending is being underpinned by strong wage gains thanks to a tight labour market.

Some households still have savings accumulated during the pandemic. 

Economists are forecasting a recession as the cumulative and delayed effects of the Federal Reserve's fastest interest rate hiking campaign since the 1980s to tame inflation start to have a broader impact on the economy.

UK not 'hostile' to tech despite blocking Microsoft deal, insists competition chief

The head of the UK's competition watchdog has insisted regulators have not created a ""hostile environment"" for tech businesses after blocking Microsoft's $69bn (£55bn) merger with Activision Blizzard.

Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) chief executive Sarah Cardell told the business and trade committee that she stood by the decision to halt the deal, despite the EU giving its approval for the proposal on Monday.

Microsoft president Brad Smith has accused the UK regulator of undermining confidence in Britain as a destination for tech businesses.

Ms Cardell said: ""This is a sector where we want to make sure together that we can create and support the best conditions for competition that will enable companies big and small to thrive, including many UK start-ups, many UK competitors.

She said that the CMA had engaged widely with companies across the sector, adding: ""I don't find that we are operating sort of, broadly speaking, in a hostile environment."" 

Microsoft has said it will appeal the CMA's ruling.

US markets poised to open lower

Wall Street is expected to open after data showed China's economy is weaker than expected.

Meanwhile Home Depot cut its profit and sales outlook for the year, signaling a spending shift by Americans strapped by inflation and anxious about a possible recession.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3pc and the S&P 500 ticked down 0.2pc before the bell. The Nasdaq 100 look poised to begin the day 0.1pc lower.

Home Depot shares skidded 3.6pc in premarket trading after the home improvement giant's first-quarter revenue fell short of analyst expectations. 

Shortly, the US government will report April sales data from the retail sector, and later this week Target and Walmart will report their quarterly results.

Clarkson's Farm stars visit Downing Street for food summit

Clarkson's Farm stars Kaleb Cooper and Charlie Ireland on Tuesday attended a Downing Street food summit aimed at tackling soaring supermarket prices and shoring up Britain's supply chain.

Retail editor Hannah Boland has the latest:

Mr Cooper and Mr Ireland, who feature in Jeremy Clarkson's Amazon Prime series following his experience farming, were pictured arriving at the summit on Tuesday.

Speaking ahead of the meetings, Mr Cooper told ITV News that supermarkets were ""probably"" charging too much for food. 

Supermarket chiefs, farming unions and food leaders were called to the summit to address growing concerns over prices.

The Bank of England warned last week that the weekly shop would keep rising for ""longer than we previously thought"" and the Liberal Democrats have accused supermarkets of profiteering in the face of falling wholesale prices.

Worst food price rises revealed as PM urged to intervene

Some meat, yoghurt and vegetables have doubled in price over the last year, new data show, as Rishi Sunak holds a food summit with the bosses of the UK's biggest supermarkets today.

Consumer group Which? has urged the Prime Minister to intervene on behalf of struggling consumers after its analysis of supermarket prices showed inflation remains at ""shockingly high levels"".

It found inflation on essential food groups like meat, fish and vegetables have continued to rise after it examined April prices on more than 26,000 food and drink products at Aldi, Asda, Lidl, Morrisons, Ocado, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Waitrose.

For example, Aberdoyle Dairies Natural Cottage Cheese 300g at Lidl had gone from an average of 67p in 2022 to £1.34 this year, a difference of 100.9pc.

At Asda, Morliny Frankfurters (350g) rose from an average of £1.25 to £2.42 - a rise of 93.8pc - on a year ago.

Which? head of food policy Sue Davies said: ""It's very alarming to see products such as meat, cheese and vegetables that people rely on still rapidly soaring in price.

""As the Prime Minister gathers supermarket bosses today to discuss the problem of inflation, we urge him to ask supermarkets to commit to do much more.

""Supermarkets must also provide transparent pricing so people can easily work out which products offer the best value.""

It comes as the Competition and Markets Authority announced on Monday it is to investigate whether ""any failure in competition"" is leaving consumers paying higher grocery and fuel prices than they should be.

CMA 'not doing the bidding of other agencies'

The chief executive of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has told MP that it is ""not doing the bidding of other agencies"" after blocking Microsoft's $69bn (£55bn) takeover of Activision Blizzard.

Sarah Cardell addressed the business and trade committee after questions about how the CMA has communicated about the deal with US regulators, which also opposed the plan. She said:

First point I would like to clarify is that the CMA will take its decisions based on our assessment on a merger.

We are absolutely not, and I would clarify this because I think there's been some speculation on this, for example, in the press, we are absolutely not doing the bidding of other agencies.

We undertake our own analysis and, as I mentioned before, we have our independent panel groups who are responsible for those decisions and take those responsibilities incredibly seriously.

Supermarket appears to have increased margin targets on fuel, says CMA chief

The chief executive of the Competition and Markets Authority has told MPs that the additional margins that supermarkets are charging for petrol and diesel is not entirely due to factors outside their control, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Sarah Cardell told the business and trade committee:

Supermarkets have historically been the cheapest suppliers by and large at the retail level.

And I should say that it remains the case that many of the factors driving up petrol and diesel prices are external factors, including obviously the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

But nonetheless, what our evidence is showing us is that the rise in margins doesn't appear to be entirely due to factors outside of retailers' control.

What we appear to see is evidence that at least one of the supermarkets has increased its own internal targets for margins, we're not seeing a strong competitive response from the other supermarkets there.

Vodafone shares hit lowest level since 1997 amid plans to cut 11,000 jobs

Vodafone shares have hit their lowest level since 1997 as shareholders were left unconvinced by the turnaround plan for the British mobile phone giant.

The company has slumped 7.5pc to make it the worst performer on the FTSE 100, despite announcing plans to shed 11,000 jobs over three years.

New boss Margherita Della Valle slammed recent performance, adding the business must ""simplify our organisation, cutting out complexity to regain our competitiveness"".

Vodafone's announcement follows the axing this year of tens of thousands of jobs across the global tech sector, including by Facebook parent Meta, as soaring inflation weakened the economy. 

Wrong to boost UK confidence by 'turning a blind eye' to mega mergers, says CMA chairman

The chairman of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has said that it is not worth ""turning a blind eye"" to anti-competitive mergers in order to boost confidence in the UK as a place to do business.

Marcus Bokkerink told MPs on the business and trade committee: 

We are vigilant, as it is our duty to be vigilant, about investments that consolidate and entrench market power.

I think I would challenge the premise that if there is an impact on international confidence in doing business in the UK, that the best way that that confidence is served is by turning a blind eye to anti-competitive mergers.

It came after CMA chief executive Sarah Cardell said that having strong competition in the UK was good for the country's reputation. She said:

Individual cases need to be decided on their merits.

When we're looking strategically at the role of the competition authority, absolutely, we will consider the impact of the decisions that we have and the impact that has for the UK economy, including the reputation externally. 

I believe that strong competition is a very positive signal for the UK's reputation externally.

Elon Musk denies taking advice from ""˜cretin' Jeffrey Epstein

German recession fears resurface

Investor confidence in Germany's economy weakened for a third month as its vital manufacturing sector reels from a slump in demand.

The ZEW institute's gauge of expectations dropped to -10.7 in May from 4.1 in April. 

ZEW President Achim Wambach said: 

The financial market experts anticipate a worsening of the already unfavourable economic situation in the next six months.

As a result, the German economy could slip into a recession, albeit a mild one.

The reading comes after an unexpectedly strong fall in industrial production and other weak data raised concern that Europe's largest economy may in fact have endured a winter downturn. 

A drop in new manufacturing orders also casts doubt on how strongly it can rebound in the coming months, despite consumer demand for services remaining strong. 

The European Commission on Monday forecast growth of just 0.2pc for this year, followed by 1.4pc in 2024. 

More evidence of problems at the heart of the EU...

I'm a little wary of the #ZEW survey (a poll of 'financial market experts', rather than 'real' businesses or consumers), but the May results are downbeat on the eurozone and #Germany in particular... ðŸ‘‡https://t.co/2UJZSjl5Wc

Gas prices near two-year low

European natural gas prices neared a two-year low amid weak demand.

Benchmark Dutch futures fell as much as 2.5pc today to the lowest level since the summer of 2021. 

At around â‚¬32 per megawatt-hour, gas is trading at less than a tenth of the record prices seen last year, helped by high fuel stockpiles and liquified natural gas (LNG) flows. 

As a result of tepid demand in both Europe and Asia, global volumes that have been left at sea for over 20 days hit 3.5 million tons on Sunday, well above normal levels for this time of year. 

Yet while shipments into Northern Europe have started slowing, they picked up momentum last week in China and Japan.  

Analysts at AlfaEnergy wrote:

With ample storage and strong LNG inflows we have seen significant price deductions over the last week. 

However, it is important to note that with weak demand, many ships still await to unload their cargo, and could turn elsewhere if offers become attractive.

Oil prices rise as China poised to boost demand

Oil prices have risen as the International Energy Agency predicted global demand will climb more strongly than previously estimated this year amid a stronger than expected post-pandemic rebound in China.

Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose as much as 1pc to head in the direction of $76 a barrel, while US-produced West Texas Intermediate neared $72.

Brent was last up 0.3pc while WTI has climbed 0.2pc.

The IEA said world fuel consumption will increase by 2.2m barrels a day in 2023 ""” about 200,000 a day more than forecast before ""” to a record 102m as China's demand hits an all-time high after scrapping zero-Covid restrictions.

The Paris-based organisation said: ""Chinese demand for oil broke new ground in March, vaulting to the highest mark ever recorded."" 

While Beijing's latest economic indicators have faltered, the IEA said ""the vast majority of the projected demand recovery is already in train"".

Putin gets £1.4bn boost as Russia's oil exports hit post-invasion high

Russia's oil exports rose to the highest level since its invasion of Ukraine last month as Vladimir Putin raced to boost revenues for his war effort.

Russian exports increased by 50,000 barrels per day to 8.3m last month, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), despite the Kremlin previously announcing it would cut production by 500,000 barrels per day.

Revenues increased by $1.7bn (£1.4bn) in April to $15bn (£12bn) despite Western sanctions, the IEA said.

However, Russia's oil revenues were still 27pc lower than the same month last year, shortly after Putin's invasion.

In its monthly oil market report, the IEA said: ""Indeed, Russia may be boosting volumes to make up for lost revenue.""

Russia's tax receipts from its oil and gas sector were down by 64pc year-on-year, the IEA added.

The G7 and Australia have set price caps on Russian petroleum products and crude in coordination with the EU in an effort to cut a key source of funding for the war on Ukraine.

The IEA said China and India accounted for nearly 80pc of Russian crude export destinations.

Moscow's output held ""broadly steady"" in April at 9.6m barrels per day.

It added the country must cut a further 300,000 barrels per day in May to bring itself into line with its planned production cut of 500,000 barrels per day.

The report said: ""Russia seems to have few problems finding willing buyers for its crude and oil products, frequently at the expense of fellow Opec+ members in the two-tier market that has emerged since the embargoes came into force.""

China's emergence from nearly three years of Covid restrictions is also expected to lift world oil demand this year as the IEA raised its forecast by 2.2m barrels per day to an average of 102m. This is 200,000 above the previous forecast.

It added China's demand recovery ""continues to surpass expectations, with the country setting an all-time record in March"" at 16m barrels per day.

FTSE 100 boosted by weaker pound

The FTSE 100 edged up as weakness in the sterling supported some internationally-focused consumer firms, although Vodafone slumped after it forecast a big drop in fresh cash flow.

The telecom giant's stock fell 4pc to become the top decliner on the UK's blue chip index after the company announced 11,000 job cuts and forecast a â‚¬1.5bn (£1.3bn) decline in free cash flow this year.

However, the FTSE 100 has risen 0.3pc and the mid-cap FTSE 250 has added 0.2pc.

The pound slipped after data showed UK unemployment unexpectedly rose in the first quarter, fuelling hopes of a pause in the Bank of England's rate hike cycle.

The currency's weakness lifted shares of dollar earners like Unilever and British American Tobacco.

Industrial metals miners slipped 0.2pc, tracking easing copper prices on investor worries of patchy economic recovery in top consumer China.

Boohoo Group has jumped 11.8pc after the retailer said it expects an improved performance in its new financial year.

Being in work 'best way for people to get on in life,' says minister

Employment minister Guy Opperman insisted ""being in work remains the best way for people to get on in life"" as the number of people on payrolls fell for the first time in two years - while the economy lost another half a million working days to strikes in March.

Mr Opperman added that he remains focused on ""matching jobseekers with roles"" as the number of vacancies fell in the UK economy fell for the 10th fall in a row, according to the Office for National Statistics. He said:

We're continuing to see progress in the labour market as we take action across government to grow the economy. 

Employment is up; economic inactivity is down; and vacancies have fallen in successive quarters.

As well as helping deliver on our priority to grow the economy, we know that being in work remains the best way for people to get on in life. 

That's why I'm focused on matching jobseekers with roles, and businesses with a resilient and skilled workforce. 

Through partnerships with local employers, we have thousands of placements in sectors such as banking and engineering, helping people to achieve new qualifications and build rewarding careers.

Pound falls as jobs market loosens

The pound fell after data showed a rise in the UK unemployment rate, which could take some of the pressure off the Bank of England to raise interest rates.

Britain's unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 3.9pc in the three months to March as more people sought to get back into the jobs market, driving the first fall in total payrolled employees in more than two years in April.

Sterling fell by as much as 0.5pc against the dollar to $1.24, and by as much as 0.4pc against the euro.

The pound was last down 0.1pc against the dollar and back above $1.25 and down 0.3pc against the euro at 87p.

ING strategist Francesco Pesole said: ""With the BoE having put a lot of weight on this release, as well as the next CPI print, the chances of a pause at the June meeting have slightly increased.""

Tesco unveils fresh round of price cuts

Tesco has announced another round of price cuts on its own-brand pasta and cooking oil as it sees deflation making its way through to cupboard essentials.

The UK's biggest supermarket is dropping the price of 30 products, with 15p off 500g and 1kg packs of own-brand pasta, 14p off its one litre vegetable oil and 15p off its one litre sunflower oil.

It follows a number of supermarkets dropping the price of some lines of bread and butter last week in response to falling commodity prices.

Sainsbury's and Tesco also recently cut the price of milk by at least 5p, followed by Aldi, Lidl and Asda.

The cuts come as grocery inflation leapt by more than 19pc in March compared with a year ago, as energy and supply chain costs were passed on to shoppers.

Tesco announced its latest price cuts as Downing Street hosted a ""Farm to Fork Summit"", bringing together farmers' representatives and food and retail trade bodies along with supermarket chiefs to talk about the Government's goal of boosting co-operation across the supply chain and the sector's resilience - and tackling rampant food inflation.

Land Securities warns of stubborn interest rates after slashing UK real estate by £850m

The chief executive of one of Britain's biggest property companies has warned of ""higher for longer"" interest rates after being forced to slash the value of its buildings by almost £850m.

Business reporter Riya Makwana has the details:

Mark Allan, boss of Landsec, said interest rates were driving a slump in the value of commercial properties and warned the downturn was likely to continue for the foreseeable future.

Mr Allan said: ""We expect the combination of a higher for longer interest rate environment.

""Last year saw the most striking difference in performance between occupational markets and investment markets that I can remember. In investment markets, rapidly rising interest rates led to a sharp slowdown in transaction activity and falling asset values as valuation yields rose.""

The landlord has marked down the value of its portfolio by £848m to £10.2bn in the year to March, resulting in a £622m loss. Landsec owns properties including the BBC's MediaCity in Salford and the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent, among others. 

Despite the downturn in property values, Landsec reported a 6pc increase in rental income as people returned to offices and shops.

Rising interest rates and the slowing global economy hit the value of commercial property in Britain. Values fell dramatically in the second half of last year, dropping 18pc on average and by 26pc for industrial buildings.

Moreover, companies with large office space portfolios such as Landsec also struggled because of the rise of home and hybrid working post-pandemic. Office assets, of which central London space account for 58pc, brought down the value of its portfolio.

Mr Allan said five-day work weeks in the office remained a rarity, with most office clients filling Landsec's buildings Tuesday to Thursday. However, he said landlords were not cutting back on office space because desks were generally filled in the middle of the week.

Landsec said it would focus its future investments on retail space rather than offices. 

The company has sold off London office space worth £2.2bn out of the £2.5bn target set as part of its strategic initiative laid out in late 2020.

Mr Allan added: ""Our strategy is based on two clear and simple principles: focus our resources where we have sustainable competitive advantage and maintain a strong balance sheet.""

Price increases to boost Imperial Brands profits

Winston and Gauloises cigarettes maker Imperial Brands expects profits to rise after it increased prices.

The tobacco company said it is on track to deliver faster earnings growth in the second half of year, even after a fall in volumes as consumers returned to pre-Covid buying patterns and its exit from Russia.

Chief executive Stefan Bomhard said: ""We expect the pricing picture to improve in the second half because of the rollover effect of the price increases from the first half.""

Mr Bomhard is now in the third year of a five-year turnaround plan, and he has set a goal for an acceleration in earnings growth. 

Imperial has been lagging its larger rivals in the race for smoking alternatives. 

The loss from next-generation products rose 33pc, as expected, although such products represent about 3pc of Imperial's overall revenue excluding its distribution unit Logista. 

Boohoo surges as cost cuts boost profit outlook

Shares in Boohoo jumped by 14pc after markets opened as the online fashion retailer said profits should start to improve this year.

The British fast-fashion chain expects adjusted earnings margins of 4pc to 4.5pc, which would beat the 3.6pc achieved last year amid cost cuts and a focus on more sustainable growth. 

The upbeat guidance comes even though it is forecasting revenue to come in flat or decline as much as 5pc this fiscal year. 

The fall in sales will be particularly marked in its first half. 

Boohoo, owner of brands from PrettyLittleThing to Karen Millen, has been hit hard by inflation-squeezed consumers cutting back on buying clothes online and returning to stores that were shut during Covid lockdowns.

It has also had to deal with rising freight and energy costs. 

FTSE 100 falls as China growth weaker than hoped

The FTSE 100 has fallen at the open as the latest data showed China's economy is weaker than expected, with domestic demand failing to bounce back as much as hoped for after the pandemic.

The internationally-focused blue-chip index has fallen 0.1pc to 7,768.47 while the midcap FTSE 250 was flat at 19,253.26.

Vodafone job losses to hit UK headquarters

Vodafone's new boss has revealed plans to slash 11,000 jobs across the group over the next three years as she said the firm ""must change"" to address its poor performance.

Margherita Della Valle, recently appointed Vodafone's group chief executive, said the cull comes as part of a plan to simplify the business.

It will impact the group's UK headquarters in Newbury, Berkshire, as well as markets worldwide.

Ms Della Valle said: 

Our performance has not been good enough. To consistently deliver, Vodafone must change.

We will simplify our organisation, cutting out complexity to regain our competitiveness.

It comes as Vodafone reported a 1.3pc drop in full-year earnings to a lower-than-expected â‚¬14.7bn (£12.8bn) and forecast little or no growth in earnings over the current financial year.

The group's former boss Nick Read, who was ousted abruptly in December due to concerns over the group's performance, unveiled plans late last year to drive around â‚¬1bn (£883m) of cost savings.

The firm said at the time it could lead to job losses but did not put a figure on the number of roles being cut.

'Family finances are being squeezed to breaking point,' says Labour

Labour said the Office for National Statistics figures showing the rate of UK unemployment at 3.9pc is evidence the Conservative Government is ""a drag"" on the economy.

Shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: 

Today we see yet more evidence that this Tory Government is a drag on Britain's economy.

Family finances are being squeezed to breaking point by a further fall in real wages, fewer people are in employment than before the pandemic and the number of people out of work due to long-term sickness has reached a record high.

Labour's ambitious reform plan will open up Jobcentres, support over 50s back into work and provide specialist job support for those with ill health.

With our mission to secure the highest sustained growth in the G7, we will get our economy moving and create good jobs across every part of the country.

Difficulty finding staff is a worry for businesses, says Hunt

After the latest employment data was released by the Office for National Statistics, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said:

It's encouraging that the unemployment rate remains historically low but difficulty in finding staff and rising prices are a worry for many families and businesses. 

That's why we must stick to our plan to halve inflation and help families with the cost of living, while delivering our childcare reforms and supporting older people and disabled people who want to work.

CMA boss defends decision to block Microsoft and Activision merger

The chief executive of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has defended the regulator's decision to block the merger of Microsoft and Activision Blizzard after EU officials announced their approval of the deal.

Sarah Cardell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme:

Both the European Commission and the CMA, and indeed the US FTC, have concerns that this deal will be a problem for competition.

We have all concluded that the deal will lead to restriction of competition, in the case of the CMA and the European Commission identifying the problem in the cloud gaming market.

Our independent group looked very, very carefully at [the remedy proposed] from Microsoft [to alleviate competition concerns] and we concluded that it was not an effective substitute for the competitive functioning of this market.

It would not resolve the problems that we identified from the merger and the reason for that is this deal that's been offered by Microsoft, essentially allows Microsoft to set the terms of trade for this market for the next 10 years. 

It allows Microsoft to dictate who are the games supplied to, which cloud gaming platforms receive the games and on what terms.

That introduces a regulatory solution and it prevents free and open competition from driving the evolution of this really important market.

Long-term sick surge to record high

The number of people who are out of work because they are long-term sick has surged by 235,000 year-on-year to hit a new record high.

Economics reporter Melissa Lawford has been analysing the latest data from the Office for National Statistics:

Between January and March this year, there were 2.55 million people out of work because they were ill.

The figures came as public sector pay soared at the fastest pace on record since 2003 following waves of strikes.

Across March, 556,000 working days were lost to industrial action, up from 332,000 in February.

Salaries in the public sector between January and March were up by 5.6pc compared to a year earlier. This was the biggest jump in nearly 20 years. In the private sector, average regular pay rose by 7pc.

However, neither increase was enough to offset the blow of double digit inflation. In real terms, average total pay fell by 3pc, while regular pay fell by 2pc.

From October to December and January to March 2023, there was a record high net flow out of economic inactivity.

This was driven largely by an increase in students, but the number of people quitting the workforce because they took early retirement is also starting to decline, dropping by 93,000 year-on-year to a total of 1.08 million.

Job vacancies fall for 10th straight month

Britain's unemployment rate has risen again unexpectedly while vacancies have fallen to the lowest level for 18 months as economic uncertainty weighs on the UK's jobs market, according to official figures.

The rate of UK unemployment rose to 3.9pc in the three months to March, up from 3.8pc in the previous quarter and the highest level since the three months to January 2022, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.

Most economists had expected the rate to remain unchanged at 3.8pc.

The number of vacancies fell by 55,000 quarter on quarter to 1.08m in the three months to April, marking the 10th fall in a row.

The ONS said this reflects ""uncertainty across industries, as survey respondents continue to cite economic pressures as a factor in holding back on recruitment"".

But the figures also showed a rise in the employment rate to 75.9pc and a fall in inactivity as more men in particular starting looking for work.

In another sign of a flagging jobs market, the more timely PAYE figures showed the first fall in workers on payrolls since February 2021, down 136,000 to 29.8m.

There were 1.083 million job vacancies on average across February to April 2023.

This was down 55,000 on the previous quarter, as employers continue to cite economic pressures.

Vodafone to cut 11,000 jobs

Vodafone plans to cut 11,000 jobs over the next three years as new chief executive Margherita Della Valle seeks a ""simpler"" organisation.

Ms Della Valle said: ""Our performance has not been good enough. To consistently deliver, Vodafone must change.""

The British mobile phone giant abruptly ousted chief executive Nick Read in December and last month confirmed Ms Della Valle as his permanent replacement after a lengthy search process.

The company is struggling with a huge debt pile and troubles in its German business.

Greggs sales boosted by cost-of-living crisis

Bakery chain Greggs has revealed its sales surged by nearly a fifth over the year to date as its cheap meals remain ""compelling"" to cash-strapped consumers.

Sales grew by 17pc since the start of the year compared to 2022, partly because the first few months of the previous year were impacted by the Omicron variant, Greggs said.

Hot food like chicken goujons and wedges are proving popular, as well as strong demand for pizza as the retailer moves further into the evening market.

Greggs has steamed ahead with growing its store estate, opening 63 new shops over the period and closing 25 franchises, leaving it with more than 2,360 shops by mid-May.

The macroeconomic backdrop remains ""challenging"" with ongoing cost inflation and household incomes under pressure, but the chain said it is confident its ""outstanding value proposition continues to be compelling"".

Average earnings 'still being outstripped by rising prices', says ONS

Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the Office for National Statistics, said: 

Employment and unemployment both rose again in the first three months of 2023, driven in particular by men.

This means the number of those neither working nor looking for work continues to fall, although the number of people not working due to long-term sickness rose again, to a new record.

However, the number of people on employers' payrolls fell in April for the first time in over two years, though this is an early estimate that could be revised later.

Despite continued growth in pay, people's average earnings are still being outstripped by rising prices.

The number of days lost to strikes rose again in March, with education and health making up four-fifths of the total this month.

Public sector pay grows at fastest rate in 20 years

Public sector pay grew at its fastest pace in 20 years giving a fresh headache for the Bank of England in its battle against inflation.

Average earnings in the public sector grew by 5.6pc in the first three months of the year, its highest level since August to October 2003 as more and more staff demanded pay rises to keep up with inflation, which stands at 10.1pc.

It comes as there were 556,000 working days lost to strikes in March, up from 332,000 in February, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Private sector pay grew by 7pc over the period with overall regular pay excluding bonuses growing by 6.7pc.

However, after taking inflation into account, average pay including bonuses fell by 3pc in the year to January to March, or 2pc excluding bonuses.

Meanwhile, the number of people who are out of work because they are long-term sick has surged by 235,000 year-on-year to hit a new record high.

Between January and March this year, there were 2.55 million people out of work because they were ill.

Policymakers at the Bank of England fear wages rising will fuel inflation as pay keeps up with surging prices.

Huw Pill, the Bank of England's chief economist, told British families last month to ""accept that they're worse off"" following a surge in inflation, although he has since said he should have used ""less inflammatory"" language.

The rate of UK unemployment rose to 3.9pc in the three months to March from 3.8pc in the previous three months.

The UK employment rate was estimated at 75.9pc in the first three months of the year, which was 0.2 percentage points higher than October to December.

However, the more timely estimate of payrolled employees for April shows a monthly decrease, down 136,000 on the revised March figures, to 29.8m, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Headline indicators for the UK labour market for January to March 2023 show:

â–ªï¸ employment was 75.9%
â–ªï¸ unemployment was 3.9%
â–ªï¸ economic inactivity was 21.0%

Good morning

Workers in the public sector secured pay rises of 5.6pc in the first three months of the year - taking their pay growth to its highest level since 2003.

It comes as 556,000 working days lost to strikes in March, up from 332,000 in February, according to the Office for National Statistics.

The rate of UK unemployment rose to 3.9pc in the three months to March from 3.8pc in the previous three months.

What happened overnight 

Asian shares were mostly higher even though the latest data showed China's economy is weaker than expected, with domestic demand failing to bounce back as much as hoped for after the pandemic.

Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index surged 0.9pc to 29,899.83 continuing a climb toward its highest level since the early 1990s helped by strong corporate earnings and signs that inflationary pressures might be easing.

Benchmarks also advanced in Hong Kong and Seoul but fell in Shanghai and Sydney.

China's industrial output rose 5.6pc year-on-year in April while investment crept up 4.7pc from the year before in January-April. 

But those increases also reflected a big gap from the slow activity at the height of China's zero-Covid restrictions, which Beijing abandoned late in 2022.

The Hang Seng in Hong Kong gained 0.4pc to 20,044.72, while the Shanghai Composite index was nearly unchanged, at 3,311.06.

In Seoul, the Kospi rose 0.3pc to 2,485.58, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.2pc to 7,251.20.

Wall Street stocks ended with modest gains on Monday after manufacturing data raised concerns about a slowing US economy that could help bring down inflation amid ongoing debt ceiling negotiations.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.1pc at 33,348.60, while the broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.4pc to 4,136.28.

The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 0.7pc to 12,365.21 following a rise in Meta shares.

Benchmark 10-year Treasuries fell in price to yield of 3.496pc, from 3.463pc late on Friday.

How the Royal Countryside Fund is changing the lives of farmers

With so many farms failing, the project offers families support that has never been more needed

""On a family farm, you always hope that your hard work is building a legacy for the next generation to continue,"" reflects Emma Billings, sitting at a crowded kitchen table at Grange Farm at Manby between the Lincolnshire Wolds and the North Sea. ""But you have to do more than hope it will happen, especially now with so many family farms around us going to the wall at the moment.""

She has, she says, ""seen too many other family farms being sold because the farmer hangs on to grim death and doesn't give the younger generation a chance"". The Billings family has been working these 150 acres for nearly a century. She grew up in the farmhouse with her two sisters and remembers all too well the uncertainty that hung over the whole family because her father, who died in 2013, never said what would happen to the farm when he couldn't go on any longer.

""He wasn't the sort of man who knew how to talk about things like that,"" she says. ""I'd always loved the farm, so I think he just assumed I would take over, but we needed him to say it so we could start planning, but he didn't.""

Her sisters, it turned out, didn't want to be farmers. There were, though, she recalls, ""bumpy"" times at first because she knew so little about managing a farm. A decade on, with her husband, Mark, she has carried on with the farm's herd of 35 breeding Limousin wheat-coloured cows but had started to grow more arable crops. Now aged 49 and 51, the couple are already worrying that history might repeat itself. Though they are determined they won't be the last in line of Billings on Grange Farm. Research published in 2022 reported that 68 per cent of young people growing up on farms fear a career in farming will not provide them with job satisfaction and 70 per cent don't believe they have the skills required to succeed. With the average farmer now aged 59, such views among the next generation of farmers pose a particular threat to the future of family farms.

Their son, Billy, 21, who towers over his parents at just short of 7ft tall, was studying at agricultural college, but decided he would rather learn on the job. ""I've been helping out since I could pull on my first pair of wellies,"" he says. He has an older sister, 24-year-old Amy, but she has chosen a career working for a chain of gardening centres. ""Our dream has always been that Billy joins us,"" explains Emma, who has to work part-time at a vets to supplement the farm's income (as well as presenting a weekly show on BBC Radio Lincolnshire).

That is why, when she first heard about a series of workshops on succession planning being offered free by the Prince's Countryside Fund, she signed up. ""They have,"" she says simply, ""made it possible for us to continue.""

Established in 2010 to sustain farms and rural communities, the fund was relaunched as the Royal Countryside Fund (RCF) now that King Charles is on the throne.

Since 2019, of the 7,000 farming businesses that have failed almost all of them have been family-run, according to the National Farmers Union (NFU), so the rebranded RCF will be redoubling its efforts to keep those that remain solvent and thriving.

What Emma learnt at the succession planning workshops she then brought back to the kitchen table. ""It helped us all open up on a subject that had always been awkward to talk about before that. We had never wanted to put pressure on Billy when he was so young.""

When Billy heard about the workshops, he wanted to go along, too. ""The experience has made him a lot braver in asking us questions that I wouldn't have dared to do with my parents,"" his mother says.

They are now able to make plans, share the management between the generations and plan for the day when Billy takes over. ""I want to see Billy able to earn enough from the farm that he doesn't have to take on other jobs to keep afloat.""

Since it was set up after the then Prince of Wales was alerted to the plight of small farmers during a stay on a hill farm in the Lake District, the foundation has invested £11.2""‰million in community-led projects, including better transport links.

Since 2016, it has had 2,500 families take part in its Farming Resilience Programme. During the winter of 2021-2022, the project worked with 882 farms of under 250 acres - 85 per cent of them had two workers or fewer, including family members. ""What makes the RCF such a success,"" suggests Keith Halstead, RCF director, ""is the sense of connection it engenders."" The King, he stresses, is not just the patron of the RCF; he created it. ""He really knows his stuff and I always notice when he meets the beneficiaries, there is nothing he enjoys more than having a long chat with them about what is happening on their farm.""

To mark its new status, the RCF is releasing a series of six short films, presented and executive-produced by 30-year-old Lady Violet Manners, a model, socialite (often in the company of her two sisters, Alice and Eliza, together known as the ""Bad Manners Girls"") and daughter of the Duke of Rutland. In them, she meets six farmers who have benefited from the foundation's support.

Making the films, she says, was her celebration of the King's commitment to the countryside and ""summarises what I cherish so much about this country and the rural community within it"". While the King has not been to Grange Farm, Emma has met him on several occasions, most recently in 2021 when she was invited to Buckingham Palace to attend a reception to launch the RCF's in-house magazine, The Journal, where she met representatives of the businesses such as HSBC and McDonald's which contribute to the Fund's £3""‰million annual budget.

It is safe to say she is a fan. When, in November 2020, one of her Limousins calved on the then Prince Charles's birthday, she called the calf Manby Grange Royal Highness. ""You can feel very alone as a farmer, especially on farms like ours where it is just family who work it, "" reflects Emma. ""But the King and the RCF have improved our confidence in the future. They have made it possible for us to continue.""

The challenges for small farmers have been piling up in recent years, confirms Minette Batters, president of the NFU.

""Since the Brexit referendum, farmers have been going through the biggest upheaval since we joined the European Economic Community in 1973,"" she says.

If you then add in rising costs for producing food that are not matched by prices paid by retailers, the changing climate, and the impact the war in Ukraine has had on food supplies, then the support the RCF can offer has never been more needed, argues Halstead.

Tackling the isolation experienced by many farmers is, he feels, an important contribution to the RCF's focus on the ""big issue"" of mental health. In 2021, there were 44 recorded suicides among farmers in England and Wales - up from 34 the previous year, with the Farming Safety Foundation revealing last year that 92 per cent of UK farmers under 40 ranked poor mental health as the biggest hidden problem in their profession, and 36 per cent saying that they ""possibly"" or ""probably"" were suffering from depression.

The most requested topic for RCF workshops is for up-to-date guidance on carbon and how to meet the challenge of being greener but Halsted is keen to dispel any impression that such sessions are in any way preaching to farmers.

""We do not advocate any specific form of action, or tell farmers they have to go organic. That would be to alienate the very people we are trying to support.""

And that search for the right options for individual farms has helped Richard Vines, 80, an ex-army officer, who, with his wife Lizzie in 1991, escaped the corporate world to farm high quality, sustainable beef near the Chagford in Devon. His big concern was succession, but the dilemma he faced was a different one from the Billings family.

Vines is proud of the business they have built on his 40 acres of Dartmoor. His Welsh black and native Devon cattle drink pure water, roam freely, graze on uncultivated pasture and common land, with their meat hung for a month before being sold under the brand name Wild Beef at London's Borough Market.

Bus as the childless couple grew older their thoughts inevitably turned to succession.

""I didn't want to sell up and walk away from our farm and all we had created, but I was beginning to think there was no alternative,"" he says.

Happy #BackBritishFarmingDay! We're sharing some of the highlights from our recent series of farmer stories to show what life is like for many farming families across rural Britain.

Until that is, the RCF, and its workshops came their way. ""I had first come across Prince Charles in the context of his Hill Farm Project supporting small family farms,"" Vines recalls. ""And when the Prince's Resilience Fund started, I was impressed by how it managed to encourage farmers to co-operate with each other to their mutual benefit.""

Dartmoor farmers, he says, are not by nature natural co-operators. ""They prefer to keep their cards close to their chest.""

Through the RCF's programmes, he engaged with his now business partner, 30-year-old Richard Mortimer, who works for his grandfather on the neighbouring cattle farm. ""I've known Richard since he was a lad and he had already been helping me with loading cattle and TB tests.""

Vines was sufficiently reassured that he and Mortimer shared a similar outlook on farming and the benefits of the Wild Beef way of doing things. From small beginnings they have been developing their own bespoke way of working side by side. ""We have effectively merged our two farms. We farm in the same way, what is sometimes called ""˜stick-and-dog farming'. So we respect each other.""

Mortimer's stock now graze on Vines' farm. While the younger partner raises the cattle, Mortimer describes his role as ""underwriting and overseeing"". He is encouraged by what has been achieved, he says - for now and by pointing to a way forward for a viable future.

And that, he suggests, has come about because the RCF brings with it a profound understanding that he finds lacking in policies coming out of government. ""The foundation knows that we are doing something worthwhile, and they know the countryside. They are helping us, in spite of everything else we are coping with, to thrive.""

The futuristic farming technique that could solve our food crisis

A new generation of vertical farms are rising to the challenge of our salad shortage - so could this be the future of food production?

It's a farm, but not as you know it. There is no soil. There are no tractors, silos or rolling fields. Instead, on a former brownfield site near Sandwich, Kent, there is a warehouse, signposted GrowUp. Step inside, and you'll find 12 layers of carefully temperature-controlled crops bathed in bright pink LED light - the equivalent of 1,000 acres of farmland, stacked floor to ceiling.

And Kate Hofman, GrowUp's co-founder, isn't actually a farmer. She's a former management consultant who left a ""comfortable, corporate"" job at IBM in 2013 to invest her time in a burgeoning industry: vertical farming.

The pressure to feed a growing population has never been greater. The invasion of Ukraine and cost of living crisis has put British food security under the spotlight. At this point in the year, about 90 per cent of the salad usually available in supermarkets is imported. And, as anyone who has done a food shop recently will know, there hasn't been much in the way of leaves available at all.

But a new generation of food producers is rising to the challenge. Now, a decade since it was founded, GrowUp has become the first vertical farm in the UK to supply branded salad to supermarkets (you can buy their ""Fresh Leaf Co"" baby leaves in Iceland).

Instead of ploughed fields, the crops are stacked in neat layers and grown inside, in controlled conditions. This reduces drastically the amount of growing space required and removes the confines of a growing season - crops can be harvested all year round. A sophisticated irrigation system delivers a nutrient mix to the plant's roots. Finely tuned LED lights act as the sun.

""In a vertical farm,"" says Hofman, ""we're providing plants with the perfect conditions they need to grow. If it's lettuce, that's a Mediterranean spring day, but every day of the year.

""We're able to control the growing environment,"" she adds. ""You can actually tailor the wavelengths that you provide the plants with."" The pink-ish light, she explains, is the spectrum of light those plants need at the stage they're growing.

""On each of those layers, we can control the conditions: not only the lighting and irrigation but the humidity and the temperature of the air around the crop as well. It means that day in, day out, we're producing the kind of [crops] you might associate with the height of summer. We harvest every day.""

This promising technology has been extolled as the future of farming. It requires significantly less land and water than conventional methods and can reduce the use of pesticides. It removes the variables of a changing climate. As well as in vast warehouses, it works on a hyper-local scale (Selfridges and some branches of Marks & Spencer already have mini vertical farms for herbs in-store).

""The supply chain has never been under more pressure than it is now - from climate change, from rising distribution costs, labour shortages, impacts of Brexit on imports,"" says Hofman. ""We need to be building more resilience into our food system in the UK and choosing the right products to do that with."" For growers like Hofman, that means looking up.

It allows food to be produced in places where conventional farming is not possible, so pockets of disused urban space can be utilised to bolster Britain's food supply. There is also the potential for plant scientists to make crops tastier and more nutritious.

GrowUp has been producing salad leaves and herbs in this way for 10 years. But it faces growing competition. A subterranean vertical farm, Growing Underground, opened in a disused air raid shelter in London in 2015. It supplies Marks & Spencer with ""microgreens"" such as micro-watercress, sunflower shoots and pea shoots for salads. The plants are grown in wool rather than soil and use 70 per cent less water than conventional farming.

The biggest player in this new type of agriculture is the Jones Food Company, which built Europe's largest vertical farm in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, in 2019. It has 5,000 sq m (53,820 sq ft) of growing space and supplies between 15 and 30 per cent of the UK's basil. Depending on the crop, its yields can be ""60 or 70 times more than a conventional farm per square metre"", says James Lloyd-Jones, the company's founder. Only six people work on the Scunthorpe farm, as robots and automated systems do most of the heavy lifting. This circumvents another of the issues crippling traditional farmers: labour shortages.

Sensing an opportunity, Ocado bought a majority stake in Jones Food Company in 2019. The company opened an ""Innovation Centre"" in Bristol last year, where researchers experiment with growing strawberries, leafy greens, other herbs (chives, coriander, parsley and thyme) and cut flowers. Now, Lloyd-Jones is eyeing world dominance with a project three times the size. A new farm, ""JFC2"", is under construction in Lydney, Gloucestershire. It is eight weeks from completion and will be the world's biggest vertical farm: 71 metres long with 15,000 sq m of growing space.

""It's silly that if you go into any supermarket, fruit and salad is being flown in from Morocco, Spain or Peru. It's crazy,"" says Lloyd-Jones. ""We should be using the shocks we're getting now - and Covid and Brexit - to really get our head around why we keep importing and flying food around the world. Let's get to the point where we can try and at least displace imports in the next 10 years. We could really lead the world in this type of technology as a country.""

There's just one problem: man cannot live on cut herbs and ""microgreens"" alone. This is the main argument of vertical farming's critics - that it's not much more than a gimmick to grow garnishes. Could lower-value staples like onions and potatoes be farmed vertically? What about cereal crops like wheat and barley, which take months to grow? ""We've grown [them], but we're about 30 years off making that work commercially,"" says Lloyd-Jones. ""We need a way to make growing them shorter, faster and overall cheaper.""

Some traditional farmers are justifiably sceptical, too. Hofman recently spoke at the Oxford Farming Conference. There were ""some preconceptions about what vertical farming meant and what vertical farmers thought,"" she says. ""We really see what we do as part of the present and the future of farming""‰""¦ The way we talk about food and farming is the way [they] talk about it. Lots of forward-thinking farmers already think about diversification and ways of farming sustainably.""

But it has so far proved impossible to make more substantial fruit and vegetables work on a commercial scale. This is partly due to the energy costs involved: all those pink LEDs and temperature controls require plenty of power. Vertical farmers have been especially vulnerable to energy price increases.

Some have chased rapid expansion and flown too close to the sun. Infarm, a European vertical farming start-up valued at $1 billion (£820""‰million), made 500 staff (over half the workforce) redundant in November last year. The company had just opened a vast vertical farming facility on the outskirts of Bedford.

In an email to employees, its co-founders said: ""In our current setup, we recognise that Infarm cannot withstand the challenging market conditions, particularly with regards to escalating energy prices and tough financial markets""‰""¦ Energy prices have escalated (doubled across Europe), which puts a lot of additional pressure on our business and seriously impacts our cost of production in affected markets.""

The fatal error some people make, says Lloyd-Jones, is to mistake hype for growth: to look at vertical farming in terms of ""tech valuations"" rather than the ""real cost we have to build and grow at"". The potential is huge: ""It's not just food supply""‰""¦ it's nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, it's taking pressure off the land by growing other commodity crops or letting it rest while our systems do all the other things.""

However, the cost of energy will continue to be an issue. There is no way Hofman could have predicted the energy crisis but, luckily, she and GrowUp's co-founder Tom Webster thought ahead. ""We've got quite a unique model - we built this farm right next to existing renewable energy infrastructure, so we buy electricity and heat directly from the power plant. That's one of the major ways we've been able to scale the business and keep our production costs affordable.""

There's no doubt it's a ""challenging industry"", says Hofman. But she's not saying vertical farming is the only way forward. To the critics: ""We're firmly of the view that not all food will be grown in vertical farms. That's not the point of what we're trying to do. Vertical farming is a necessary part of a robust and resilient food system. And that's got to include lots of different kinds of food production.""

Plus, it's a nascent industry. ""I think it's important to remember that vertical farming is still at a fairly early stage - a lot of people are still working out where they fit,"" says Hofman. So, what's next? GrowUp is looking at reintroducing heritage seed varieties that can no longer be grown in fields, as well as other ""fruit plants and salad vegetables"". They also hope to replicate their renewable energy model across more vertical farm sites.

""There's some really exciting things that we're doing from a research perspective that I hope will [mean] that in five to 19 years we can tackle more challenging crops,"" says Hofman. You could say the sky's the limit.

Why Britain's pubs are growing their own veg in order to survive

Two belaguered features of our countryside are more endangered than ever - but their survival might lie in this radical new approach

Phil Winser says that when he owned a hospitality company in New York, Americans loved three things about Britain: ""the Queen, David Beckham and pubs"". Now that he's back on home turf in the Cotswolds, the Oxfordshire native is determined to add farming to that list of great British symbols. 

Winser found himself trapped on a trip back to England at the beginning of the pandemic; by the time lockdown ended, he had lost his American business but found a new UK focus. ""I'd spent so long selling food and wondered what the next chapter was for me,"" Winser says. ""I realised that I wanted to start growing food and become a farmer.""

Winser and his childhood friend-turned-business partner, James Gummer, reopened The Bull in Charlbury, a 16th-century pub with rooms, in July. There's nothing unusual about two well-spoken chaps aged in their 30s opening a pub in these parts, not least a pair who already had The Pelican gastropub in London's Notting Hill to their name. What is striking is their conviction that two endangered British industries - pubs and farming - can survive by helping each other.

""A pub is very different to a restaurant, which is a transactional experience when you come for two hours to have a meal,"" Winser says. ""A pub is a community asset that's used as an extension of the home. It's the British form of hospitality and what we're known for around the world. That was our starting point. If we want to connect our pub to British food, how could we use British ingredients on the menu to support British farmers?""

Data from real-estate analysts Altus Group reveals that 383 pubs closed in the first half of 2023, almost the total number for the whole of the previous year. The outlook is just as bleak for farming. Research from Riverford Organic Farmers, the fruit-and-veg box delivery company, suggests that almost half of British fruit and veg farmers fear they will go out of business within the next 12 months, with supermarket behaviour cited as a leading concern by 75 per cent of those surveyed.

""It's not an easy thing to buy direct from a farm,"" Gummer says. ""It's a lot simpler to place your order through a big supplier and things are delivered exactly when you want them."" However, working with the middlemen of wholesalers and cash-and-carrys, instead of directly with farmers, means higher costs and less control over quality and freshness. ""We are trying to support the farmers who are growing in a certain way,"" Gummer adds. ""They're working in a totally different world to the monocrop farmers who supply the supermarkets.""

Things began with buying whole carcasses of meat direct from Whittington Lodge Farm near Cheltenham for The Pelican, where the mince on toast became the signature dish. ""Whole butchery is perfect for pubs, because you can use all the different cuts in stews, soups and pies,"" Gummer says.

For vegetables, Gummer and Winser took an even more hands-on approach, signing the lease on a one-acre plot at Bruern Farms, 10 miles from Charlbury, in April. What was a weed-covered wasteland has produced 180kg of tomatoes since May, as well as cucumbers so intensely flavoured they became a solo dish on the pub's menu, delivered to the table four hours after being picked. The land is farmed bio-intensively, so when one bed is harvested, a crop of a different vegetable is planted. The farm is overseen by head grower Thomas Jones but the chefs from The Bull and The Pelican have been involved in the planting and the plan is that by next summer everyone who works for the company will have spent a day on the farm.

""We look at the farm as an independent business,"" Winser says. ""Can a diverse, non-monocrop-style farm like this be financially and environmentally sustainable? Michelin-starred restaurants like L'Enclume already have market gardens, but can we make the farm a profitable business, while still charging the prices a pub needs to charge?"" Those prices, admittedly, hover around the £11 mark for a starter and £25 for a main, but the omens are good: with more pubs in the pipeline, the plan is to add an acre of farm every year for the next five years.

Charlbury's street names pay tribute to a time when food was a more essential part of the local economy - Sheep Street, Fisher's Lane, Market Street - but these days most locals do their shopping at the Co-op and there are more Chelsea tractors than the real thing hogging the narrow streets. Winser had his first pint at the Rose & Crown over the road, but says that the drinks-focused pub is a dying breed. ""It does great beer and there's not really anything to eat except pork scratchings. But pubs like this are struggling. There needs to be a food offering to make pubs work now.""

Two months after The Bull reopened, Lady Carole Bamford of Daylesford relaunched The Bell round the corner, leading to talk of Charlbury being the new Chipping Campden. Yet for all the Soho Farmhouse-style incomers, real farming remains a vital feature of the Cotswolds landscape. But could the ale-and-agriculture model proposed by The Bull work in an urban setting?

It's a long way from the Cotswolds to Deptford, in every sense, though even in this gritty corner of south-east London there are Farrow & Ball window frames creeping in among the terraces overlooking Deptford Park. And in one corner of the square is a third-of-an-acre urban farm owned by the Culpeper Family of pubs, where four inches of topsoil has been laid over a fabric membrane on a sterile brownfield site.

There are rows of beetroot and kale, a greenhouse of tomatoes and peppers, and a coppice of spindly fruit trees propped against a fence waiting to be planted. The group's executive chef director Peter Weeden admits that one row of cavolo nero would only feed 30 people and take three months to grow back; the group's flagship pub, the organic Duke of Cambridge in Islington, serves 30,000 guests a year. Apart from giving chefs a break from the pressures of the kitchen - ""Time doesn't exist here,"" Weeden notes poetically - why bother?

""If you genuinely want to change things, you have to convince other people that change is possible,"" Weeden says. ""We live in an age of detachment in which food production feels remote. Because Deptford Little Farm is in the middle of an urban area, masses of people can see how we're growing food. And it's a way of making sure that our chefs understand the time and effort required to grow something without chemicals, herbicides and pesticides.""

Weeden says it is unlikely the farm will ever expand; the point is to serve as an example for how farming can be done differently rather than compete with the producers Culpeper already uses: Rhug Estate organic poultry from north Wales, heritage-breed beef for the Sunday roasts from Swaledale Butchers in Yorkshire, Sarah Green's Organics for veg grown on the Essex coast. ""We have too much respect for the farmers who do this day in, day out to compete with them as producers,"" Weeden says. ""The purpose of Deptford Little Farm is to help us bridge the gap between consumers and farmers, rather than us take over.""

Weeden was chef at the Duke of Cambridge for seven years when it was owned by Geetie Singh-Watson, who opened what was the UK's first certified organic pub in 1998. Since 2012, Singh-Watson has lived in Totnes, Devon, with her husband Guy, founder of Riverford Organic Farmers, and they now own The Bull Inn on the town's high street.

It is, however, another form of ""bull"" that peppers the couple's speech: Guy describes much of the provenance labelling on menus as ""dishonest"" because ""if people can get away with bullsh­""”ting, they will"". Geetie says that ""any restaurant that has a set menu that doesn't change for six months that says it's sustainably local is bulls""”t"" as the weather means the supply of seasonal veg cannot be guaranteed. ""The idea of being able to have whatever you want, whenever you want, is just bulls""”t,"" Guy adds. ""It needs to be challenged. I think there is an opportunity to offer a much more edited choice of ingredients on a menu.""

Which is where The Bull Inn comes in. The Singh-Watsons live at Baddaford Farm on the edge of Dartmoor, where they lease 154 acres of land rent-free to a collective of five farmers. ""˜They're completely independent of us, but we all work together and support each other,' says Geetie, who grew up on a commune in the Malvern Hills. Guy, meanwhile, won an award for responsible capitalism when he sold Riverford to its employees for a quarter of the market value. He recently launched the Get Fair About Farming campaign to put pressure on supermarkets to buy from British family farms for a fair price.

One of the Baddaford Farm collective is Aidan Vey, the owner of Green Finger Organics. How would Vey be farming if he weren't working with the Singh-Watsons? ""I would be doing the same elsewhere, but it would be a lot harder,"" he says. ""Something like 70 per cent of what I produce goes to The Bull.""

Geetie says their approach relies on a creative kitchen team. For example, Guy recently delivered a glut of artichokes to the pub that will need to appear in a multitude of dishes if the produce is not to go to waste. ""That's pretty unusual because a lot of mid-range restaurants and pubs have de-skilled their kitchens,"" he says. ""If you're going to use this sort of supply chain, you need a very dedicated chef."" Unless, of course, the chef is also the farmer.

Tommy Banks rebooted his family's farm in North Yorkshire after winning a Michelin star for his gastropub The Black Swan at Oldstead. The chef's family had abandoned contract farming when Banks was growing up and his parents realised that offering accommodation as a farmhouse bed and breakfast was a more reliable source of income, which in turn led them to buy the village pub half a mile away.

""We made a decent go of it,"" Banks deadpans with typical Yorkshire understatement, though he says that returning to farming was as much about combating the imposter syndrome he felt winning a star at the age of 24 as it was to provide food for the pub (and give his dad a sense of purpose).

The Bankses adopted regenerative farming practices when they found that 10 years of leaving the land fallow had turned the 160 acres into a hotbed of biodiversity. Today it produces everything from grass-fed Dexter cattle and Herdwick sheep to specialist fruit and veg, supplying not only The Black Swan but Banks' Roots restaurant in York, his Made in Oldstead delivery boxes and his latest venture, The Abbey Inn at the nearby village of Byland.

Banks now employs 145 people across his business and makes no distinction between his pubs and the farm. ""Turning the ingredients that we're farming into a high-value product for the end consumer isn't just a case of sending baskets of fruit and cuts of meat to the pub. It's a very labour-intensive process. I have three chefs working full time on the farm who I would count as farm workers even though they are trained chefs. They do all the butchery, make the charcuterie, turn the milk into yoghurt and prepare the pickles, preserves and fermented vegetables. There is a level of infrastructure required to get towards the self-sufficiency that we're aiming for.""

Banks remembers there being 15 kids getting on the school bus in Oldstead when he was growing up; now it's just his niece and nephew in an area where few couples can afford to raise a family. The pubs and farm, at least, are keeping young people in the Yorkshire countryside.

""We have an apprenticeship scheme that starts at 16 and the average age of people who work for us is in the mid-20s,"" Banks says. ""The farm and the pubs are intrinsically linked. One doesn't work without the other. So by connecting pubs with farming, you can create jobs for a community of young people that wouldn't otherwise exist in a rural location.""

Geetie Singh-Watson estimates that only five per cent of UK pubs work along similarly socially conscious lines to The Bull Inn or The Culpeper Family. ""A pub can only do that if it's in control of its supply chains,"" says Ed Bedington, editor of The Morning Advertiser, the trade paper for the pub industry. ""The larger operations buy food centrally and by price. Provenance tends to go out of the window for whatever ingredient is cheapest, whether that comes from England, Ireland or Argentina.""

Pubs still command the biggest share of consumer spending in hospitality - 29 per cent - according to recent data from research consultancy KAM and the British Institute of Innkeeping. But the study also found that customers were migrating to fast food due to the cost-of-living crisis. Like the rest of hospitality, pubs are facing year-on-year energy price increases of 80 per cent, high inflation and high interest rates. Surely many publicans have better things to worry about than where the ingredients for their lasagne are coming from?

""To be honest, they probably do,"" Bedington says. ""There's more of a survive than thrive mentality in the sector at the moment. Do operators really care about establishing a relationship with a farmer down the road if they can't put those great products on the menu at a price their customers can afford? But the flip-side of that is that pub operators have to be much smarter in terms of giving people reasons to come in.""

Perhaps we need to begin reimagining how British farming looks in the 21st century. When Geetie Singh-Watson owned the Duke of Cambridge, she only bought British ingredients - which meant no lemons. Tommy Banks says that his grandfather would recognise the sort of regenerative farming now practised by the family. The Bull's Thomas Jones has replaced the beds of tomato and basil with cavolo nero for winter. Yet do most pub-goers really want to return to the days when there was nothing to eat but brassicas for three months of the year, let alone no citrus fruit?

""Consumers aren't going to change how they think,"" says Greg Watts, the owner of the Bat & Ball near Fordingbridge on the edge of the New Forest. ""They want to eat strawberries all year round."" When he bought the pub two and a half years ago, he converted 160 square metres, roughly half of its bramble-choked garden, into a vertical hydroponics system that uses no soil and 90 per cent less water than traditional farming techniques. ""For eight months of the year,"" Watts says, ""we're growing strawberries on site, which means no food miles or single-use plastics when we eat products like that during winter.""

Watts admits that the tiers of tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers and courgettes growing in a polytunnel behind the pub lack the romance of traditional farming. But he is producing 50 per cent of the fruit and veg that the pub uses, as well as all the flowers for the pub's hanging baskets. ""If you can afford to lose three parking spaces, you can start growing hydroponically,"" he says. ""It's not going to produce everything you need. But it will make a dent in your food miles and it saves money. You can't solve everything in one go.""

Watts buys his meat from the local butcher, yet it is hard not to feel that his version of self-sufficiency feels more divorced from the local community. Must British farming be a struggle between the heart and the head?

""Pubs are the perfect place to work with farming,"" says Phil Winser, back at The Bull in Charlbury. ""We fit into a local ecosystem and a lot of the producers we use drink in the pub themselves. I'm not saying that pubs can save farming - yet. But I think they can help each other. And so far, it's working.""

How the ""˜Jeremy Clarkson effect' is hitting rural Britain

New research shows 93 per cent of farmers agree with presenter that planning system stifles rural economic growth

The ""Jeremy Clarkson effect"" is hitting rural Britain, with three-quarters of farmers saying they have abandoned plans to develop their businesses because of planning disputes.

The Top Gear presenter has publicly criticised his local council, which was accused by fans of ""pen pushing"" after it rejected his plans 

for a restaurant on Diddly Squat Farm, which features in his Amazon show Clarkson's Farm.

New research from the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) has found that a majority of farmers have faced similar problems, with 93 per cent agreeing with Clarkson's argument that the planning system is stifling economic growth in the countryside.

More than a third of farmers say they had already spent more than £20,000 on projects to develop their land before being forced to abandon them by planning issues. Almost 20 per cent said they had spent £50,000 or more.

Clarkson's planning battle with West Oxfordshire District Council over the restaurant has been widely publicised, with an online petition to ""save Diddly Squat Farm from planning injustice"" attracting 170,000 signatures.

The council has accused the programme of a ""misleading"" portrayal of a meeting at which councillors overwhelmingly voted to reject the development.

The CLA says the problem is rife in the countryside, with problems concentrated in national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty.

Seventy per cent of farmers responding to the organisation's survey who live in protected areas say they have farm buildings they hope to convert.

Will Mathias, 36, runs a plant nursery based near Farnham in the Surrey Hills area of outstanding natural beauty. His application to build a house and farm office on his land was rejected by Waverley Borough Council amid concerns that it would ""detrimentally affect the openness of the green belt"".

Mr Mathias told The Telegraph he would ""never vote Conservative again in local elections"" after the judgment, which he is appealing against.

The council is run by a coalition of parties led by the Liberal Democrats, but the Conservatives are the largest group.

""It was just purely a local politics issue of counsellors sitting in a meeting, they get all the papers dumped in front of them, and they make almost a split second decision there and then and they have a debate about it,"" he said.

""Not a single one of them had seen the site or knew the situation or indeed knew anything about our business. They basically decided on the day that they weren't going to allow it because they don't like to see any development happening in the area of outstanding natural beauty and green belt.

""We live in the very, very affluent village Tilford and it's essentially full of bankers, stockbrokers, city workers, who earn lots of money. They don't want to see people out working in the fields and machinery operating and that sort of thing.""

Mr Mathias estimates that his appeal will take 18 months and cost £20,000, but  is confident the new building will eventually be allowed.

The CLA has called for a comprehensive review of planning policy in the green belt to increase the development of rural businesses.

Mark Tufnell, the organisation's president, said: ""We can't continue treating the countryside as a museum, like it's something to be looked at not touched, because it's a home to communities and businesses that need to grow after decades of economic neglect.

""What we need is a new system that supports sensible, small-scale developments. It doesn't matter if you're Jeremy Clarkson or from a farming family - all deserve a lifeline and a genuine chance to thrive.""

Russia's ""˜weaponisation' of Ukrainian grain ""˜highly likely' a war crime

Human rights lawyers say Kremlin-linked network of grain extraction points towards a carefully planned campaign of a ""˜criminal nature'

Russia is ""highly likely"" to be guilty of war crimes following its ""systematised weaponisation"" of Ukrainian grain supplies, international lawyers have found. 

Since the beginning of the war in February, a Kremlin-linked network of grain extraction has been methodically built up in occupied eastern Ukraine, pointing towards a carefully planned campaign of a ""criminal nature,"" said human rights law firm Global Rights Compliance (GRC) in a newly-published study.

Russia used large carrier ships purchased before the war to transport grain, seized train tracks and the local means of storage, and set up shipping operations in Ukrainian port facilities to export products into Russia, the report showed.

As a result of the war, Ukrainian grain exports have been severely disrupted, causing prices to soar and contributing to a global food security crisis.

GRC's investigation, which was carried out between March and June 2023, said that Russia acted deliberately in seizing and controlling the grain trade in occupied areas.

""We saw a systematic approach to the way that food was being weaponised within the conflict,"" said Catriona Murdoch, the lead of the GRC's Starvation Mobile Justice Team.

""We've not seen anything as sophisticated as this in terms of the ability to transfer millions of tons of grain, and reroute that through occupied areas into Russia and the way that they have wielded that in terms of political pressure."" 

An estimated $1 billion worth of grain has been pillaged from Ukraine, the report said.

The report analysed open sources comprising information including photographs, videos, public statements by officials, and other digital data. 

It found that upon invasion, Russia seized grain facilities from Ukrainian corporations and private farmers, consolidating control through the Russian-affiliated civilian administration of these facilities.

The Kremlin then invested in networks to transport the grain, including roads, rail and ports. 

Global ""˜havoc' on food supplies

The report found that three 170-metre grain carrier ships were pre-purchased by a Russian defence contractor before the war, which GRC said speaks to pre-planning ""on an unprecedented scale"". 

Ms Murdoch said that it was part of a ""concerted plan"" to both weaken the livelihoods of many Ukrainians and place ""political pressure"" on world leaders in relation to food shortages in vulnerable countries, like those in the Horn of Africa. 

Russian blockades of Black Sea ports have left global supplies insecure, reducing Ukraine's ability to export grain and foodstuff to those most vulnerable. 

The Black Sea Grain Initiative marked an attempt to reintroduce exports from Ukraine to the global market, but it expired in July 2023 after Russia unilaterally refused to extend its term. 

""It has given Russia a real trump card in terms of being able to bring people to the negotiating table,"" Ms Murdoch said, explaining the link to the Black Sea initiative. 

Grain extraction occurred in occupied Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia, according to the report. 

Multiple convoys were seen carrying grain towards Crimea, while GPS trackers on vehicles stolen from farmers showed them driving into Russia via Crimea. 

Rail networks were also used, along with barges that were loaded with supplies from Berdiansk Port in Zaporizhzhia, with potential destinations including Rostov-on-Don, Russia, or Kerch in Crimea. 

Job adverts posted to Telegram by Russian logistics companies, and analysed by the investigators, show they could not get enough drivers in time to transport the vast quantities of stolen Ukrainian grain to Russia.

GRC found that the first extractions of grain occurred in March 2022. 

""The scale of what we're talking about here is something that is unprecedented because we're talking about millions and millions of tons of grain,"" Ms Murdoch said. 

""It has disrupted global food supply, creating havoc on a global scale.""

MS Swaminathan, father of India's Green Revolution who saved millions from famine - obituary

His new wheat varieties enabled Indian farmers to increase annual yields from 12 million tons in the 1960s to 120 million tons today

Professor MS Swaminathan, who has died aged 98, was the world's leading agricultural scientist and the ""father"" of India's ""green revolution"" of the late 1960s which prevented millions of people suffering food shortages and famine.

In the early years of the decade, India grew some 12 million tons of wheat every year. Starvation was rampant and the country imported much of its food. Swaminathan, an agricultural geneticist, developed new dwarf high-yield wheat varieties that enabled the country to triple its production, turning India from being the world's largest importer of food grains to a net exporter. Today, India grows some 120 million tons of wheat.

He continued his career in pure biotech research, but in later life began to question some of the principles of intensive farming practices on which the Green Revolution had been based. While the population of India almost doubled after independence, partly as a result of over-intensification half of the country's cultivable land became ecologically degraded; grain production began to decline and from the late 1980s farmers, encouraged by a government which had embraced globalisation, turned to cash crops and away from the traditional staples that make up the bulk of the food eaten by the poorest.

Swaminathan became an advocate for the Gandhian concept of production by the masses and called for an ""Ever-green Revolution"" which would keep people on the land while avoiding further ecological damage. The key to this, he argued, was GM technology allied to organic farming techniques, although he was vehemently opposed to the corporate GM model promoted by companies such as Monsanto. GM technology, he argued, should be publicly funded by governments and should be made freely available to producers.

The second of four sons of a surgeon, Monkombu Sambasivan Swaminathan was born on August 7 1925 into a Tamil family at Kumbakonam, Madras State (now Tamil Nadu), in what was then British-ruled India. His father died unexpectedly when he was 11 and during his teens he was much influenced by his uncle, a teacher and scholar of English literature, Tamil and Sanskrit at Madras University.

Swaminathan was educated at the Little Flower Catholic High School in Kumbakonam and at Maharajas College in Trivandrum where he took a degree in zoology. As wartime food shortages began to bite and famine struck Bengal in 1942 he decided to switch to agriculture and enrolled at Coimbatore Agricultural College where he took another degree in Agricultural Science. 

In 1947, the year of Indian independence, he moved to the Indian Agricultural Research Institute in New Delhi as a post-graduate student in genetics and plant breeding and obtained a post-graduate degree in Cytogenetics in 1949.

Because Swaminathan's parents had planned a government career for him, he took and passed the Indian government's civil service examinations. He was offered a management job in the police, but at the same time, he heard that he had won a Unesco fellowship to continue his education overseas. He spent a year studying plant genetics at the University of Wageningen in the Netherlands and then moved on to Cambridge University in England, where he earned a doctorate in 1952 on the genetic structures of certain potato species.

He then accepted a post-doctoral research post at the University of Wisconsin, where he helped to establish a potato research station and gained practical experience of plant hybridisation.

He was offered a professorship at the University but chose to return to India and began his career in 1954 as assistant botanist at the Central Rice Research Institute in the Indian state of Orissa, where he experimented with crossing rice varieties in order to create a new strain with increased yields. Within six months he had moved to New Delhi and to the Indian Agricultural Research Institute where he became chief cytogeneticist in 1956, head of the botany division in 1961, and director of the division in 1966.

It was here that he began to experiment with cross-breeding native Indian wheat varieties with Japanese strains and with a dwarf wheat plant developed in Mexico by the Nobel prize-winning American agricultural researcher Norman Borlaug - work that would underpin the Green Revolution. Scientists under Swaminathan's direction at the IARI made similar breakthroughs with rice. He also helped assemble a stock of 7,000 rice strains from northeast India that became something of a genetic gold mine and eventually grew to include 75,000 different varieties.

Swaminathan was not just a brilliant scientist but a gifted communicator as well, and in the late 1960s he took steps to spread the message by setting up a network of 2,000 model farms that showed local farmers the possibilities of the new plant varieties.

From 1970 to 1980 he served as Director General of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and during the decade he was aided in his efforts to improve Indian farming by the country's prime minister, Indira Gandhi, who gave him free rein to reform India's agricultural bureaucracy and in 1979 named him principal secretary of India's Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation.

As a result of his achievements in India, Swaminathan became a leading adviser to international organisations concerned with food security, biodiversity and genetic research, chairing or serving as president of numerous committees and organisations including, in 1974, the UN World Food Congress held in Rome, and, from 1981 to 1985, the Food and Agriculture Organisation.

In 1982 he moved to the Philippines to take a post as director general of the International Rice Research Institute. He returned to India in 1989 and founded the Center for Research on Sustainable Agricultural and Rural Development in Madras (now Chennai), having served as honorary vice president of the World Wildlife Fund from 1985 to 1987.

In the 1990s, with backing from the Rockefeller Foundation, he led research into GM varieties of rice, tobacco and other crops that are tolerant to salt water, and into techniques which involve a mix of GM and organic farming methods. More recently, he became involved in trying to spread Internet and computer technology into India's rural villages.

Swaminathan was the author of numerous scientific papers and books on agriculture and biodiversity. His numerous awards included the 1987 World Food Prize and the 1999 Unesco Mahatma Gandhi Gold Medal. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society and of the American, Russian, Chinese and Italian Academies of Science. In 1999 he was one of only three Indians included in Time magazine's list of the ""20 most influential Asian people of the 20th century"", the other two being Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore.

In the 1950s Swaminathan married Mina Bhoothalingam, a fellow student at Cambridge, who died last year. He is survived by their three daughters.

MS Swaminathan, born August 7 1925, died September 28 2023

Meat is crucial for human health, scientists warn

Close to a thousand experts unite behind statement that rejects ""˜zealotry' of plant-based diets and promotes livestock farming

Meat is crucial for human health, scientists have warned, as they called for an end to the ""zealotry"" pushing vegetarian and vegan diets.

Dozens of experts were asked to look into the science behind claims that meat eating causes disease and is harmful for the planet in a special issue of Animal Frontiers.

They warned that it is difficult to replace the nutritional content of meat, arguing that poorer communities with low meat intake often suffer from stunting, wasting and anaemia driven by a lack of vital nutrients and protein.

In recent years, there has been a widespread societal push towards plant-based diets, with schemes such as Veganuary and meat-free Mondays encouraging the public away from meat.

The major Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factor Study, published in The Lancet in 2020, also suggested that a diet high in red meat was responsible for 896,000 deaths worldwide, and was the fifth leading dietary risk factor.

But researchers argue that unprocessed meat delivers most of the vitamin B12 intake in human diets, plays a major role in supplying retinol, omega-3 fatty acids and minerals such as iron and zinc, as well as important compounds for metabolism, such as taurine and creatine.

""˜Fatally scientifically flawed'

In one paper published in the issue, experts found no good evidence to support red meat being dangerous below intakes of 75g per day, and argued that the link between red meat and disease vanished when part of a healthy diet, suggesting it was the rest of the diet that was fuelling health problems.

Dr Alice Stanton, of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, one of the authors of the review, said: ""The peer-reviewed evidence published reaffirms that [the 2019 Global Burden of Disease Risk Factors Report] which claimed that consumption of even tiny amounts of red meat harms health is fatally scientifically flawed.

""In fact, removing fresh meat and dairy from diets would harm human health. Women, children, the elderly and low income would be particularly negatively impacted.""

The NHS also advises that red meat - such as beef, lamb and pork - is a good source of protein, vitamins and minerals and can form part of a balanced diet, although it warns that eating more than 90g per day can raise the risk of bowel cancer.

The new edition includes a declaration signed by nearly 1,000 scientists across the globe arguing that livestock farming was too important to society to ""become the victim of zealotry"".

The Dublin Declaration includes signatories from the universities of Cambridge, Edinburgh, Bristol, Belfast, Newcastle, Nottingham, Surrey as well as several scientists from Britain's world-leading agricultural and farming university Harper Adams.

""Livestock-derived foods provide a variety of essential nutrients and other health-promoting compounds, many of which are lacking in diets even among those populations with higher incomes,"" the declaration states.

""Well-resourced individuals may be able to achieve adequate diets while heavily restricting meat, dairy and eggs. However, this approach should not be recommended for general populations.""

The researchers warned that those who need to eat animal products included young children, adolescents, pregnant and lactating women, women of reproductive age, older adults and the chronically ill.

""˜One-size-fits-all agendas'

Dr Wilhelm Windisch, a farming nutrition expert at the Technical University of Munich, said: ""Farmed and herded animals maintain a circular flow of materials in agriculture by using and upcycling large amounts of materials humans cannot eat, turning them into high-quality nutrient dense food.

""One-size-fits-all agendas, such as the drastic reductions of livestock numbers could incur environmental and nutritional consequences on a massive scale.""

The intervention was welcomed by the National Farmers Union (NFU) who were this week promoting Great British Beef Week.

Richard Findlay, the NFU livestock board chair, said: ""This peer-reviewed research confirms what we've always known - that red meat is a quality, nutritious protein that plays a critical role in a healthy, sustainable balanced diet.

""During Great British Beef Week this week, we can celebrate the sustainability of British beef and the environmental benefits our grazing herds deliver.""

The Global Burden of Diseases team had not responded at the time of publication.

Two cows per field limit incenses Dutch farmers

Farmers in conflict with Mark Rutte, the country's PM, over bid to restrict cattle to just a couple per football pitch-sized space

The Dutch government is considering plans to restrict cattle numbers to two cows per football pitch-sized field, putting them on a collision course with the country's farmers.

Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, has not yet approved the proposed limit of up to ""0.35 hectares of grassland per livestock unit"", which is part of a range of measures designed to help the Netherlands meet European Union climate change targets.

The aim is to reduce the large quantities of polluting methane, produced by manure and fertiliser, in grassland-poor areas, while other fields will be converted to grassland, which is good for biodiversity and water quality.

Farmers are incensed by the plans to limit their livestock numbers, especially in the south of the Netherlands, where about 3.5 cows per football field graze.

Strained relations
 

Relations between farmers in the world's second-largest agricultural exporter and Mr Rutte are already strained.

In March, the Farmer-Citizen Movement (BBB) triumphed in regional elections dominated by tractor protests against compulsory farm buyouts, designed to hit EU climate change targets.

Protests over measures to reduce nitrogen drew global attention and support from the likes of Donald Trump and Elon Musk.

The BBB came from nowhere to become the largest party in all 12 Dutch provinces in what became a de facto referendum on the leadership of Mr Rutte, the Netherlands' longest-serving prime minister.

The party is now targeting power in The Hague if Mr Rutte's coalition collapses and a general election is called.

The limit on cow numbers emerged in a leaked government document prepared for negotiations with farmers and obtained by the NOS broadcaster.

It quotes research from Wageningen University & Research, which found that the Dutch livestock sector needed to shrink by up to 30 per cent and all the mooted measures be implemented to hit targets for nitrogen, climate and water.

Officials and farmers' organisations are locked in talks over an agricultural agreement to reduce pollution in the sector up to 2040.

Negotiations are particularly difficult because they are over changes to ensure nitrogen emissions are halved to meet EU targets for 2030, which triggered the farmers' tractor protests.

Press leak ""˜not helpful'
 

Piet Adema, the minister for agriculture, reacted angrily to the leak, which revealed the government was also considering lower emission stables, reducing pesticides and improving manure processing.

""I am incredibly disappointed that there is a leak. I don't know where it came from, but it is bad because it is not helpful to the process,"" he told MPs.

""We are still negotiating. Everything is still in motion,"" said the minister, who wanted a deal this month as talks began in December last year.

£5.8 billion cost
 

The leak revealed that Mr Adema believes the Agricultural Agreement will cost the government £5.8 billion plus another £521 million for ""ecosystem services"".

This money would be paid to farmers for rewilding areas of their land, managing ditches and ponds, and creating habitats for insects and birds, but it has not been approved by the government.

Another area of disagreement is whether the right to keep animals can be transferred to people other than family members if a farm is closed.

Mr Rutte has already earmarked £22 billion by 2035 for measures such as farm buyouts and reducing livestock numbers.
Nitrogen is also caused by construction. 

Construction projects to ease a housing crisis were stopped by a court order on environmental grounds and cannot resume unless action is taken to reduce emissions elsewhere, the government said.

Sheep in wolves' clothing scare off predators

Swiss researchers develop collar worn by livestock that tricks animals into believing they have strayed into a rival pack's territory

Putting a sheep in wolf's clothing is an effective way to prevent them being eaten, Swiss researchers say.

The scientists have developed ""pheromone collars"", which, when placed around the necks of cattle or sheep, trick wolves into believing that they have strayed into the territory of a rival pack causing them to slope off in search of unclaimed prey.

Studio Alpino and Tibio, the two companies involved, have tested the collars on more than 650 sheep and cows in and around 20 pastures in the Swiss Alps and say that the initial results are ""very encouraging"".

""It's a little box that you put on the animal's collar. Inside there is a pocket of pheromones, that's the innovation,"" said Federico Tettamanti, a wildlife biologist and head of Studio Alpino, who co-invented the anti-wolf collar.

When wolves smell the pheromones, they think they are in another wolf's territory. ""Wolves have a highly developed sense of smell. With these pheromones, the wolf understands that there is a barrier that it must not cross because these are territory pheromones,"" Mr Tettamanti told France Bleu radio in Savoie.

Wider tests to be carried out

So far, only one cow wearing a collar in the Vaud canton north-east of Geneva has been attacked, but the farmer had ""only just put the anti-wolf collar on it"".

The two Swiss companies believe that the collar provides better protection for herds. ""An animal wearing a pheromone-based collar is half as likely to be attacked by a wolf. I'm convinced it can work,"" said Mr Tettamanti.

However, he said wider tests must be carried out before shepherds can sleep more easily. These will be conducted in the coming months in France in the southwestern Occitanie and southeastern Alpes-Maritimes regions.

Other anti-wolf collars have been in use for several years, but they are not pheromone-based. Most detect sudden movement when a flock or herd panics owing to the presence of wolves. This triggers an alarm that turns on powerful lights to scare the wolves away. Results have been mixed.

After centuries of absence, wolves were first spotted back in Switzerland in 2012. Today 32 wolf packs with a total of around 300 wolves roam the country. In 2020, there were only 11 packs with some 100 wolves.

The number of livestock killed rose from 446 in 2019 to 1,480 last year. This is a particular problem for Alpine farming with sheep and goats. However, the wolves also killed cattle, alpacas and a donkey.

Culling of wolf packs

This week, federal authorities authorised the culling of 12 wolf packs in five cantons. Ticino was permitted to shoot two-thirds of young wolves from a pack in Onsernone Valley.

The plan has appalled conservationists who say it is incompatible with the EU's Habitats Directive, adopted in 1992, which prohibits the deliberate capture or killing of wolves in the wild.

However, in September, Brussels began a review into the predator's status with Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, warning: ""The concentration of wolf packs in some European regions has become a real danger for livestock and potentially also for humans.""

She also urged local and national authorities to take advantage of exemptions to EU laws to allow farmers to take targeted measures to protect their crops and livelihoods, such as using ""soft-catch"" traps for wolves.

Climate change is happening - Africa must adapt to it to survive

Leaders must rally behind a common priority: adaptation to safeguard food systems that feed more than a billion people on the continent

When 60,000 tonnes of grain stored for export smouldered as Russia pounded Ukrainian ports in July, and a renewed blockade of Black Sea ports again curbed food trade, it stoked a simmering global food crisis.

Within weeks, India's government announced a ban on rice exports, increasing fears of rising prices and food shortages elsewhere. 

Most concerning of all, these developments came as the impacts of climate change took an increasing toll on food production, with July the hottest month ever recorded on our planet.  

Africa is among the world regions most impacted by climate change. All signs point to a rising risk of climate-related humanitarian crises like the""¯multi-year droughts""¯that have decimated farming in East Africa and this year's record-breaking, 36-day-long cyclone across the continent's South East that displaced""¯400,000 people.  

Less obvious is the slow but steady erosion in the production and quality of staple foods like""¯maize, beans,""¯milk,""¯meat and eggs""¯due to extreme heat and the spread of crop and livestock pests and diseases.""¯ 

The need for agricultural adaptation to climate change is glaring. Yet most attention to climate change has been directed at mitigating the climate crisis. While this is clearly essential, Africa has contributed less than four per cent to global greenhouse gas emissions that fuel climate change, while disproportionately suffering its worst impacts.""¯ 

As conflict and climate change ramp up prices and reduce crop yields around the world, Africa has increasingly relied on imports of food staples like wheat and rice. This dependence is increasingly untenable. 

In preparation for next month's Africa Climate Week and the global climate summit (COP28) in November, government leaders can rally behind a common priority: adaptation to safeguard food systems that feed more than a billion people on the continent.""¯

Cassava, for example, and a host of native African crops offer potential alternatives. Cassava's resilience in harsh conditions makes it particularly promising. But it is not invincible. Worsening climate extremes decrease yields and promote pests - but scientists can address these vulnerabilities through breakthroughs in breeding. 

In generating these developments, combined with more precise market research and improved community engagement, science institutions like the CGIAR global agricultural research network have enhanced cassava's sustainability and applied this model of crop improvement to other African crops with climate resilience potential, such as millets and sorghum. 

In the face of increasing heat extremes, adaptation must include water-saving innovations. In West Africa, smallholder rice farmers are working with agricultural experts from the research organisation AfricaRice (a part of CGIAR) to improve their operations amid increasingly erratic rainfall, soaring demand for rice, and costly imports. 

Across areas with limited irrigation, farmers introduced periodic saturation of fields, rather than constant, shin-deep saturation. This decreased water usage by 30 per cent while maintaining harvests and cutting weed infestations by half.

It even enabled some rice farmers to diversify their operations, branching into aquaculture and vegetable production within one growing season. As global rice supplies tighten, this model of adaptation could enable African production to increase in an increasingly unfriendly environment. 

Climate change is also taking a huge toll on soils that are already often depleted. A range of adaptation approaches can address this problem, from the use of digital soil maps that reveal the precise composition of soils and their nutrient balances to drip irrigation systems powered by solar mini-grids - an approach being implemented widely in Ethiopia.

Other solutions rely on increasing the number of different crops that farmers in Africa grow. For example, ""intercropping"" beans with maize makes the most of the bean plant's natural ability to increase the nitrogen content of soils and alleviates the need for manufactured fertilisers.  

Crop diversity, water conservation, and soil health are not subjects that exist in silos. Farmers and farming communities must be able to access the knowledge, technology, and financing needed to embrace these and other improvements, understanding where they overlap and where they do not so that they can adapt to a swiftly changing climate.  

The money and resources needed to deploy these new techniques do not grow on trees. At last year's COP27 climate summit, African leaders were quite vocal about the need for more adaptation financing. Senegalese President and then President of the African Union""¯Macky Sall""¯called for a doubling of the global US$100 billion pledge for climate adaptation support. This call will no doubt be taken up again at COP28 in November. 

Delegates at COP28 need to go further, however. As difficult as this year has been so far, the weather and so many other factors can only get worse. With so much of humanity on the razor's edge of survival, we must produce a comprehensive strategy for the global food system to adapt to global warming and move decisively toward a climate-resilient food future.

The great vegan diet ""˜con'

It may be Veganuary, but a plant-based lifestyle isn't better for your health and it certainly won't save the planet

Canola oil, yeast, acidity regulator, methyl­cellulose, corn oil thickener, starch, gelling agent. ""Hmm, I don't like agents in my food,"" says Jayne Buxton.

We're in the refrigerator aisle of a well-known, high-end health-food supermarket in Richmond, London, reading the backs of packets of vegan ­sausages, burgers et al. As far as vegan products go, we're dining at the Ritz.

Pastrami-style slices, scrambled tofu, vegan chorizo slices, jackfruit rendang, a canister of No-Egg Egg for £4.99. ""That's more than a carton of eggs,"" says Buxton as she scans the ingredients. Gum cellulose dextrose, ""That's sugar. Do you want sugar with your eggs?""

You would expect the quality here to be better than anywhere else, but nutritionally, says Buxton, it's a wasteland of chemicals and oils where nutritious protein should be.

""Someone's going to arrest us in a minute,"" she jokes. It does feel subversive. Like we're poking around in veganism's knicker drawer.

In recent years, we've been told by Netflix documentaries, vegan activists and companies selling plant-based products that going vegan is the single best thing you can do to improve your own health, the planet's and the wellbeing of the animals we share it with.

However, four years ago, Jayne Buxton started to question the received wisdom. What she saw in documentaries and news outlets, she says, was at odds with the very few facts she knew. ""When the documentary Cowspiracy came out and said 51 per cent of emissions are from livestock, I knew that was not true. I knew that the official global number was 14.5 per cent, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. And even that is an exaggerated number.""

Buxton, a former management consultant with an MBA, is trained to look at data critically. She began researching the topic of food, health and the environment (specifically, the impact of meat and plant-based diets on human and plan­etary health) and she realised the extent of the ­misinformation around both the health and environmental impact of meat-eating, and that the benefits of plant-only diets were being exaggerated.

""People are trying to do the right thing. And no wonder it's hard, because they're being given confusing messages.""

Buxton searched for the answers to these questions: is a plant-based diet better for your health? Will it save the planet? Who is pushing the plant-based diet and why? And how should we eat?

She decided to turn her research into a book: The Great Plant-Based Con. The ""con"" refers to the gradual conditioning of the public's thought processes by a constellation of individuals and organisations, ""who may well believe in the truth of the views they express, but present things that are far from certain as established fact"".

She's not oblivious to the hornets' nest she's about to poke. However, she feels that hers is one of a growing number of voices pushing back against the ""dogma"" of veganism, citing the likes of food writer Joanna Blythman and shepherd and author James Rebanks. Many of the scientists she spoke to appreciated what she was doing. ""They are often working at a distance from the lay person. There is debate happening at their level, but they can sometimes struggle to reach a popular audience.""

While she's become known as ""the Meat Lady"" to friends and family, they have been supportive. Her children, 30, 27 and 23, are part of the generation who are lobbied about being plant-based every day. ""I'm really proud of how they ask questions and aren't set in how they think. ""The zeitgeist is such that young ­people are frightened to stand up and say something different.""

Can veganism save the planet?

In 2018, researchers at the University of Oxford published a study that claimed cutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by up to 73 per cent.

The number was widely reported in the media, with little close questioning. Buxton, however, spent time ­picking apart the modelling used in the study. It, like other figures, such as those used in Cowspiracy, she says, advocates for plant-based diets by exaggerating GHG (greenhouse gas) numbers, ­failing to fully account for carbon sequestration, using a methane metric that overestimates the methane from livestock, and downplaying nutritional considerations.

Buxton wrote to Joseph Poore, the lead author of the Oxford study, early on to ask some questions about it. ""I hoped it would start a dialogue. He did not reply."" When I approached the Vegan Society for comment about the study, a spokesperson said: ""Of course there are many things to consider when it comes to sustainable food. Plant-based diets are consistently shown to be the lowest impact across a range of environmental measures.""

Lumping the UK in with global figures for countries with vastly different farming practices means that some of the good news gets lost. Beef cattle and sheep in the UK account for just 5.7 per cent of all UK emissions, but this is reduced to 3.7 per cent if carbon sequestration (storing of carbon in the soil) is taken into account. While she says it's a clichÃ©, ""It really is the how, not the cow.""

Still, in a complex world, giving up meat can feel like a positive contribution we can all make relatively easily, compared with that more damaging flight to go on our annual holiday.

""This is why people have latched onto the plant-based idea with such vigour,"" says Buxton. ""It's a supposedly pain-free way of helping the environment. It's a kind of virtue signalling ­get-out clause that stops people from having to think about making more significant changes to their lifestyles.""

Buying less, flying less and doing less could make a more meaningful impact. ""Just generally consume less. That's not a good message in a capitalist economy, though. People don't like it. They like this one because it drives the ­economy forward.""

Giving up dairy milk has become the ultimate act of virtue signalling, says Buxton. But if our food footprint is a maximum of 16 per cent of the total individual footprint and milk is a tiny proportion of that, the reduction of GHGs is minuscule. ""It allows individuals to keep on with their other carbon-generating habits in a guilt-free way.""

Who is pushing the message?

Harmless hippies versus murdering meat-eaters - that's the clichÃ©d narrative dichotomy. Yesterday's lentil-eating free-lovers, though, have been consumed by the big business of veganism.

The plant-based ""meat"" market alone is expected to be worth more than £25 billion by 2026, according to a study by Stephan van Vliet, of Duke University in the United States.

Conflicts of interest abound. Film director James Cameron was one of those behind the pro-plant-eating movie The Game Changers. He also used to own Verdient Foods, an organic pea-protein company that aims to be the largest pea-protein producer in North America.

Buxton also charts in her book how an anti-meat agenda started with the Seventh-day Adventists' ""Garden of Eden"" diet in the 19th century, which advocated veg­etarianism. Meat-free proponent John Harvey Kellogg, of ­Kellogg's Corn Flakes fame, championed the car­bo­hydrate-rich diet that dominates today. ""They have been very influential in the dietary committees and forming the dietary guidelines that have been developed since.""

Buxton wants more people to be aware of how the targeted marketing that we might unwittingly parrot becomes ""unquestionable dogma"".

Where do we go from here?

This isn't a call to forks for you to head to your nearest all-you-can-eat­ ­steakhouse. Buxton would like to see everyone reduce consumption of meat from industrial farming and ­transition towards more sustainably raised meat, ""which will likely mean consuming less"".

Before writing the book, she had always been more of a baked-potato-and-salad person, than a steak person. However, researching her book has made her appreciate meat and its health benefits. She now eats some animal-sourced foods (eggs, meat, cheese) alongside a variety of vegetables every day, including having meat for dinner three or four times a week, and a ""nice 4oz steak"" about once a week.

An ordinary, average British 4oz steak, Buxton worked out from numbers in an FAO report, is about 1.9kg of CO2e. ""Estimates of the carbon cost of red meat vary widely. This is not an exact science at all.

So, for example, in Mike Berners-Lee's book there's an estimate of 2.9kg for British beef."" A hot bath is 2.5kg. Running a portable heater in your house for six hours is about 5kg. A veggie curry delivered on a scooter - five miles - is between 1.4kg and 2.7kg, depending on whether you're ordering for one or for four. ""It's all about the choices we make.""

However, meat, the high-welfare kind that Buxton would like to see us all eating, is expensive. ""That is because our food system is skewed. If I were designing policies to make it affordable to eat properly, I would tax the hell out of the processed stuff and the empty carbs and the junk and subsidise the regeneratively farmed eggs and meat, and well-raised fish. And I would support farmers with active policies to transition to the best farming practices.""

First off, though, the anti-meat rhetoric has to stop. Encouragingly, diets such as the Keto (high fat and low carb) are growing in popularity for treating an epidemic of obesity and diabetes. In many ways, it and veganism are antithetical.

For Buxton, it's a sign that as a society we're rethinking how a healthy diet might be one that is balanced, fresh and unprocessed. ""Eventually, I really firmly believe that if we pursue the regenerative path, we will eventually see fully sustainable, healthful meat available for reasonable prices.""

Is a plant-based diet actually healthier? 

If you have a lingering feeling that meat, eggs and dairy are bad for you, you might be suffering from a hangover from the demonisation of cholesterol in the 1950s. Today, eggs and dairy in moderation are considered part of a healthy diet, yet the reputational damage to red meat remains, despite there being no studies that conclusively prove it is bad for our health.

""Red meat gets lumped in with processed meat, which some studies have proved to be harmful. However, recent studies in the Annals of Internal Medicine [2019], which conducted a meta analysis of the full body of research, concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend reduced consumption of red or processed meat,"" says Buxton.

There have been several critiques of the WHO report on cancer (2015), which is responsible for the notion that eating processed meat causes cancer, including one from a member of the committee that produced the report, who felt that it was not evidence based.

""The thing about the data for red meat is that, via epidemiological studies, it has been lumped together with other aspects of an unhealthy diet, such as the excess consumption of processed carbohydrates. Is it the meat producing the results or the bun, fries and cola consumed alongside it?"" questions Buxton.

When it comes to veganism, she is concerned that a diet requiring additional supplementation (plant-based diets are deficient in nutrients such as preformed vitamin A, B12 and D, iodine, iron, omega-3, several essential amino acids and zinc) can be held up as healthier than a balanced one that doesn't.

Plant-based milks require fortification with calcium and other vitamins; breastfeeding vegan mothers are encouraged by the Vegan Society to take supplements of B12, iodine, vitamin D and omega-3, and to increase their intake (requirements are 80 per cent higher than for other adults) by eating calcium-fortified foods and calcium-set tofu. When we approached the Vegan Society for comment, a spokesperson said: ""From a health point of view, a well-planned vegan diet can support healthy living in people of all ages, including during pregnancy and breastfeeding.""

A single egg, however, contains omega-3 essential fatty acids in DHA form, vitamins A, B6, B12, E, D and K, calcium, iron, zinc and many other healthy minerals. Take that, No-Egg Egg.

Then there is the higher consumption of seed oils, high in omega-6, associated with highly processed foods, such as those we found in the supermarket refrigerator.

""The amount of omega-6 in our adipose tissue has risen from something like nine per cent to 21 per cent in the past two decades,"" says Buxton.

Her research led her to conclude that the belief a vegan diet will make you healthier is a myth. ""Plant-based diets provide inferior-quality protein and are deficient in important nutrients while being abundant in potentially harmful compounds. However, if a person eats plant-based foods in the sense of lots of plants alongside small amounts of animal foods, the deficiencies will not be there.""

In 2020, the actor Liam Hemsworth had to rethink his vegan diet after an overload of oxalates (a naturally occurring compound in plants) gave him painful kidney stones that required surgery.

It seems even when a vegan diet avoids the pitfalls of processed food, you can have too much of a good thing. As ever, balance and moderation in all things is key.

The ethical argument for veganism 

Animal welfare is the issue that turns many off meat: full disclosure, it's why I haven't eaten it for six years. Buxton sympathises: ""I understand that people are disgusted by the way we farm meat intensively. I am too.""

She thinks we should all be grateful to animal rights activists, vegans and vegetarians for highlighting these issues. ""That's a positive contribution. The solution is maybe where we part company.""

Buxton supports the transition towards farming regeneratively, which aims to restore soil quality and biodiversity while producing sufficient food of high nutritional quality. ""British farming is going well compared with the rest of the world.""

She also questions whether a plant-based diet is cruelty-free, using the example of John Chester, a Californian farmer who was the subject of the 2018 documentary The Biggest Little Farm, who explained he has to kill 40,000 gophers a year to protect his 250-acre avocado crop.

In the UK, meanwhile, as wheat yields doubled between 1970 and today, the number of farmland birds decreased by 54 per cent, according to the National Biodiversity Network.

In New South Wales, Australia, over a five-year period up to 2013, rice farmers killed nearly 200,000 native ducks to protect their rice crops from the birds.

At the heart of this, Buxton says, is the fact that we have to get to grips with the fundamental reality that: ""For us to eat, there will be death.""

She would rather that we come to terms with our biology, rather than trying to evolve beyond it by creating lab-grown meats. ""You can eat grazing animals that have led a really good life and have been good for the soil.""

The case for UK-produced meat

In an extract from her book, Jayne Buxton says regeneratively farmed meat is what we should aim for: 

Meat produced in the UK is among the most sustainable in the world. Taking into account grassland sequestration (the process by which grassland draws carbon out of the atmosphere and stores it in the soil, of which more in a moment), cattle and sheep account for 3.7 per cent of UK emissions. Even excluding sequestration, cattle and sheep account for just 5.7 per cent of emissions. 

Very little meat consumed in the UK comes from systems that deplete rainforests and generate large amounts of emissions. Imported meat from Brazil, for example, make up just one per cent of UK beef imports. If the high-level, global numbers for emissions are misleading, so are the various claims about the carbon cost per kilo of beef.

Frank Mitloehner, an air-quality scientist at the University of California, explains this using a car analogy: ""If I asked you about the emissions generated by a car, you would have to ask: what car are we talking about? A Fiat or an S-Class Mercedes or an electric car? Is it diesel or gas? How old is it, and who's driving it? All these questions and more. It's the same with cows. What breed is she? Where is she? What is she fed? Is there a veterinary system to treat her diseases? There are so many issues to consider. So, when you try to produce a global estimate and apply it to a specific region or farm, you are almost certainly going to be wrong, perhaps by 10, 15 or 20 times.""

The problem identified by Mitloehner goes some way towards explaining why estimates for the carbon costs per kilo of meat vary so widely. Sources I consulted gave estimates ranging from -4kg to +400kg of CO2 per kilo.

The research organisation Our World in Data, for example, has published two different estimates: 100kg and 60kg. The per kilo CO2 cost of beef in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated at 40-50kg CO2e, versus 5-10kg in Europe. A report by the National Farmers' Union estimates the carbon cost of British beef at 17.2kg (as compared with 46kg for the rest of the world).

The claims in a BBC Horizon programme that aired in early 2021 were (according to the online material provided by the scientist who sourced the data for the programme) based on yet another emissions-per-kilo-of-beef number - 25kg of CO2e.

Clearly, where and how the beef is produced, and what factors are accounted for in the calculations, makes a difference, but it remains a fact that emissions in places such as the UK and the US are dramatically lower than is regularly claimed, and represent a very small part of the emissions pie. Yet the cumulative effect of the arguments put forward by plant-based food advocates is to condition people into thinking that swapping all animal foods will make a significant difference in our quest to reduce emissions and fight climate change.

A 2017 study by Mary Beth Hall, an animal scientist at the US Dairy Forage Research Center, in Wisconsin, and Robin R White, a professor of animal and poultry science at Virginia Tech, concluded that the impact of eliminating all meat consumption would be very small. Modelling a US food system without animals, they found that total US emissions would be reduced by just 2.6 per cent, and this at some considerable cost to nutritional adequacy.

A total of 2.6 per cent is not nothing, but it is not even close to the kinds of numbers that are regularly bandied about. Environmental economist Dr Bjorn Lomborg concurs with Hall and White, asserting that ""eating carrots instead of steak means you effectively cut your emissions by about two per cent"". Lomborg, a vegetarian for ethical reasons, says: ""There are many good reasons to eat less meat. Sadly, making a huge difference to the climate isn't one of them.""

Professor FrÃ©dÃ©ric Leroy, a professor in the field of food science and biotechnology at Vrije University, in Brussels, confirms that the impact on the climate of adopting a vegan diet is very small and becomes even smaller if one also factors in such contextual factors as natural carbon cycles, carbon sequestration and actual nutritional value. Whatever the exact number is, he says: ""It's not big. It's something, but not much, and what the data from Hall and White also suggest is that there is likely going to be a cost in terms of nutrition.""

Hall and White's findings have been replicated at the level of the individual. An individual's annual carbon footprint is about 12 tonnes of CO2, and their food footprint is estimated to be about 16 per cent of this, or two tonnes of CO2 (this number varies greatly by country).

The estimated reduction in emissions generated by a switch to a vegan diet is 0.8 of a tonne, representing a six per cent reduction in the total per capita footprint. When you compare this with the reduction in emissions resulting from one fewer return transatlantic flight (1.6 tonnes) or living car-free (between 1 and 5.3 tonnes), the benefit of switching to a plant-based diet looks relatively inconsequential, particularly when the negative impact on nutrition and health are factored in. Once any unintended consequences - sometimes referred to as rebound effects - are accounted for, the benefit of switching to a vegan diet looks more inconsequential still.

Giving up meat versus giving up flying 

These hard truths about carbon savings made possible by different individual actions makes a nonsense out of the frequently heard claim that eating a plant-based diet is ""the most important contribution every individual can make to reversing global warming"".

For someone who regularly flies, forgoing just one transatlantic flight that they would otherwise have taken would make a far bigger contribution. (The data in Sarah Bridle's Food and Climate Change: Without the Hot Air makes this abundantly clear: the emissions from a single transatlantic flight are 50 per cent more than those from an entire year's worth of food consumed by the average individual.)

For someone who drives a car, ditching the car or driving it less often also constitutes an important contribution. Do both of these things and you could wipe 6.9 tonnes of carbon off your total footprint.

The comparison between the amount of CO2 saved by giving up all animal foods as compared to that saved by forgoing a single flight makes a mockery of publicity stunts such as that of Richard Branson, CEO of Virgin Airlines, who declared that beef would no longer be served on Virgin flights. Let's look at the carbon costs of a serving of beef (say, 112 grams). Estimates range from -0.4kg (for grass-fed, regeneratively produced beef) to 11kg of CO2e.

Even if we take the highest estimate, the CO2 cost of a serving of beef is utterly dwarfed by the per-person CO2 cost of the flight (1.6 tonnes, or 1,600kg, for a one-way flight). Equally specious is the concept of the Hollywood elite demonstrating their commitment to combating climate change by taking meat off the menu at the Golden Globes while travelling to the awards ceremony by private jet.

New Zealand's farmers unite to dismantle Jacinda Ardern's climate policies

Labour's draconian plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions could cost party the next election

Farmers angered by New Zealand's environmental policies have united behind Right-wing parties promising to roll them back if they win power in this weekend's elections.

Some rural voters backed Jacinda Ardern in 2020, with the Labour Party - now led by Chris Hipkins - introducing policies including planting pine forests on grazing land and demanding farmers pay a levy on the methane excreted by their livestock.

Now, however, farmers are among the fiercest critics of Labour's reign, and are all but unanimous in their wish to unseat the party.

They are not alone in their desire for change. Polls and pundits indicate a coalition will be formed between the centre-right National the libertarian ACT and populist New Zealand First parties. National is currently polling ahead of Labour, but does not have enough support to govern alone.

When the Telegraph asked six farmers in the South Island market town of Geraldine for their thoughts on the incumbent government's chances, four used the phrase ""we've got to get rid of them"". The others used stronger language to express the same sentiment.

Green policies intended to enhance New Zealand's natural environment and reduce carbon emissions have made farming harder and more expensive, and morale is low in an industry once celebrated as the backbone of the country's export-led economy.

It still is very important to the economy - a fact farmers accuse Wellington of failing to appreciate. Dairy exports alone are worth more than twice as much as New Zealand's tourism industry - on a par with the value of its shipments of red meat.

Andrew Hoggard is a dairy farmer in the North Island's Manawatu region whose frustration with the government recently propelled him into the political arena.

He announced he would run as an MP for ACT - which has ""standing up for rural New Zealand"" as a tenet of its campaign - when his tenure as president of Federated Farmers, a leading advocacy group, ended earlier this year.

""I guess if the country had been moving in the right direction and everything was hunky dory, I might have just said, ""˜Sweet, I'm going back to the farm',"" Mr Hoggard said.

One of the first things Ms Ardern's Labour government did during its second term was to introduce a draconian set of rules intended to protect New Zealand's waterways from agricultural run-off.

""[The policy was] just completely unworkable and caused a hell of a lot of angst before the government eventually realised it had stuffed up,"" said Mr Hoggard.

Some of the more extreme new rules were scrapped, including one requiring that hoofprints must never sink deeper than 8in in paddocks and another setting fixed dates for sowing crops - irrespective of the weather.

But what remains is a situation Mr Hoggard said ""still has us in a state of paralysis"".

National and ACT have vowed to remove a lot of the red tape currently stifling farmers.

Labour maintains that New Zealand's agricultural sector needs to keep ahead of the sustainability curve to be competitive in a global market that places increasing importance on provenance.

""I think it's important for New Zealand farmers to improve and evolve in ways that benefit the environment, but costly regulations and taxation is not the way to achieve that,"" said Mr Hoggard.

A major regulatory bugbear is Labour's so-called ""fart tax"". This world-first scheme, intended to start in 2025, would tax methane emissions from livestock, which make up about a quarter of New Zealand's greenhouse gases.

Farmers have described the scheme as unreasonably punitive, pointing out that New Zealand produces a tiny fraction of global emissions - 0.09 percent, the same as Ireland.

They also point to research that shows New Zealand's milk and red meat production already emits less greenhouse gas per unit than most other agri-exporters, and that the levy would increase farmers' costs, making them less competitive in the global market.

Notably, National and ACT have not ruled out their own fart tax. National has said it would delay introducing one until 2030, but also end New Zealand's long-maintained ban on genetic editing - which studies show can dramatically reduce the amount of methane released by cattle.

""If farmers in countries who are our biggest trading partners are not paying a price for their methane emissions, neither should New Zealand farmers,"" the party's leader, David Seymour, said earlier this year.

ACT's small government stance has won over sheep and beef farmer James Patterson, who farms in the South Island's high country, near Queenstown.

""Labour are effing pathetic and National wouldn't be much better - they're too busy trying to be all things to everyone,"" he told the Telegraph. He described ACT's policies as ""the least wishy-washy"".

Patterson believes that farmers are the best custodians of the land because their relationship with it is symbiotic. He said this was evident when comparing government-managed farming areas of the high country which are ridden with noxious weeds like gorse, broome, and wilding pines.

By contrast, high country tended by farmers and grazed by their merino sheep - a breed uniquely suited to this harsh landscape and prized for producing the finest wool in the world - tends to be in better shape.

Last year, Labour passed a law imposing tight restrictions on how farmers manage this land.

""˜End of high country farming'

The move was dubbed ""the end of high country farming"" by local media. Both National and ACT have pledged to repeal the law if they form the next government.

Dayna Rowe, a 25-year-old dairy farmer who manages her parents' Bay of Plenty property, described the uncertainties surrounding the industry

""My grandfather was a dairy farmer, my parents are dairy farmers, and I have this really cool opportunity to be one too and it should be really exciting,"" she told the Telegraph. ""But it's super scary. You're kind of having those conversations of, ""˜don't put all your eggs in this basket for a secure future'.""

Ms Rowe acknowledged New Zealand agriculture could be more environmentally friendly - ""just like literally any industry"". But said it felt like farmers were being unfairly targeted by the current government.

""I think anyone that claims that a farmer isn't pro the environment is crazy. That's our bread and butter. If we have c""” land, we can't do our job properly, right? We're really passionate about our animals and our environment.""

Ms Rowe thought a National-ACT coalition would be a good result for her industry when the country goes to the polls on Saturday.

Mr Hoggard said it would be good for New Zealand, which entered its first recession in a decade in June.

""Agriculture is a very important part of our economy,"" he said. ""But farmers need to have the confidence to carry on farming, to continue investing in the land - which is something they're really questioning the point of at the moment.""

It's time cat owners took responsibility for their bird-killing pets

If we gave dogs carte blanche to do what came naturally it would be sheer lunacy and end in disaster, so why are cats given free rein?

Right, I'm tired of pussyfooting around. Why can't cat owners behave more responsibly? A few days ago, I found a mangled little blue tit corpse in the flower bed. Not for the first time. Or the last. And I can say with absolute certainty whodunnit. 

Cats are killers, they are laying waste to our wildlife - and the most shameful part is that their owners let them. If dogs behaved the same way, slaughtering native mammals and birds by the million, there would be absolute outrage. And quite rightly so.

Yes, a dog can do far more damage to humans - and it is only right and proper that certain strains have been or are about to be banned - but rest assured to a wren or a mistle thrush, your timid tabby is as aggressive and lethal as any XL bully. 

If you're a cat lover, feeling under attack, and think I'm exaggerating mark this; a study published in April last year estimated that UK cats kill between 160 and 270 million small animals annually; a quarter of them birds. 

The real number is likely to be even higher; the study was based on the pre-pandemic pet cat population of 9.5 million. That figure is now closer to 12 million.

But while dog owners are expected to be responsible for their animals and rein in their natural tendencies; too many cat owners take a perverse pride in abdicating all responsibility for their pet's behaviour on the grounds they are doing what comes naturally.

Maybe so, but if we just gave dogs - or for that matter people - carte blanche to do what came naturally it would be sheer lunacy and end in disaster. But as the well worn slogan goes; dogs have owners, cats have staff.

I don't dislike cats, not at all. I've given houseroom and heartroom to many of them down the years. But I feel furious their ""caregivers"" don't so much as attempt to curtail their soft-pawed bloodlust. 

These cossetted cats don't hunt because they're hungry, they hunt because they are hardwired to do so and their irrationally besotted humans let them. Why?

To explain my righteous fury; this week I received my annual email from the RSPB flagging up the Big Garden Birdwatch 2024, which is due to take place in January. And my heart sank.

A few short years ago, I would already be sharpening my pencil and polishing my binoculars, brimming with the unique excitement that kitchen window birdwatching brings. I know many Telegraph readers will understand the sense of joy and, yes, tremendous pride that of all the suet-filled feeders in the neighbourhood, those blue tits have chosen to squabble over yours. 

Not just on birdwatch day, but any time. One of the few highlights of lockdown was the opportunity to pause and take tremendous pleasure from the comings and goings of garden birds, fluttering to and fro with the freedom we no longer enjoyed.

So why is this year any different? It is different because a new influx of cats have caused such carnage there are no longer any birds in my garden - in too many of our gardens. 

Back in 2022, there had been endless rain in north London, which discourages birds from venturing out. On the day itself, it reduced to a drizzle and the birds flocked to feed; a frenzy of bright goldfinches illuminated the niger seed feeder and long-tailed tits argued over the sunflower hearts. Parakeets - those incongruous aviary escapees that have gone forth and multiplied (very noisily) in pockets of the South East - made an appearance, along with blackbirds feasting on the crumbs below.

But last spring, after two kittens were brought into the neighbourhood, I noticed a change. The feisty male dunnock who took exception to his own reflection in the bifold doors and pecked at the glass, disappeared. The woodpecker no longer made his cameo appearance every few days. The tree sparrows fell silent. 

On birdwatch day there was just a blackbird and a wood pigeon in the garden. I sent out a light hearted message on the local WhatsApp, demanding to know who was stockpiling the birds - the replies came thick and fast. Nobody understood where they had gone.

This year has been no better. I've spotted the pair of jays but not recently. Even the pigeons are steering clear. At the weekend I watched helplessly as a long-haired cat made its way up the plane tree - and hunkered down outside the mouth of the squirrels' dray. I'm no softie but I left the room.

According to the Songbird Survival charity, songbird populations have crashed in the last 50 years, with more than half of Britain's songbirds threatened or in decline. It has quite a few sensible recommendations, rooted in scientific research, that will help reduce the prey drive of pet cats.

Playing with your cat for 15 to 20 minutes a day will reduce the number of tiny dead things by 25 per cent. Feeding your cat a meat-rich food, cuts the prey figure by 36 per cent - and fitting the animal with a brightly coloured collar reduces bird capture by over 40 per cent. 

Yet I rarely see a cat wearing a collar, on the grounds ""it might get caught on a branch"" even though collars are famously elasticated and cats even more famously agile enough to extricate themselves.

These days you can also buy safety collars that instantly snap open if tugged with sufficient force. But I can't remember the last time I saw a cat wearing any sort of collar; a straw poll of friends reveals they had no idea such things existed - maybe because they don't care enough to find out.

Ideally cats should be kept indoors from dawn to dusk but that rarely happens as cat lovers construe it as a gross infringement of their feline rights. Plus cats can get very vocal if thwarted. They want to prowl about, fine. But it's inhumane not to give their feathery prey a fighting chance to escape.

Anyone who considers themselves an animal lover should love all animals. So please, if you know someone with a cat buy them a safety release cat collar this Christmas. Britain's songbirds will thank you.

Pets ""˜should go vegan' to cut greenhouse gas emissions

Cutting production of meat-based dog food could help planet, finds study that was partly funded by firm that makes meat-free pet food

Pets should be fed vegan diets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the meat industry, a study has suggested.

The production of meat-based dog food generates more greenhouse gases than the UK's total output, while emissions from cat food are on a par with the amount created by Israel, according to scientists from Griffith University in Australia.

Globally, nearly 10 per cent of livestock consumption goes into pet food, contributing emissions from methane, as well as water use and deforestation, researchers said.

""This study shows environmental benefits when vegan diets are used to feed not just people, but dogs and cats as well,"" said Andrew Knight, the study author. 

""However, to safeguard health, it's important that people feed only vegan pet food labeled as nutritionally complete, produced by reputable companies with good standards.""

The research was funded by the Food System Research Fund, a non-profit organisation dedicated to eliminating animals from the global food system, and Wild Earth, a company which makes vegan pet food.

The majority of pet food sold in the UK is made from byproducts from meat production, although it is fit for human consumption, according to the British Veterinary Association (BVA).

Whether or not eliminating pet food from the supply chain would have a direct impact on livestock numbers would depend on a number of factors. This includes the value of pet food sales to livestock producers, and whether there are other markets for the by-product.

""˜Increasing interest' in vegan diets

There have been several studies in recent years on the impact of vegan diets on dogs and cats, although none on a major scale.

While dogs are omnivores, cats are obligate carnivores, as meat provides them with the essential nutrient taurine, which they do not naturally produce.

In recent years taurine supplements have been developed, and vegan pet food is sold with taurine as an ingredient.

A recent study also led by Mr Knight, based on a survey of 1,369 cat owners, found around 9 per cent fed their pets a meat-free diet.

Owners reported better health outcomes for cats on vegan diets, although all but one of the differences found were not considered to be statistically significant.

Mr Knight said it would be desirable to have large-scale studies into the potential benefits, including with bloodwork analysis and veterinary clinical examination results, but added not enough funding had been made available yet.

The BVA has recently said it would review the role of vegan diets in pet health, after previously advising against them.

""There is increasing interest amongst pet owners around alternative diets for pets and whilst there is a lot of ongoing research into the impacts of vegan diets in particular, there has been a lack of robust data mapping the health consequences of this diet over time,"" Justine Shotton from the BVA said. 

""In light of ongoing research, the British Veterinary Association recently convened a companion animal feeding working group which will inform our recommendations going forward.

""In the meantime, owners should speak to their vet if they are considering changing their pet's diet.""

The study was published in the journal PLOS ONE.

Meat may be to blame for one in 14 urinary tract infections

Study suggests E.coli found in raw meat can reach the urogenital tract after ingestion, with livestock vaccination one possible solution

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) may be driven by E.coli from eating meat, and people should take extra care when handling and preparing food, scientists have warned.

A new study from George Washington University suggests that around one in 14 UTIs may be triggered by bacteria from meat, which can live in the gut before ending up in the urinary tract.

Researchers collected samples of E.coli infections from hospitals in Arizona and found that around 8 per cent were foodborne animal strains such as those found in chicken, turkey and pork.

Around 85 per cent of UTIs are caused by E.coli, and the research suggests that a significant number of those may be caused by meat consumption.

Although it was known that eating uncooked meat or accidentally ingesting bacteria could lead to a stomach upset, it was not known that the bacteria could remain in the gut and cause problems later on.

People may also accidentally transfer the bug if they do not wash their hands properly after handling meat, the experts warned.

""˜Particularly poultry'

""On an individual level, I would say that anyone already prone to UTIs should take extra care when handling raw meat, particularly poultry,"" said Lance Price, professor of environmental and occupational health at George Washington University.

""If people handle raw meat products and don't wash sufficiently - which can be difficult - then the E.coli could be introduced directly into the urogenital tract.""

Some strains of E.coli are typically found in the human bowel and are usually harmless but can sometimes get transferred to the urinary tract, leading to painful bladder infections.

Some UTIs also can lead to more serious kidney infections; symptoms include fever, chills, back pain, nausea or vomiting and life-threatening blood infections.

There is also emerging evidence to suggest that UTIs can lead to temporary confusion, and may be a significant cause of falls in elderly people.

Women are more at risk because their pelvic anatomy makes it easier for bacteria to travel to the urinary tract after being expelled from the body.

""˜Vehicle for human exposure'

Writing in the journal One Health, the researchers concluded: ""Meat may be an important vehicle for human exposure to extraintestinal pathogenic E.coli strains from food animals.

""Approximately 8 per cent of the clinical E.coli isolates in our population appeared to be foodborne zoonotic strains.""

The experts said that vaccinating animals against six of the most dangerous strains of E.coli would be one way to ensure that they do not enter the food supply.

""On a population scale, food animal producers could investigate ways to eliminate the riskiest strains of E.coli from their animals through vaccination programmes,"" added Prof Price.

""It would be a win-win for producers and public health, since some of the strains that pose the greatest threat to people also cause problems in animals.

Stomp on your lawn like a buffalo to attract animals, says rewilding champion

Isabella Tree tells nature lovers to ""˜think like a beaver', use pony spit and abandon ""˜artificial' methods of cultivating wildlife

Forget bird feeders and hedgehog boxes - to have a nature-friendly garden you should trample the lawn like a water buffalo and cover your rose bushes in pony spit.

Isabella Tree, the rewilding champion, has urged people to stop using ""artificial"" means to attract wildlife to a suburban garden, and instead mimic the behaviour of real animals.

Throwing wood into your pond to recreate a beaver's habitat is another tip from Ms Tree, who owns the 3,500-acre ""wild estate"" of Knepp in West Sussex.

""Garden centres will sell you bird boxes, bat boxes, bird feeding tables, hedgehog boxes - all the paraphernalia that is manufactured to get creatures back into your gardens. I really would say: why would you actually do that?"" Ms Tree told her audience at the annual Hay Festival.

""The natural habitat for birds is thorny protection. It's berries, it's seeds. If you're having to put up bird boxes in your gardens, it's probably because you haven't got enough natural habitat. So instead of having a picket fence between you and your neighbour, establish a lovely, thick, native species hedge. Instead of tidying up at the end of the summer, leave seed heads for the birds for the winter.

""Most nature-friendly ponds are quite anodyne and probably have the same depth of water, with grass all the way up to them. So if you wanted to rewild your garden, you would think like a beaver - throw in some branches of wood and let that rot down for the algae, that will feed the tiny fish that will kick-start the life cycle of species in your pond.

""You would think perhaps like a water buffalo or a cow, and you would trample around the edges, creating puddles and pools where amphibians would spawn. It's just thinking differently.""

Ms Tree told the crowd of an unusual but natural way to get rose bushes to flourish.

""What are you doing when you're pruning the rose bush in your garden with secateurs? You're being a proxy for a deer or a pony. If you prune your rose bush, it thinks it's under attack from a herbivore so it throws out more flowers.

""A study has shown that if you collect some animal saliva, even if it's pony spit or something, and anoint the little bit that you cut with your secateurs, the plant can read the enzyme in the spit and it goes even crazier.""

Also at Hay was Adam Frost, the Gardeners' World presenter, who advised gardeners to ""just back off"" at certain times of year and let nature take its course.

""As gardeners, we are a little bit too tidy,"" he said, adding that people should not fall for pictures of perfectly-tended gardens in magazines or on television programmes.

""Every time you see a beautiful garden in a magazine, that garden has crap bits. They just don't photograph the crap bits,"" he said.

""˜I think it's absurd'

Ms Tree was being interviewed by Ben Goldsmith, who expressed his frustration that Britain refuses to allow the reintroduction of wolves.

""What's with this British exceptionalism that we are somehow too grand and too civilised to rewild?"" he asked.

There are 22,000 wolves in Europe, he said. ""I think it's absurd, this idea that wolves can be trotting around the outskirts of Brussels or Amsterdam, or just across the water in Normandy - in suburban Normandy you can hear wolves howling from the woods - it's absurd that we can't have wildlife like that. And I think it's inevitable that we'll get back lynx and, eventually, wolves.""

Mr Goldsmith insisted that many farmers would welcome wolves, and said we should learn to live with the effect that reintroduction could have on livestock.

""One pack of wolves in Spain was observed to kill 50 deer and 50 wild boar in a single year. So those farmers are delighted with the return of wolves.

""Yes, they pose difficulties for some kinds of farming, specifically sheep farming""¦ but all wildlife is difficult. All my chickens got killed last year by a fox. Do I want foxes eradicated?

""Would we get permission to reintroduce foxes if they were extinct in Britain? I doubt it.""

Vegan meat substitutes are often high in salt and highly processed, warns UN

Despite health concerns, the global body still urges governments to consider providing more support for plant-based alternatives

Plant-based alternative meat products are often highly processed and have too much salt, the UN has said while still urging governments to consider providing more support to the industry.

Vegan substitutes can contribute to significantly reducing the carbon footprint of meat and dairy, especially in richer countries, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said.

Animal products account for between 14.5 and 20 per cent of global emissions, from direct methane emissions, feed, changes in land use and energy-intensive global supply chains.

The UN looked at several different alternatives, including lab-grown meat and fermentation-derived products.

Plant-based products, such as those made from soy or pea protein, are among the most popular alternative meat products, often marketed as sausages or burgers.

But the UN cautioned that these products ""currently tend to be highly processed and have high amounts of salt"".

It added that the evidence of health impacts from lab-grown meat or fermentation-based products was also limited.

Lab-grown meat is also highly energy intensive, with a study earlier this year finding it could be 25 times more costly for the environment than beef.

It is currently only approved for sale in the US and Singapore, although the UK has said it will fast-track approval after an Israeli company applied to the Food Standards Agency.

A mass shift away from meat and dairy and towards vegan alternatives could also ""threaten a range of existing jobs"", the UN said.

But it said meat-free options ""can likely play a role in supporting a more sustainable, healthier and more humane food system"".

Inger Andersen, executive director of UNEP, said more government support could ""help unlock the potential of these new technologies for some countries"".

Global meat consumption is expected to increase by 50 per cent by 2050, adding to deforestation pressure in areas such as the Amazon.

Expanding consumer choice

""New food alternatives will offer a broader spectrum of consumer choices,"" said Ms Andersen.

""Further, such alternatives can also lessen the pressures on agricultural lands and reduce emissions, thereby helping us address the triple planetary crisis - the crisis of climate change, the crisis of biodiversity and nature loss, the crisis of pollution and waste - as well as address the health and environmental consequences of the animal agriculture industry.""

The Government has said it wants the UK to be at the front of the alternative proteins sector, and is providing £12 million backing for a project at the University of Bath to develop the technology.

But it has been accused of relying too heavily on alternative proteins as a solution to food emissions, which experts say must include a reduction in meat consumption.

The authors of the UN report said it was crucial to understand the implications for food security and the livelihoods of farmers in backing alternatives to meat.

Last month, Italian MPs backed a law banning the production and sale of cultivated meat, in what their government said was a defence of the country's tradition.

Junk food clampdown would be 'incredibly popular', says Henry Dimbleby

Former tsar accuses the Tories of 'insane' inaction against the problem and says it was wrong to think there would be a backlash

Red Wall voters are crying out for restrictions to ""protect them"" from junk food, the Government's former food tsar has said.

Henry Dimbleby, who has just resigned as a government adviser, accused the Tories of ""insane"" inaction against obesity and suggested ministers were wrong to assume that nanny state measures would provoke a backlash.

In an interview with the Telegraph, Mr Dimbleby said polling conducted while officials were drawing up a national food strategy found strong support for a slew of restrictions, especially on junk food promotion.

Ministers have repeatedly delayed a proposed ban on such adverts before 9pm on TV and online, along with a ban on buy-one-get-one free deals.

Mr Dimbleby was appointed by the Government to carry out a review of England's food system which called for an expansion of sugar taxes, to cover foods as well as drinks, and the introduction of a salt tax.

Both calls were dismissed in summer 2022 when ministers published a watered-down strategy.

Parents keen to see action for children

Mr Dimbleby, son of broadcaster David and co-founder of restaurant chain Leon, said ministers' views were out of kilter with the public, particularly of those in Red Wall seats which have traditionally voted Labour.

He said parents were especially keen to see action to prevent obesity in children.  

""People are actually slightly fed up with their children being marketed junk food. Advertising restrictions are very popular. So while on Twitter you get a small number of quite loud, free marketeers, actually people in general - and in those Red Wall seats in particular - like rules, and they like rules that protect them. 

""They are quite happy for the Government to restrict the way in which junk food is marketed at them,"" he said.

He said the polling was also ""significantly positive"" about sugar and salt taxes, suggesting that ministers were ""wrong"" to think it would have cost them at the ballot box.

""We thought it was definitely a doable policy that you would you be able to get over the line without making it electoral so I think they're wrong about that ""¦ I think they've read it wrong,"" he said .

Mr Dimbleby said there was one area where the public was fiercely opposed to any attempt to change; anything that threatened the great British sausage.

""With any recommendations we were considering we would do focus groups, followed by quantitative research. The one that was fascinating was meat.

""Politicians will absolutely not say ""˜you need to reduce the amount of meat you need to eat'. And for electoral reasons they are absolutely right to do that, regardless of whether you think they should be brave. 

""It is a minefield; you bring it up in these focus groups and all hell breaks loose,"" said Mr Dimbleby, who also said his concern was that such taxes were ""regressive"" and hit the poor hardest.

He said ministers were alive to the public mood on this.

His new book Ravenous, quotes a No 10 official, asked about the potential for a meat tax, saying: ""We will not be imposing a meat tax on the great British banger or anything else.""

Mr Dimbleby, 52, was the lead non-executive director at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs until he left last week. he said he needed to be free to speak openly about its policies.

'These policies are incredibly popular'

He said an ""ultra-free market ideology"" was fuelling record rates of obesity, with two in three adults now overweight or obese.

Mr Dimbleby said ministers were ""terrified of p------g off voters"".

""Actually they are wrong on this, these policies are incredibly popular, but you have to have skill to frame within your party to get it over the line,"" he said, suggesting Sajid Javid - who resigned in summer 2022 - was the last health secretary to ""get it"" and be prepared to act.

He had planned a paper on health disparities while in post which was then ditched.

Mr Dimbleby said he was concerned that ministers would be prepared to roll out weight-loss drugs to millions of Britons rather than take action to prevent obesity.

Earlier this month, NHS watchdogs backed Wegovy, a new drug to regulate the body's appetite, for tens of thousands of obese people with other health problems.

But health officials hope to go much further, with drug companies to be encouraged into a bidding war to drive down prices, so that NHS treatment can be offered to far more of the 12 million adults classed as obese.

Mr Dimbleby said: ""Medicating millions of people isn't something that should be taken lightly. Clearly these drugs can help people, but to work they likely have to be taken for life and we really don't know about long-term consequences.

""To decide to medicate a significant portion of your population, rather than deal with the actual problem. strikes me as storing up problems for the future.""

The hidden health hazards of vegan sausages

These meatless subsitutes contain a litany of highly processed ingredients - and supermarket sales are falling

A quick trawl through the vegan-sausage options in the supermarket shows up an unappetising smorgasbord of ingredients, none of which you would find in your cupboard at home - or is particularly good for our health: methylcellulose (a stabiliser), calcium alginate (a ""gelling agent""), sodium sulphite, pea protein isolate and something called ""functional binder"". Mmm, yum.

Then there are the oils, such as palm oil - currently in the dock for causing wildlife habitat destruction - among others, which will have been heavily processed to make them bland enough for the product. Is the meat-free option no longer to our palate?

A British sausage maker has had to axe almost its entire range of vegan products, after admitting last week that demand had plummeted. Heck, based in Yorkshire, said it had cut the size of its vegan range from around 15 products to just two as shoppers' interest had waned.

Sales of meat-free products fell by £37.3""‰million in the supermarkets over the year to September 2022, according to figures from NielsenIQ published in trade magazine The Grocer, while the number of meat alternative lines stocked by the ""big five"" supermarkets fell by 10.9 per cent over the six months to March 20.

With the meat-free market worth over £570""‰million in 2022, that's just a 6.5 per cent drop - hardly falling off a cliff. But it's a reversal in an area that has up until now seemed unstoppable - a plant-based gravy train for producers.

From 2014 to 2019, sales of meat-free alternatives rose 40 per cent. In 2020, we picked up 25 million tons of vegan meat alternatives from the chiller cabinet - up 70 per cent from 2018. It could be that we are getting more particular about what we eat. While vegan alternatives may benefit the planet (although not lab-grown meat, as recent analysis suggests it could have a carbon footprint up to 25 times that of conventional meat), they aren't necessarily good for our health.

Vegan sausages contain a litany of highly processed ingredients. For the body of the sausage, pea protein is the main ingredient - the jury is still out on how processed this is compared to the other ingredients, because you can make something similar at home with flour and water.

Linda McCartney's vegetarian sausages have a higher percentage of textured soy protein, while in Quorn sausages, it is mycoprotein, a yeast-like mass grown industrially in vats.

All of these additives and oils are deemed safe, but they are also ingredients that plant the bangers firmly in the ""˜ultra-processed food' category - the kind of food that is increasingly being blamed for causing obesity and ill health. So why are they used?

As Dr Chris van Tulleken sums it up in his new book Ultra Processed People, they are usually there ""to replace the ingredients of a traditional and much-loved food with cheaper alternatives and additives that extend shelf life, facilitate centralised distribution and, it turns out, drive excess consumption."" Be wary of health claims touted on the packets, too.

Of course, ""real"" meat sausages aren't healthy - with few exceptions, they contain processed meat, defined as ""meat that has been transformed through salting, curing, fermentation, smoking or other processes to enhance flavour or improve preservation"" by the World Health Organisation. Processed meat has been designated as a Group 1 carcinogen by the WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer.

It's not just the colorectal cancer risk from processed meat that is an issue with sausages. There's the salt levels: a couple of bangers can easily contain 2g salt - a third of your daily limit. Then there's the saturated fat - 7g perhaps in the same serving, which is nearly a quarter of your daily allowance. Not a disaster, but a hefty chunk. Add in buttery mashed potatoes and you could easily double that. Vegan versions vary wildly, with some carrying similar levels of salt and saturated fat to the meat versions, some less.

I've long been an advocate for vegan junk food. According to research published in the medical journal The Lancet, by 2050 we need to reduce our meat consumption to 300g a week for the sake of the planet. Then there are ethical concerns: it seems mad that an animal should be reared and slaughtered for a service station sausage or a rubbery hot dog, both of which can be replicated impressively by modern plant-based technology. And sure, they aren't healthy, but neither are the meaty alternatives. If people want to eat them, why not eat the mock-meat versions?

We need, however, to tread carefully. According to van Tulleken, ultra processed food ""damages the planet"". He says: ""The food system necessary for its production, and of which it is the necessary product, is the leading cause of declining biodiversity and the second largest contributor to global emissions.""

Nonetheless, I suspect vegan sausages are here to stay. But if you want to stick to a proper pork banger, it's no less good for you - just choose the one with the shortest ingredients list, made with the best meat you can afford. There's no fairy godmother to wave her wand and make them a healthy choice, but a little of what you fancy? Why not?

Do you eat vegan sausages? Please join the discussion in the comments below.

Seven ways the Dutch are getting it right when it comes to raising healthy kids

With Dutch children growing taller and coming out higher on happiness baromoters than their British peers, we look into the reasons why

Toast with chocolate sprinkles: this is what children in the Netherlands eat for breakfast and what British parents might do well to start serving given the recent news that the average Dutch five-year-old is 2.75in taller than the equivalent Brit. The data, collated by the Non-Communicable Diseases Risk Factor Collaboration, shows British youngsters are dropping down the height charts, with boys and girls aged five ranking 69th out of 200 nationalities in 1985, while in 2019 British boys were 102nd and girls 96th - supporting an earlier study suggesting that UK teenagers are not growing at the same rate as those in other countries.

Shona Goudie of the Food Foundation, a charity striving to improve Britain's food system, blames overindulgence in cheap junk foods and processed snacks for our children's diminishing stature - and also their expanding waistlines. Toddlers in Britain have among the worst diets in the world, with mass-produced foods making up almost two-thirds of their average daily energy intake, and children are consuming up to three times the recommended intake of sugar, resulting in a childhood obesity rate of 20 per cent. ""Children are eating food that is high in calories and low in nutrients,"" Goudie explains. ""Other countries are proving that it's possible to do better - it's not just about our children's height, its about their long-term health.""

But toast with chocolate sprinkles? This is the kind of thing my children would go wild for but which I would write off as embarrassingly unhealthy. Yet hagelslag, as it is known in the Netherlands, symbolises a moderate approach not only to children's meals but to parenting in general that appears to be working. Dutch children and teens aren't just thriving in terms of height, they regularly come out top in happiness barometers, too. In a Unicef survey, children from the Netherlands were in the top five in every category assessed, from material wellbeing to education and environment, while UK children performed poorly in all areas. 

Meanwhile, Dutch babies have also been found to be happier and better adjusted than American babies, displaying less fear sadness and frustration, and laughing, smiling and cuddling more. ""Hearty meals and outdoorsiness are part of Dutch culture,"" explains Sanna Sumner, a Finnish nutritionist who is raising her children in Amsterdam. ""Children won't just have toast with chocolate sprinkles for breakfast, they'll also have a glass of milk, cheese, fruit and yoghurt - and then they'll get on their bike and cycle to school.""

Tracy Abraham, who married a Dutchman and raised her children in Amsterdam before moving back to Britain, agrees that the physicality of the Dutch lifestyle makes for happier, hungrier children who eat well at mealtimes. The weather is even more brutal than it is in Britain, she says, yet Dutch children cycle to school each day with their parents from the age of four (and from 11 on their own) and partake in after-school activities such as sailing and skating. They love fries as much as the next child, Sumner continues, and live off bread, cheese and chocolate milk, but they're not being served junk food at school - and there are no energy drinks or chocolate bars on the way home. Milk and fruit are provided free at school and parents provide substantial sandwiches for lunch and after-school snacks, along with extra vegetables and fruit.

""My children can expect a hunk of bread, a piece of cheese, some cherry tomatoes and chopped cucumber,"" Sumner says. ""They're hungry; they need something that will sustain them.""

If Sumner seems surprised that I'm interested in her children's eating habits, it's because diet simply isn't such a contentious subject in the Netherlands. This is partly because fruit, vegetables and dairy produce are cheaper and widely available, but it's also, she says, because Dutch parents feel more supported by the government and schools who understand the lure of energy drinks and junk food and take an active role in keeping children away from it. Parents thus are more relaxed about food and more focused on family and life balance. ""There's a big drive towards making time for yourself and for your family - we finish work earlier and young children don't have homework,"" Sumner says.

The family meal, adds Abraham, is a fundamental part of Dutch culture; parents encourage their children to be independent but regroup with them over a hearty early evening feed each day. ""My husband often says he wants our children to grow to be ""˜strong Dutch boys',"" she explains. ""There's a sense that you mustn't mollycoddle them; you need to let them get on with it. ""

If this all sounds like teaching Grandmother to suck eggs, that's fine: Dutch parents are direct about their views and happy to give out advice. ""We take offence so easily in Britain, but the Dutch aren't shy about saying it as it is,"" Abraham says. ""I'm forever asking my husband, is that rude or is that Dutch?""

7 ways the Dutch are getting parenting right

Snacks not treats

Sumner is horrified when I tell her that it's pretty normal in the UK for a child to have a chocolate bar or cookie after school. ""But that's a treat, not a snack,"" she says, sounding confused. In the Netherlands, liquorice and Haribo are popular treats, as are sugary cookies, pancakes and stroopwafels, but they are exactly that: treats. Snacks, meanwhile, are intended to be nourishing and filling: a glass of milk (or three), a sandwich, a piece of fruit or vegetables. ""Dutch children eat a lot of bread, cheese and milk, often in the form of chocolate milk,"" Abraham says. ""Even a grown man will take a carton of milk to work with them for extra protein.""

There's little or no parenting guilt

The adage that happy parents are better parents is ingrained in Dutch culture. It's seen as completely normal to keep up with your favourite hobbies once you're a parent, even if it means getting childcare at weekends. Maternity leave is short, Abraham explains - three months is pretty standard - but flexible working is encouraged when you return to work and no one will judge you for leaving your small baby at daycare or equally if you decide to be a stay-at-home mum - it's a question of whatever works for your family. ""When our first child was born, the message from my husband's boss was that family comes first from now on,"" Sumner says. ""Most people finish work at 5pm in time to pick their children up from daycare or after-school care at 5.30pm.""

Family meal times are non-negotiable

Dutch families tend to eat breakfast together around the table and enjoy an early dinner as a family around 6pm. ""Family meals are seen as a big step to promoting wellbeing,"" Sanna says. While children do enjoy hagelslag, sugary breakfast cereals aren't a thing in the Netherlands; instead they'll be offered a traditional continental breakfast of meats, cheeses, yoghurt, fruit and bread, and on the evening menu will be simple, hearty fare: meat or herring with mashed root vegetables, for example, washed down with another glass of milk. 

""Height is about the availability of good things,"" points out Prof Majid Ezzati from Imperial College London, the senior author of a previous study on global height rankings. ""Sufficient animal protein, dairy, milk, legumes and vegetables, which all help with growth.""

Schools aren't all about grades

The Netherlands is a high-achieving nation, ranking fourth in terms of start-up value creation in Europe, yet Dutch schools are not hot-houses. Pupils have less homework and shorter school days than British children and Sumner finds that teachers are less pushy than at international schools. Children start school age four, but there is no structured learning until age six, and Wednesday is a half day. ""In British schools there is so much stress about how your child performs, but here the teachers seem more relaxed,"" she says. ""It's all about play to begin with and then it's about what suits the individual. I'm always amazed how confident Dutch children are and how well they do at school; by a young age they'll be speaking near-perfect English.""

There's no sitting around

Dutch children are encouraged to be independent from a young age, which takes British expats a while to get used to, Abraham says. Before they start secondary school at age 11, they're required to pass a bike exam to ensure they're safe on the roads, and there's a national swimming programme for all children. After school, if they don't have a club or activity, they will head off to the playground with their friends or play a ball game on the street or in a park. They do this whatever the weather, returning home hungry and happy.

""As a result, they're on screens less than children in the UK,"" Abraham adds. ""There's simply less time to be sedentary.""

Parenting isn't just for parents

Schools and the government also take a share of the responsibility. A kraamzorg, funded by the government, will support parents for the first few days of their child's life, helping with feeding and weighing the baby, as well as cooking and cleaning, while the Dutch free milk scheme, funded through the EU Common Agricultural Policy, provides fruit, vegetables and milk to school children and is thought to be contributing to the strapping height of children. 

Meanwhile, schools are strict about what children eat, according to Sumner, banning children from bringing in ""unhealthy"" snacks such as croissants and juice. ""The government recommends each child drinks two to three glasses of milk each day, plus cheese for protein and calcium,"" Sumner says. ""They'll regularly invite nutritionists into schools to talk about healthy eating and dental care.""

It's OK to be streetwise

Dutch teens, like their parents, tend to be direct and outspoken - they're encouraged to speak their mind rather than hold back for the sake of politeness. They're also much more open about sex and other blush-inducing topics, as they have sex education from as early as age four. 

""British expats find the sex education parts of the science museum in Amsterdam too full-on when they first arrive,"" Abraham says. Yet teen pregnancy rates in the Netherlands are among the lowest in Europe and there is also less of a problem with binge drinking and drugs than there is in the UK.

The big breakfast myth - and why we get the first meal of the day all wrong

Experts suggest that many of our most cherished beliefs about breakfast are likely to be wrong

The hold that breakfast exerts on our national imagination is strange and powerful. We tend to be more entrenched in our beliefs about this meal than any other, both about its importance and about the merits and identity of constituent parts, and it is the medium for fierce debate about local traditions and ingredients.

The most celebrated - some would say notorious - expression of our national obsession, the Full English Breakfast, has become a totemic presence on hotel and restaurant menus: a fried form of the national identity, with red or brown sauce on the side.

But experts in diet, nutrition and the history of food suggest that many of our most cherished beliefs about breakfast are quite wrong, the result of a still-tumbling avalanche of marketing by mass manufacturers keen to have us consume their processed and often salt- and sugar-laden products. Much of what we think we know about the first meal of the day is mistaken, and there are questions that we should all be asking before we reach for those old familiar packets.

Does All-Bran really improve gut health? Is Rude Health muesli actually healthier? Do instant oats really give you all the benefits of oats in a quick and convenient microwaveable packet? Beliefs about breakfast cereals fuelled by the makers of breakfast cereals have, over time, become gospel. Indeed, our notion of breakfast in this country - of a quick, carb-based morning meal being a nutritional necessity - is largely the result of messaging by cereal ­manufacturers and the dairy industry, loosely supported by some questionable studies.

""Breakfast itself is a relatively new invention,"" says Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London and author of Spoon-Fed: Why Almost Everything We've Been Told About Food Is Wrong. ""There isn't much evidence that hunter-gatherer tribes ate breakfast. There isn't much evidence that people 500 years ago ate breakfast.

""There's been very little research into it. A lot of the science about eating early in the day is becoming shakier and shakier. It works for some people, and doesn't work for others.""

In short, what Spector has dubbed ""the breakfast myth"" is itself ""up for grabs"".

""It's one of the NHS's eight tips for healthy eating that we shouldn't skip it, but there's no data to support that,"" he continues. Indeed, subsequent meta-analysis of some of the studies behind those claims has suggested the reverse. Before blowing this breakfast myth open, however, a caveat: experimenting with skipping breakfast is not advisable if you are young, have struggled with eating disorders, or have any other special dietary requirements.

If that's not you, then strap in, because the modern tale of breakfast in Britain is a bizarre and often baffling one. According to food writer Felicity Cloake, who spent more than a year researching the past and present of the British breakfast for her book Red Sauce Brown Sauce: A British Breakfast Odyssey, ""Historically, breakfast wasn't really eaten until around the 17th century"" - which is when the wealthy started to designate ""breakfast rooms"" in their homes.

As the Industrial Revolution gathered pace, breakfast was embedded: labourers needed a meal to sustain them before work, and the habit caught on across all classes. Still, we didn't have set ideas around what we eat. ""Looking at Victorian recipes and menus, everything from mushroom curry to fried sole was fair game,"" says Cloake. ""The quintessential ""˜English' breakfast is basically a 20th-century creation.""

She notes that bacon and eggs were what the ""man of the house"" would have in poorer households, but quite why we decided that dish should be the true British breakfast remains a mystery. ""Many other countries lost their tradition of a heavy breakfast before work, so I wonder whether it was because it was unusual and set us apart from others on the continent. And because it's a widespread signature dish more than a regional speciality, it united the country.""

Either way, the fry-up was born and helped forge a peculiarly British attitude towards breakfast - even after its fall from grace in the 1960s, when the sugar industry paid scientists to play down the link between sugar and heart disease and instead demonise fat. Breakfast cereals and low-fat yoghurts rushed into the gap left by bacon, sausages and eggs, and we - under the considerable influence of clever advertising - transferred to these foods our rule-bound ideas about breakfast.

""We [in the West] are the only culture that has strict ideas about what we eat in the morning,"" says Spector. ""If you go to India, they have last night's curry for breakfast. In Japan and China, there's no real difference between breakfast and lunch food.""

Congee, grits, rice pudding, polenta - all are forms of porridge from around the world, and none of them is eaten solely at breakfast, says Cloake. Our national decision to designate it a breakfast food is singular and recent. In Scotland, and much of England, people have eaten porridge for centuries: ""In the 19th century, an MP for the Highlands references the fact that his constituents eat porridge three times a day.""

As the fields of dietetics and nutritional research have expanded in the past 50 years, so breakfast has become more complicated. Spector points out that when breakfast cereals debuted, ""we assumed they were healthy - mainly because of the marketing and publicity. There was little research on it, other than when we started to be concerned about the sugar content of cereals.""

Highly processed

Since then, they have become more of a bÃªte noire. The chief problem is the processing: the cooking, rolling, cutting, reconstituting, blending and puffing of the various grains you find in breakfast cereals raise their sugar content and reduce their natural fibre and nutritional value. ""These foods are so highly processed, there's not much structure that reaches the lower part of the gut, so sugars are released early into the bloodstream,"" says Spector.

And while the manufacturers add vitamins and minerals back in - in chemical form - there is no knowing whether they have opted for the cheapest possible supplements. ""The iron, for example, may not be absorbed at all. It may just pass straight through. In many ways, breakfast cereals are the equivalent of the supplements market: they make these huge claims on the packet, without providing any evidence that these things enter the bloodstream.""

He says the upshot is that we are fooled into eating what is effectively fake food, ""when you'd be better off having leftovers from last night's meal, or an egg, or a full-fat yoghurt"" - a low-fat diet being yet another food fad to have been blown open by more recent research. In 2017, McMaster University in Ontario, which studied 135,000 people in 18 countries over a decade, found that those who ate the least fats were a quarter more likely to die early - suggesting that what people replace meat and full-fat dairy products with could turn out to be more dangerous than the saturated fats themselves.

Given the enormous sway cereal brands have had over the British and American idea of a healthy breakfast, it seems reasonable that they are now being subjected to some scrutiny. Every year since 2019, the Food Foundation charity has conducted the Broken Plate report, documenting the health of our food system and the impact it has on our lives. Its latest report, released in 2022, concluded that most breakfast cereals fail to meet the green rating under the Government's front-of-pack nutritional labelling guidance for levels of sugar and saturated fat - and many remain red.

The health halo

According to nutritionist Katharine Jenner, director of Action on Sugar, the report shows that while cereal brands have made some steps to reduce sugar, salt and saturated fat, they have much further to travel. Imagery and labelling, for example, continue to be misleading. ""You can have an unhealthy cereal, spray on vitamin B or iron supplements, and make a vitamin B or iron claim,"" she notes - regardless of the quality of these nutrients or how easily your body can access them. ""We find if you put a health claim on food, it has a ""˜health halo' effect, which stops you scrutinising the nutrition panel and seeing what's really in the food and whether it relates to the product.""

Meanwhile, those cereals that are not necessarily healthy can trade off the reputations of foods that are. Sometimes this is explicit. ""Weetabix is a good cereal,"" says Jenner, ""but chuck some chocolate chips in it and it's high in sugar. Still, Weetabix Chocolate carries the ""˜health halo' of Weetabix."" See also Frosted Shreddies and Golden Syrup Quaker Oats.

More subtle are cereals that trade off the reputations of whole foods, when the amount of processing entailed in their production renders them practically unrecognisable: dried fruit pieces, which are invariably more refined sugar than anything else, imply all the benefits of fresh fruit; instant oats, which are partially cooked, then rolled even thinner to reduce their cooking time, carry the health halo of whole oats.

Recently, porridge has been going through a fashionable phase all of its own, at least among a certain stratum of the population. (""It's interesting that what was once a subsistence food is now quite a middle-class food,"" Cloake says wryly.) Yet there is a long and large difference between whole, steel-cut oats, and the pale imitations you find in packets of instant or even rolled oats.

Though popularly considered to be the king of cereals from a health point of view, porridge sent Spector's blood sugar soaring when he studied it himself. ""The instant oats resulted in a very big [blood glucose] peak; jumbo rolled oats slightly less; steel-cut oats resulted in only a very slight peak. That's all about processing. Steel-cut oats still have the core husk and fibre of the original product. Very few cereals have that.""

""The standard of the British carb breakfast leads some people to overeating without them knowing it,"" adds Spector, whose research - conducted through Zoe, the world's largest nutrition science study - has found many people experience a blood-sugar spike after such a breakfast, followed by a dip three hours later.

His belief - not one supported by Public Health England - is that ""many people don't need breakfast and would be better off without it. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 randomised trials of skipping breakfast concluded that those who skip it are no worse off than those who eat it, in terms of weight gain and metabolic rate,"" he says. ""It even suggested a slight reduction in weight in people who regularly skip it in favour of black coffee - which is healthy, containing fibre and polyphenols.""

The best thing we can do, in Spector's ­thoroughly researched and well-substantiated opinion, is work out what suits us as individuals, either through experimenting with eating different things at different times or through a personalised nutrition test, such as the Zoe app. Our metabolisms are highly individual: some people wake up starving and like to front-load; some prefer to breakfast later; some would rather run through to lunchtime on just a coffee. ""It's interesting how at the weekends many of us do that naturally, and wait until brunch.""

That said, our 9-to-5s are as unique as our metabolisms. Like me, Cloake prefers to breakfast about 11am - but because she works from home, she can control what she eats better than people working in hospitals, schools, factories and even many offices, which don't always have good options nearby. Registered dietitian Dr Frankie Phillips, spokeswoman for the British Dietetic Association, strongly recommends that such people should still eat before they leave home. ""You will get hungry at some point, and if you're at home you have more control, rather than relying on cafÃ©s or vending machines,"" she tells me. If you aren't hungry first thing, she suggests taking something along the lines of her homemade breakfast cereal recipe, which is included above.

Whether you are breakfasting at home, on the hoof or not until lunch, try to eat as diversely as possible. ""From a gut-health point of view, you want a diversity of plants,"" says Spector.

If you are a creature of habit who really needs the familiarity of your favourite cereal at breakfast, mix it up a bit, says Jenner. Add fresh fruit, seeds and nuts. Have it with yoghurt or kefir. ""Carbohydrates should be from wholegrains to give you energy and to protect your heart health, and fibre for gut health. Protein can make you feel fuller, as well as being important for growth and repair. Whole fruit and veget­ables are valuable sources of vitamins, minerals and fibre."" Breakfast, like any other meal, ""should be low in salt, sugar and saturated fat"".

This bodes well for the direction breakfast appears to be taking in the UK, which is bigger, better - and later. ""People are becoming much more open-minded about what to have for breakfast, and not just because they're hung­over,"" Cloake observes. ""The popularity of brunch has encouraged that."" A look at the menu of a favourite London brunch spot reveals breakfast ramen, pea fritter and shakshuka, as well as porridge and the usual egg and bacon-based staples - which it serves all day, not just until lunch.

""For the first time since Victorian times, we are broadening our horizons when it comes to breakfast,"" says Cloake. ""We've been conservative for 150 years, and now we're coming back to that.""

It's been a wild ride, but like all meals, breakfast boils down to the usual principles: eat a diverse range of whole foods, in moderation, when you're hungry - and limit your sugar.

The ideal breakfast

According to Dr Frankie Phillips, the ideal breakfast would combine unrefined wholegrains, a dairy or a fortified dairy alternative to provide calcium, some nuts, if you can, and some fruit. ""All of these elements give you a different range of nutrients,"" she says. An orange, or orange juice, provides vitamin C, which will help absorb the iron from the wholegrains - though if it's juice, be sure to get one without added sugars.

Steel-cut oats

Steel-cut oats are the best option as far as porridge - and, indeed, breakfast cereal - is concerned, because they are most closely related to the whole, unprocessed oat kernel, says Professor Tim Spector. They take longer to prepare - about 15-30 minutes - but retain all the nutrition of the original oat groat, and the cooking time is reduced if you soak them or cook them in a rice cooker or Aga overnight. Add chopped dried fruit, fruit compote and a sprinkle of nuts or seeds (or a dollop of sugar-free peanut butter), or enjoy a piece of fruit alongside.

Weetabix/Shredded Wheat

Both Katharine Jenner and Tim Spector agree that Weetabix and Shredded Wheat are good cereals - so long as you are buying the originals, not the pimped-up versions. They are made from about 89 to 95 per cent wholegrain wheat and are minimally processed. There is added sugar and salt, but the amount is very small compared with other cereals. The nutrients derived from Weetabix and Shredded Wheat largely come from the wheat itself, rather than supplements. As with porridge, add chopped dried fruit, fruit compote and a sprinkle of nuts or seeds (or a dollop of sugar-free peanut butter), or enjoy a piece of fruit alongside.

Poached eggs and spinach on sourdough toast

The cholesterol in egg yolk has led to eggs being demonised in the past, says Govindji - but dietary cholesterol has very little impact on your blood cholesterol, so you can enjoy these eggs with a clear conscience. Meanwhile, low glycaemic index (GI) foods can help to keep your blood-sugar levels steady - and sourdough bread has a lower GI then many other breads, even if it's white.

Smashed avocado and charred red peppers on rye bread

Avocado gives you good fats, and in this breakfast it has a double function, says dietitian Azmina Govindji, author of Vegan Savvy: The Expert's Guide to Nutrition on a Plant-based Diet. Vegetables such as red peppers contain beta carotene, which is converted into vitamin A in the body; however, you need some fats in order for your body to do this conversion efficiently - the fats in avocado are the perfect partner.

Your bowl of pasta may soon be a thing of the past

From food shortages to rising costs, there's much more going on in your dinner than you may realise

For most of us, pasta with tomato sauce is the reliable stalwart in our culinary arsenal. On any given night in Britain, there must be thousands of saucepans blipping away, splattering T-shirts and tiles with a rust red concoction destined for spaghetti, fusilli, a bag of animal shaped pasta to appease the three-year-old. No two saucepans will contain exactly the same combination of ingredients - one might feature a tin of Asda tomatoes, a little table salt, some garlic, while another will be simmering with tomatoes from an independent Italian supplier, the olive oil grassy and dark, the basil sweetly perfumed. But the result will not be worlds apart.

Yet, everything about this humble plate of food, from the wheat in the pasta, to the tinned or fresh tomatoes, to the olive oil, to how the ingredients get from source, to shop, to kitchen, to the gas used to cook it all, is at risk.

Right now, meals which use cheap, nutritious ingredients are the name of the game. So what does it say about the security of our food systems if we can't even rustle up a plate of pasta pomodoro without trawling the aisles for unavailable ingredients, baulking at the price at the till, or worrying about how much energy it might take to cook? Let's start with tomatoes. Last week, shelves have been bare of fresh tomatoes, with some supermarkets rationing them. Imports from Spain and Morocco (on which British supermarkets increasingly rely through the winter) stalled as bad weather led to poorer than predicted harvests in both countries.

The British Retail Consortium says it's likely to be four weeks until shortages end, shining a harsh light on how reliant we have become on imports. Last year, between October and December, 40 per cent of our tomatoes came from Morocco, up from 20 per cent pre-Brexit. Since leaving the EU, Britain has been forced to go further afield for imports as red tape has slowed the trade in fresh produce with Europe. We can't simply turn to our own produce - British tomatoes make up just 17 per cent of our supply these days, down to 68,000 tonnes a year in 2021 compared to 134,000 in 1990. When logistical problems collide with the impact of climate change, shortages are the inevitable (and increasingly common) outcome.

This year, in Britain's so-called ""salad bowl"", the Lea Valley, some greenhouses are lying empty. Growers are struggling to heat and light their crops amid an energy crisis sparked by the war in Ukraine, which shows no sign of abating. The British Tomato Growers Association reports many have delayed their season by three weeks to try to avoid huge heating bills. Meanwhile labour shortages are also having an impact. In December, Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers' Union, said the country's tomato and egg sectors (among others) were shrinking, calling for action to boost the number of overseas workers.

Every stage of production is more expensive for them with the price of packaging, fuel and fertiliser all up. The cost of synthetic fertiliser was already on the rise in 2021. By September 2022, the conflict in Ukraine had pushed it up further - the price of fertiliser was up 139 per cent compared to the previous year, with some manufacturers halting or reducing production in response to rising gas prices.

For chefs who need a regular supply, turning to canned tomatoes isn't necessarily the answer. Italian restaurateurs warned last week red pizzas could be dropped from menus as suppliers began rationing tinned tomatoes. If the price for fresh has increased (as much as fourfold in the past year, from £5 to £20 a case), the cost of canned tomatoes has gone up too, doubling from £15 a case to £30.

""It's absolutely skyrocketing,"" says James Chiavarini, owner of Il Portico in London. ""There's nothing you can do about it, you just have to ride it out. Whether it'll come down in the next 12-24 months is anybody's guess.""

Then there's pasta. Dried spaghetti, as well as the flour he uses for fresh tagliatelle, linguine and rigatoni, are more expensive too, says Chiavarini. ""The raw ingredients are extortionate.""

Wheat prices were already on the rise this time last year as food inflation crept up globally. In March 2022, the price of wheat soared by 19.7 per cent as grain supplies were disrupted by war. It meant any product that relied on wheat (from bread and pasta to chickens and eggs) were impacted. Now, even at the budget end of the scale the price of pasta has nearly doubled in two years: a standard 500g bag of value range supermarket pasta was 50p two years ago - now, according to BBC research, it's 95p.

Even those ingredients we produce domestically are at risk. Take eggs - a key ingredient in fresh pasta and one of the products we have long been self-sufficient in, yet shortages continue to plague our supermarkets as a combination of bird flu outbreaks and production costs.

Garlic was last spring's shortage, when the UK's supply was impeded by industrial action among hauliers in Spain, our chief source of garlic. The strike, inflation and soaring fuel prices, meant significant numbers of hauliers weren't operating.

There is really no part of a plate of tomato pasta that isn't in trouble. Last summer's drought had a devastating effect on olive oil production. Spain is the biggest exporter of olive oil and its growers were affected by the worst conditions they'd ever seen. By December, estimates showed the country's annual yield was likely to be about 50 per cent of the usual rate. The UK chief executive of Filippo Berio told The Grocer in December that Spain wouldn't even have enough to cover domestic needs and was turning to Greece and Tunisia. As production plummets, wholesale prices soar: the price of Italian extra virgin olive oil rose by 40.7 per cent between June and November last year to just over â‚¬6,000/kg.

A recent intergovernmental panel on climate change and biodiversity loss identified both as major contributing factors to food insecurity in the UK. Shortages, then, are likely to be par for the course whether politics and logistics get in the way or not.

""It's a polycrisis,"" says Prof Tim Lang, an expert in food policy at City University, who says political events and decisions are inextricably linked to the current crisis. ""We get at least a third of our food from Europe, we are drawn into the Ukraine-Russia war, our farmers are entirely dependent upon Russian gas to turn into fertiliser. The price has rocketed.""

In this country we've got used to food being inexpensive, says Prof Lang. Shortages like the current ones could be circumvented, he says, if supermarkets were prepared to ""pay more"". ""Brits have got used to wanting cheap food. The supermarkets have done what they were asked to do, the food manufacturers and the farmers have done what they were asked to do. [...] The French pay 50 per cent more for their food.""

Meanwhile, the ""stresses"" on our food system are ""coming more regularly and some would argue more often,"" he says. ""We really do need to think about what we eat, where we get it from and how it's made.""

Lang even suggests dishes like pasta pomodoro may have to become a ""seasonal"" meal. I'm all for seasonality, but with respect to Therese Coffey, turnip pasta doesn't have quite the same appeal. And I certainly can't imagine any dish being able to answer the question ""what's for dinner?"" quite so consistently as a reliable plate of pasta pomodoro.

Clarkson's Farm holds a mirror up to Can't-Do Britain

Baffling red tape and council decisions are indicative of a computer-says-no attitude holding us back

One of the many strengths of Clarkson's Farm, the second series of which is now being streamed on Amazon Prime, is the cast of characters who act as perfect foils to the controversial television host as he blunders from one agricultural mistake to the next muddy disaster. 

In the first series, Kaleb Cooper, the 24-year-old farmhand, provided the parochial competence to offset Jeremy Clarkson's worldly ineptitude; Gerald Cooper (no relation) is the totally unintelligible stonewalling ying to Clarkson's hyper-articulate yang. 

In the second series it is Charlie Ireland, the ultra competent land agent, who comes to the fore, acting as an unflappable Virgil to Clarkson's constantly flapping Dante as they both descend into the hell of farming red tape, subsidies and, in the middle of the ninth circle, planning applications. 

If Clarkson's main obstacle to managing Diddly Squat Farm in the first series was his own staggering inexperience and incompetence, in the second it is bureaucracy. 

The programme, which is busy breaking viewing records for Amazon, has already done more to highlight the parlous state of the country's farming industry than a thousand editorials, select committee meetings or National Farmers Union conferences ever could. A spoonful of self-deprecating buffoonery clearly helps the polemic go down. 

The timing has also been fortuitous. With the latest episodes airing just as the UK's supermarkets are hit by a shortage of tomatoes and cucumbers, it will help shoppers understand the daily struggles farmers go through to keep the nation fed.

Clarkson has had to deal with high energy and fertiliser costs, labour shortages, the uncertainty about whether the Government will replace European Union subsidies and new trade deals that potentially favour foreign farmers.

The programme also illustrates the uneasy trade-off between keeping the price of food down in a cost of living crisis and the importance of food security when global supply chains have become increasingly vulnerable to disruption. No wonder Clarkson is being feted by farmers up and down the country. 

Not content with that, the new season also highlights the Byzantine bureaucracy of the country's planning systems and the computer-says-no mentality of many local governments.

Clarkson's latest wheeze is to turn a lambing shed into a restaurant, which will serve beef from the cattle he has reared as well as the produce from neighbouring farms. This, one would have thought, is perfectly in keeping with the Government's drive to get farmers to diversify into other money-making activities. One would have failed to reckon with West Oxfordshire County Council.

Notwithstanding the obviously one-eyed slant given to the facts by the programme makers and Clarkson's preternatural gift for rubbing people up the wrong way, some of the council's decisions are utterly baffling. They turn down an application to build a car park for his farm shop, which would clearly alleviate some of the traffic on the road leading to the local village.

They even stop Clarkson building a track across his own land, which Ireland is forced to admit is a new one on him.

One of the most extraordinary aspects of the whole episode is the revelation that Clarkson's only means of appeal lies in Westminster. This means that a secretary of state would effectively be deciding the fate of a barn in Oxfordshire.

Not that it gets that far as, by the programme's estimate, an appeal would cost nearly half a million quid. If that's too much for the millionaire host of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, it's clearly beyond the reach of almost every other farmer in the country. The obvious conclusion is that planning decisions are effectively carved in stone and unimpeachable. 

This is a much bigger issue than one small restaurant in the Cotswolds; it's indicative of a can't-do attitude that is holding back the economy. 

No one needs telling that this country's property market has long been a total basket case. One recent revelation was that, despite British ambitions of becoming a science superpower, planning backlogs mean the UK is not building enough laboratories. 

There is an estimated demand for over 335,000 square feet of new lab space in Oxford and Cambridge every year. And yet we are only building about 150,000 sq ft. That's nearly 200,000 sq ft of unmet demand, leading to higher rents soaking up money that could otherwise be spent on research and development. 

Residential property is even more dysfunctional. On Monday, the house building industry warned that the number of new properties completed each year in England could slump to its lowest level since the Second World War. High property prices are obviously leading to issues of generational inequality, but large regional disparities, along with stamp duty, are also likely to be one of the reasons for the UK's dire productivity problems.

Those living in regions with low house prices find it next to impossible to move to regions with higher house prices, where there tend to be better paid jobs and higher levels of productivity. As Michael Saunders, the former Bank of England rate-setter, points out, this distortion of ""internal migration flow"" means many Brits are actually moving in the opposite direction. Call it ""levelling down"" if you like. 

Saunders also believes that low housing supply and reduced mobility is one of the reasons why Brits have such long commutes, which ""may adversely affect people's health and hence workforce participation"". That's probably worth bearing in mind as politicians and economists sit around scratching their heads and wondering why so many 50-somethings have decided to take early retirement. 

The Government did, in fairness, try to kick-start reform of the planning process in 2020 but this ground to halt last year in the face of backbench rebellions and is now languishing in the long grass of further consultations. On Monday, Keir Starmer pledged that Labour will relax planning rules to build new infrastructure and help young people buy their own homes in a bid to boost the economy. It's a laudable aim but the Devil will obviously be in the detail. 

One potential issue is Labour's support for further devolution as championed in the report authored by Gordon Brown last year. This could end up handing more power to the likes of West Oxfordshire County Council. 

If that's the case, what will change? Diddly squat.

Sewage most harmful form of pollution for rivers - and more damaging than agricultural waste

Researchers call for urgent improvements to water plants and increased regulations to protect animals, ecosystems and human wellbeing

Sewage is the most harmful form of pollution for rivers, according to a new study from the University of Oxford.

The research, published in journals Global Change Biology and Ecological Solutions, found human wastewater is ""radically altering"" animal, plant and microbe communities and is more damaging than agricultural waste.

It was found to be the main driver increasing algae, nutrient and sewage fungus in rivers.

Dr Dania Albini, Department of Biology, University of Oxford, and lead author of the study, said: ""Our study highlights the disproportionate impact that sewage discharge has on river quality, presenting an urgent need for a comprehensive action plan targeting the sewage discharge problem.

""Improvements to waste water plants should be implemented along with more regulations.

""These efforts are crucial in safeguarding the integrity and safety of our rivers - fundamental elements of both ecosystems and human wellbeing.""

Sewage fungus is a complex mix of fungus, algae and bacteria formed when there are high levels of organic nutrients.

It reduces oxygen levels enough to negatively affect all river species and kill a high number of fish.

At present, it has to be identified by eye - by then it is already large enough to be harmful.

Worms and cyanobacteria, known as blue-green algae, were increasingly abundant downstream of the sewage pipes, the study found.

Cyanobacteria is well known for producing toxic chemicals that can kill aquatic organisms and degrade critical ecosystems in the process.

Dr Michelle Jackson at the Department of Biology, University of Oxford, and senior author of the study, said: ""There is ongoing debate about the cause of the poor ecological state of many rivers in the UK because it is difficult to disentangle different pollution sources.

""Here, we show that even treated sewage appears to have a stronger influence on river communities than pollution from the surrounding land.

""This important information should be used to prioritise the management and conservation of our rivers moving forward.

""Rapid identification of sewage fungus pollution events will allow early intervention which would help prevent any potential negative consequences for local wildlife.""

Currently, there is intense public concern over the UK's waterways and a recent investigation discovered more than 90 per cent of England's freshwater habitats have been degraded by farming pollution, raw sewage and water abstraction.

Agricultural run-off encouraged sensitive insect groups of mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies, suggesting sewage is a greater threat to rivers than farming - though they added the field still needs to be kept in check.

James Wallace, the chief executive of the UK-based charity River Action, said: ""This important research demonstrates yet again the damage from unregulated water companies and agriculture.

""In addition to the catastrophic impact on wildlife from nutrient pollution, the public should be aware that sewage systems do not remove dangerous bacteria such as E.coli and intestinal enterococci from treated sewage.

He added: ""When will the Government make water companies and farms clean up their act, especially in places where human lives and sensitive protected habitats are threatened?""

Sir Gordon Conway, expert on food security and advocate of ""˜sustainable intensification' - obituary

He was pro-GM but argued that in the near term most advances in agricultural productivity would be based on conventional techniques

Professor Sir Gordon Conway, who has died aged 85, was a world leader in international development and one of the world's foremost experts on food security and the sustainable development of agricultural land.

He began his career as an entomologist in North Borneo working with the cocoa industry at a time when the plantations were being ravaged by insect pests: ""I discovered the growers of the cocoa were spraying it with all kinds of insecticides like DDT,"" he told an interviewer in 2014. ""I decided they were killing the natural enemies of the pest with the pesticides, so I said they had to stop spraying and they said ""˜You don't know what you're talking about, you're only 22 years old and straight out of university'."" 

But he persuaded the authorities in the Malaysian state of Sabah to ban the spraying of pesticides on cocoa, and was vindicated by the results. ""The natural enemies came alive and controlled all the pests, and it lasted for 30 years.""

Conway went on to work extensively in Indonesia, Thailand and sub-Saharan Africa, and although he held numerous academic, government and international posts, including as Professor of International Development at Imperial College, London from 2005 and Chief Scientific Adviser at the Department for International Development (DIDD, 2005-09), he remained very much the practical scientist, travelling each month to Africa into his eighties to talk to farmers about how to improve their crop yields. 

The focus of his career was neatly summed up in the title of his 2012 book One Billion Hungry: Can We Feed the World? in which he estimated that world food production would need to increase by 70 to 100 per cent by 2050 to feed its growing population. This posed a huge challenge at a time of rapid climate change, with agriculture expected to play a major part in reducing carbon emissions, and a premium on conserving water supplies.

The answer lay in ""sustainable intensification"", an approach which could be easily demonstrated at a local level but which was more difficult to envisage globally. ""In Africa they're using the top of Coca Cola or Pepsi Cola bottles, the little cap at the top and putting the fertiliser in that and then putting that fertiliser in a hole where you're going to plant the seed of the maize,"" he said in 2014. ""So you only apply 11 kilos of fertiliser per hectare, instead of hundreds per hectare, the fertiliser goes exactly where it's needed for the plant and it doesn't spread all over the field... you can do it on a small scale but doing it on a big scale is really a big challenge.""

He was as sceptical of campaigners offering magic bullets. One of the lessons of One Billion Hungry was how little - so far at least - GM technology was contributing to beating hunger. GM crops were needed in the longer term and for specific pests and diseases, he argued, but in the meantime the world would need many different technologies to have a hope of meeting its food needs. GM, he explained, ""probably will deliver results but it'll take time... the bulk of science that's going into food security for the next 10 to 15 years is going to be conventional.""

Gordon Richard Conway was born in Birmingham on July 6 1938 to Cyril Conway, an engineer who worked with Sir Frank Whittle on the development of jet engines, and Thelma, nÃ©e Goodwin, a geography teacher. The family moved to Kingston, southwest London, where he was educated at Kingston Grammar School and Kingston Polytechnic. 

He went on to take a BSC in Zoology at University College of North Wales, Bangor (now Bangor University), followed by a diploma in agricultural science at St John's College, Cambridge, then a diploma in Tropical Agriculture at the University College of West Indies, Trinidad.

After six years in Borneo, he spent three years at the Institute of Ecology, University of California, Davis, where he took a PhD in agricultural ecology in 1969.

Back in Britain, in 1970 he joined Imperial College as a research fellow and lecturer in the Department of Zoology and Applied Entomology, rising to be founder director, then chairman, of its Centre for Environmental Technology - and later Professor of  Environmental Technology from 1980 to 1988, serving concurrently in later years as director of the sustainable agriculture programme of the International Institute for Environment and Development.

He remained a visiting professor at Imperial while serving as representative of the philanthropic Ford Foundation in New Delhi from 1988 to 1992, as well as six years as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sussex (1992-98) where he played a leading role in the establishment of the Brighton and Sussex Medical School, and during a further six years as president of the Rockefeller Foundation in the US (1998-2004).

There he was responsible for steering an endowment of more than $4 billion dollars towards philanthropic causes. As well as working to extend the benefits of the ""Green Revolution"" to Africa, he took an interest in issues of urban poverty and oversaw an increase in the number of private and public partnerships. He was particularly proud of the foundation's programme for treating HIV-positive pregnant women in Africa with antiretrovirals, which proved highly effective in curbing rates of mother-to-child transmission.

In 2005 Conway returned to Britain as Chief Scientific Adviser at DFID, where he oversaw a major expansion in the UK government's support for GM research in developing countries, and was appointed to a chair in International Development at Imperial the same year.

He was elected unopposed to the presidency of the Royal Geographical Society in 2006, though in 2009, his final year in the post, he ran into controversy when some of Britain's leading explorers, including Sir Ranulph Fiennes, joined forces to accuse the Society of being hijacked by politically correct academics who had abandoned great expeditions in favour of studying the environment and rising sea levels.

Conway was having none of it, pointing out that the last major expedition supported by the RGS 10 years previously, to the Shoals of Africa, had taken a great deal of time and effort and produced only 17 cited scientific papers. ""The world has changed,"" he argued. ""We provide money now for a lot of researchers to work overseas, but not on expeditions. We research things like fire in the Amazon, glaciers in Greenland, climate change in the Kalahari and arsenic pollution in Bangladesh... All our charter says we have to do is advance geographical science. If people intimate we are not abiding by our charter it is close to libellous.""

The row ended in a ballot of RGS members in May 2009. The explorers lost the vote 38 per cent to 62 per cent.

In later life Conway headed the Bill and Melinda Gates-funded project Agriculture for Impact (A4I) , based at Imperial College, looking into ways to increase and enhance agricultural development for smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa. He subsequently served as a senior adviser to its successor organisation the Malabo Montpellier Panel - a group of international agriculture experts who guide policy choices towards food and nutritional security in Africa.

Though Conway could sound apocalyptic about the looming environmental and security problems facing the world,  he remained an optimist: ""I've been in the development business all my adult life,"" he told The Guardian in 2005. ""... I know there are answers. The world is very slow to respond but, in time, we usually put the answers in place.""

Conway was a man of wide interests, and as well as his book on the global food crisis, he published on agriculture and pollution and, in the 1990s, chaired the Runnymede Commission on British Muslims and Islamophobia.

He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 2004 and in 2017 was awarded the Founder's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society. He was knighted in 2005 and appointed a deputy lieutenant of East Sussex in 2006. At the time of his death he was writing a book on agriculture in the Roman Empire.

In 1965 he married Susan Mumford, who recalled that within a few days of their wedding she and her husband were busily occupied chasing a huge swarm of locusts in northern Borneo. She survives him with two daughters and a son.

Sir Gordon Conway, born July 6 1938, died July 30 2023

The grown-up guide to flashing a midlife midriff like Gwyneth Paltrow

Yes you can shows off your abs, no stomach crunches required

Mention the words ""crop-top"" to most middle-aged women, and you'll probably be met with a shudder. Unless you are Gwyneth Paltrow, who attended the Daily Front Row's Fashion Los Angeles Awards on Sunday evening in a ribcage-grazing co-ord that showed off her ultra-toned midsection.

Gwyneth's no fool. She was attending the event to accept an award for G. Label, the luxury fashion line that's part of her Goop lifestyle platform. In wearing this midriff-baring look, she knows that she will dominate the post-awards media coverage - and may even generate some extra G. Label sales. Clever. 

More importantly though, it dismisses expectations of what one ""˜should' wear at 50. If you have worked to get a body that's the envy of a 25-year-old, you've earned the right to show it off - even if it does make normal civilians without a rigorous daily gym habit and strict macrobiotic diet feel like colossal underachievers.

But there is a way to bare skin without a Gwyneth-style fitness routine, and you'll be relieved to know that it has nothing to do with Christopher Kane's ""˜Six-Pack' dress. Instead, look to Wendy Euler, the Montana-based influencer behind the Instagram handle @goodbyecroptop. Euler, who is 55, regularly shows a flash of skin at the waistline. She makes it look nonchalant and unstudied - and it imbues so much confidence.

In fact, that element is key to her success. ""There are no rules [when it comes to crop-tops or any other fashion item], other than you should feel good and confident in what you wear,"" she says. ""As I tell my daughters - and my community - if you're fidgeting before you walk out the door, change.""

And on the topic of Paltrow's co-ord? ""I say go Gwyneth,"" she says. ""I'd wear one.""

The grown-up's guide to flashing your midriff

For those who aspire to Euler's attitude, but lack the confidence, the high street has done a stellar job this season when it comes to cut-out and crop-top baby steps.  

A little flash of skin at the ribcage is an entry-level place to begin, as it's the slimmest part of your torso. I'd urge you to try it before you dismiss it, because, done right, it can look very sexy in a not-too-outre way - and there's nothing to stop you wearing a bra. A highlight from the M&S spring/summer collection is a black broderie Anglaise dress with cut-outs at the sides (£59). It creates the illusion of a tiny waist, and the cut-outs are elasticated, so the skin beneath won't push against them.

The same applies to a cut-out below the bust, like Anthropologie's Lara linen midi dress (£128) - much more subtle and intriguing than cleavage.

Another option is to try the co-ord route. Most of those available to buy right now are far less extreme than Gwyneth's - a long-ish cropped top teamed with a high-waisted skirt leaves just a sliver of skin on show, on or just below the ribcage.

Expect to see plenty of these on stylish wedding guests this summer. Boden has a few but the square-neck crop top (£55) and full maxi skirt (£120) are especially chic. For a smarter occasion, Reformation's Andy two-piece comes as a set (£298) The wide waistband and structured top make it easy to wear whatever your shape or size.

With any cut-out or cropped look, remember that it's always better to size up than to size down. You can always get it tweaked by a tailor if the fit isn't perfect. 

The idea here is that there's more flexibility than ever before in showing the parts of your body that you love, and concealing what you don't - and if you need a little help in finding that self-love, the Telegraph's beauty editor-at-large, Annabel Jones, has some tips to help you get there""¦

The lunchtime stomach crunching procedure 

Let's be honest, achieving abs as toned as Gwyneth's would take the average 50-year-old woman with two children a year in plank position to achieve. The plank, by the way, is thought to be one of the best ways to coax lazy stomach muscles out of retirement, but in lieu of a gruelling exercise regime, technology can step in to help.

EMsculpt Neo is a new-age treatment that combines high-intensity focused electro-magnetic energy or HIFEM+- a fancy way of saying it heats up and destroys fat cells and contracts your abdominal muscles for you, along with radiofrequency (thermal energy that prompts collagen and elastin synthesis to tighten the skin). 

In plain English, the non-invasive procedure, which feels like a non-painful contraction, has been clinically shown to reduce fat by 30 per cent, increase muscle by 25 per cent while tightening loose skin within half an hour. 

Admittedly, four 30-minute treatments scheduled five to 10 days apart is recommended to achieve such results, but should you detest the gym, this is a viable option. 

Supercharge your body cream 

There is an argument for using an anti-ageing serum on your torso, or anywhere on your body that you want to be firm and smooth for that matter - because body cream won't cut it when it comes to specific concerns. 

Dr. Barbara Sturm says this is because the skin on our bodies tends to be thicker, has less oil and hair glands, thus it's often drier, yet it can be more susceptible to crepiness and age spots, particularly after childbirth and during the menopause when skin is drier and collagen depleted. 

Sturm's new Super Anti-ageing Body Serum, £170, contains anti-stretch mark properties and intense hydration for glowing, soft skin. Results are accumulative, naturally. 

To brighten and even skin tone, Beauty Pie's Superdose Vitamin C Bio Vitamin Brightening Body Cream contains brightening ascorbic acid, hydrating hyaluronic acid and tranexamic acid which fades dark spots and uneven skin tone for a considerably more affordable £50 (or £15 for members).

Instant radiance 

To boost a glow, smear St.Tropez's new Luxe Body Serum (£28) all over, which combines a special collagen-enhancing complex with a hint of self-tanner for a sunkissed glow that develops within 4-8 hours.  

Do however, approach self-tanning with caution and prep skin first by exfoliating dry spots like elbows and ankles with a scrub in the shower and use a tanning mitt when applying for a streak free outcome. 

Or Charlotte Tilbury's Magic Body Cream (£49) will provide an age-appropriate amount of glisten and sparkle. For those who prefer an oil over a cream, Chanel Les Beiges Illuminating Dry Oil for Face Body and Hair (£70) gives a sheer coppery shine that's unparalleled in its subtleness. Use sparingly - a little goes a long way.

Ferrero Rocher shortage looms this Christmas after poor nut harvest

Hazelnut crop levels are lower than usual in Turkey because of poor weather conditions and damage from insects

A Ferrero Rocher shortage is feared this Christmas after a poor nut harvest.

Hazelnut crop levels are lower than usual in Turkey, the world's largest producer of the nut, thanks to poor weather conditions and damage from insects.

Experts have warned this is likely to send prices soaring and cause shortages in the run up to the festive season, when sales of Ferrero Rocher usually boom. Ferrero, which makes Nutella spread as well as the velvet chocolate balls, purchases a quarter of the world's hazelnuts.

The Turkish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has placed this year's crop size at 718,000 tonnes, which would be down around 13 per cent compared to last year, but traders have suggested it might be as low as 620,000 tonnes.

Jara Zicha, a senior analyst at market research firm Mintec, told The Grocer: ""The price increase is indeed driven by shorter-than-expected production in Turkey.

Surging prices

""The initial estimates from May/June this year came in at 720,000 to 810,000 tonnes. When the harvest started, farmers started report[ing] much lower output, which has caused prices in Turkey to surge.""

He added: ""If the high prices were to stay, we could see some packers trying to substitute hazelnuts out of nut mixes.""

Swaroop Joshi, from hazelnut supplier Ofi, admitted that: ""This year's harvest of hazelnuts in Turkey has resulted in slightly lower seasonal yields than expected"", which ""has in turn resulted in higher prices"".

Kenan Ä°ncirkuÅŸ, a trader from Giresun, Turkey, told Mintec ""there are very few hazelnuts this year"" thanks to ""the effects of global warming, insect damage and, in particular, a lack of rainfall during the critical nut development period in May"".

Food inflation

It could spell bad news for those who do manage to get their hands on Ferrero Rocher or Nutella this Christmas, as the prices of sugar and cocoa - the other key ingredients - have also spiked.

The latest feared shortages come after Christmas shoppers were warned of scarce turkey supplies last year thanks to bird flu and crippling costs in the poultry industry.

Quality Street was also forced to remove green and orange foil wrappers from some tins thanks to a shortage of the material last November.

The Telegraph has contacted Ferrero for comment.

UK weather: Heatwave to hit gardeners with bad news for cauliflower or broccoli growers

But late summer sun will have better effects on tomatoes, potatoes, raspberries and sweetcorn, says Royal Horticultural Society

The late summer heatwave will be bad news for cauliflower or broccoli growers, but tomato, potato and raspberry crops will have a delayed bloom, the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) has said.

Temperatures could be as high as 90F (32C) this week, following weeks of washout weather.

As well as enjoying the sun, anyone who has planted blight-resistant tomatoes ""will be rewarded for their foresight"" with a glut this week, said Guy Barter, the RHS's chief horticulturist.

Sweetcorn also thrives in hot temperatures, when their photosynthesis works best.

""This is going to give it a very welcome boost,"" said Mr Barter. ""In other years the sweetcorn gets to October and it's not right and the flavours never quite as good. But it's paid off this year.""

Other varieties will not do so well out of the heat, particularly cruciferous varieties and salad leaves.

""Things like cauliflowers and cabbages and lettuce will mature all in a rush, which is always a pesky nuisance,"" said Mr Barter.

As well as keeping leaves in the salad crisper, Mr Barter suggested pickling as a method to cut down on food waste.

The RHS kicks off its Festival of Flavours this week, inviting top cooks including Raymond Blanc to events across five of its sites to encourage gardeners to grow their own fruit and veg.

""Growing your own has so many advantages and benefits, from improving mental and physical health to helping the environment,"" said Dr Tim Upson, the RHS's Director of Gardens and Horticulture. ""Just last month a study revealed that people who grow their own eat more than their allotted five-a-day, waste less and save money.""

Mr Barter said that while it was important to keep wilting flowers watered, ""the thing is not to get too carried away"".

He added: ""The heatwave won't last long and the end of the growing season is in sight. So water plants but it's probably not worth feeding at the moment because the plants will never actually get to use the fertiliser before the growing season winds down.""

Now is also a good time to sow seeds for the next season, Mr Barter said.

""Take advantage of the warmth to get things up and going,"" he said.

Go ""˜demitarian' to tackle climate change, UN report urges

Cutting down on eating meat and dairy - as opposed to going vegan - can help reduce nitrogen pollution

Going ""demitarian"", by halving meat and dairy in your diet, can help reduce nitrogen pollution and tackle climate change, a UN report has found.

On its own, nitrogen is a harmless gas in the atmosphere but when combined with oxygen or hydrogen it becomes a pollutant.

It also becomes a greenhouse gas that is 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide.

Plants need nitrogen to grow so farmers spread these chemical compounds over their fields to help their crops, but create vast amounts of waste in the process.

Current practices mean that 80 per cent of the nitrogen spread is not absorbed by the plants but leaks into the environment.

In the UK last year, £3.5 billion worth of fertiliser was wasted this way, which is equal to the total amount of UK farming subsidies.

2030 goal is ""˜extremely ambitious'

The UN aims to reduce nitrogen waste by 50 per cent by 2030 and a group of researchers believe the best way to achieve this is by all groups taking moderate action together rather than one sector bearing all of the weight.

Cutting meat and dairy consumption to around 500 grams of meat a week or changing farming practices and using new technology, all supported by government policies, is the best way to slow the toxic leakage contaminating rivers and the air we breathe, the researchers said.

Professor Mark Sutton, co-editor of the report and environmental physicist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH), said: ""Let's face it, to get to that 2030 goal is extremely ambitious.

""If we're going to get there, what are the different ways of doing it?

""It's not just the guys with the technical measures - we all need to think about our food choices.

""Our food choices are affecting water pollution and climate change. So we all need to contribute.""

Led by UKCEH with colleagues across Europe, the scientists analysed 144 scenarios involving different levels of ambition across different sectors and settled on 12 that meet the 50 per cent nitrogen waste reduction target.

What they found to be a ""demitarian"" diet - cutting meat and dairy in half as opposed to going vegan - worked best alongside other measures.

Derek Clayton, Kew botanist who catalogued the world's grasses - obituary

He overhauled our understanding of the grass family (which includes wheat, rice and maize) more profoundly than anyone since the 1880s

Derek Clayton, who has died aged 97, was a visionary botanist who worked for over 50 years at Kew and catalogued the world's grasses.

Of all the plant families, grasses (or Poaceae) are the most important to humanity because they feed the world. Crops such as wheat, rice, maize, sorghum and sugar cane are all technically grasses, and it was the development of cereal crops that allowed humanity to progress beyond life as hunter gatherers and become settled pastoralists. For half a century, Clayton led a small team at The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, which researched grasses everywhere from tropical Africa to Australia, South America, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East and the Pacific.

The Kew herbarium houses a global collection of dried and pressed plant specimens mounted on sheets of paper, of which several hundred thousand are grass specimens. Clayton, who was appointed head of the grass section at Kew in 1958, decided to use the dried specimens to review the classification of the grass family as a whole. This would require an assessment of the status of all grass genera and their interrelationships, something that had not been attempted since the great Victorians, George Bentham and Joseph Hooker, in their Genera Plantarum, completed in 1883.

Since then, however, the collection at Kew had expanded, particularly in the second half of the 20th century, with important additions from Africa, Australasia and South America; Clayton also wanted to incorporate data from more modern disciplines in his taxonomy, such as seed and embryo morphology, chromosome numbers, pollen morphology, physiology, phytochemistry and anatomy. The result of his overhaul was the seminal 1986 Genera Graminum, co-written with his fellow Kew botanist SA Renvoize, which remains the standard work.

The book paved the way for Clayton's next monumental task: to collect descriptive information for all grass species on an electronic database, which he realised would be the future of taxonomy. It took him 10 years but in 2000 it was launched as GrassBase. The largest database of its kind, it now contains all new grass names as recorded by the International Plant Names Index, and currently has morphological descriptions of over 11,000 grass species, and the botanical names of over 64,000 grasses. Clayton returned to Kew to work on GrassBase regularly throughout his retirement, ceasing only in 2017, at the age of 91.

William Derek Clayton (he preferred his middle name) was born on July 24 1926 in Croydon, Surrey, to William Rex Clayton, a director of the stone restoration company Szerelmey Ltd, and his wife, Margaret Ann (nee Meikle). Derek attended Eastbourne College where he attained the Higher School Certificate in physics and double maths. He went up to Cambridge to read mechanical sciences at Magdalene, but realising that a career in engineering was not for him, he left after a year and did odd jobs until he was called up for National Service. He was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant and posted to 110 Army Troops Squadron in Austria, where he was appointed Garrison Engineer at PÃ¶rtschach am WÃ¶rthersee.

After his National Service, he took up botany and spent a year at Norwood College, where he began to specialise in grass identification. Then followed three years at Imperial College, London, where he obtained a first in botany. A Colonial Ecological Scholarship took him to Lincoln College, Oxford for a year, then another year at the East African Research and Forestry Organisation, travelling in Kenya, Uganda and Malawi. He worked for four years as an ecologist at the Federal Agricultural Research Station at Ibadan in Nigeria.

He then joined Kew, where he concentrated on giving an account of the grasses of tropical west Africa, while simultaneously working on a monograph of Hyparrhenia - a fiendishly difficult genus to interpret, and one not to be tackled lightly. Grasses of the genus Hyparrhenia, however, are a prime component of the African savannas, and Clayton realised how badly those involved with pasture development needed a reliable and up to date account of them. For this work he received a PhD; his monograph, published in 1969, is still widely consulted. This ethos, of looking forward to what would be useful, was characteristic of Clayton's career.

He went on to document Central and East African grasses, and became an evangelist for the emerging analytical methods of numerical taxonomy, which sought to approach the problems of identifying species and their relationships in a mathematical way, rather than the subjective assessment employed prior to this, which relied on the observation and experience of the researcher. He also became interested in the discipline of chorology - the study of the spatial distribution of organisms - and how one might identify geographical patterns, from very narrow evolution hotspots to broad pan-tropical phenomena.

In 1953 he married Lucille Hicks, who predeceased him. He is survived by their son and two daughters.

Derek Clayton, born July 24 1926, died September 8 2023

Feral ""˜super pigs' threatening to invade US from Canada

Prolific breeders eat almost anything and cause $2.5 billion of damage to US crops every year

The US is facing the threat of an invasion of feral ""super pigs"" from Canada, experts have warned.

Described as ""the most invasive animal on the planet"", by Saskatchewan professor Ryan Brook, the hog population is soaring.

According to a 2019 study, the number of hogs - a cross between a farmyard pig and wild boar - is increasing at the rate of nine per cent a year.

The porcine invasion comes at a time when the US is already struggling to contain feral swine elsewhere in the country with a domestic population estimated at six million across 35 states.

""Wild pigs are ecological train wrecks. They are prolific breeders, making them an extremely successful invasive species,"" said researcher Ruth Aschim.

""Wild pigs can cause soil erosion, degrade water quality, destroy crops, and prey on small mammals, amphibians and birds.""

Problem began when wild boars were imported from Europe

The problem originated when wild boars were imported from Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Some were imported to diversify livestock, others as game for hunters.

But demand for wild boar for food never took off and in the early years of the 21st century, farmers cut down their fences and allowed the hogs to roam at will.

By 2017 they had expanded territory across Canada, with the majority in Saskatchewan.

Sows can have a dozen piglets each per year

Prolific breeders - sows can have a dozen piglets each per year - the super pigs spreading south eat almost anything and they trample over farmland leaving a trail of devastation in their wake.

They are estimated to cause $2.5 billion damage to US crops a year. They are also aggressive, in 2019, a Texas woman was killed by wild pigs.

Northern US states are already taking action. Minnesota announced what it described as a ""proactive review"" earlier this month on how to tackle the problem.

Montana has set up a ""squeal on pigs"" hotline, urging the public to report sightings of the animals which can carry more than 30 diseases and parasites.

""Early detection and rapid response are the keys to success. Eradicating small populations and minimising the impacts of these invasive species are important to protect the economy and natural resources of the region,"" the public was told.

The e-collar ban is based on ideology, not reality

The Government needs to take a more nuanced approach to animal welfare

Every public document nowadays says it is ""evidence-based"", but too often, the scientific research evidence involved appears pre-organised to produce a political result. So it is with the attempt by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to ban e-collars for dogs.

Today, from the sharp-toothed front line, comes a letter to the Prime Minister from 441 sheep farmers in England. Led by the aptly named Phil Stocker, chief executive of the National Sheep Association, they protest at the ban. They say e-collars can be ""an effective training aid, and in many cases an alternative to having to have a dog put down"".

As any country-dweller knows, attacks by dogs on livestock are a problem that exploded during Covid and remains severe. Defra's own estimate is that half a million dogs are trained with e-collars. If this training were banned, next February's lambing would soon show the dire effects. Unfortunately, taking a dog for a walk on a lead is no guarantee of good behaviour because, in nearly half the cases, leads are slipped.

Advocates of e-collars do not say they suit all cases; but, for dogs who are naturally predatory and/or behave badly, they do teach the necessary lesson. The phrase ""short, sharp shock"" was once well known as a remedy for youth crime. The concept, in its most literal form, was not suited to human beings but, after three or four applications, it does teach dogs a permanent aversion. This means that thousands can run free without harm to others. That is surely much better than canine capital punishment.

If the collars are banned, we shall be in a strange situation. Farmers may put up electric fences for cattle or sheep which deliver shocks of up to 15,000 millijoules (mJ), whereas a dog's e-collar - current maximum, 5mJ - will be illegal. In the RSPCA's 2021 figures of reported cruelty to animals, there were 1,094 killings, 38,087 abandonments, but not one e-collar incident.

It is borderline insane for Defra to pay so little attention to the reality of death by dog, but that is what happens when ministers and officials pass their days in meetings with pressure groups.

Birds and oil can live together

Sir Keir Starmer's upcoming answer to this country's energy needs seems to be to prevent all new exploration for oil and gas in British waters. This will be announced in Scotland later this month. Not surprisingly, the prospect has upset the normally Labour-supporting trade unions, the GMB and Unite, whose members work in both fields. They would lose jobs if the proposed policy were enacted.

There will be much more argument about this, but what interests me right now is the reaction of the Campaign to Protect Rural England and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. They issued a statement calling on Sir Keir to ""stand firm on Labour's policy of no new oil and gas development"", preferring money spent on ""nature-positive renewables"" etc.

Obviously both organisations care about what happens to our environment, but is it right for a charity to promote a named party's policy, particularly over such a wide-ranging, controversial and highly political issue? There must be millions, your columnist included, who are interested in the welfare of rural England and of birds but do not want the charities who share those aims to fight partisan wars with the money they raise tax-free in the name of the public good.

Would rural England or rare birds automatically be better off with more on-shore windfarms than with North Sea oil or gas fields? As with the e-collar controversy (see above), zealotry and politics seem to trump reason and impartiality.

The first deserve the naming rights

Before I forget for a year, please let me reassert a pedantry which the media increasingly ignore: the race run last Saturday is not ""the Epsom Derby"". It is ""The Derby"".

All other Derbys (should that be ""Derbies""?) have a qualifier in their name - the Irish Derby, the Kentucky Derby. Various football and rugby matches are sometimes described as a ""Derby"" (or should that be ""derby""?). But the race run at Epsom was the first and remains the greatest. Like the Grand National, it needs only its name, and is always thus referred to in conversation.

It is worth sticking to these things. The lack of a geographical or national prefix often gives a clue to an early origin. Thus Britain's oldest daily newspaper, The Times, should not be called ""The London Times"", though it often is in foreign reports, whereas The New York Times should be so-called, because that is what its masthead says.

It is to do with who got there first. For that reason, Britain is the only country in the world whose postage stamps do not state where they come from, and the United States is the only nation in which none of its email addresses include the country's initials or abbreviation.

Gerald Wiener, Kindertransport refugee who became an eminent animal geneticist - obituary

He showed how an understanding of genetics could improve farm animal breed quality, and wrote about the yak

Gerald Wiener, who has died aged 97, arrived in Britain as a penniless 12-year-old refugee from Nazi Germany on a Kindertransport and went on to become a distinguished scientist working on the genetics of farm animals at what would later be merged into the Roslin Institute, where he assembled a team that included many of the scientists who would go on to clone Dolly the Sheep.

Wiener's key contributions to animal genetics include mapping out how genes flowed from a relatively small subset of influential herds or flocks to the wider population, and how this ""pyramid"" of genetic inheritance could be used for improving breed quality - an idea fundamental to modern livestock breeding.

Subsequently, during research into the causes of variation in productivity of cattle and sheep, he discovered that deaths from swayback, a non-treatable condition in young lambs caused by copper deficiency, was heavily influenced by breed. This led him to conclude that the absorption of dietary copper from the gut was strongly influenced by genetics, and that an understanding of metabolic ""pathways"" - the chemical reactions in living cells essential to maintain bodily functions - often offer better predictions of animal health and productivity than such indicators as body weight or volume of milk.

An only child, he was born Horst Wiener in KÃ¼strin, Germany (now Kostrzyn, Poland) on April 25 1926 to secular Jewish parents, Paul and Luise Wiener. His parents divorced when he was two and he was brought up by his mother in Berlin.

As the Nazis consolidated their hold on Germany, young Horst was forced to leave school and after Kristallnacht, when Nazis looted and vandalised Jewish-owned businesses, his mother sought ways for her son to escape. ""At school I had a really close friend, Hardy Seidel, who came to Britain first,"" he recalled. ""My mother wrote to them and they brought me to the attention of Save the Children and that's how I came over on the Kindertransport in March 1939.""

While many children were terrified of leaving their homes and parents, young Horst recalled the journey as an adventure: ""There were over 100 of us on the train, At Hamburg docks we were met by an enormous ship, SS Manhattan. It was so exciting. The crew gave us balloons and cakes. Of course, I was seasick.""

Fortunately his mother was able to join him a couple of months later, having obtained permission to train as a midwife, and they settled in Oxford, where Horst changed his name to Gerald and became friendly with Rosemary and Ruth Spooner, Christian Socialists and relations of the Rev William Spooner who gave his name to ""spoonerisms"". 

The Spooners had a great influence on the young boy: ""None of my family had ever been to university, they were shopkeepers, but the Spooners thought ""˜This boy's too bright to be a farm labourer or something like that' and set me on the road to university.""

Under their influence he also converted to Christianity, eventually becoming an elder in the Church of Scotland, and with their help he read agriculture at Edinburgh University, winning the Steven Scholarship and graduating top of his year in 1947.

He was one of the first young scientists to be recruited to the newly-formed National Animal Breeding Genetics and Research Organisation based in Edinburgh, going on to take a PhD and DSc and rising to head of the Department of Physiological Genetics, and deputy director of the organisation, before his formal retirement at 60 in 1986.

During this time he was a leading member of the British Society of Animal Science, and editor for 25 years of its journal Animal Production. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1970.

Following his retirement Wiener worked as a consultant for the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation and the British Council in countries including Ethiopia, India and China - where in 1988 he became involved in a project on the yak, which led to the publication of The Yak (2003), one of the few English-language books about the animal, of which he was senior author.

While working in the US, Wiener discovered how his father, who had remarried and begun a new family, had escaped from Germany and made it to San Francisco via Shanghai. They were living in the Shanghai International Settlement when it was occupied by the Japanese the day after Pearl Harbor. Fortunately the Japanese, whatever their other sins, did not share their German ally's anti-Semitism, ignoring efforts by the Nazi government to repatriate the city's Jewish community. 

For many years Wiener refused to speak German, even to his mother, but his feelings for the country were transformed when he was asked to go back and work for a period at a livestock research station in Mariensee. ""We were suddenly with people who genuinely detested the Hitler period,"" he recalled. ""They were the same as us. I changed my attitude."" 

A committed Christian throughout his adult life, Wiener was instrumental in the establishment of the Eric Liddell Centre in Edinburgh, a community centre established in 1980, and at his home in Biggar he helped to establish Biggar and District Community Heritage, a charity which works to improve the local natural environment, chairing it for several years before moving to Inverness in 2008.

Wiener was twice married, secondly to Margaret Russell, who wrote under the pen name Margaret Dunlop and published a biography of her husband, Goodbye Berlin, in 2016. She died in 2020 and Wiener is survived by a son and daughter from his first marriage, which was dissolved.

Gerald Wiener, born April 25 1926, died September 28 2023

Our obsession with being tidy is killing a much-loved British creature

Modern life has not been kind to our favourite prickly animals - but can we prevent their extinction?

It is the early 1990s and my parents have woken my brother and me up and plonked us on the doorstep of our home in suburban Stockport. Through sleepy eyes we scan the shrubbery, and we're rewarded with a snuffling midnight peregrination of hedgehogs: a healthy-sized sow and her pebble-shaped spiny offspring. We don't know how lucky we are.

Thirty years later, most of the front gardens on the road have been tarmacked. Those that haven't are neat and closely mown. Where might our hedgehog family find its home here? 

Modern life has not been kind to the hedgehog. Numbers are estimated to have halved between 2000 and 2018. And that is in spite of it being our favourite animal. In 2016 they won a national poll, with a decisive 35.9 per cent of the vote.

When I tell conservationist Dr Tom Moorhouse about my hedgehog encounters he admits to being a little envious. 

His own childhood garden had a solid brick wall around it, and consequently, no hedgehogs. Now a research scientist at Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, he worries that his daughter and other children will be victims of ""shifting baseline syndrome"", a gradual change in the accepted norms for the condition of the natural environment due to lack of past information or lack of experience of past conditions.

""My real worry is that more people are going to be like me than like you,"" says Moorhouse.

Despite holding such a strong place in our national psyche, hedgehogs are elusive creatures (""They're just a little bit strange and incredibly cute,"" says Moorhouse). This is what spurred him to write Ghosts in the Hedgerow, turning detective to crunch through the data we have available to explain what has happened to the hedgehog. Badgers, cars, intensive agriculture - where should we pin the blame for declining numbers?

While he has spent years working on hedgehog projects, Moorhouse's original specialism is the water vole.

""I was intrigued by the difference between hedgehogs and the species I'm most familiar with, water voles, where we know the principal cause of them going extinct in the UK is clearly American mink, and a little bit of habitat loss. With hedgehogs it's a completely different situation."" 

These nocturnal mammals leave few signs of their presence and are notoriously difficult to monitor - not least because their prickles and wide neck aren't conducive to tags. 

""It's also very reliant on researchers getting into people's properties. We don't have enough researchers, and we don't have enough access,"" says Moorhouse.

We can't even say with any certainty how numbers of hedgehogs have declined. In the 1950s there were an estimated 36.5""‰million in the UK, and this number is often used to illustrate the fall in population. However, Moorhouse says that whopping number, which has been oft-quoted down the decades, was never reliable or accurate. 

""It was based on taking the population of one area and scaling it up to national level,"" explains Moorhouse. The figure was based on assuming there was one hedgehog per acre.

A more accurate way to find data on hedgehog numbers, although more grisly than looking under bushes, is to count how many are getting run over. ""While it doesn't tell us the national population, it shows the change in that population,"" says Moorhouse. ""We have data on how many were being recorded as being flattened on the roads at different junctures.""

With traffic volume increasing, you would expect more hedgehogs to be getting run over. ""But we're actually getting fewer being flattened, which indicates there are fewer hedgehogs around."" (Contrast that with the number of squished badgers and foxes you see in rural areas.) 

A brief word on badgers, who, yes, will eat a hedgehog - a gruesome fate - particularly if the spring has been dry and the ground too hard for them to claw up their preferred invertebrates. 

If we destroyed all badgers in the country, would it save hedgehogs? ""Probably not,"" says Moorhouse. ""We've done 90 per cent of the damage and we're blaming the other species for finishing off the last 10 per cent.""

Nature is red in tooth and claw; as a conservationist, Moorhouse knows this implicitly. ""I'm happy for animals to die of natural causes in a natural way as long as their breeding rate is in balance with their mortality rate. 

""If they get stepped on by a cow, that's unlucky, but in the grand scheme of things it's not bad for the species. We tend not to worry about hedgehogs getting run over.""

Our best estimates for how many hedgehogs are being killed on the roads in one year falls between 167,000 and 335,000. ""That's a lot, but we can't put those figures into context by calculating what proportion of all living hedgehogs they represent, because that requires taking a somewhat imprecise estimate of annual total road kill and dividing it by a wholly inaccurate estimate of the live hedgehog population.""

The lack of reliable data means that anecdata, such as my own, does play a part in understanding how healthy the hedgehog population is.

Garden birdwatch surveys have shown a decline in hedgehogs up to about 2013, and then a little bit of a bounce back. And our ability to monitor has improved recently with cameras. ""It's likely that they're holding stable,"" says Moorhouse. 

He believes we all play a role in the story of our favourite animal. Both in its decline, but also in protecting its future. 

""With a lot of conservation problems it can feel like a systemic problem that seems like it's out of reach of ordinary people to deal with,""explains Moorhouse. In the case of the hedgehog, our intensive farming practices, grubbing up hedgerows and making huge, machinery-ploughed dust bowls, has created an inhospitable environment for them. 

""The problem is embedded in our food system and how farming is conducted,"" says Moorhouse. ""But with hedgehogs, the twist is that they're ending up in our urban areas - and that's something we really can individually have an impact on.""

Yours, your neighbour's and your next-door neighbour's little patch of earth has become the last stronghold for the hedgehog. Thankfully we have control over what happens in our back gardens and we can make changes. ""If enough people do that it changes society a bit and will have a positive influence,"" says Moorhouse. 

Except the changes we've been making haven't been the right ones. 

A driveway here, a patio there, another bit of decking, slug pellets, a shed on a concrete base; it all chisels away at the wildness of our urban spaces. Our gardens have become an extension of our homes: designed, decorated and managed - even more since the pandemic and the lockdowns. 

""Agricultural tidiness and urban tidiness completely mirror each other and they both have catastrophic consequences on wildlife. When we end up with more urban than wild and eventually wildlife isn't able to be there,"" says Moorhouse. 

Our obsession with privacy, making our home into a castle, is part of the problem. While elsewhere in Europe they are also worrying about hedgehog decline they face fewer barriers on the home front. In Denmark, for example, gardens are more likely to be separated by hedgerows than ugly wooden fences. 

And even though we all know the benefits of hedgehog highways, how many of us have instigated one with our neighbours?

However, Moorhouse is keen to point out: ""Nobody is a bad person. We might all intend to have a chat with our neighbours, to see if it would be OK to make a hole in their fence, but we put it off - I know it took me some time to do that - as social awkwardness acts as a barrier to action. But if we do remove them, good things flow from there.""

Rats might be a concern, but as Moorhouse points out, they can burrow under a fence, so a hedgehog hole the size of a CD case isn't an issue. 

What is a problem are robotic lawnmowers (a grisly end for a hedgehog), strimmers and plastic grass.

The message isn't all doom and gloom though. By Moorhouse's calculation, taking the rough figure of 22.7""Šmillion gardens in the UK, with a total area of 4,330 km2, that area  would be enough to support something like 39,000-139,000 hedgehogs. ""Even if hedgehogs were eradicated from the countryside, they could exist in our towns.""

Moorhouse's advice is for us all to make an untidy bit in our garden. ""You will get more wildlife and it will become more interesting and beautiful. The cumulative effect of lots of people doing tiny things is huge.""

We can also write to our councils and encourage them to take part in No Mow May. Because if we really do feel passionate about hedgehogs, then why not make time?

""They are a species that it's very easy to fall in love with and that desperately needs conservation work.""

UK borrowing costs surge to mini-Budget levels after GDP leap

Key moments

Chosen by us to get you up to speed at a glance

UK borrowing costs have surged to mini-Budget levels amid concerns that the Bank of England will be forced to raise interest rates higher after official data showed GDP beat expectations in June.  

The yield on two-year gilts, which are sensitive to interest rates, has risen around nine basis points to 4.94pc.

The benchmark 10-year bond yield - the rate the Government must promise to pay the holders of its debt when it matures - has moved even higher, rising about 13 basis points to 4.54pc.

Money markets predict there is an 86pc chance that interest rates will move higher in September but have raised bets that the Monetary Policy Committee will keep them around 5.5pc for longer - with traders forecasting a 5.75pc terminal rate by March.

The FTSE 100 fell as much as 1.45pc after data showed the British economy expanded by 0.2pc in the three months to June - faster than the zero growth predicted by economists.

Britain's blue-chip index ended 1.24pc lower at 7,524.16, while the midcap FTSE 250 index dropped 1.02pc at 18,799.70.

Richard Flax, chief investment officer at Moneyfarm, said: ""The dominant narrative ends up being that rates probably stay higher for longer.

""If you were to see inflation begin to fall relatively quickly and growth to hold up, then maybe that would change the equation.""

Neil Birrell from asset manager Premier Miton said: ""It gives the Bank of England a headache - they may well have been thinking about pausing interest rate increases soon, but this data will make that more difficult."" 

Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, added: ""We still think that with most of the drag from higher interest rates still to come, GDP will fall in the third quarter and a mild recession will begin.""

Santander latest to cut mortgage rates

Santander has become the latest bank to cut its mortgage rates amid hopes that the inflation crisis is easing.

Santander said that selected fixed purchase and remortgage rates for homeowners will decrease by up to 0.29 percentage points from Monday.

Nottingham Building Society said it has also launched new remortgage and purchase deals and will announce further rate reductions, including in the residential and buy-to-let sectors over the coming days.

Halifax, NatWest, First Direct, HSBC UK, Nationwide Building Society and TSB have also been among the lenders to announce mortgage rate reductions this week.

Swap rates, which underpin fixed mortgage rates, have stabilised amid expectations that inflation is cooling.

Inflation stood at 7.9pc in June, slowing from 8.7pc in May, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

The next inflation data for July will be published on Wednesday.

Co-op Bank buys Sainsbury's £480m mortgage business

The Co-operative Bank has bought Sainsbury's £480m mortgage business. 

Sainsbury's Bank will transfer 3,500 mortgage customers with about £479m in their accounts, the companies announced on Friday. 

Mortgage customers are expected to benefit from The Co-operative's investment in new technology once the handover completes in a year's time. 

Nick Slape, chief executive of The Co-operative Bank, said: ""This transaction, our first portfolio acquisition in more than a decade, further demonstrates the progress we have made in recent years and our strength in what remains a competitive UK mortgage market.""

The deal allows Sainsbury's to formally exit the UK mortgage market, after years of attempting to offload its mortgage portfolio.

Britain's second biggest supermarket chain stopped offering new mortgages to customers in 2019, just two years after expanding into the market with a range of products.

The suspension was part of a major overhaul of Sainsbury's Bank, then a loss-making business which weighed down on the retailer's profits.

Jim Brown, chief executive of Sainsbury's Bank, said: ""Closing the chapter on our mortgage offering is a big step in simplifying our business.""

Sainsbury's previously explored selling its financial services arm after receiving expressions of interest in 2020.

However, the grocer called off talks a year later after concluding that the offers were not good value for shareholders.

Inflation is still a concern, warn US economists

Stocks are slightly lower on Wall Street after a slight increase in wholesale prices last month, suggesting that the Federal Reserve's work on bringing inflation down is not yet finished.

The S&P 500 was down 0.2pc and on pace for its second losing week in a row after the producer prices index reached 0.8pc in July, up from 0.2pc in June. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1pc while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.5pc lower.

Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial, said: ""Not surprisingly, today's report offers the hawkish wing of the Fed more ammunition to advocate for another rate hike before the Fed is convinced it's reached its terminal rate.""

Adam Sarhan, chief executive of 50 Park Investments, said:

The PPI data shows that inflation is still a concern.

The market needs to pause and digest the inflation data which is coming in mixed, where it's not clear what the Fed's going do next. 

Even if the Fed pauses one time, the question becomes what will it be doing for the rest of the year.

Sainsbury's sells mortgage portfolio to Co-operative Bank

The Co-operative Bank will buy the mortgages held by Sainsbury's Bank, bringing it another 3,500 customers with around £479m in their accounts, the companies said.

It will take a year for mortgage customers at Sainsbury's Bank to transfer to their new lender, but when they do they will benefit from the Co-op Bank's investment in new technology, they said.

Sainsbury's Bank chief executive Jim Brown said: 

We're pleased to confirm we have agreed the sale of our mortgage book to the Co-operative Bank.

Closing the chapter on our mortgage offering is a big step in simplifying our business.

Pound dips after US wholesale inflation rise

The pound has lost some of its gains after the latest producer prices index from the US increased by more than expected in July.

Sterling has dipped below $1.27 but remains 0.1pc higher on the day after American wholesale prices picked up last month amid a surge in services costs, according to Labor Department data.

The bigger-than-expected rise in the July producer price index (PPI) indicates that services prices are still buoyant, even as increases in the cost of goods are tepid.

Wall Street slumps amid inflation fears

US markets dropped at the opening bell after stronger-than-expected wholesale inflation figures.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 0.3pc to 35,064.88 while the S&P 500 has declined by 0.5pc to 4,444.71.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has slumped by 0.7pc to 13,637.12.

Bond markets hit amid higher US wholesale inflation

Government borrowing costs have hit their highest level in a month after the stronger than expected US producer prices inflation, which rose to 0.8pc in the year to July from 0.2pc in June.

The yield on 10-year UK gilts has risen 14 basis points to 4.51pc, the highest points since July 12 as money markets increase bets on the peak for interest rates in the UK.

German bunds have also fallen, sending Berlin's 10-year borrowing costs nine points higher to 2.61pc.

US markets poised to open lower amid rising wholesale prices

Wall Street extended losses in pre-market trading after stronger-than-expected wholesale price increases stoked concerns about sticky inflation in the world's largest economy.

The Labor Department reported that its producer price index ""” which measures inflation before it hits consumers""” rose 0.8pc last month from July 2022. 

The latest figure followed a 0.2pc year-over-year increase in June, which had been the smallest annual rise since August 2020.

On a month-to-month basis, producer prices rose 0.3pc from June to July, up from no change from May to June.

The producer price figures the Labor Department reflect prices charged by manufacturers, farmers and wholesalers. 

The figures can provide an early sign of how fast consumer inflation will rise in the coming months. Since peaking at 11.7pc in March 2022, wholesale inflation has steadily tumbled in the face of the Federal Reserve's 11 interest rate rises.

Ahead of markets opening, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2pc, the S&P 500 had dropped 0.3pc, and the Nasdaq 100 had fallen 0.5pc. 

On Thursday, the government reported that consumer prices rose 3.3pc in July from 12 months earlier, an uptick from June's 3pc year-over-year increase.

US producer inflation ticks higher

The amount US producers were paid for their goods and services increased last month, raising the prospect of the US Federal Reserve holding interest rates higher for longer.

The producer prices index grew to 0.8pc in the year to July, up from an upwardly revised 0.2pc the previous month, according to the Labor Department. It had been forecast to rise to 0.7pc.

Starling Bank 'eyes Asia expansion'

Starling Bank, the British online lender, is planning its first expansion outside Europe into Asia, according to reports.

Nick Drewett, chief commercial officer at the digital bank, which is backed by Goldman Sachs, said it is in talks with an Asian bank about taking its Engine banking-as-a-service platform into a country in the continent, according to CNBC. He said: 

It's a different proof point for us: one in Europe, one in Asia-Pacific.

We're quite happy with the pace that we can absorb the implementation ""” and that will accelerate with every implementation. (...) It will never completely be cut and paste, but it will be able to accelerate as we become more material.

Starling Bank parted ways with its founder Anne Boden in June in a move designed to avoid potential for conflicts of interest, nine years after she founded the lender.

Musk v Zuckerberg fight to happen in 'epic location' in Italy

The highly-anticipated fight between Tesla chief executive Elon Musk and his rival Mark Zuckerberg could take place in Italy, the SpaceX boss has indicated.

Mr Musk, who owns the X social media platform formerly known as Twitter, said he has spoken to Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni about an ""epic location"" for the bout, with the backdrop of ""ancient Rome"".

He later added that all proceeds from the bout with the Meta chief executive would go to veterans:

The fight will be managed by my and Zuck's foundations (not UFC).

Livestream will be on this platform and Meta. Everything in camera frame will be ancient Rome, so nothing modern at all.

I spoke to the PM of Italy and Minister of Culture. They have agreed on an epic location.

Russian oil price rises above G7 cap

Russia's crude breached the G7 price cap in July, while revenue from oil exports soared to an eight-month high, according to the International Energy Agency. 

The price of the country's seaborne crude shipments last month jumped to $64.41 a barrel on a weighted average, ""smashing"" the $60 price limit set last year by the G7, the IEA said in latest monthly report. 

Russia's oil-export revenue rose last month to the highest since November, with the weighted average price for Russian seaborne crude exports rising $8.84 a barrel to $64.41, the IEA data shows. 

Russia benefited from higher global prices and narrowing discounts on the nation's crude and petroleum products, the IEA said. The nation earned $15.3bn from exports of its crude and fuel in July, up by almost 20pc from previous month. 

It comes as Russia's rouble was headed back towards the 98-per-dollar mark and touched the 108-per-euro.

Russian Ruble is falling (black), while the global Brent oil price (blue) is rising. This kind of decoupling is highly unusual and is the best piece of evidence that the G7 oil price cap is working.

US markets poised for mixed open

Wall Street looks subdued with investors cautious ahead of the producer prices inflation data due before markets open.

US indexes finished marginally higher on Thursday, giving up most early gains after milder-than-feared consumer inflation data.

Investors are focused on the producer prices data - which measures the change in what domestic companies are paid for their goods and services.

It is expected to rise to 0.7pc in the year to July, after growing 0.1pc in June. The figures will offer more insight into inflation in the world's largest economy and the Federal Reserve's next steps on interest rates.

In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, while the S&P 500 was down 0.1pc. Futures on the Nasdaq 100 were down 0.2pc.

Energy billionaire's flying taxi crashes in Cotswolds

A flying taxi owned by the billionaire boss of Ovo Energy has crashed in the Cotswolds.

Luke Barr has the details:

Vertical Aerospace, founded by Stephen Fitzpatrick, was dealt a blow on Wednesday when a test flight failed in dramatic fashion.

The Bristol-based startup, which is producing a five-seater flying taxi that can reach speeds of up to 200mph, said in a short statement that its prototype had crashed during a test of the ""aircraft's manoeuvrability"".

Mr Fitzpatrick has incorporated Vertical Aerospace into his sprawling business empire, the bulk of which is made of Ovo Energy, Britain's fourth-largest gas and electricity supplier that serves 4.5m customers.

He has also recently bought Kensington Roof Gardens, a glitzy party venue in west London, once owned by Sir Richard Branson, that he wants to turn into an exclusive private members' club.

Read how the crash comes after Vertical Aerospace's share price had already slumped.

Gas workers urge companies to settle and avoid strikes

Australian workers threatening strikes that sent global gas prices surging this week have urged their bosses to quickly resolve disputes and avoid any costly disruption to exports.

The prospect of disruptions at three major LNG plants ""” which together account for about 10pc of global supply ""” has roiled gas markets in recent days and triggered new concerns over the outlook ahead of the northern hemisphere winter. 

European gas prices are on track to have risen about 27pc this week after a surge of as much as 49pc on Wednesday after workers voted in favour of strike action at the facilies run by Chevron and Woodside Energy.

Chevron ""is taking steps to ensure safe and reliable operations are maintained in the event of disruption at our facilities,"" the company said, after Australia's Fair Work Commission authorised some workers at the Wheatstone and Gorgon downstream facilities to vote on taking industrial action.

Offshore workers at Wheatstone are also seeking permission to vote on a strike, the company said.

Union members on Woodside offshore platforms off the coast of Western Australia earlier voted to strike and can begin action at seven days' notice. Further negotiations between the Offshore Alliance, which includes two key labour unions, and the companies are scheduled for Tuesday.

Workers are seeking improved pay and conditions, and steps to improve job security including limits on the outsourcing of roles to labour hire contractors.

Union leaders claim disruptions in 2022 at Shell Plc's Prelude floating LNG production hub in Australia cost the company about A$1.5 billion (£770m). 

Oil demand hits record as Saudi cuts send prices climbing

Global oil demand has surged to a record amid robust consumption in China and elsewhere, threatening to push prices higher, the International Energy Agency said.  

World fuel use averaged 103m barrels a day for the first time in June and may soar even higher in August, the agency said in a report. 

As Saudi Arabia and its partners reduce supplies, oil markets are tightening significantly. 

The Paris-based IEA said: ""Oil demand is scaling record highs, boosted by strong summer air travel, increased oil use in power generation and surging Chinese petrochemical activity.""

It added that ""crude and products inventories have drawn sharply"" and ""balances are set to tighten further into the autumn"".

Brent crude this week touched a six-month high above $88 a barrel in London amid the post-pandemic resurgence in fuel use and production cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia.

The international benchmark has fallen back slightly by 0.1pc to hold over $86 today.

PM: UK growth shows 'the plan is working'

Rishi Sunak said the Government's plan was working, after the latest GDP figures showed the UK economy had grown by 0.2pc in the second quarter of the year.

The Prime Minister said: 

This is good news. At the beginning of the year I made growing the economy one of my top priorities, and we are making progress.

There's still more work to do, but today's figures show the plan is working.

Tesco's science-based climate targets approved

Retailers are being urged to match Tesco's scienced-based climate targets after the retailer had a landmark goal on reducing greenhouse gas emissions approved.

The supermarket has become one of the first companies in the world to set a validated science-based target for slashing emissions originating from forests, land and agriculture.

Its plans to become carbon neutral across its operations by 2035 and across its entire value chain by 2050 have been approved by the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi).

It is the official global body that defines, promotes and validates the best practice in setting climate targets in line with the Paris Agreement goals of limiting warming to 1.5C.

Tesco's independently validated targets include an interim goal of reducing absolute emissions from its own operations by 85pc, by 2030, compared to 2015.

Tanya Steele, chief executive of WWF, said: 

We welcome Tesco's important step forward in setting SBTi-validated emission targets; this must now be matched by action to drive down emissions across their entire value chain.

We are calling on all UK food retailers to match this ambition by setting science-based climate targets across their value chains, and acting to put our food system on a sustainable footing, from farm to fork.

UK growth weakest in 65 years outside recession

A sobering statistic from James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, after the British economy grew by 0.2pc in the three months to June. He said:

The good news is that the economy grew by 0.2pc in the second quarter, stronger than the flat growth many had expected. 

This is a continuation of the UK's relative resilience as we continue to dodge the technical recession experienced elsewhere in the face of the ongoing cost of living crisis.

But the big picture is that the UK economy has expanded by just 0.4pc since the start of 2022 - the weakest growth in 65 years outside of a full-blown recession.

With the economy continuing to stall, we are far from out of the cost of living crisis woods yet.

Such weak growth will feel like a recession to many as families struggle with the ever-rising cost of essentials and higher mortgage repayments.

FTSE 100 falls amid interest rate fears

The FTSE 100 has fallen 1pc in early trading as surprisingly strong UK economic growth leaves the door open for more interest rate rises from the Bank of England.

The economy grew by 0.2pc in the second quarter after an unexpectedly high 0.5pc growth in June as businesses bounced back from the extra May bank holiday for the Coronation.

Richard Flax, chief investment officer at Moneyfarm, said: ""The dominant narrative ends up being that rates probably stay higher for longer.

""If you were to see inflation begin to fall relatively quickly and growth to hold up, then maybe that would change the equation.""

John Choong, equity and markets analyst at InvestingReviews.co.uk, said: 

The FTSE 100 opened in the red this morning as markets were spooked by strong services data in the GDP figures. 

This may spur more rate hikes than markets expected, with the Bank of England handed more room to do so without triggering a recession given the economy's strength. 

As such, housebuilder stocks, which are sensitive to interest rate futures, are on the decline again with gilt yields taking a jump. 

Oil demand to grow at slower pace next year, says IEA

Although demand has hit a record high, the International Energy Agency said this is not expected to continue for long.

The Paris-based energy watchdog said growth in demand for oil next year will be slower than previously forecast amid lacklustre macroeconomic conditions and the burgeoning use of electric vehicles.

Growth is forecast to slow to 1 million barrels per day in 2024, it said in its August monthly oil market report, down by 150,000 bpd from its previous forecast.

IEA said: ""The global economic outlook remains challenging in the face of soaring interest rates and tighter bank credit, squeezing businesses that are already having to cope with sluggish manufacturing and trade.""

In 2023, global oil demand is set to expand by 2.2m barrels per day, buoyed by summer air travel, increased oil use in power generation and surging Chinese petrochemical activity.

That forecast is largely unchanged from the IEA's previous estimate.

Irn-Bru supplies at risk amid drivers strike

A union has warned that Irn-Bru supplies could be disrupted as drivers walk out in a dispute over pay.

Trucker and shunter drivers represented by Unite took strike action on Friday at AG Barr's production and distribution centre in Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire.

The 24-hour stoppage is the first of nine with the final one concluding on October 6. A continuous ban on overtime also came into effect this week.

The strike comes after workers rejected a 5pc wage rise, which Unite said equates to a ""significant, real-terms pay cut"" due to inflation.

Andy Brown, Unite industrial officer, said: 

Unite's members have no option but to take strike action because AG Barr stubbornly refuses to give its loyal workforce a fair share of its sparkling profits.

There is a steely determination among our members because 5% just doesn't cut it.

The 24-hour strike action will be the first of nine stoppages over the coming weeks.

AG Barr's stinginess has escalated this dispute when it could have been easily resolved with a fair pay offer.

Gas prices head for biggest weekly gain since June

European natural gas prices are headed for the biggest weekly gain since June as jitters re-emerge about the continent's ability to secure enough supplies ahead of winter. 

Benchmark futures soared 28pc on Wednesday after workers at natural gas plants in Australia voted in favour of holding strikes. 

Traders are awaiting news about the potential walkouts at the three facilities, which threaten to disrupt about 10pc of global liquefied natural gas exports.  

Dutch front-month futures, Europe's gas benchmark, have fallen 2pc in early trading toward â‚¬36 a megawatt-hour.

European storage sites, meanwhile, are more than 88pc full.

Gilt yields rise after UK grows faster than expected

Government borrowing costs have ticked higher after the latest GDP figures, as traders anticipate the Bank of England will continue to raise interest rates.

The yield on two-year gilts, which are sensitive to interest rates, has risen around four basis points to 4.91pc.

The benchmark 10-year bond yield - the rate the Government must promise to pay the holders of its debt when it matures - has moved even higher, rising seven basis points to 4.43pc.

Bank of England still expected to raise interest rates

Money markets still think it is likely that the Bank of England will raise interest rates at its next meeting in September, despite the unexpectedly strong growth in the UK economy.

Traders believe there is about an 86pc chance that rates will rise at the next Monetary Policy Committee meeting as they battle to bring inflation back to the Bank's 2pc target.

David Baker, a partner at Mazars, said:

The better-than-expected GDP figures are likely to galvanize the Bank of England's zeal to continue to raise interest rates. 

The Bank will remain very concerned about the persistence of inflation and will reflect on near full employment and high wage inflation as reasons to keep policy tight.

FTSE 100 pressured by stronger pound

The exporter-heavy FTSE 100 has opened lower as it came under pressure from a stronger pound after data showed the UK's economy surprisingly grew higher-than-expected in the second quarter.

Britain recorded unexpected growth in the second quarter, helped by a strong June performance. It grew 0.2pc in the second quarter, ahead of economists' predictions that GDP would be flat.

The FTSE 100 fell 0.6pc, while the sterling broke three straight days of losses after the data. The pound is up around 0.3pc.

Stuart Cole, chief macro economist at Equiti Capital, said: ""Any lingering fears that the UK economy is set to fall into a recession will likely have been put to bed now with these numbers.""

The more domestically-focussed FTSE 250 index edged 0.2pc down.

Miners dropped 1.1pc, leading sectoral declines as metal prices fell.

Heathrow passenger numbers jump 22pc

Heathrow said 7.7m passengers travelled through the airport in July, demonstrating the resurgence in foreign travel.

The figure is up 22pc on the total of 6.3m during the same month last year and is just 1pc below the figure of 7.8m recorded in July 2019 before the pandemic.

The year-on-year surge in passenger numbers last month was driven by fights to and from Asia (up 129pc) and North America (up 77pc).

Travel to those regions was limited a year earlier, partly because their pandemic restrictions lasted longer than in some other parts of the world.

July was Heathrow's busiest ever month for flights to Turkey, with more than 73,000 people flying to the country.

It also saw near-record levels of departures to Portugal, Italy and Gibraltar.

The west London airport reported a ""strong start to the summer season for passenger service"", with security queues ""consistently under five minutes"".

Inflation makes growth 'very difficult,' says minister

It is ""very difficult"" to achieve higher levels of growth when ""you are dealing with inflation pressures"", a Treasury minister has said.

Asked about the latest GDP data on Sky News, John Glen said: 

I think what it shows is there's a lot of resilience in the UK economy. We saw a record upgrade from the IMF (International Monetary Fund) of 0.7pc higher for the UK economy this year. That's welcome news. When I started in office nine-and-a-half months ago, recession was predicted.

But of course, you know, I would like that figure to be higher, but we are in the middle of the pack with respect to our peers in the G7.

Germany's is actually flat, Italy's minus 0.3pc. So, we've got a lot of work to do, but also in the context of the inflation pressures we see in the economy at the moment, it's obviously a delicate balancing act because we want to deal with that inflation, which is a massive impact for business confidence and for households as we know, and obviously it's very difficult to achieve higher levels of growth when you're dealing with inflation pressures.

Asked about the Prime Minister's pledge to grow the economy by the end of the year, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury said: ""We had the highest growth last year in the G7 and we are predicted in 2025 to get back up to that level.

""But you won't expect me to commentate on the outcome of something that will take all year: we are at half-time.""

Reeves: UK 'trapped in a low-growth, high-tax cycle'

After data showed that gross domestic product grew by 0.2pc in the second quarter, Labour shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: 

Growth in the economy is still on the floor.

Thirteen years of economic mismanagement under the Conservatives has left Britain worse off and trapped in a low-growth, high-tax cycle.

Labour's plan for the economy will boost growth, increase wages and bring down bills so working people are better off.

Strikes are holding back growth, says minister

The strikes and the extra bank holiday for the King's coronation have played a significant part in the UK's lack of growth, a Treasury minister has suggested.

John Glen was asked on Sky News what he thinks is behind ""this lack of growth"" and ""stagnation"".

He said: 

The strikes played a significant part. Obviously, the public sector is 20pc of our GDP. We had quite a lot of strikes in June, cancelled operations, that has a big impact.

We also had an additional bank holiday in May for the coronation, that has another effect.

But we are in line with our peers across Europe. And the fact is that 90pc of economies, the IMF says this year, will see a reduction in anticipated growth levels. These are global factors that are impacting us.

FTSE 100 falls after UK growth figures

Markets in London have fallen at the open despite data showing the British economy grew by more than expected in the three months to June.

The FTSE 100 has begun the day down 0.6pc to 7,575.38 while the domestically-focused FTSE 250 has fallen 0.2pc to 18,954.14.

We expect UK to avoid recession, says NIESR

One thing is in no doubt after today's GDP figures for the UK economy: economists are divided on whether Britain will fall into recession or avoid one.

Paula Bejarano Carbo, associate economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said:

Today's data indicate that GDP grew by 0.5pc in June relative to May, driven partially by a weaker May performance due to the extra bank holiday and a strong rebound in production output in June. 

Further, GDP grew by 0.2 per cent in the second quarter of 2023, as production and construction output grew strongly enough in June to pull the whole quarter ahead. 

Both figures represent positive surprises to GDP, despite the downside risks that high inflation and interest rates pose to economic growth. 

These data are in line with our recent UK Economic Outlook forecast in which, despite risks being tilted to the downside, we expect the UK to avoid a recession both this year and next.

Britain still faces mild recession this year, warn economists

The economy is still at risk of a recession later this year as the impact of higher interest rates begin to drag on British businesses, economists have warned.

 Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said:

Overall, the bank holiday, unusually warm weather and strikes make it hard to judge the true health of the economy. 

But our sense is that underlying activity is still growing, albeit at a snail's pace. 

We still think that with most of the drag from higher interest rates still to come, GDP will fall in Q3 and a mild recession will begin. 

That may not prevent the Bank of England from raising interest rates from 5.25pc now to 5.5pc in September. 

But it may mean that rates don't rise as far as the 5.75pc to 6pc envisaged by the consensus and investors.

Further interest rate rises could dampen growth, warns PwC

Divya Sridhar, economist at PwC, said the Bank of England's battle to bring down inflation risks stalling the growth in the UK economy recorded in the second quarter of the year.  He said:

Looking ahead, the good news is that annual CPI inflation fell to 7.9pc in June, falling below consensus expectations for the first time in the past few months. 

This meant that the Bank increased interest rates by 25 base points in its latest interest rate decision, as opposed to a larger hike.

However, with inflation expected to return to the 2pc target level only in 2025, we will likely see further interest rate rises which may continue to dampen growth expectations.

GDP data 'encouraging,' says IoD

Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said:

This is an encouraging set of data showing an economy performing strongly in June. There was decent growth in both retail and manufacturing, helped by a positive rebound effect from the previous month when activity had been reduced due to the extra bank holiday for the King's Coronation.

Looking across the full three months of the second quarter, we also see economic growth picking up compared to earlier in the year, although today's initial estimates are subject to revision. In particular, car production has benefited from falling input prices, and consumer demand has also proved resilient, helped by decent weather in June.

However the quarterly data also shows a worrying decline in business investment in ICT and machinery following the expiring of the government's super-deduction allowance at the end of March. It also shows falls in expenditure on scientific R&D, advertising and market research, which could be an early indicator of difficulties ahead.

'GDP is likely to weaken considerably,' warns economist

Suren Thiru, economics director at ICAEW, said that Britain's rebound from the Coronation was ""underwhelming"". He said:

While GDP bounced back strongly in June, this reflects more the reversal of the squeeze on output from the extra bank holiday in May, rather than a meaningful improvement in our growth trajectory.

The UK is entering a more challenging period where, with stubbornly high inflation, soaring interest rates and unseasonably wet weather, GDP is likely to weaken considerably in the third quarter, despite a boost from lower energy bills.

While interest rates will probably rise again in September, additional tightening risks further destabilising an already brittle economy by further suffocating consumer spending and businesses investment.

Economy remains below pre-pandemic levels

Today's figures show Britain has dodged recession, unlike the eurozone.

However, the figures also confirmed the UK's relatively poor performance since the onset of the pandemic.

Britain's economy now stands 0.2pc below its level in late 2019 as of the second quarter, compared with 0.2pc above for Germany, 1.7pc for France, 2.2pc for Italy and 6.2pc for the United States.

But equally true that the UK is still the only major economy below its pre-pandemic level of output #ontheonehandontheother pic.twitter.com/OGtV7VSuo8

Pound rises amid stronger UK growth

The pound has jumped after the surprisingly strong growth figures for the British economy.

Sterling has gained 0.3pc against the dollar, which is worth $1.27.

The pound has also improved 0.1pc against the euro, which is worth 86p.

Hunt: Actions to fight inflation are starting to take effect

After the latest ONS data, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said:

The actions we're taking to fight inflation are starting to take effect, which means we're laying the strong foundations needed to grow the economy.

The Bank of England are now forecasting that we will avoid recession, and if we stick to our plan to help people into work and boost business investment, the IMF have said over the longer-term we will grow faster than Germany, France and Italy.

UK economy 'continues to surprise on the upside'

Neil Birrell, chief investment office at asset manager Premier Miton, said the UK economy ""continues to surprise on the upside"". He said:

This is a feature we are seeing around the world and the UK is joining in. 

It gives the Bank of England a headache though, they may well have been thinking about pausing interest rate increases soon, but this data will make that more difficult and, at the same time, increases the risk of rates staying too high for too long and causing a worse recession. 

The Bank has a tightrope to negotiate in the next few months.

Car manufacturing and pharma lead growth in economy, say ONS

Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the Office for National Statistics, said:

The economy bounced back from the effects of May's extra bank holiday to record strong growth in June.

Manufacturing saw a particularly strong month with both cars and the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry seeing particular buoyant growth.

Services also had a strong month with publishing and car sales and legal services all doing well, though this was partially offset by falls in health, which was hit by further strike action.

Construction also grew strongly, as did pubs and restaurants, with both aided by the hot weather.

Across the quarter as a whole, GDP grew a little with widespread growth across manufacturing - aided by falling raw material prices - computer programming and hospitality. 

Britain shrugs off recession risk as economy grows

The UK economy grew slightly in the second quarter of the year, official figures show, raising hopes that Britain can avoid a recession despite rising interest rates.

Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 0.2pc in the three months to June, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), following an expansion of 0.1pc in the previous quarter.

It was ahead of economists expectations of zero growth, thanks to a big final month.

On a monthly basis, the economy grew by 0.5pc in June as businesses bounced back from the extra bank holidays for the Coronation in May.

It had slumped by 0.1pc in May, having grown by 0.2pc in April.

ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said: ""The economy bounced back from the effects of May's extra bank holiday to record strong growth in June. 

""Manufacturing saw a particularly strong month with both cars and the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry seeing particularly buoyant growth.""

The growth comes despite a sequence of 14 consecutive interest rate rises by the Bank of England as it battles to bring down rampant inflation, which still stands at 7.9pc.

GDP grew 0.5% in June and 0.2% across Quarter 2 (April to June) as a whole.

In June:

â–ªï¸ services grew 0.2%
â–ªï¸ production grew 1.8%
â–ªï¸ construction grew 1.6%

Good morning

Thanks for joining me as new data show that Britain's economy grew in the three months to June.

Gross domestic product product expanded by 0.2pc in the second quarter of the year, according to the Office for National Statistics.

What happened overnight 

Asian stocks hit a one-month low and logged a weekly loss while the dollar headed for a month of gains after US inflation came in steady.

Soft demand at a 30-year Treasury auction and a blowout in the US budget deficit also weighed on bonds, and their higher yields in turn moved the dollar higher - particularly against a yen pinned by yield control in Japan.

The yen touched a six-week low of 144.89 per dollar in early trade, though volumes were thinned owing to a public holiday in Japan. Its stock markets were closed and Treasuries went untraded in the Asia session.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.7pc with stocks in Hong Kong and China the biggest drag. It was down 1.6pc for the week.

Wall Street stocks closed slightly higher on Thursday despite handing back most of earlier gains during the choppy session. 

The S&P 500 nudged up less than 0.1pc to 4,468.83, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2pc to close at 35,176.15. The Nasdaq Composite finished up 0.1pc to 13,737.99.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.09pc from 4.01pc late Wednesday. The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, ticked up to 4.81pc from 4.80pc.

Grand National to undergo major changes amid animal rights pressure

The overhaul comes after protesters caused the 2023 race to be delayed but the changes, Aintree insists, are not a result of the protests

The Grand National is to undergo a raft of radical safety-related changes including reducing the size of the field and moving the first fence after animal rights protests.

The changes follow an annual review of the race which Aintree undertakes and was not, the racecourse insisted, in any way prompted by the course invasion by Animal Rising which delayed the start to this year's Grand National and consequently upset a number of horses, of which first fence fatality, Hill Sixteen, was one.

As a result of the review, next year's Grand National will include:

The Jockey Club has announced that it will cut the maximum number of runners for the first time since 1984, reducing the field size from 40 to 34, and in a bid to reduce the speed the field goes towards the first it will pull the first fence 60 yards closer to the start line as well as implementing a standing start.

The changes come just six months after animal rights protesters targeted Aintree and caused the 2023 Grand National to be delayed, before Hill Sixteen died at the first fence when the race eventually got under way after a 15-minute delay.

Other more nuanced alterations include bringing the race back from its post-5pm start to the middle of the afternoon, aiding ground management with more giving turf, and a parade which is not handler-led, meaning each horse can canter off in front of the stands before turning to look at the first fence.

While the earlier start time will be reintroduced with the going in mind, it will also reduce the length of time that the 80,000-strong in attendance will have to drink alcohol and intensify the atmosphere, which it can be argued contributed to this year's chaotic scenes.

Pre-race vet checks and eligibility criteria will also be ramped up, while Fence 11 will be pruned back two inches, although in the history of the National no horse has suffered a fatality at the open ditch.

It comes 10 years after the last major alterations to the famous course took place - the replacing of the wooden post core of the fences by a more forgiving ""˜plastic birch', the removal of most drop landings and shifting the start 90 yards forwards after two horses, including the Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Synchronised, died in the 2012 race.

One of the things that sets the National apart as a race and as the most colourful 10 minutes in sport is a full field of 40 horses racing away from the stands down over the first six fences and reducing that number by 15 per cent is the most controversial change.

Speaking about the decision, Aintree's clerk of the course, Sulekha Varma, who led the review process, said: ""The welfare of our racehorses and jockeys is our number one priority at Aintree and we have invested significantly in equine welfare over many years. We continually review the Grand National and following an in-depth, evidence-based review process this year, we are announcing several changes as part of its continued evolution.

""One of our key areas of focus is reducing the risk of incidents during the race. We know from research papers and internal analysis of jump races that there is a direct correlation between the number of runners and the risk of falling, unseating or being brought down.

""However, we also must consider that reducing the field size by too great a number could create a faster race and have an adverse impact in terms of safety. Using the information available to us and considering the experiences of participants, our conclusion is that 34 should be the maximum number of runners in the race which we hope will result in the least number of incidents.""

A recent trend has been the speeding up of the race in the early part. Horses traditionally met the first doing 28 mph but for the last three years it has been between 34-35 mph and the field has been getting to Becher's four lengths ahead even of 1990 when the track record was set.

The Jockey Club thought long and hard about putting the start after the first fence which would have reduced the distance to nearer four miles but stopped short of that by pulling the first fence back 60 yards.

Moving the start towards the first was a non-starter because of restrictions on the width of the course, part of which is the bend on the Mildmay course. In theory it should have the desired effect of slowing the pace at which the first is taken.

Nevin Truesdale, chief executive of the Jockey Club, said: ""I believe that a competitive, fair and safe Randox Grand National is one of the best ways of ensuring the sport continues to thrive for generations to come and remains an important part of Britain's culture and economy.

""That means our sport, like many other sports have done, needs to recognise when action needs to be taken to evolve because the safety and care of horses and jockeys will always be our number one priority. In making these changes at Aintree we are underlining our relentless focus on welfare and our commitment to powering the future of British racing.""

The changes were welcomed by dual National winning trainer Lucinda Russell whose Corach Rambler won last season's race. ""I am fully supportive of reducing the field size and I don't feel that six fewer runners will make a difference to the heritage of the race,"" she said. ""It can only be a good step and hopefully will help improve the start procedures.""

However, welfare group Animal Rising rejected the changes as measures with equine safety in mind.

""These changes are nothing more than an attempt to hide the realities of horse racing from the British public,"" said Louisa Hillwood, spokesperson for Animal Rising. ""Just as factory farms have rebranded themselves as free-range, or cage-free, the Jockey Club is trying to create a fanciful image of the industry. All this completely ignores our fundamentally broken relationship with other animals and the natural world.

""We all want to see these horses living happy lives in sanctuaries, not being raced; just as we need to see mass rewilding and a plant-based food system to really tackle our climate and nature crises.""

Grand National should have held nerve - runners and fences are not the problem

Whether you regard the changes made to next year's Randox Health Grand National as a pragmatic decision to tailor the race for modern tastes or an invitation for Animal Rising to pop by again in 2024, there is no question last season's race made for difficult viewing.

It is not easy to pin all the blame for the 2023 running's drama on the animal rights group's pitch invasion but the hold up instilled equal panic among the organisers and the competitors, and set off a chain of events which created a perfect storm for the National of a first fence fatality and loose horses galloping about like headless chickens. And the mop up continues.

Changes to the course to improve the safety of horses and jockeys are nothing new. As early as 1841 a stone wall in front of the stands was replaced by an open water after four of the 12 runners had come down at it. Ironically back then spectacle trumped safety and the wall was reinstated in 1843 - for one year only - because no faller at the water was not deemed exciting enough.

After a pile up at the Canal Turn in 1929, the ditch on the take-off side was filled in and, historically, the most significant changes have usually been reactive to an incident.

In 1990 I was the beneficiary of the landing side of Becher's Brook having been levelled and the ditch filled in after two fatalities there in 1989. Luckily it was not level enough to stop Uncle Merlin, the only horse going better than Mr Frisk, from tripping up there the second time we jumped it.

But, sitting from the comfort of the press room, I would have held my nerve on cutting numbers and moving the first fence 60 yards closer to the start, but I am all for the Jockey Club's more subtle changes.

I have been banging on like a stuck record for some time about not running the race so late in the day (not just because of my vested interest in avoiding the nightmare of having to bang out 1,000 words on the race in half an hour).

Quite apart from the ground management reasoning on a post-5pm start, there are 80,000 people there on their big day out who have been drinking for nearly six hours - who can blame them? - and, like the golf and cricket, crowds can get very raucous at the end of a ""˜long day'. That was very evident this year and both horses and jockeys, for whom it is also an incredibly long day, were incontrovertibly revved by it.

In 2013 the start was, quite rightly, pulled 90 yards down the course to get it out of the way of the bear-pit created by Aintree's then new Derby and Sefton grandstands. That was subsequently undone by new country-wide start procedures that required the runners to circle nearly a furlong behind the start, right back in the cauldron where the atmosphere, following the delay, has never been more febrile than it was in April. Now I would also have them circling in front of the start until required to line up, not behind it.

But what sets the National apart as a race is not only its extreme distance - thank goodness, though tempted, they did not alter that -- but the lush green fences, the distance to the first and from the last which all add to the unique challenge, and the number of runners. It was the only race boasting 40 horses.

I may be guilty of putting spectacle before safety but while it is all very well cutting the numbers, how that works all depends on the jockeys and how they use the extra space. There was already more room for 40 runners at Aintree than 27 in a hurdle around Cheltenham and if all the jockeys decide to take the inside then it does not really get anyone anywhere.

But in the last 10 years neither Minella Times (2021), who propelled Rachael Blackmore into mega-stardom, and Auroras Encore (2013) would have got into the race. Against that, did we think any less of Rough Quest's win against 26 rivals in 1996 or Bobbyjo's against 31 others in 1999? Nope.

And there is one thing you cannot legislate for. Today's jockeys will love this from an old long retired amateur but, on the whole, they ride too short. In a modern National the most common form of exit is the unseat. At times this year's race looked like an extreme dismounting contest or testing ground for prototype ejector seats.

It is, surely, no coincidence that the most successful jockeys in recent years have been Derek Fox, who rides three holes longer than anyone else, Leighton Aspell, Davy Russell, David Mullins and Ryan Mania who all rode a decent length. That is something jockeys need to work out for themselves.

If the National is the portal through which people come into racing or are completely turned off by it, then the Jockey Club sits between a rock and hard place on a tightrope on this. They are damned if they do, damned if they don't.

But by cutting the number of runners by 15 per cent, my worry is what happens after the next incident? Where do you go from here? Is it evolution or erosion?

Plants cry out when they need watering - but humans can't hear them

Scientists find recordings of plants show they make occasional ultrasonic popping noises likely heard by insects and mammals

Plants were generally thought to be an uncomplaining bunch, silently enduring the ravages of neglect, drought or disease with stoical forbearance.  

Now scientists have discovered that they cry out when distressed or need watering, even though humans cannot hear their high-pitched emergency calls. 

Recordings of tomato, tobacco, wheat, corn and cactus show that they make occasional ultrasonic popping noises - similar to bubble wrap - which ramp up when under stress.

The sounds are comparable in volume to normal human conversation, but are too high for human ears to detect. However it is likely they can be heard by insects, other mammals, and possibly other plants.

""An idyllic field of flowers can be a rather noisy place, it's just that we can't hear the sounds,"" said Professor Lilach Hadany from the School of Plant Sciences and Food Security at the Wise Faculty of Life Sciences at Tel Aviv University. 

'World is full of plant sounds'

""Our findings suggest that the world around us is full of plant sounds, and that these sounds contain information - for example about water scarcity or injury. 

""We assume that in nature the sounds emitted by plants are detected by creatures nearby, such as bats, rodents, various insects, and possibly also other plants - that can hear the high frequencies and derive relevant information.""

The notion that plants emit sounds has been controversial, with some studies suggesting they ""scream"" when they are cut or uprooted. Vibration detectors have also picked up pulses emanating from plants, but it was unknown if they actually became soundwaves which could be picked up. 

To find out, the team placed plants in an acoustic box in a quiet, isolated basement with no background noise. 

Ultrasonic microphones recording sounds at frequencies of 20-250 kilohertz were set up at a distance of about four inches from each plant. The maximum frequency detected by a human adult is around 16 kilohertz.

The plants were subjected to different treatments. Some had not been watered for five days, while others had their stems cut. A control group was left untouched. 

The recordings showed that the plants emitted sounds at frequencies of 40-80 kilohertz with unstressed plants making a click less than one sound per hour, on average, while the stressed plants - both dehydrated and injured - emitted dozens of sounds every hour.

Water-stressed plants began emitting noises before they were visibly dehydrated, and it was also possible to identify the plant, as well as what type of stress it was suffering from. 

For example a dehydrated tomato plant made a different pattern of clicks to a dehydrated cactus. Happy plants tended to be very quiet.

The team hopes that in future it may be possible to monitor plants and determine if they are struggling based on the pattern of noises. For example, sound recordings could be used in agricultural irrigation systems to monitor crop hydration and help distribute water more efficiently, the authors say.

""The fact that plants are making these sounds opens a whole new avenue of opportunities for communication, eavesdropping, and exploitation of these sounds,"" said co-senior author Yossi Yovel, a neuro-ecologist at Tel Aviv University.

How the plants are making the noises is still unclear, but the researchers suggest the popping may be caused by the formation and bursting of air bubbles in the plant's vascular system, a process called cavitation.

Other plants could also be listening in and benefiting from the sounds, the researchers believe. Previous research has shown that plants increase the concentration of sugar in their nectar when they ""hear"" the sounds made by pollinators.

""It's possible that other organisms could have evolved to hear and respond to these sounds,"" added Prof Hadany. 

""For example, a moth that intends to lay eggs on a plant or an animal that intends to eat a plant could use the sounds to help guide their decision.""

The research was published in the journal Cell.

A desert plant and the moon could hold the key to humanity's future

A risky space expedition could show how humans can put down roots 240,000 miles from home - and help sustain life on our own finite planet

The true rose of Jericho is a desert plant that blooms where other life falters. Growing in arid regions across Africa and the Middle East, in some of the most inhospitable corners of Earth, it is capable of withstanding temperatures in excess of 40C and prolonged periods of drought. Long after it dries out, the plant persists; waiting for a few drops of rain in order for its branches to unfurl and reveal its seeds.

The plant has long been regarded as possessing special powers. In desert folklore it was considered a weather prognosticator able to predict incoming rains. For Christians in the Middle East, it symbolised the resurrection of Jesus. Now another miracle is hoped for the true rose of Jericho - to become the first plant to flourish on the moon.

An international consortium of scientists has launched one of the most daring enterprises in the history of horticulture, to grow terrestrial plants in this alien environment 240,000 miles away. Their project, Aleph-1, which is part of the Australian space start-up Lunaria One, has been awarded a place on the Beresheet 2 mission to the moon scheduled for 2025. Launched by SpaceIL, an Israel-based not-for-profit space firm, the mission will send a lunar orbiter and two landers to the moon from an as yet unnamed base in the US. Aleph-1 has gained a berth on one of the landers for a small capsule weighing 1.5kg, carrying seeds of specially selected plant species that can endure hostile conditions, designed to germinate on landing.

It is an expedition laced with peril. The first Beresheet mission in 2019 ended in failure after the lunar lander's main engine shut down prematurely during its descent, causing it to crash. Should such a fate be avoided this time, whatever seeds have been selected have just 72 hours to sprout before the chamber powers down and stops transmitting information back to Earth.

The lead biologist on the project is Professor Simon Barak, who grew up in Ilford but is now based in Israel at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev's Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research, where he specialises in the molecular responses of plants to extreme environments. ""˜My motivation is if you really care about the future of humanity, you need to reach for the stars,' Barak says. ""˜In a few billion years the sun becomes a red giant and burns the planet. We will have gone extinct a long time before that. The Earth's resources are finite and we need to get off the planet - these are the first baby steps in growing food.'

To date, the only plant successfully grown on the moon is a cotton seed announced in January 2019 by Chinese scientists monitoring the Chang'e 4 probe (the first to land on the dark side of the moon). It was grown in a sealed canister, which also included the seeds of potato and arabidopsis (a hardy member of the brassica family known as thale cress), yeast and fruit fly eggs. But in the extremes of lunar temperature fluctuations, which can range from minus-173C to 127C, the seed quickly perished.

The Lunaria One team also includes Dr Graham Dorrington, an English aerospace engineer based at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, and Dr Anne Visscher, a seed specialist based at Kew Gardens in London. They are working alongside scientists from across the world, both devising the ideal specimens to fly to the moon (the true rose of Jericho is one such contender) and engineering the equipment that will offer the best chance of germination.

At the end of June, the Australian Space Agency provided a welcome boost with a $2.4 million grant to the Aleph-1 project. But the multitude of potential pitfalls make it a moonshot in every sense. This has not been helped by the announcement in May that several of Beresheet 2's major funders, who had previously contributed $45 million, were pulling out (albeit not because of concerns over the viability of the mission, but to fund other philanthropic ventures on Earth). In the face of rumours that the mission is in jeopardy, SpaceIL has stressed that it is confident about filling the funding gap, although the landing could now be delayed to 2026.

Beyond such issues, Barak admits the stress of the project is causing him sleepless nights: ""˜On one hand, I worry it won't germinate or something will go wrong with the chamber. On the other hand, we learn from failure. If it fails, the next mission will have learned why.'

There is another hope for the mission back on Earth. By trialling the species best adapted to survive the moon's extremes, the team aims to discover what will cope best on our increasingly inhospitable planet. As a result of climate change, temperatures are rising, droughts becoming more prolonged and severe, deserts are gobbling up previously fertile land and rainfall patterns are ever more difficult to predict. ""˜Fifty per cent of global crop losses are due to droughts and heatwaves and we are seeing this more frequently,' Barak says. ""˜I don't think people have woken up at all to the fact that agriculture and their food supplies are in danger.'

It is an argument echoed by Shimon Sarid, chief executive of SpaceIL. ""˜The chosen experiment has enormous value both for our life here on Earth and for humanity's progress in space exploration,' he says of the Lunaria One project. ""˜Examining plant growth under extreme conditions will help us to act correctly as far as food security is concerned.'

Israel's Negev desert, which comprises roughly 60 per cent of the country, offers a glimpse of this bold vision of the future. Over the decades this harsh landscape has been transformed into a hotbed of agriculture. The country now produces about 50 per cent of the global jojoba market (a plant grown principally for its oil). Vineyards, too, are cropping up across the Negev, with Barak's university colleague Professor Aaron Fait (also involved in Aleph-1) now a world-leading expert on desert viticulture.

Crops such as tomatoes are drip-fed water on schedules devised by algorithms to ensure maximum efficiency. The plants are irrigated with a combination of reservoirs of brackish water pumped from beneath the ground and Israel's network of desalination plants, which treat sea water. By 2030, according to government targets, the country will produce 1,100 million cubic metres of desalinated water a year. ""˜Most of our water problems are solved,' Barak says. Drip irrigation technology pioneered in Israel is now in use all over the world.

Despite 30 years living and working in Israel, Barak, 57, has kept true to his British roots. He still speaks with a recognisable Essex accent and proudly displays a scarf of his beloved Tottenham Hotspur in his study. He grew up the son of a businessman who ran a chain of camera shops and studied at Bancroft's School. His time there was unhappy and Barak recalls being subjected to continual antisemitic abuse. ""˜A week after I got there the other kids realised I was Jewish,' he says. ""˜From that day until the day I left I suffered antisemitism every single day. They would throw halfpennies on the floor and tell me to pick them up""¦ Some of the teachers were antisemitic, too.' Occasionally, the bullying turned violent. Barak didn't tell his parents about it but resolved in his teens to travel to Israel. After studying agricultural science at the University of Nottingham, he emigrated in 1990 at 25 and married an Israeli woman with whom he has two children in their 20s.

At Ben-Gurion University his work focuses on so-called extremophytes - plants that grow in some of the harshest conditions on Earth. ""˜We look at extremophytes and examine what genes they have which others do not in order to manipulate crop plants to make them more hardy,' he says.

His decision to pursue futuristic concepts of agriculture was motivated, in part, by a copy of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, bought for him by his mother. The dystopian version of genetic engineering it portrays, with humans divided into social castes at the embryonic stage, helped sway a significant proportion of 20th-century public opinion against gene-editing. But for Barak, the book inspired a mission. Gene-edited crops will be increasingly crucial, he insists, to ensure we can feed the world.

Climate change is already wreaking havoc on agriculture, with projections that global harvests could reduce by 10 per cent by the 2050s and 25 per cent by the end of the century, unless farmers can adapt. According to a separate 2017 study, globally it is estimated that, without effective adaptation and intervention, each 1C of temperature rise will reduce yields of maize by 7.4 per cent, wheat by six per cent, rice by 3.2 per cent and soybean by 3.1 per cent (crops that together comprise about two thirds of all calories consumed by humans). ""˜We have to use the whole arsenal of technologies at our disposal,' Barak says, ""˜otherwise people will starve.'

After the Nasa Apollo missions came to an end in 1972, enthusiasm dwindled in sending humans to the moon. People were deemed too expensive, with too much risk attached; superpowers instead focused on satellite technology and sending machines into orbit. But as life on Earth has become more perilous, the moon has regained its allure. The likes of Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are pumping billions into plans to make space habitable. After trimming budgets in the wake of the Cold War, countries are also stepping up and jostling for extraterrestrial supremacy. The space race has been given a rocket booster.

The Nasa Artemis programme aims to return astronauts to the surface of the moon by 2025. Beyond that, Nasa scientists talk of creating ""˜surface sustainability', establishing a long-term base camp from which to launch increasingly bold missions further into space. In these lunar settlements, plants will be vital for scrubbing carbon from the atmosphere and potentially providing sustainable sources of medicine. Plus, freeze-dried food will only take us so far; people are going need something decent to eat.

Last year, researchers made a bold leap in that direction, growing plants in lunar soil, known as regolith, for the first time. The grey dust and fine rubble contains virtually no nutrients. Apollo astronauts had collected samples for experiments back on Earth, but due to the scarcity of the material, none had previously been used.

A decade or so ago, Dr Anna-Lisa Paul and Dr Rob Ferl, colleagues at the University of Florida where they run its Space Plants Lab, started efforts to persuade Nasa to loan them some regolith. Having finally succeeded in securing a precious 12 grams, and operating from a locked laboratory kept secret even from their colleagues, they managed to grow the seedlings of arabidopsis by adding a diluted nutrient solution. ""˜After three days we realised every seed we had planted had germinated,' Paul says. ""˜Looking at the very first terrestrial organism growing in extraterrestrial materials, it really struck us what an amazing gift and privilege [it was] to be part of this legacy.'

Paul, a molecular biologist, has spent three decades working in this field. Such is the rate of advance, she predicts that within five years the scientific community will have ""˜pretty much nailed' growing plants on the moon. She has previously arranged 12 experiments at the International Space Station (ISS), which orbits 250 miles above Earth. Plants including Chinese cabbage, kale and bright orange zinnia flowers have all been successfully grown aboard the ISS.

In orbit the biggest problem hindering plant growth is the dramatically increased sense of weightlessness known as microgravity, Paul explains, with water droplets sticking to the surface of the roots rather than being sucked up. To counter this, researchers have devised a clay-based substrate that provides a capillary effect dispersing water around the roots.

The moon provides a different set of challenges. The gravity force is about a sixth of that on Earth, and on Mars it is about a third, meaning plants should be able to adapt relatively easily. But the biggest issue compared to the ISS (which is regularly restocked from Earth) is the lack of resources such as organic material to use as soil, and water (although reserves have been detected frozen in lunar craters at the moon's poles).

Radiation poses another major issue on the moon, as it is significantly enhanced due to the absence of a substantial atmosphere. According to a 2020 study, astronauts on the lunar surface are subjected to about 60 microsieverts of radiation per hour - five to 10 times higher than what passengers experience on a transatlantic jet and 200 times higher than on Earth's surface.

Paul stresses that this can be mitigated by the design of the environments the plants are grown in. She envisages shielded, temperature-regulated greenhouses with sunlight piped in through small openings to reduce the severity of its glare. ""˜You can shield things against radiation and develop plants that are more resistant,' she says. She also points out that plants cope far better at lower atmospheric pressure than humans, thriving at altitudes where people cannot survive for long. Plants, she insists, can adapt remarkably quickly to their environments. She cites one study that demonstrated that plants subjected to a pathogen attack were able to produce progeny with greater resistance.  

""˜I have every confidence we will converge on crops that will work,' she says. ""˜You might not be able to grow Irish potatoes but you might be able to grow sweet potatoes. It will require a different mindset but the environment will absolutely be able to support part of the nutritional needs of a habitat.'

The engineers working on designing and fabricating the Aleph-1 payload are primarily based at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. Lauren Fell, the project lead for Lunaria One and an associate lecturer at Queensland University of Technology, says while the final design has yet to be agreed, the sealed capsule in which the seeds are sent into space will be about 200mm by 100mm and made of metal alloys with an insulated layer. The seeds will be embedded in specialist mats being designed in New Zealand while the capsule will also contain an automatic watering system, LED lighting and a camera to transmit data back to Earth.

The design is intended to be as robust as possible, as much as anything to help the seeds survive a journey of several months. After launching, the landers will slowly orbit Earth until being pulled towards the moon; temperatures during this stage are estimated to vary between minus-20C and 60C. There are also hopes to include so-called ""˜resurrection plants' on board, species such as the Australian native grass Tripogon loliiformis, which can survive in a dormant state for months then unfurl and turn green when it encounters water.

Fell says images of the plants growing will be posted on the Lunaria One website during the 72 hours after landing. They are also encouraging the public to take part in control experiments at the same time on Earth. ""˜From a scientific perspective, it is a step towards having plants for oxygen, food, medicine when we do eventually go up there. The idealistic thing is we want to inspire people and get people involved in space.'

Fell, 33, started working in the field after taking part in Nasa challenges that crowdsource solutions to space problems. The daughter of an electrician and an accountant with little formal engineering training, in 2017 she won first prize in a challenge and she has since competed in 20 more - including designing a foldable radiation shield inspired by an armadillo's armour for astronauts travelling to Mars.

Plants, however, are her true love. In the confines of her two-bedroom flat in Brisbane, Australia, she tends in the region of 70 different specimens (at the last count). Her plants offer a retreat away from the congested and polluted streets outside. On the moon, Fell argues, they will be even more important. As well as being vital for sustenance, numerous studies have shown that plants help to preserve people's mental health. ""˜I can definitely imagine the difference it will make to astronauts travelling to the moon to be in a totally foreign and very barren environment and have parts of Earth growing and alive around them,' she says.

Would such home comforts persuade people to up sticks to the moon? Professor Barak believes that in 20 years, permanent settlements will be in operation on the lunar surface, and also on Mars within his lifetime. He says he is tempted to at least visit, but has already discussed the possibility of living there with his wife who has flat-out refused. Whether or not he ever sets foot on the moon, the small steps he and his colleagues are taking as agricultural pioneers could certainly facilitate a giant leap for mankind.

Wheat on track for biggest gain in eight years after failed Russian coup

Key moments

Chosen by us to get you up to speed at a glance

The price of wheat has climbed to a four-month high and is on course for its biggest monthly gain in eight years after the armed uprising in Russia.

Wheat futures rallied as much as 3.2pc as traders weighed the implications of the greatest challenge to Vladimir Putin's authority during his 23 years in power.

Convoys loyal to Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of the Wagner mercenary group, advanced toward Moscow on Saturday, demanding the removal of Vladimir Putin's army chiefs. 

A deal was struck to end the insurrection, prompting Prigozhin to halt his assault and agree to go into exile in Belarus. 

The situation could add to worries over the future of the pact that allows Ukraine to ship grain from Black Sea ports, known as the breadbasket of Europe. 

The deal is up for renewal in mid-July and Ukraine's infrastructure minister last week said he was ""not optimistic"" over its extension.

Meanwhile, Russia is expected to be the world's biggest wheat exporter this season and next, and any shift in the outlook for its shipments would have a significant impact.

The latest increase in prices puts wheat on track for a 29pc monthly gain, the biggest since 2015, which has also been driven by dry weather parching US corn and soy crops.

Increases in wheat prices are more likely to have a deeper impact more quickly on the developing world than the UK, where wheat makes up a smaller proportion of the total cost of a loaf of bread once energy costs, labour and packaging are taken into account.

Until then, here's why Britain's incompetent net zero elite is tearing up society with no backup plan, according to columnist Andrew Orlowski...

London Stock Exchange buys back minority stakes in Paris-based clearing house

Euronext has sold its minority stake in the European division of the London Stock Exchange's clearing house for â‚¬111m (£95.2m).

The pan-European stock exchange has agreed to sell its 11.1pc position in LCH SA, the French subsidiary of LCH Group, in a share buyback agreement.

The shares were purchased by the LCH Group, which is ultimately owned by the London Stock Exchange Group.

The deal was funded by existing cash resources and is expected to close early next month.

Clearing houses serve as middlemen in derivatives trades between banks.

The agreement hands LCH Group total control of its Paris-based clearing house, through which it plans to ""further accelerate"" the introduction of new products and services for customers.

Fund led by former UK chancellor George Osborne increases Ocado stake

An investment fund chaired by former UK chancellor George Osborne has raised its stake in online supermarket and robotics group Ocado.

Lingotto Investment Management has increased its position in Ocado above the 5pc disclosure threshold, according to regulatory findings released on Monday.

Lingotto is owned by Exor, one of Europe's largest diversified holding groups controlled by Italy's billionaire Agnelli family.

Mr Osborne, who led the Treasury from 2010 to 2016, was appointed as Lingotto's chair in May.

It follows last week's reports that Amazon is interested in acquiring Ocado Group, causing the grocery and technology company's share price to surge.

A takeover would further expand the online shopping giant's share of the UK supermarket sector, in addition to its checkout-free Amazon Fresh stores and high-end chain Whole Foods Market.

FTSE 100 closes in the red

The FTSE 100 has closed 0.11pc lower at 7,453.58, while the FTSE 250 midcap index ended 0.49pc down at 17,974.67.

 

Voluntary mortgage measures 'just not good enough', says shadow chancellor

Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has criticised the Government for not requiring lenders to sign up to support measures for borrowers. 

She told the House of Commons: ""All lenders need to play their part when people are struggling.""

The shadow chancellor said that while many banks are doing the right thing by their customers, a voluntary set of measures ""is just not good enough"".

She noted that there are over one million families still unprotected because their bank has not agreed to the voluntary mortgage charter. 

The Labour MP added that higher households costs under the ""Tory mortgage bombshell"" will for many mean ""holidays cancelled, family savings draining away and missing out on days spent with families and friends"".

Ms Reeves said: ""Just how bad does it have to get before the Chancellor recognises that mandatory action is needed to provide meaningful assistance?""

The Government's plan was also criticised by Ms Reeves for failing to address renters, who face higher monthly costs as landlords pass on mortgage rate increases. 

However, Mr Hunt said that the Labour party is ""positioning itself brilliantly as the pro inflation party"". 

He noted that Labour's plans to spend up to £28bn per year on green jobs and industry will worsen inflation. 

Responding to Ms Reeves's comments, Mr Hunt said:

She wants people to think she is fiscally responsible, she won't take risks with inflation, so why on earth is she committed to borrowing £28bn a year more when as a former Bank of England economist she should know that will be inflationary and push up the costs of mortages.

Government made a 'good start' to signing banks up to voluntary mortgage charter

The Government is working to sign up more banks to the voluntary ""˜mortgage charter', according to the Chancellor.

Speaking to the House of Commons, Jeremy Hunt said the Government has made a ""good start"" in getting lenders covering 85pc of the mortgage market to agree to measures protecting borrowers against rising rates. 

He added banks which fail to sign up to the charter will appear ""less competitive"" to many of thousands of families looking to renew their mortgage. 

The Chancellor dismissed calls for a windfall tax on bumper brofits enjoyed by British banks, noting that lenders already pay a surge charge on their corporate tax and must pay a levy on their balance sheets. 

Mr Hunt also recognised that banks are taking too long to pass on interest rate increases to savers. He said this issue was raised in ""no uncertain terms"" during his meeting with lenders last Friday and a solution is currently being worked on. 

Jeremy Hunt 'never once' had to question Bank of England's monetary policy

When asked about whether the Bank of England has ""got it right"" on tackling inflation, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told the House of Commons:

In my dealings with the Bank of England, I have never once had any reason to question their resolve to hit the target, but we need to make sure the forecasting is better.

The Chancellor noted that Andrew Bailey, the govenor of the Bank of England, has been ""very open"" about how its forecasting has not always been accurate and is conducting an independent review to see how it can do better. 

Jeremy Hunt: 85pc of mortgage market signed up to support measures

Jeremy Hunt, the Chancellor, has said that lenders covering 85pc of the mortgage market have signed up to the list of protections for borrowers announced last Friday. 

The ""˜mortgage charter' will support two groups of people: those at real risk of losing their home after missing their mortgage payments and those needing to change their mortgage as their fixed rates come to and end. 

Speaking to the House of Commons, he said the measures will take effect within the next few weeks. 

Prices for second class stamps to be capped amid fears over affordability

The price of a second class stamp will be capped in line with inflation amid fears that costs for households are rising more than necessary.

Senior business reporter James Warrington has the details:

Regulator Ofcom will roll out a ceiling on the price of sending letters by second class post under new proposals, meaning the average cost will not rise above inflation each year until at least 2029.

However, customers are still likely to pay more for stamps as inflation remains stubbornly high.

The consumer price index held steady at 8.7pc last month, defying hopes that price rises would ease in line with lower energy costs.

Royal Mail came under fire in April after introducing inflation-busting price rises of 16pc. The cost of a second class stamp rose to 75p, while first class stamps jumped from 95p to £1.10.

Royal Mail has argued that price rises are necessary to keep its Universal Service agreement sustainable...

German central bank risks bailout after money printing spree

That's all from me today. As ever, my colleague Adam Mawardi will guide you through to the evening.

I'll leave you with this from our economics editor Szu Ping Chan:

Germany's central bank may need a bailout to cover losses on the debt it hoovered up as part of the European Central Bank's (ECB) massive bond-buying programme, the country's federal auditor has warned.

The Bundesrechnungshof said losses faced by the Bundesbank on more than â‚¬650bn (£570bn) of bond purchases were ""substantial"" and ""could necessitate a recapitalisation with budgetary funds"".

The critical report of the ECB's so-called public sector purchase programme (PSPP) - akin to quantitative easing in the UK and US - throws future bond-buying sprees to prop up the single currency bloc in doubt.

Read why economists have blamed bond-buying programmes for stoking inflation.

Rising prices leave one in 10 fearful of keeping up with mortgage repayments

One in 10 mortgage holders feel they will not be able to afford their home loan if the cost of living continues to rise, a survey has found.

Two-fifths (41pc) expect to make cuts elsewhere to be able to pay their mortgage, with some saying they would need to borrow money from family or friends.

More than half (56pc) said the cost-of-living crisis will make it more of a struggle to pay their mortgage, according to research by insights agency Opinium.

Inflation remained at 8.7pc in May, despite hopes that inflation would slow and provide some relief for households.

Opinium's research among 2,000 people across the UK was carried out between June 20 and 23.

On June 22, the Bank of England base rate was hiked from 4.5pc to 5pc, pushing up the average monthly payment for someone on a tracker mortgage by around £47.43 per month.

Many homeowners are sitting on fixed-rate mortgages and so are yet to feel the mortgage pain from 13 base rate increases in a row.

Thousands of jobs lost as British delivery giant Tuffnells bought out of administration

More than 2,000 jobs have been confirmed as lost after one of Britain's biggest delivery companies Tuffnells was sold to a gig economy rival.

Chief business correspondent Oliver Gill has the details:

Shift, a delivery company founded by 29-year-old entrepreneur Jacob Corlett, has struck a deal to buy the Tuffnells brand and intellectual property from administrators Interpath.

The purchase comes after Tuffnells collapsed into administration earlier this month, bringing down the curtain on a business whose history can be traced back more than a century. The delivery company had struggled in recent months with soaring costs, and an increasingly competitive market. 

Sheffield-headquartered Tuffnells was founded in 1914 after Harold Tuffnell bought a horse and cart for £100 and began delivering goods.

Shift, meanwhile, was founded in 2017, and runs a system which it says is more efficient than traditional delivery companies, by adding orders into vans which are already on the roads.

Read how the takeover will affect the company.

Frankie & Bennie's owner on longest losing streak in 12 years

The owner of chains Frankie & Bennie's and Wagamama has endured its worst run on the stock market in 12 years as investor confidence in the UK economy weakens.

Shares in the Restaurant Group have fallen by 3.2pc today to put the company on track for a ninth straight day of declines.

It is the company's longest losing streak since 2011, with its shares losing 20pc of their value over the period.

It comes as the outlook darkens for the UK economy as the Bank of England put up interest rates to 5pc, increasing worries that Britain will suffer a recession as consumer spending is stifled.

US markets open flat

Wall Street was muted after the opening bell as investors remain concerned that the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary tightening will hurt the US economy.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were all little changed.

Challenge to Putin puts Black Sea grain deal at risk

The rapid chain of events in Russia has left the world trying to comprehend the political implications of a mutiny that opens cracks in Vladimir Putin's previously unquestioned authority in the Kremlin. 

Erik Meyersson, a strategist at Swedish bank SEB, said risks to the global wheat market ""appear much more muted"" as Putin remains in control. 

However, the bank now sees a lower probability of a further extension of the Black Sea grain deal in mid-July, adding to the potential for grain prices to move higher. 

Russia's agricultural industry is operating normally and production chains are stable, the Russian news agency Tass reported on Saturday, citing Agriculture Minister Dmitry Patrushev.

Interest rates will hit 5.5pc, say economists

The Bank of England will raise borrowing costs 50 basis points higher than was thought only two weeks ago, in two quarter-point moves, according to economists polled by Reuters.

Last week, the Bank surprised investors by raising interest rates half a percentage point to 5pc, and said there had been ""significant"" news suggesting persistently high inflation in Britain would take longer to fall.

Mortgage rates have already shot up, meaning the 800,000 borrowers who still need to refinance this year, and a further 1.6m homeowners next year, face much higher repayments.

Interest rates are now expected to peak at 5.5pc next quarter following 25 basis point hikes at the August and September meetings of the Monetary Policy Committee, according to the poll taken after the Bank's Thursday move.

In a June 14 poll, policymakers were expected to draw a halt at 5pc next quarter.

Bonds rally as global recession fears grow

Government bonds around the world have rallied as investors remained wary that global economies might take a bigger hit from rising interest rates by the Bank of England and other central banks.

The yield on benchmark 10-year UK gilts fell six basis points to 4.25pc, while the coupon on two-year UK bonds, which are susceptible to moves in borrowing costs, fell four basis points to 5.09pc.

European bond yields slumped, with Germany's 10-year benchmark yield tumbling five basis points to 2.3pc as data showed the business outlook deteriorated to the lowest seen this year.

US 10-year Treasury yields dropped five basis points to 3.68pc.

Investors have been growing more anxious that central bank will keep pushing rates higher and risk breaking fragile economies in an effort to bring down persistent inflation. 

Bonds are considered a safer bet for investors ahead of recessions because they offer guaranteed returns.

Andrew McCaffery, global chief investment officer at Fidelity International, said:

As central banks remain hawkish on the back of persistent inflationary pressure, the likelihood of a soft landing is falling.

Investors should be wary of taking on too much risk at this late stage of the cycle.

Wall Street expected to edge down as markets open

US stock markets are on track to slip at the opening bell after the short-lived revolt in Russia over the weekend.

Traders globally have been treading with caution after an aborted revolt by Russian mercenaries raised concerns over the stability of Vladimir Putin's regime and a potential disruption to the country's oil supply.

Shares of US defense companies including Raytheon Technologies and Lockheed Martin slipped about 1pc each in thin premarket trading.

Oil stocks like Exxon Mobil and Chevron dipped as crude prices reversed early gains spurred by the revolt.

It comes after a recent rally in US stocks sputtered last week after Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony to Congress in which he signalled there are more interest rate rises ahead.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq snapped its eight-week winning streak on Friday, its longest since March 2019, while the benchmark S&P 500 broke its five-week rally, its longest since November 2021.

In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat while the S&P 500 was down 0.1pc. The Nasdaq 100 was also off by 0.1pc.

Braemar asks to suspend shares as accounts delayed

Shipbroker Braemar has said it will not be able to publish its full year results on time and has asked for its shares to be suspended amid an investigation into payments it made a decade ago.

The company, which provides advice in shipping investment, chartering and risk management, has asked for its stock to cease trading temporarily from Monday until it can release its 2023 results.

Bosses said they expect record revenue and profitability for 2023, with revenue for the year of at least £150m and an underlying operating profit of at least £20m, doubling the £10.1m from the previous year.

Its shares plunged 22pc after the announcement as FRP conducts an investigation into a $3m transaction dating back to 2013, which involves payments made through to 2017.

The company said in a statement that the board ""is not presently comfortable with the manner in which the transaction has been historically represented"".

In an update to shareholders, the company said the financial impact of the investigation would not affect the underlying trading profit or cash position of the company for its 2023 reporting year. 

Pass savings onto shoppers, No 10 tells supermarkets

Downing Street has urged supermarkets to pass savings on to shoppers, and for banks to ensure savers benefit from higher interest rates.

Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will meet regulators on Wednesday to discuss ""what actions the regulators are taking, what more we could do working together, are there any potential barriers to them going further"", the Prime Minister's official spokesman told reporters.

He conceded there is ""no legal requirement"" for supermarkets to pass on savings, but added: ""There are rules around things like profiteering - I'm not suggesting that's the case here.

""Equally I think we would of course want supermarkets and others to rightly pass on the savings they are making with the fall in global energy costs. I think that's what the public would expect and they will vote with their feet if that's not the case.""

On banks, he said: ""We absolutely expect banks to pass through higher rates to savers, as they are for mortgage holders, and we're working closely with the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) who we know are monitoring it closely.

""It's not only the right thing to do but it also has the potential to reduce inflation because people are encouraged to save rather than spend.""

High prices hurting retail sales, says CBI survey

Retail sales fell for a second month as households struggled with high prices, according to the CBI. 

More stores reported a fall in sales volumes in the year to June than reported an increase, the lobbying group said, giving a net reading of minus nine - roughly in line with May, according to its latest survey. 

The outlook is a bit brighter, with sales volumes expected to stabilise in July. 

Soaring prices for essentials like food and rising mortgage and rental costs are eating into disposable income. 

As a result, the volume of goods being bought is falling even through the amount households are spending may be rising. 

CBI principal economist Martin Sartorius said:

Another contraction in sales volumes attests to the difficult trading environment being faced by the retail sector.

Households' finances are still under pressure from high inflation, which means that demand conditions for retailers are likely to remain challenging in the coming months.

Currys announces paid leave for IVF and gender reassignment

Currys has announced it will give paid leave to employees having fertility treatment or undergoing gender reassignment under a series of new diversity and inclusion policies.

The electricals and tech retailer announced the new measures today after developing them in collaboration with its National Forum - a collective of the company's employees from different areas of its business.

The new measures include support for those undergoing gender reassignment, with six weeks' additional paid leave, which can be used flexibly for appointments, surgery and recovery.

Those undergoing IVF or fertility treatment will now be able to take paid leave for up to six appointments per treatment or transfer cycle among a host of new policies.

Sarah Burrows, who works in sales, is co-chair of the Pride At Currys committee and has recent experience of gender reassignment, called the new policy ""really progressive"".

She said: ""I know first-hand the huge difference it will make.""

Elsewhere, the firm is introducing a new menopause support policy to encourage open conversation and provide information on practical support and reasonable adjustments.

Pound claws back gains after selloff sparked by interest rate rise

The pound has reversed some of its 0.8pc fall last week after the half point interest rate increase from the Bank of England stoked fears of a recession.

Against the dollar, sterling has gained 0.1pc to be worth $1.27.

The pound has risen 0.1pc against the euro, which is worth 85p, after the survey showing German business morale worsened for the second consecutive month in June, indicating Europe's largest economy is at risk of a longer recession.

German recession 'probably passed,' says Bundesbank

Not everyone has a bleak mood about the outlook for the German businesses.

Bundesbank thinks Europe's largest economy probably returned to growth after a winter recession and expanded ""slightly"" in the three months to June, the lender said in its monthly report.

The German central bank said ""the economic trough has probably passed,"" although it added that ""some burdens persist"".

It acknowledged that un the industrial sector, foreign demand continues to decline, weighing on production and exports.

It added Germany's inflation is ""likely to continue to fall in the coming months"".

Hope for German rebound 'is nothing more than hope'

German business morale worsened for the second consecutive month in June, a closely-watched survey has shown, indicating that Europe's largest economy faces an uphill battle to shake off recession.

Economics editor Szu Ping Chan has this insight:

Europe's largest economy is already suffering a technical recession after shrinking 0.3pc in the first quarter of 2023. 

This follows a drop of 0.5pc in the final quarter of last year. 

Carsten Brzeski at ING has warned that Germany now risked years of stagnation. 

He said: ""Today's disappointing Ifo index reading suggests that the hoped-for rebound of the German economy is nothing more than hope. 

Optimism is fading and the economy faces new growth concerns. 

""We are not saying that the economy will be stuck in recession for the next couple of years, but with several short and long-term challenges, growth will remain subdued at best.""

Rouble recovers after selloff in wake of Wagner coup

The Russian rouble has clawed back its losses after it tumbled to its lowest in nearly 15 months against the dollar in early trading as investors responded for the first time to an aborted mutiny by heavily armed mercenaries in Russia over the weekend.

The rouble has recovered to be 0.2pc stronger against the dollar at 84.64, recovering after hitting 87.23, its weakest point since March last year.

It had gained 0.3pc to trade at 92.10 versus the euro and 0.5pc against the pound to 107.79.

Mercenaries led by Yevgeny Prigozhin withdrew from the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don overnight on Saturday under a deal that halted their rapid advance on Moscow but left questions about President Vladimir Putin's grip on power.

 Alexey Antonov of Alor Broker said: 

Politics is again having a negative impact on investors' mood.

The peak of tensions has passed, but an unpleasant residue will linger for some time.

Wrexham-owners Reynolds and McElhenney take stake in F1 team

Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney are joining an investor group taking a 24pc equity stake in the parent company of the Renault Formula One team.

The â‚¬200m (£171m) deal values British-based Alpine Racing at around $900m (£706.5m) following the investment.

Alpine Racing's board of directors will be expanded to include Alec Scheiner, the co-founder and partner of Otro Capital, which is among the investors, along with RedBird Capital Partners.

""˜Deadpool' star Mr Reynolds leads Maximum Effort Investments with Mr McElhenney, of American comedy series ""˜It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia', and fellow-actor Michael B Jordan as co-investors.

Mr Reynolds and Mr McElhenney took over Wrexham in November 2020, funding the club's return to the Football League as Conference champions in April this year.

Their popular docu-series ""˜Welcome to Wrexham' has proved a big hit in North America, propelling the little-known club into the global spotlight.

Disposable income falls for 80pc of homes

Eight in 10 British households suffered a drop in their disposable incomes last month as rising living costs continue to weigh on spending. 

Some 40pc of households are in negative income territory ""” where take-home-pay does not cover bills and essentials ""” according Asda's income tracker. 

The average shortfall for those families was £42.50 ($54.16) a week in May. 

It comes as inflation remained at 8.7pc in May, unchanged from the previous month, forcing the Bank of England to raise interest rates to 5pc in a blow to mortgage holders.

The effect of inflation on shoppers is particularly pronounced for supermarkets, with food price inflation standing at 18.4pc.

Bosses from Tesco, Sainsbury's Asda and Morrisons will answer questions from the business committee of MPs on Tuesday.

Sainsbury's cuts prices as Chancellor plans to meet regulators

Sainsbury's has unveiled £15m of price cuts across cupboard essentials such as rice and pasta as the Chancellor prepares for a meeting with regulators aimed a tackling so-called ""greedflation"".

Britain's second largest supermarket will roll out the reductions on the own-brand items from Tuesday, also lowering prices on staples including corn flakes, jams and runny honey.

The company added that, from Monday, all Sainsbury's ""happier and healthier"" whole chicken breast fillets will be price-matched to Aldi for the first time.

It pledged to continue cutting prices on essential products throughout the summer.

The move comes as supermarkets are under increasing pressure to hand down savings they are seeing on wholesale items to consumers, who have faced punishing food price inflation in recent months.

The Bank of England suggested last week that some retailers are jacking up prices or failing to pass on lower costs to consumers as a way of increasing their profit margins at a time of stubborn inflation - a process known as ""greedflation"".

Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is to meet the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and the watchdogs for the energy, water and communications sectors on Wednesday to ask whether there is a profiteering problem in their sectors and what they are doing about it.

Typical mortgage rate highest in seven months

Britain's mortgage crisis shows no sign of abating as the average rate of a two-year fixed deal climbed to its highest level since November last year.

Borrowers taking out a deal today will typically have to pay 6.23pc from today, up from 6.19pc on Friday, according to Moneyfacts.

The average five-year fixed residential mortgage rate also inched up to 5.86pc, up from 5.83pc on Friday, which is also the highest since the end of November.

German outlook has 'clouded over noticeably'

Ifo's president Clemens Fuest said ""sentiment in the German economy has clouded over noticeably"" after data showed morale took a hit for the second straight month.

The Ifo institute said its business climate index stood at 88.5 following a reading of 91.5 in May.

Business expectations were significantly more pessimistic, falling to 83.6 in June from 88.3 in May. 

Companies also assessed their current situation more poorly, with the sentiment evaluating current conditions falling to 93.7 from 94.8.

This is an ugly chart from #Germany. The #Ifo Index dropped much more than expected in June.

And the Expectations subindex fell by nearly five points, the biggest monthly decline since August last year.

German recession worries deepen as confidence slumps

Germany risks staying mired in recession this year after a closely-watched barometer of business activity slumped in June.

The decline, led by a ""substantial"" decline in manufacturing, saw the closely-watched Ifo business climate index slump to 88.5 in June following May's reading of 91.5. 

This is the lowest reading since November 2022, in the wake of a surge in energy costs and well below analysts' expectations for a fall to 90.7. 

All sectors of the German economy suffered a decline, according to the survey, which noted that in manufacturing ""the business climate deteriorated substantially"". 

It added: ""Hardly any industry has been left untouched by this development."" 

Carsten Brzeski at ING said the ""collapse"" in activity suggested ""the rebound of the German economy has ended before it ever really began"". 

He added: ""The weaker-than-hoped-for Chinese reopening, a looming US recession and ongoing monetary policy tightening seem to be weighing on German company sentiment. 

""Also, the growing feeling that Germany is in for a longer period of subdued growth seems to have reached German business."" 

Klaus Wohlrabe, head of Ifo surveys, said the German economy now ""faces the prospect of a longer recession as domestic demand and the expectations of exporters have both weakened"".

HSBC to leave Canary Wharf for BT's former head office

HSBC is planning to leave its Canary Wharf headquarters and relocate to the City of London, the latest sign of how a shift to flexible work is reshaping demand for offices. 

The lender, which launched a review in September, will tell staff today that its preferred option is BT's former head office near St Paul's, according to the Times. 

The bank said it ""will now now begin more detailed discussions on a potential lease, with the intention to move in late 2026"".

HSBC has been looking for alternatives to its Docklands skyscraper as it looks to a more flexible workspace and adapts to the post-pandemic cityscape. 

The lease on its current address is due to expire in 2027. 

Orion Capital Management, a private equity firm, is redeveloping the former BT headquarters on Newgate Street. 

HSBC has resided in the 45-story 8 Canada Square building since 2002, when it was completed by Canary Wharf Group. 

The building is now owned by Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, which bought it for about £1.1bn in 2014.

FTSE 100 slumps as energy stocks hit

The FTSE 100 has slumped to a three-month low as financial and energy stocks suffered in the wake of the political instability over the weekend in major crude producer Russia.

The blue-chip index was down 0.3p, while the more domestically-focussed FTSE 250 midcap index has dropped 0.5pc.

The FTSE oil and gas index was down 0.2pc while banks slumped 0.7pc amid concerns for the UK economy as interest rates look set to move higher for longer.

Lloyds fell 1.9pc after JP Morgan downgraded the bank's rating to ""underweight"" from ""neutral"". 

Shares of Aston Martin has jumped 10.3pc after the luxury carmaker said it would enter into a strategic supply agreement with US electric vehicle company Lucid Group.

Cineworld Group dropped as much as 34.4pc after the cinema chain operator said it will file for administration as part of a proposed restructuring plan.

Deutsche Bank issues warning on Russian shares held by its clients

Deutsche Bank has reportedly told clients it can no longer guarantee full access to Russian stocks that belong to them, underlining the challenges global investors face to recover stranded investments in the country's companies.

The bank has discovered a discrepancy in so-called depositary receipts (DRs) - the certificates issued by a bank representing shares in a foreign company traded on a local stock exchange. 

Germany's largest bank said in a note dated June 9 that it had uncovered a shortfall in the shares linked to the DRs the bank had issued before the Ukraine invasion, according to Reuters. The shares have been held in Russia by a different depositary bank.

In the circular, Deutsche attributed the shortfall to a decision by Moscow to allow investors to convert some of the DRs into local stock. 

The conversion was carried out without the German bank's ""involvement or oversight"" and Deutsche was unable to reconcile the company shares with the depositary receipts.

It is the first major bank to formally inform depositary receipt holders that they may not get take ownership of precisely all the shares they are entitled to, Reuters reported.

Aston Martin shares surge following electric vehicle deal

Aston Martin shares have jumped by the most in five weeks after revealing a strategic supply agreement for high performance electric vehicles from Lucid Group.

Lucid will gain about a 3.7pc stake in the UK company in exchange for supplying Aston Martin with select powertrain components for battery electric vehicles.

The agreement would also complement the bespoke development of a single battery electric vehicle platform by Aston Martin and support the company's target to launch its first such vehicle in 2025.

Yew Tree Overseas, which owns about 21pc of Aston Martin's shares, has agreed to back the supply deal.

Aston Martin shares have gained 12pc.

Markets muted following short-lived Russian coup

There have been big moves in the value of Russia's currency and European gas prices following the geopolitical shock that challenged Vladimir Putin's rule.

However, aside from those areas, global markets have been a picture of relative calm.

Russia has largely become cut off from from global financial markets due to sanctions imposed since its invasion of Ukraine, thus limiting the impact on Monday.

As a result, initial moves have been modest and reflected the impact of a deal that was brokered to halt the Wagner mercenary group's advance toward Moscow. 

The agreement includes dropping criminal mutiny charges against Yevgeny Prigozhin and his fighters. 

Hong Kong shares of Russian aluminum producer Rusal, which offer some insight into appetite for the nation's assets, fell as much as 2.9pc.

UK markets edge up

It has been a relatively quiet start for the markets in London despite the extraordinary weekend in Russia.

The FTSE 100 has begun the day flat at 7,461.11 while the midcap FTSE 250 has risen 0.2pc to 18,103.12.

Cineworld still 'business as usual'

After announcing its intention to file for administration, Cineworld said: 

Cineworld continues to operate its global business and cinemas as usual without interruption and this will not be affected by the entry of Cineworld Group into administration.

The group and its brands around the world - including Regal, Cinema City, Picturehouse and Planet - are continuing to welcome customers to cinemas as usual.

The group continues to honour the terms of all existing customer membership programmes, including Regal Unlimited and Regal Crown Club in the United States and Cineworld Unlimited in the UK.

Cineworld shareholders face wipe out as chain files for administration

Stricken cinema chain Cineworld has said it will file for administration in the UK as part of a restructuring plan that is set to wipe out shareholders.

The world's second largest cinema chain said it will apply for administration for the London-listed company in July, which will see shares in the firm suspended.

But it stressed that the move will not impact the British operations for the holding company, with cinemas continuing to remain open as usual.

Cineworld filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US last year after being weighed down by its mammoth debts and weaker-than-hoped audience numbers.

The group, which also owns the Picturehouse brand, is moving forward with plans to restructure its near $5bn (£3.9bn) debt pile to allow it to exit bankruptcy.

It is also looking to raise $800m (£628m) through a rights offering and secure $1.46bn (£1.1bn) of new debt financing.

Gas prices jump after failed coup in Russia

European natural gas prices have jumped amid nervousness over the short-lived rebellion in Russia.  

Benchmark futures rose as much as 8.4pc with gas already having soared about 30pc this month as outages and nervousness about supply roiled markets. 

The dramatic mutiny over the weekend is the latest factor adding to volatility. 

While Europe has significantly reduced its dependence on Russian pipeline gas, it still receives large amounts of Russian LNG. 

Tom Marzec-Manser, head of gas analytics at ICIS in London, said:

Russian geopolitical risk now is significantly higher than before the weekend.

The uncertainty of what could happen in the coming weeks within Russia itself - rather than within Ukraine - is likely to push markets higher on Monday.

Dutch front-month futures, Europe's pricing benchmark, were last up 7.4pc to just below $35 per megawatt hour.

Primark owner boosts profit outlook as prices rise

The owner of Primark said its sales jumped over the latest quarter amid higher prices, and was now upgrading its full-year profit expectations.

Associated British Foods, which also has major sugar, ingredients and other food businesses, said its total sales surged by 16pc over the three months to the end of May to £4.7bn.

Sales in Primark grew by 13pc across its global stores, helped by higher average selling prices for its products, the firm said.

Seasonal clothing and accessories, as well as health and beauty products sold particularly well during the period, the retailer said.

The company now expects its adjusted operating profit for the full year to be slightly ahead of last year.

Rouble tumbles to 15-month low after failed coup against Putin

The Russian rouble tumbled to a near 15-month low against the dollar as markets responded for the first time to the short-lived military coup against Vladimir Putin.

The rouble has lost as much as 3pc against the dollar, hitting 86.88 as markets opened, its weakest point since late March last year, about a month after Russia invaded Ukraine.

The rouble has lost about 13pc of its value against the US currency this year, making it one of the worst performers among emerging markets worldwide.

It comes as Goldman Sachs warned that the world faces the risk of higher oil prices long-term, although Brent crude was little changed overnight after the Wagner mercenary group called off its march on Moscow over the weekend.

Analysts at the bank believe that while the short-term impact is likely to be muted, the unprecedented challenge to Putin's authority risks a supply shock if the Russian leader's 23 years in power come to an end.

Daan Struyven and Callum Bruce said: ""The higher risk of lower supply at some point may put some upward pressure on prices.""

Goldman Sachs addressed a slate of possible, longer-term risks. Since the rebellion was initiated around Rostov-on-Don in the south ""” by the Sea of Azov, which filters into the Black Sea ""” oil infrastructure in that region may face a relatively higher risk of disruption or blockade, it said.

RBC Capital Markets LLC analysts including Helima Croft said: ""The immediate challenge to the Putin regime appears to have receded. 

""However, the risk of further civil unrest in Russia now must be factored into our oil analysis for the back half of the year.""

Oil was slightly higher after the Wagner Group abandoned its coup against the Putin regime having marched to within 150 miles of Moscow virtually unopposed.

Brent crude has gained 0.6pc to more than $74 a barrel while the rouble dropped to a 15-month low early in Moscow.

Russian mercenaries made a short-lived rebellion on Saturday, seizing the southern city of Rostov and advancing on Moscow demanding the removal of Russian military commanders in charge of the war in Ukraine.

The private Wagner army then withdrew after striking a deal guaranteeing their safety and the passage of their leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, to Belarus.

Ray Attrill, head of foreign exchange strategy at National Australia Bank in Sydney, said: ""I don't think the market can get its head around working out if there are implications.""

Good morning

The rouble dropped to a 15-month low in Moscow as an aborted weekend mutiny by the Wagner Group of mercenaries raised questions about Russian stability.

Oil was little changed but faced warnings about its long-term outlook from Goldman Sachs as rhe unprecedented challenge to Vladimir Putin's authority risks a supply shock if the Russian leader's 23 years in power come to an end.

Racing can defeat animal rights complaints... by copying McDonald's

The Grand National is to undergo several radical changes after animal rights protests in this year's race

A racecourse veterinary surgeon has called for racing to radically change how it engages with its critics in light of the animal rights invasion of Aintree in April that caused a 15-minute delay to the start of the Grand National.

Citing the fast-food chain McDonald's and zoos as good examples of businesses that swam with the tide rather than against it, Gemma Pearson - an expert in equine behavioural medicine employed by the Horse Trust, based at the Royal School of Veterinary Studies at the University of Edinburgh and a race-day vet at Musselburgh - recently published a paper with three fellow scientists on the narratives surrounding racehorse welfare that took place in the immediate aftermath of the 2023 race.

With the Becher Chase being run over a modified National course on Saturday, Pearson's paper warns that racing could go the way of circus animals or performing orcas if it does not take its head out of the sand while attitudes change around it.

""I was watching the Grand National,"" Pearson, 39, who can see both sides of the argument, recalls. ""The protesters came on and then the commentary - I just had my head in my hands.

""They believe they are doing the best thing for racing but they cannot see they are actually digging a hole for it by saying things like, ""˜You don't realise how much these horses are loved at home', or by belittling the protesters without addressing the reason they are there.""

As this relates to changing public attitudes, she got in touch with Tamzin Furtado, a human behaviour change specialist, Janet Douglas, the ""˜queen' of social licence, and Inga Wolframm, who researches sustainable equestrianism.

""We debated whether to publish something because it's a hot potato,"" she says. ""I don't want to upset people and it would be very tempting not to but someone's got to say it. We're blunt in some places. We focused on that commentary, the radio phone-ins and a few things online. It's not all wrong but bits of it are.""

Social licence is not something that just exists around horses or was magicked up recently. It started in the mining industry decades ago. ""There is plenty of research on how to lose social licence and how to maintain it,"" Pearson points out.

""McDonald's did a really good job. Animal rights protestors were saying McDonald's didn't care about the welfare of beef going into their burgers so they employed independent welfare scientists, looked at slaughterhouse regimes and handling facilities, audited it, put the results online so there was transparency.

""Rather than saying, ""˜No, we're happy with the way our cattle are slaughtered', they said, ""˜Ok, we'll get an independent expert in to improve things'.

""Racing has to engage with its critics, not dismiss or belittle them. Listen to what they are saying. Not just the moderate critics but even the more extreme ones. Listen to the stuff they are public about, reflect on it. If you live in the bubble of an industry, everything is so normal to you that you don't reflect on it.

""Also we know from human behaviour change science that if someone critiques you, that's a part of your personal identity so you feel threatened. It's not easy but you've got to ask if there's any merit in what they are saying.""

""˜Horses don't want to live like kings, they want to live like horses'

Citing the difference between zoos and circuses, Pearson believes racing needs to make some decisions. ""Circuses can't use animals now but zoos can. In zoos, the changes in welfare have been unbelievable. They invested in independent welfare scientists, got them to measure this and it's not necessarily that you're doing something wrong but that you can do better. Zoos have invested time and money in measuring welfare and striving to improve.

""Circuses said, ""˜We're the experts, we know what we're doing', and the public lost confidence with them. Social licence is all about trust. If the public trust you, they will continue to let you self-regulate.

""But if they don't, they will lobby the Government for legislation. Trust is key. You often hear ""˜if we give an inch, they'll take a mile' - if you're proactive and willing to make changes, the public won't be interested in Animal Rising anymore. Being brave is often the way forward.

""If people say, ""˜We're worried about horses being injured', say that's a very valid concern but tell them we've got the jump racing risk model coming on line, we're invested in it. The fatality rate used to be 0.3, it's now 0.2. Use the numbers. The reduction of a third in 20 years is a massive difference but we're going to continue reducing it. You'll never get to zero but people will trust that you care. You have to walk the walk. You can't say you'll do things and not do them.

""Don't say, ""˜Horses live like kings'. Horses don't want to live like kings, they want to live like horses. We know they want to be turned out in a field with other horses. That's why we championed Lucinda Russell in the paper. After Corach Rambler won [the Grand National] he went to Kelso. She was asked to take him elsewhere but said, ""˜No, he's out in a field with other horses'.

""In yards we have high rates of cribbing or windsucking. These are coping mechanisms for stress. We have to acknowledge we can improve here. You probably make yourself sound a bit silly saying racehorses have the best life of any horses, because they probably don't. But we know to change things you have to nudge people in the right direction. The zoos moved quietly in the right directions. If you said all horses had to live in a field 24/7 or in a barn, it's not going to happen.

""I'm passionate about racing. If we do what zoos did, think carefully, tackle problems transparently, racing will survive. If we do what the circuses did and say we know better, ignore the critics, say it's they that need educating, it won't. If stakeholders in racing think a little bit more about social licence principles in what they're saying and if they are brave and willing to make changes, racing's got a really bright future.""

Lecturer ignored ""˜typical' farmer who told student to ""˜take her top off'

Veterinary students left in tears after suffering ""˜sexist' abuse and being forced to do household cleaning during placement

A ""sexist"" farmer who told a veterinary student to take her top off had his behaviour dismissed by a university lecturer who said it was ""typical for farmers to act like this"", it has been claimed.

Veterinary science students at Bristol University reported the farmer to their lecturer after they said they were subjected to sexist and inappropriate behaviour during a mandatory lambing placement.

The farmer allegedly told one student to ""take your top off"" so that she would be able to help paint one of his lodges, The Bristol Tab reported.

Another student on the same placement alleged that he sent inappropriate TikTok videos, including one depicting women dancing in short skirts, which the farmer sent with the caption: ""This is what I want to see in my shed then on Saturday night x"". Another video made constant derogatory remarks concerning the role of women in society, the student said.

Undergraduates on the veterinary science course are sent on lambing placements in their first two years of study. It is usually their first placement, and is arranged by the university.

""˜Gate b---h' and ""˜cherub slag'

The students claimed that on multiple occasions, the farmer would refer to them as his ""gate b---h"" and ""cherub slag"", and tell them that his friends were going to come and visit them in the middle of the night while they were alone in the lambing shed.

One evening, they said they were told they had been promised a ""treat"" the next morning, but when they came downstairs they were told they would be spending the day cleaning his lodgings, even though cleaners were already employed by him.

""We went downstairs and he just handed us cleaning supplies and told us that we would be cleaning all day,"" one student said.

The farmer allegedly then told the students: ""You are women, you like cleaning.""

One student said she had been left alone in the middle of the countryside in the early hours of the morning because the farmer forgot to pick her up. ""On the second and third day, he forgot to feed us, he just disappeared for the whole time. One night he even forgot to pick me up,"" she told The Tab.

She said: ""I would cry so much, calling my dad in tears.""

After the placement ended, messages seen by The Tab allegedly showed the farmer continued to contact the students, referring to them as ""pebble"".

""˜Typical for farmers to act like this'

When they returned to university after Easter last year, the students said they complained to a senior member of staff at the veterinary school about the farmer's behaviour.

However, they said their concerns were disregarded and they were told: ""It's just typical for farmers to act like this.""

The lecturer also allegedly told the students: ""It must have been an admin error, they [the farm] were not meant to be on the list"" due to prior complaints.

One student said: ""I asked her what's going to happen now, will he be taken off the list again?

""She responded by saying that she didn't think that was necessary and that they might contact the family ahead of next year and give them some tips on how to be a bit more welcoming.""

The students said that after their complaint, two more students were sent to the same farm this year. Nobody at the university followed up with them about their concerns after they reported it, they added.

The university said this week that it has launched an investigation into the students' complaints.

""˜Deeply saddened and shocked'

Prof Sheena Warman, deputy head of the Vet School at the University of Bristol, said: ""I am extremely concerned to hear about the experiences of these students and I'm very sorry they were disappointed by the feedback from their lecturer when this was raised with them afterwards.

""The behaviour and attitudes they have described during their placement are completely unacceptable. I have met with the students to assure them that their concerns are being taken seriously and to apologise for the distress this has caused. We are now looking into this as a matter of urgency and have taken the farm in question off our placements list while we investigate.""

The Association of Veterinary Students said it was ""deeply saddened and shocked"" to learn of the alleged sexism and harassment faced by the students.

In a statement, it said that it has been contacted by other students who claimed they have faced similar harassment issues.

The association is preparing to release a survey to urgently gather information on how common such experiences are on placements.

George Marwick, entrepreneur who brought modern farming to Orkney and led the islands' 1970s oil negotiations - obituary

His innovation was to use silage, rather than neeps and hay, and controversially introduced chemical fertilisers to grow better grass

George Marwick, who has died aged 91, was a progressive farmer whose cheese, made on his family farm on the wind-battered north-westerly tip of the Orkney mainland and on the remote Kintyre Peninsula, fetched high prices, and was sold at Harrods; in the 1970s, as the first ever Convener of the newly instituted Orkney Island Council, he skilfully led negotiations with oil companies to get Orkney a good deal, resulting in the strategic Oil Reserve Fund, which is now worth over £200m.

He was born on February 27 1932, a scion of Orkney's notable Marwick family; his relatives included the archaeologist Dr Hugh Marwick and the folklorist Ernest Walker Marwick, who anthologised Orkney verse. His father Robert Marwick was a civil engineer in charge of the construction of several wartime aerodromes, including Wick, and was later a director of George Wimpey Ltd; his mother Agnes (nÃ©e Robson) was from Northumberland.

After graduating from Edinburgh School of Agriculture in 1953, George Marwick returned to manage the family farm of Swannay at Birsay. Hitherto cows on Orkney had been fed with neeps (turnips) and hay (which was difficult to make in the rainy climate); Marwick's innovation was to use silage, which was a better option in Orkney's damp and temperate conditions (typically 15C during the summer, with an annual rainfall of around 1 metre).

Growing better grass became his metier. He believed that only good grass would produce good milk, which in turn was essential for good cheese. He introduced chemical fertilisers, such as nitrogen, before his neighbours, who thought him iconoclastic, but soon he was able to sell Swannay Farm cheese at a premium. 

By 2001, when the capital expenditure required by stricter EU regulations forced its closure, Swannay was making 280 tonnes of Cheddar annually, drawing on herd of 400 dairy cows, across 870 acres, and also buying in 900,000 litres of milk each year from the Orkney dairy farmers' cooperative.

In 1968, he was asked by a couple of his farming neighbours to stand for Orkney County Council. He served for 10 years and, in 1975, became the first Convener of Orkney Island Council after Scottish local government reforms of the early 1970s.

The greatest challenge of his term as Convener was dealing with new opportunities presented by North Sea oil. His positive attitude - ""If it is good for Orkney we should grasp it with both hands"" - and entrepreneurial credentials made him the ideal figure to lead negotiations with the oil men.

The many well-paid jobs created at Occidental's Flotta Oil Terminal and in OIC's new Department of Harbours were a direct result of Orkney's well-managed welcome to the oil industry under Marwick's leadership. Most importantly, the oil money became the Oil Reserve Fund, now standing at about £200 million, which has cushioned for Orkney the recent Scottish Government funding cuts to local authorities.

In the mid-1970s, Marwick and Rupert Cooper took over and revamped the ailing Campbelltown Creamery, thus ensuring the continued viability of many dairy farms in the Kintyre Peninsula. Here they also produced high-quality cheese to complement that made at Swannay, and which was sold at a premium in the best outlets, including Harrods.

He was also a Director of North Eastern Farmers, Orkney Islands Shipping Company and Chairman of the North of Scotland Water Board, a member of the Countryside Commission for Scotland and of the Council of the National Trust for Scotland, an Honorary Sheriff in Kirkwall Sheriff Court and a Justice of the Peace.

Marwick was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Orkney in 1976, Vice Lord-Lieutenant in 1995 and Lord-Lieutenant from 1997 to 2007. He said one of the most satisfying aspects of being Lord-Lieutenant was the ex-officio appointment as chairman of The Society of The Friends of St Magnus Cathedral, which helps keep up the impressive medieval St Magnus Cathedral, which is - unusually - not owned by the Church, but was bestowed upon the people of Kirkwall by James III of Scotland in 1486. George Marwick was appointed CVO in 2007.

He was the first president of Orkney Rugby Football Club in 1966, and enjoyed motorsport and rough shooting.

George Marwick married, first, in 1958 Copenhagen-born Hanne Jensen, and they had three daughters, one of whom, Kareen, represented Britain in the rowing team at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. The marriage was dissolved in 1989 and he married, secondly, Norma Gerrard (nÃ©e Helm) in 1990. He is survived by his second wife and three daughters from his first marriage.

George Marwick, born February 27 1932, died September 1 2023

Vegan diet ""˜cannot easily provide some vital nutrients,' major report warns

The findings come after the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation examined more than 500 scientific papers on animal foods

Eggs, milk and meat offer vital nutrients that cannot be easily obtained through a vegan diet, a major United Nations report has warned.

""ŒIn the most comprehensive analysis to date, a scientific advisory committee for the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) looked at more than 500 scientific papers to weigh up the risks and benefits of animal foods.

""ŒThey concluded that meat, eggs and milk provide important nutrients such as protein, essential fatty-acids, iron, calcium, zinc, selenium, Vitamin B12 and choline, as well as compounds like carnitine, creatine and taurine, which are important for health and development.

""ŒThe experts warned that such nutrients ""cannot easily be obtained from plant-based foods"" and said animal foods were particularly important during pregnancy and lactation, childhood, adolescence and old age.

""ŒIron and vitamin A are among the most common micronutrient deficiencies around the world, particularly in children and pregnant women, the report states.""Œ

The authors also warn that plant-based meat alternatives were often deficient in essential nutrients and high in saturated fat, sodium and sugar.

In a forward in the report, FAO deputy director-general Maria Helena Semedo, and chief economist MÃ¡ximo Torero Cullen said: ""Terrestrial animal source foods provide energy and many essential nutrients, such as protein, fatty acids and several vitamins and minerals that are less common in other food types.""Œ

""Livestock species and breeds are adapted to a wide range of environments. They contribute to healthy diets, particularly in areas less suited or unsuitable for crop production.""

""ŒThe report concluded that milk and dairy intake during pregnancy increases birth weight, while for school-aged children and adolescents, it increases height and reduces obesity.

""ŒIn adults, milk and dairy reduces risk of all-cause mortality, hypertension, stroke, type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, obesity, osteoporosis and fractures, the authors found.

""ŒBeef consumption has also been shown to improve cognitive outcomes, and can protect against iron deficiency, and eating fewer than 72 grams a day is considered safe. However the authors warned against eating even low levels of processed meat.

""ŒThe team also said there was ""relatively robust evidence"" that egg consumption among adults does not increase the risk of stroke or coronary heart disease.

Vegans 'need to be more careful'

""ŒCommenting on the report, Gunter Kuhnle, Professor of Nutrition and Food Science at the University of Reading, said: ""It is difficult to disagree with this, and people who avoid animal-based foods generally need to be more careful to ensure that they meet all relevant nutrient requirements, especially regarding iron and Vitamin B12.

""Œ""However, we also need plant-based foods, as they are the main source of fibre, many vitamins and minerals and bioactive compounds such as polyphenols or glucosinolates, of which many believe they are important.

""Œ""In the end, it is about a balanced diet with animal and plant based products. A vegan [or] vegetarian diet needs a bit more planning to get the relevant nutrients - especially during the times mentioned by the FAO report such as pregnancy, breastfeeding or in childhood.""

""ŒProf Kuhnle said that it was often difficult to disentangle the health benefits of a vegetarian diet because vegetarians tended to be more health conscious overall.

""ŒOxford University has been monitoring the health of 65,000 men and women since the 1990s through its European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC).

""ŒThe study found rates of bowel cancer were similar among vegetarians and healthy meat eaters.

""ŒHowever the FAO report also said that farming needed to tackle issues such as deforestation, water use, overgrazing and greenhouse gas emissions.

UK to fast-track approval for lab-grown meat with Israel deal

Ministers hope to ease the cost of living crisis by providing cheaper food sources

Approval of lab-grown meat in the UK is to be fast-tracked, The Telegraph understands, in a drive for food security and alternative forms of environmentally-friendly meat.

Ministers and regulators are working to speed up approval of the novel food to ease the cost of living and provide more sources of meat in a world with a swelling population.

No lab-grown meat is currently authorised for sale in the UK. 

However, The Telegraph understands that the UK Government is poised to sign a bilateral agreement to boost collaboration on lab-grown meat with Israel, which is at the forefront of the movement.

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is also ""considering future changes"" to the approval process of cell-cultivated meat in order to ""remove unnecessary burdens on business"" and cut red tape.

It comes as the cost of meat is rising amid economic turmoil and the environmental impact of agriculture becomes an ever-growing contributor to global warming owing to a booming global population.

George Freeman, the science minister, said: ""There are some good signs that in the DNA of homo sapiens there's a need for meat and we are not going to be able to meet that through traditional husbandry with nine billion hungry mouths to feed by 2050 - we're going to have to generate novel sources.""

""If we don't quickly generate ways to develop very low cost protein, we're going to see huge geographical instability.""

More than £1 million will be dedicated to agricultural technology developments, primarily lab-grown meat, and testing them against stringent requirements set out by the FSA.

Aleph Farms, an Israeli company, became the first to submit cell-cultivated meat for FSA approval in August. 

The technology involves 3D printing animal cells into a shape and recreating the structure, density, flavour and texture of a real meat product, such as nuggets or steak.

It prevents the need to grow and slaughter animals, saving on time, space, emissions and loss of life.

There are around 60 companies working on cell-cultivated meat worldwide, with more than a third based in the UK.

The agri-tech agreement between the UK and Israel builds on a recently-signed deal to boost quantum research and academia links that will allow Israeli enterprises to submit new technologies for regulatory approval in the UK.

However, the field of cell-cultivated meats is a grey area for existing legislation and requires approval as a precision breeding food and a novel food in order to be sold in the UK.

James Cooper, deputy director of food policy at the FSA, said: ""The FSA is committed to supporting business innovation in new markets by delivering effective and proportionate regulation to protect consumers.

""We are always keen to learn more from other countries about their approach to the regulation of emerging technologies and are developing relationships with international organisations to learn about their approach to cell-cultivated products.""

FSA officials and Mr Freeman visited their respective counterparts in Israel earlier this year to try the cultivated foods and to see how the market is regulated in the Middle Eastern nation.

""Israel has very strong expertise in protein replacement and in agri-tech and turning deserts into a garden,"" Mr Freeman told The Telegraph in an exclusive interview.

""When I was there [in Israel] I tasted the world's first synthetic chicken, but it's not made from vegetable material flavoured like chicken, it's grown from chicken stem cells. It has all the qualities of a meat, but it's grown in the lab, not farmed.

""It is possible for us to be a world producer of very high standard beef, poultry and pork whilst also making sure that we're able to produce very low cost protein for hard hit families that are struggling and can't afford a £70 joint of beef. It's not an either or.

""It's making sure that we're able to maintain our very high food quality standards and international reputation, reduce the cost of living, and help develop the technologies that the world needs.""

The 'super soup' that's the equivalent of eating 1kg of raw broccoli

Biofortified foods are creating a buzz worldwide, with one broccoli soup holding promise of reducing disease and lowering blood sugar

On a field in Fife, rows of GRextra - a strain of ""super-broccoli"" - are coming into bloom. Following research showing that it successfully reduced chances of type 2 diabetes and lowered blood sugar levels among consumers, this vitamin-rich veg may hold the key to overhauling the nation's diet, its creators believe - combating our nutrient deficiencies and streamlining our food intake in one fell swoop.

""GRextra can't turn back time"" says SmarterNaturally, the company who has patented the broccoli and turned it into a soup to be consumed once a week. But, they claim, it can ""reverse the shift"" our cells undergo as we age, which leads to slowing metabolism - a possible trigger for cancer, heart disease and neurodegenerative illnesses such as Parkinson's.

With five times more glucoraphanin (a cell-protecting compound) than is found in regular broccoli, the soup is equivalent to eating five raw heads of the vegetable. ""The vegetable has a very low impact on lifestyle intervention and therefore can be very sustainably incorporated into someone's weekly diet,"" says Laura Knight, the company's CEO.

The broccoli has been biofortified, or bred to be nutrient-dense, rather than genetically modified. Genetic modification typically involves introducing a strand of DNA to the plant in question's genome, or altering its characteristics, whereas biofortification is achieved by specialised breeding. This may make it more palatable to consumers than the controversial ""Frankenfoods"" altered to the point of little resemblance to their original state.

Biofortified broccoli is part of a growing trend. There's ""quite a bit of buzz about biofortification,"" explains Professor Cathie Martin of the John Innes Centre (where GRextra was originally developed). Other vegetables could soon be packing a far greater vitamin punch, she believes. ""People are starting to realise that we're suffering from not enough micronutrients [vitamins and minerals the body requires in small amounts] and also phytonutrients [plant chemicals that contribute to good health] in our diet,"" she explains - with the biofortification breeding process upping the quantity of nutrients in individual species.

SmarterNaturally are now ramping up production of the strain, originally found in Sicily by Professor Richard Mithen of the University of Auckland. According to the company's trials, the product - which costs £5 per portion, or £20 for a monthly subscription - did not have an instant effect but rather lowers and maintains consumers' blood glucose levels over around six months. ""It's a bit like taking your car for a service and getting it re-tuned so that it works optimally and efficiently,"" Knight says of the product, which they are looking to expand to other flavours.

The idea of a single weekly veg serving slashing your illness risk may seem eyebrow-raising, but the experts don't think it's that far fetched. 

""While it's unlikely that this produce alone will have a big impact, it could contribute to the benefit of a healthier eating pattern that can help people reduce blood sugar levels and potentially reverse type 2 diabetes,"" says David Cavan, consultant endocrinologist at the London Diabetes Centre. ""There is a lot of evidence that leafy green veg are associated with reduced risk of developing the condition,"" he adds - including research from the University of Leicester, which found that one and a half daily servings cut chances by 14 per cent. Type 2 diabetes, which is typically caused by lifestyle factors such as an unhealthy diet, currently affects around 4 million people in the UK, and accounts for 10 per cent of NHS spend.

How we consume these superfoods also makes a difference. While supplements can be taken to boost certain vitamin deficiencies, eating the foods in their whole form means that micronutrients within them, from fibres to minerals, are processed in the gut, and typically at higher levels than via cooked or pill versions. Extracting the glucoraphanin and putting it into capsules, for instance, could achieve similar results to the soup, but only if several very large ones were consumed at once. SmarterNaturally's product, which is in part funded by UK Research and Innovation (which is seeking to make Britain a world leader in biofortified foods), is made from mixing their freeze-dried raw broccoli blend with 250ml of boiling water.

While broccoli, mushrooms and tomatoes with stickers boasting their high vitamin D content have periodically made their way onto supermarket shelves, the process of creating turbo-charged veg can be long - to the tune of decades, Martin adds - as a result of the regulations around products with health claims. She is currently working on a provitamin D-rich tomato, edited to increase the amount of vitamin D3 (key for muscle, bone strength and immune function) when exposed to UVB light. This crop could, it is hoped, benefit the one in six UK adults who suffer vitamin D deficiency, which is linked to higher cancer, dementia and mortality risk.

Genome-edited tomatoes have relatively recently hit shelves in Japan, via Sicilian Rouge - the breed known as the ""first CRISPR [gene-edited] food to hit the market"". 

Modified to contain high levels of GABA (neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid), research has shown that they could reduce blood pressure among consumers. While genetically modified foods have long divided shoppers, changing the terminology of old, from genetically modified to genome-edited, appears to have quieted the former backlash against bioengineered produce. CRISPR technology has also been used in recently concluded UK field trials to create wheat with reduced levels of asparagine, a carcinogenic contaminant that occurs when bread is toasted or baked.

These ""represent the tip of the iceberg in terms of the benefit potential [of biofortified foods],"" says Stuart Smyth, associate professor in the department of agricultural and resource economics at the University of Saskatchewan. As food prices rise at the fastest they have for 45 years in the UK, cultivating more produce of this kind would also give households the ability to consume ""sufficiently nutritious food, while possibly purchasing fewer vegetables."" 

It would also serve as some counterbalance to the ultra-processed foods that dominate the modern diet, and currently account for 50 per cent of what we eat, Cathie Martin says. Consumers and the industry alike must ""realise that we can't go on eating junk food and not pay any consequences.""

Martin says: ""Maybe you can't get people to eat five helpings of fruit and vegetables a day,"" per the old edict, but by improving the quality of those we eat via fortified foods, ""you're more likely to be healthy in old age and so reduce costs for the healthcare system, and also have a better quality of life.""

From ""˜sponge cities' to beavers: 17 ways to protect against climate change

Global warming remains a huge challenge worldwide, but there are things we can do now to protect ourselves in the future

Climate-related disasters are sweeping the world, leaving destruction in their wake and big questions about what we can do to prevent the next catastrophe. 

It is unlikely these emergencies will slow anytime soon as global warming continues. 

But while stopping climate change globally remains a huge and daunting challenge, there are many adaptations we should be making now to protect ourselves. 

Here are 17 that could make a difference.

1. Paint it white 

Scientists have developed a new super white paint - paint so reflective that it can slash household temperatures.

Heat from the sun is absorbed by buildings, warming the inside and leading to an upsurge in power usage to combat it as fans and air conditioning are turned on.

But the new solar reflective paint, made by scientists at Purdue University and containing calcium carbonate particles, can be applied to the roofs and exterior walls of buildings, bouncing back sunlight.

Studies show that surfaces painted with the paint can be up to 12 degrees Celsius cooler. 

Think of it as a modern, improved version of the whitewashed towns of southern Europe and the Mediterranean islands. 

2. Sponge cities

We've seen major floods across the world this summer and improving the rate at which rainwater soaks into the ground is going to be vital as the climate warms.

Sponge cities aim to ""depave"" as much of the built environment as possible, removing sections of hard paving and replacing it with surfaces that can absorb water like sand, gravel, grass and soil. 

It cuts flood risk because water can soak into the ground naturally, rather than causing flash floods on hard streets with inadequate drainage systems.

China has been a global leader in creating sponge cities. In Nanning, in southern China near the Vietnam border, $1.6 billion has been spent on fitting water-absorbent pavements and wetland parts designed to flood safely and absorb water.

3. Resistant crops 

The climate crisis will take a heavy toll on crops and global food supply chains unless we act to create more resilient crops and farming systems.

In South Asia, where the majority of the world's rice is grown, floods cause $1 billion in annual losses. Although rice thrives in wet conditions, it cannot survive if the whole plant is completely submerged. 

The issue can be combated by a new rice known as Sub-1 - or ""scuba rice"" - which is able to survive underwater for up to two weeks and recover once the water has cleared.

At the other end of the spectrum, Southern Africa is undergoing some of its most severe droughts in almost three decades. There, farmers have started planting climate-smart crops, like resilient maize or beans.

4. Meandering Rivers

River restoration projects are focusing on ""re-meandering"" rivers and streams, many of which have been straightened by human development.

Straightened rivers can cause more flooding as water flow is not slowed by natural bends and breaks or diverted to natural floodplains.

River de-straightening is referred to as ""Stage Zero"" by scientists as it aims to restore rivers to their natural state, long before human development changed their course. 

The restoration can be applied to areas where there is room to release smaller streams into valley bottoms and floodplains, creating wetland habitats and preventing flooding in urban areas. 

5. More beavers

The reintroduction of beavers in some parts of the UK has been shown to alleviate downstream flood risk.

Beavers are dam builders, and the barriers can increase water storage on a floodplain and slow river flow. They can reduce peak discharge during heavy rainfall by up to 30 per cent. 

Another way beavers can help the environment is by spreading out water over a larger area, meaning nutrients such as nitrates, phosphates and other pollutants can be stripped out, leading to better downstream water quality.

6. Floating cities

Rising sea levels are threatening communities on low-lying land, especially in the Caribbean and the Pacific.

Last week it emerged that residents of the Caribbean island of Carti Sugtupu and dozens of neighbouring settlements are set to be moved to Panama as the sea is set to engulf it.

French Polynesia could soon have the first-ever floating city. The project would see a cluster of buoyant dwellings, showcasing innovations in solar power, sustainable aquaculture, and ocean-based wind farms.

The idea is to build a semi-autonomous community at sea, offering homes for up to 300 people as the government seeks solutions for its sinking islands. 

7. Functional faeces

Artificial whale poo could be a surprising way to restore the world's oceans. 

Whale faeces, rich in nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen, help to fertilise the ocean's upper waters, proving the starting point for marine food chains. 

The aim is to provide nutrients in areas where concentrations are low. It will stimulate the growth of organisms like phytoplankton, which can take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere or build up fish stocks.

Studies on the benefits it can bring to ocean ecosystems have taken place off the west coast of India.

8. Bury power lines

Extreme weather in the United States over the last few years has repeatedly left millions of Americans without power. 

Hurricane Ida damaged or toppled more than 22,000 pylons and 26,000 cables when it hit Louisiana and the East Coast in 2021. 

But a simple technique could be used to fix the problem. 

Burying power lines means this infrastructure is less vulnerable to hurricanes. In Texas, a study found that strategically burying just 5 per cent of power lines could halve the number of affected residents in an extreme weather event. 

Burying power lines can also reduce the cables sparking and causing forest fires.

9. Let it burn

Warmer weather increases the likelihood and severity of forest fires. Yet, according to experts, perfectly protecting forests could cause more damage than good. 

Natural wildfires periodically clear surface vegetation so that there is less material to burn when fires do occur.

Before western settlement, much of the yellow pine and mixed conifer forests of America's West Coast experienced fires around once a decade. Now, most of these forests have not burned since the early 20th century. 

If we were to reduce the amount of vegetation that acts as fuel, we could make sure that fires burn less intensely and have a smaller negative impact on mature trees, wildlife, human property, and human health.

Experts say we should also stop the widespread practice of building housing developments in forested areas that are at risk from fire.

10. Urban trees

Planting trees along roadsides in towns and cities can significantly reduce temperatures by creating shade.

Investigations have found that increasing tree coverage from the European average of 14.9 per cent to 30 per cent in urban areas could lower the temperature by 0.4 Celsius. 

Although this seems marginal, it could cut heat-related deaths by 39.5 per cent as southern cities will notice more of a temperature difference, according to an international team of researchers from the Barcelona Institute for Global Health. 

The cities most likely to feel the benefit are those in southern and eastern Europe, where summer temperatures are highest and tree coverage is lower than the rest of the continent. 

11. Ventilated housing

Building sustainable ventilation in homes can play a crucial role in mitigating climate change. 

It can promote a healthier environment for you to live in by preventing the buildup of pollutants, reducing moisture-related issues, and reducing the risk of respiratory problems or other health issues associated with poor air quality. 

Natural ventilation is also better for your pocket. A passive system reduces a building's total energy usage by averting the need for air conditioning, lessening your carbon footprint. 

It is also important in a warming world for houses to be properly insulated.

12. Cholera vaccines

As climate change causes extreme weather events like floods, droughts and cyclones, new outbreaks of cholera are being triggered.

Cases of cholera reported to WHO in 2022 were more than double those in 2021. Forty-four countries reported cases, a 25 per cent increase from the 35 countries that reported cases in 2021.

A global strategy of making more vaccines and ensuring that the vulnerable are protected is the key way to combat this climate-related flare-up.  

A similar approach will be needed for many other infectious diseases, especially those carried by mosquitoes which are exploiting climate change.

13. Rapid warnings

Early warning systems are considered a ""low-hanging fruit"" for climate change adaptations. 

They are a relatively low-cost and effective way of protecting people from the hazards of storms, floods, heatwaves and forest fires.

These systems can track the paths of cyclones, typhoons and hurricanes at sea before they make landfall. The severity of droughts can also be tracked and the progress of floods monitored. 

In the UK, a text-based government warning system was introduced in April for emergency events, including extreme weather, and many other countries have the same.

In developing countries, which can be much more vulnerable to extreme weather events, they are much less widespread, however.

14. Shore up sea defences

Climate change is already having a considerable impact on our coastline. 

There are around 520,000 homes in England in areas at risk of coastal flooding and 8,900 homes are at risk of being lost to coastal erosion. 

Often, it's not worth building sea walls and other defences, but in some cases saving land is possible. 

Barriers can be made out of concrete, stone, asphalt or wood and high revetments can be designed to stop waves from overtopping the defence. 

There are also more creative ways to stop the swell of the sea. In St Andrews, Christmas trees have been buried within dunes and marram grass planted on top in order to reinforce them against the tide.

15. Communal cool rooms 

Making sure people have a cool place to shelter from heat waves can reduce heat-related illness or death and reduce personal energy usage. 

These centres can be specifically designed for large communities as safe locations with plenty of water and air conditioning, or older buildings can be adapted to do the same job. 

This summer cities across China opened the doors of their air raid shelters to offer residents some relief as scorching heat swept the country.

The shelters were equipped with seating areas, offering access to water, heat stroke medicine and amenities like WiFi, television and table tennis equipment. 

Several towns and cities in the United States and Europe also have designated communal cooling rooms when temperatures surge.

16. Modern methods for ancient styles

As thousands of buildings crumbled during the earthquakes in Morocco earlier this month, one thing was clear: the buildings were not strong enough.

Many of these buildings, as well as some of those wiped out by flooding in Libya, were made from mud bricks and rammed earth - an ancient building method used across the world. 

They have what experts call ""seismic vulnerability"". Many have not been retrofitted for earthquakes and others have received inadequate maintenance. 

Now, engineers are testing a range of new methods to combat this, from timber reinforcements to using 3D printers to embed these structures with stabilising fibres.

17. Maintaining dams and infrastructure 

Storm Daniel, also known as Cyclone Daniel, was the deadliest Mediterranean cyclone in recorded history. 

When the storm hit in Derna, Libya, it is estimated to have killed between 4,000 and 10,000, though the exact toll may never be officially confirmed. 

The dams above Derna had not been maintained properly to withstand such an event after two of them collapsed and swept away large parts of the port city.

Stronger dams would have prevented the water from sweeping through homes and causing them to collapse, sweeping people out to sea. 

Officials say a key way to prevent such a disaster is to examine and reinforce existing structures, safe proofing them for the extreme weather of the future. 

In the UK the Toddbrook Reservoir Dam, the tallest in Britain, bowed to intense rainfall in 2019 following the failure of its auxiliary spillway. Works costing £15m are now underway to repair the damage.

The true cost of cheap chicken

With new data revealing Britain's consumption of chicken is on the rise, here's how intensive poultry farming is swelling to meet the demand

Nuggets, wings, drumsticks: chicken has gone from a rare treat, the centrepiece of a family meal, to a thoughtless snack. Data tracking Britain's food purchases over the last six decades reveals that, as a nation, sales of chicken have increased by 70 per cent since the 1970s, whilst consumption of red meat has plunged by up to 81 per cent. More than 40 per cent of the meat we eat in Britain is chicken - making it our favourite meat.

Replacing beef and lamb with chicken has been suggested as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, ­pollution and the land-use footprint of our diets. Indeed, a report by the UK's Committee on Climate Change encouraged the replacement of beef and lamb consumption with pork and chicken.

Restaurant analysts talk about a ""chickenisation"" of the UK food ­service sector - pointing out that the six fastest-growing emerging ­restaurant brands heading into 2022 all specialised in chicken; and Mintel's UK burger and chicken restaurants market report predicted that the UK chicken restaurant market will go from £2.3""‰billion (2022) to reach £2.7""‰billion in 2027.

The result is that an industry of intensive chicken production has grown exponentially. Between 2017 and 2020, the number of ­industrial-scale pig and poultry units in the UK rose by 7 per cent from 1,669 to 1,786. And now experts suggest that giving chicken a free pass has increased the incidence of avian flu, caused ecological devastation, and may be driving antibiotic resistance. Across the UK, from Powys to ­Northamptonshire, locals are fighting to stop intensive poultry farming.

How did we get here? 

It's the result of a mixture of a lack of ­understanding, the abundance of chicken on our supermarket shelves and in our takeaways, and the ­perception that it is a better choice than beef, says Rob Percival, head of food policy for the Soil Association and author of The Meat Paradox ­(Little, Brown, £18.99). ­""Historically, it has been perceived as a clean meat,"" ­Percival explains. ""All the concerns around cancer and climate change and cruelty have ­coalesced around ruminant meat and dairy. That's where people make that negative association. Whereas poultry has been ­perceived to be healthy and environmentally clean and is, of course, very cheap.""

The argument about what meat is ""better"" environmentally has focused on input efficiency. Intensive chicken is a more efficient converter of plants into food than most other animals are. ""That's why they come out better than pigs, for example, in terms of carbon footprint,"" explains Mike Berners-Lee, an English researcher and writer on carbon footprinting. ""And better than sheep and cows because they don't ruminate, so there's much less ­methane involved.""

This efficiency has been achieved by streamlining the production ­process. In the UK, 850 million ­chickens are raised for meat (known as broiler chickens) each year. And 95 per cent of the UK's broilers come from intensive units.

""We've genetically modified the bird via selection so that it can't stand up. It doesn't have or need any space. We use antibiotics to get it to a ­certain weight and we kill it quicker. We've optimised everything,"" says Berners-Lee.

Animal welfare has been sacrificed for the purposes of cheap protein, and many people find that ­disquieting. Berners-Lee was recently walking in Scotland when he noticed lots of huts. ""It was eerily quiet. Sinister, all these big huts, one after another with no windows or anything. It was very strange. I ­wondered, what is it I'm walking past? And then there was a little chicken logo. It was a chicken farm.""

While there might be a low carbon footprint, there's a price to pay for that. Berners-Lee lists avian flu, ­antibiotic resistance and loss of ­biodiversity as major worries. ""I'm not a vegetarian or a vegan,"" he points out. ""I don't think any of us need to go that way, but we need to address the way we're producing chicken.""

Cheap chicken comes at a price

Bird flu is one of the most ­significant concerns. The UN's Farming and ­Agriculture Organisation has made the link between factory farming and avian flu explicit, saying that ""in ­monocultures involving mass rearing of genetically identical animals that are selected for high feed conversion, an emerging hyper-virulent pathogen will rapidly spread within a flock"".

Transmissibility remains a major concern. ""Animals in incredibly close proximity to each other and close ­proximity to humans, that is what is pushing that risk,"" says Berners-Lee. ""And ­specifically it is our chickens that are pushing the bird flu."" If it were to come across to humans, it would have a devastating effect, he suggests.

He says that global concerns about antibiotic resistance are also fuelled by intensive poultry farming. ""Two thirds of the world's antibiotics are fed to farm animals, not humans.""  

The other cost is to the local ­environment. In the Wye Valley, for instance, high phosphate levels have been blamed on run-off from intensive ­poultry farms. 

Roger Barnes from Cluck Off, a ­pressure group, is campaigning against the dangers of run-off at proposed chicken-rearing sites. ""We are shocked by how much damage this style of ""˜farming' has on the planet, with very limited monitoring of the enormous amounts of manure (up to 6,000 tonnes a year) these produce,"" he says. ""These enormous stacks of manure will sit for six months at a time in Northamptonshire and ­Bedfordshire alongside the source of the River Till and River Ouse. We already know the effects by looking at the horrific state of the River Wye.""

So is the rise of the intensive cheap chicken something we can afford to ignore? 

Even on the issue of carbon ­footprints, poultry may not be as comparatively virtuous as it first seems. UK emissions figures ­currently exclude net imports. So they miss the carbon footprint from imported feed from the Americas; 41.5 per cent of the world's ­crop-based feed is used in poultry production and 60 per cent of the soy imported into the UK is for the poultry industry. This is something about which the Soil Association is seeking to raise awareness. It is also concerned about river health and is pushing for less arable land in the UK to be used to grow crops for poultry feed and more for humans. 

Chicken versus beef

Meanwhile, farmers who are employing regenerative and organic methods feel frustrated that their pasture-raised beef is often ­compared unfavourably, in ­environmental terms, with ­intensively-reared broiler chickens. 

At Paddock Farm in Warwickshire, brothers Jon and Nick Francis have a herd of Herefordshire cattle that is integrated with their 300-strong flock of egg-laying hens. Every day the hens are moved on to land behind the ­cattle, part of a mixed-farming ­regenerative system. 

The chickens eat the larvae from the cow pats, providing a service to the cows in terms of pest control, as well as integrating cow dung back into the ground quicker by ­scratching through it. ""It's a system that requires less imported feed into the farm because they're getting ­protein from the larvae in the cow pats. And [they're] producing 200 eggs a day, too,"" explains Jon.

Jon feels frustrated that cows have taken so much of the heat in the ­dominant narrative around climate change. ""We're pasture for life. Our grasslands are where we are going to be sequestering the most carbon in the UK and it's about managing those to also ­produce nutrient-dense beef,"" he stresses. ""I really do believe that is completely possible and we're doing soil testing on our farm on a regular basis.""

There is, however, a stark price ­difference between the sort of chicken that Paddock Farm sells and that from an intensive farm; £10 a kilo for the former and nearer £3 a kilo for an intensive broiler. 

George Ford at nearby Nempnett Pastures, which produces pasture-raised broilers, says its biggest birds offer the most value at £7.50 a kilo. ""They're happy birds,"" he says. ""They live much longer and the taste is incredible because [the birds have] had time to lay down all their muscles and fat. They've been foraging and exercising and eating bugs and grass. It's what chicken used to be like.""

But with a cost of living crisis, it's understand­able that ­consumers choose the cheap product, even if there are longer-term hidden costs. 

What's the solution? 

While it would be nice if we all only ate chicken produced in systems like Nempnett Pastures and Paddock Farm's, the reality is we'd have to eat much less than we already do. 

""If the UK went to a wholly organic or agro-ecological approach, in order to make that viable with current land use, it requires a drop in 70 per cent of the average ­person's ­consumption,"" says Percival. ""And the more you tie in improvements in welfare and ­sustainability of feed, the more that 70 per cent figure is going to be squeezed.""

Chicken would become much more expensive. Just like it used to be. ""Really, we need to go back to chicken being something we eat quite rarely rather than on a daily basis,"" says Percival. 

The good news would be that the chicken we did eat would be far more nutrient-dense than intensive ­broilers. Chicken currently has fewer essential micronutrients than it used to have - 69 per cent less iron and 26 per cent less phosphorus in 2002 than in 1940.

""The nutritional content of chicken is nothing like it was 50 years ago. They have five times less omega-3 than in 1970,"" says ­Berners-Lee. And these days it also contains antibiotic residue.

Most of all, Berners-Lee wants people to understand what the whole supply chain looks like for almost all the chicken we eat. ""When you think about it like that, it makes it quite an unappetising product.""

Humans have sucked so much water out of the ground that the Earth has tipped

Pumping excessive amounts of water for farming over two decades has caused the planet to tilt more to the east, study says

The tilt of the Earth has shifted because of the vast quantity of groundwater humans have sucked out of it over the past two decades, according to scientists.

Pumping water out of the ground for drinking and farming redistributed such a large mass that the Earth's tilt moved by 31.5 inches to the east, toward Iceland, between 1993 and 2010.

According to the study, published in the Geophysical Research Letters journal, the planet's north-south axis has been tipping at a rate of about 1.7 inches per year.

Scientists described the redistribution of water on the planet as ""like adding a tiny bit of weight to a spinning top - the Earth spins a little differently as water is moved around"".

Prof Ki-Weon Seo, a geophysicist at Seoul National University who led the study, said: ""Earth's rotational pole actually changes a lot. Our study shows that among climate-related causes, the redistribution of groundwater actually has the largest impact on the drift of the rotational pole. 

""We have affected Earth systems in various ways. People need to be aware of that.

""I'm very glad to find the unexplained cause of the rotation pole drift. On the other hand, as a resident of Earth and a father, I'm concerned and surprised to see that pumping groundwater is another source of sea-level rise.""

Between 1993 and 2010, about 2,150 gigatons of groundwater was extracted from aquifers below the surface, enough to fill Lake Victoria in Africa.

The Earth spins at about 1,000mph and the largest contributor to the movement of the axis is flow in convection movements in the molten rock, well below the surface.

However, the new study showed that the removal of groundwater was the second largest contributor.

The fact that water removal could change the rotation of the planet was first discovered seven years ago, but has now been measured.

Surendra Adhikari, a research scientist at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who published a 2016 paper on water redistribution impacting rotational drift, said: ""They've quantified the role of groundwater pumping on polar motion, and it's pretty significant.""

In the new study, researchers created models of changes in the wobble of the Earth's rotational pole and the movement of water.

To begin with, they looked at only the movement of ice sheets and glaciers, before adding in different scenarios of groundwater redistribution.

The model only matched the observed polar drift once the researchers included the 2,150 gigatons of groundwater redistribution.

They also found the location of the groundwater contributes to how much it could change polar drift.

Redistributing water from the mid-latitudes has a larger impact on the movement of the rotational pole.

Water being redistributed in western North America and northwestern India, both at mid-latitudes, had a significant impact.

Prof Seo said that attempts to slow the extraction of groundwater depletion in those regions could theoretically alter the drift of the rotational pole, but only if such conservation approaches were sustained for decades.

The rotational pole usually changes by several metres a year owing to other factors including the mantle flow.

That means changes due to the pumping of groundwater would not lead to a shifting of the seasons.

However, when looked at on geologic time scales, polar drift could have an impact on the climate, the scientists said.

They will continue to look into previous decades to see how much groundwater extraction has affected the Earth's rotation over a longer period.

Prof Seo said: ""Polar motion data are available from as early as the late 19th century.""

Put wild boars on the pill instead of culling them, say scientists

The large mammals have been linked to disease outbreaks, road accidents and damage to crops

Wild boars should be given contraceptives to help control population numbers as a humane alternative to culling them, scientists have suggested.

Scientists and wildlife experts at The European Vertebrate Pest Management Conference are to look at new ways to limit some species seen as pests after links to disease outbreaks, road accidents and damage to crops.

Growing numbers of grey squirrels, deer, feral goats, pigeons and parakeets are also causing concern and will be debated at the conference in Florence, Italy, on Monday.

Dr Giovanna Massei told The Observer: ""Controlling numbers of animals like wild boar used to be achieved by shooting them, but hunting is not as popular as it used to be and is also more expensive, requiring expensive licences.""

Dr Massei, Europe director of the Botstiber Institute for Wildlife Fertility Control at York University, said one solution could be to develop new contraceptives for boars.

""Numbers of individuals who hunt animals are declining in many parts of Europe. As a result, controls of boar populations have weakened,"" she said.

""Preventing these animals from breeding is a humane way to limit numbers,"" she told the newspaper.

Scientists in the UK and US have undertaken projects looking at the development of contraceptive chemicals that could be mixed with food.

The Boar-Operated System, whereby metal cones are placed over dishes of food that only wild pigs can lift with their snouts, means other animals cannot inadvertently access the drugs.

""That means we can get contraceptives into boar and only boar,"" Dr Massei added.

A similar approach has already been implemented to tackle grey squirrels, which threaten native red squirrels, and deer which cause woodland destruction and are involved in hundreds of road accidents each year.

Populations of wild boars in Britain have soared in recent years despite nearly being hunted to extinction centuries ago.

Previous estimates say there are around 5,000 in the country, with the majority in the South West of England, specifically the Forest of Dean.

""˜Large snouts and muscular build'

Boars are good at uprooting plant seeds and disturbing ground-nesting animals while also destroying crops and vulnerable habitats because of their large snouts and muscular build. They have also been linked to the spread of African swine fever to domestic pigs.

Last year Scottish farmers demanded a cull after warning boars weighing more than 30 stone were attacking lambs.

Steven MacKenzie, a Highland gamekeeper, said he believes extra protein from devouring farm animals explained why wild boars had increased in size.

In 2021, researchers from the University of Hawaii found wild boar in the UK are threatening five native bird species and could force them out of some areas of the country.

According to the Forestry Commission, more than 800 boars were culled last year, with some of the animals shot or killed through road traffic accidents.

Liz Truss urges Rishi Sunak to rescind China's invite to AI summit

Key moments

Chosen by us to get you up to speed at a glance

Liz Truss has urged Rishi Sunak to rescind China's invitation to attend the UK's AI safety summit at Bletchley Park next week. 

Ms Truss has written to the Prime Minister and said she was ""deeply disturbed"" by the decision to invite Beijing representatives to the summit. 

She said in the letter: ""The regime in Beijing has a fundamentally different attitude to the West about AI, seeing it as a means of state control and a tool for national security.""

She also said that ""no reasonable person expects China to abide by anything agreed at this kind of summit, given their cavalier attitude to international law"". 

Ms Truss said her successor in No10 should ""reconsider the invitation"". 

Mr Sunak said this morning that he could not say with ""100 per cent certainty"" that China will attend but he insisted it was ""absolutely the right thing to have invited them"".

I took one flight over England's historic counties... then ripped them up, admits Lord Heseltine

Lord Heseltine has admitted he ripped up England's historic counties after taking a light aircraft flight across the country and redrawing lines on a map.

As local government minister under Edward Heath in the early Seventies, Lord Heseltine used the bird's-eye view provided by the trip to outline the boundaries of major conurbations that were gouged out of the traditional counties.

Conurbations are groups of towns and cities that have merged with each other and are seen to have similar economic characteristics.

Lord Heseltine said he simply ""ticked local authorities in, out, in, out"" on the basis of the single flight - a process he acknowledges would today be open to judicial review.

Labour claim Government yet to set out 'concrete proposals' on AI regulation

Labour claimed the Government was yet to set out ""concrete proposals"" on how it intended to regulate artificial intelligence as the party responded to Rishi Sunak's speech this morning. 

Peter Kyle, the shadow science, innovation and technology secretary, said: """"˜Artificial intelligence is already having huge benefits for Britain, and the potential of this next generation of AI could be endless, but it poses risks as well. Safety must come first to prevent this technology getting out of control. 

""Rishi Sunak should back up his words with action and publish the next steps on how we can ensure the public is protected. We are still yet to see concrete proposals on how the Government is going to regulate the most powerful AI models.

 ""A Labour government would set clear standards for AI safety, so that this leading tech can be used to restore our public services and boost growth. Labour would use AI to better diagnose diseases, put more money in people's pockets and help build a better Britain.""

Asked specifically about rolling out a ""robot tax"", Mr Sunak said: ""I think the right approach is make sure we have the world's best education system. That is what we are doing with the reform of the Advanced British Standard, lifelong learning entitlement, doubling down on apprenticeships. 

""Those are all examples of how to ensure that people can have fantastic opportunities in life with whatever is changing because of technology."" 

Sunak: World leaders cannot 'put our heads in the sand' on AI risk

Rishi Sunak was asked after his speech if he believed the development of artificial intelligence should be slowed down because of the risks it could pose.

""We already invest far more in AI safety research than any other country in the world.""

He added: ""What we can't do is just put our heads in the sand, as I said, and think that this can either be ignored or that it will just stop happening. It is not going to stop. AI doesn't respect borders. So what is the right approach for us, to just be ahead of it in developing the expertise and capabilities, to understand the risk and then mitigate against them.""

AI one of the 'greatest tests of leadership we face', says Sunak

Rishi Sunak said he believed artificial intelligence represented one of the ""greatest tests of leadership we face"". 

He said that ""it would be easy to bury our heads in the sand and hope it will turn out alright in the end"" but he will ""do the right thing and not the easy thing"". 

Concluding his speech he said that he believed the UK could ""look to the future with optimism and hope"" when it comes to AI. 

PM: AI can help solve 'greatest social challenges of our time'

Rishi Sunak said ""AI can also help us solve some of the greatest social challenges of our time. It can help us finally achieve the promise of nuclear fusion, providing abundant, cheap, clean energy with virtually no emissions. 

""It can help us solve world hunger by making food cheaper and easier to grow and preventing crop failures by accurately predicting when to plant, harvest or water your crops. And AI could help find novel dementia  treatments or develop vaccines for cancer. That is why today we are investing a further £100million to accelerate the use of AI on the most transformational breakthroughs in treatments for previously incurable diseases.""

""It will advance the world's knowledge of AI safety and it will carefully examine, evaluate and test new types of AI so that we understand what each new model is capable of, exploring all the risks...""

People do not need to lose sleep over AI risk right now, says Sunak

Rishi Sunak highlighted some of the potential dangers of artificial intelligence. 

He said: ""In the most unlikely but extreme cases there is even the risk that humanity could lose control of AI completely through the kind of AI sometimes referred to as super intelligence."" 

Mr Sunak said people do not need to lose sleep over that risk right now. 

He said: ""I want to be completely clear. This is not a risk that people need to be losing sleep over right now. And I don't want to be alarmist and there is real debate about this, some experts think it will never happen at all. 

""But however uncertain and unlikely these risks are, if they did manifest themselves the consequences would be incredibly serious and when so many of the biggest developers of this technology themselves warn of these risk, leaders have a responsibility to take them seriously and to act and that is what I am doing today.""

But he said like those previous big technological advances, the development of AI will bring ""new dangers and new fears"". 

He said it was right to ""address those fears head on"" and to be ""honest with people about the risks from these technologies"". 

China has accepted invite to attend UK's AI summit, says Dowden

China has accepted an invitation to the UK's AI safety summit next week, the Deputy Prime Minister has confirmed, with the Government expecting Beijing to send a representative. 

Oliver Dowden said ministers did expect China to attend the Bletchley Park gathering, but would await and see whether Chinese officials actually arrive for the meeting next week.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It is the case that they have accepted but we'll wait to see everyone who actually turns up at the summit. It is the case that you wait and see who actually turns up at these events.""

He added: ""We do expect them to come.""

By-election swings not usually replicated at general elections, says Dowden

Oliver Dowden suggested by-election swings are not usually replicated at general elections.

It follows heavy Conservatives losses in last week's Tamworth and Mid Bedfordshire by-elections. 

Asked on LBC Radio this morning whether he was nervous about his 21,000 majority in his own Hertsmere constituency, the Deputy Prime Minister said: ""You name a by-election swing that has taken place 18 months to a year before an election that has been replicated in that general election ""” you know that is not going to be the case.""

Dowden to chair Cobra meeting on Israel-Hamas war

Oliver Dowden said he will chair a meeting of the Cobra committee this morning to discuss the situation in Israel and Gaza. 

The Deputy Prime Minister was asked during an interview on Times Radio if he believed there was an appetite among the Israeli forces for a ""humanitarian pause"" in fighting to allow more aid into Gaza. 

He said: ""Well, we continue to make the case with our Israeli counterparts and indeed I will actually be chairing a meeting of Cobra immediately after these morning interviews that I have been doing to further consider our approach and strategy. 

""But I am also very sympathetic to the position of the Israelis which is they do need to take action, they have had this situation where Hamas terrorists have crossed into their territory and they have killed over 1,000 people. 

""No nation state could stand by and allow that to happen.""

Calls for Gaza ceasefire do not recognise situation Israel is in, says Dowden

Calls for a ceasefire in Gaza do not properly recognise the situation that Israel finds itself in, Oliver Dowden said this morning. 

The Deputy Prime Minister repeated the UK's call for ""humanitarian pauses"" in the fighting to allow aid in and hostages out. 

He told Times Radio: ""A humanitarian pause is to allow the delivery of aid and vital supplies into Gaza. It is something that we have been urging. This is to enable those to get into the territory. 

""That is different to a ceasefire which is a total cessation of hostilities which I don't think recognises properly the situation that Israel finds itself in in respect of this attack from Hamas which has to be dealt with by Israel.""

Asked if there was much governments could do on AI beside issue warnings about the technology, Mr Dowden told Times Radio: ""Well, first of all actually AI is an exciting, game changing opportunity. 

""If you think about the challenges of our age, whether that is climate change, cancer, dementia, global poverty, AI correctly deployed can have a profound impact on solving some of humanity's greatest challenges. But at the same time we have got to be clear eyed about the risks associated with it and take responsible action. 

""That is what the Prime Minister is seeking to do both in the speech that he is making today and the summit the United Kingdom will be hosting next week.""

Oliver Dowden admits he worries about impact of AI on elections

Oliver Dowden has warned of the threat artificial intelligence could pose to elections as Rishi Sunak prepares to deliver a major speech on the safety and potential benefits of the technology this morning. 

The Deputy Prime Minister was asked during an interview on Times Radio if he worried about the UK's elections being vulnerable to AI. 

He said: ""Yes I do and we have seen in successive elections technology imposing an effect on our elections.""

He continued: ""I also take it seriously in respect of our elections. The thing about AI is actually twofold. One, it can proliferate the range of actors that can participate in this space, so more people can create those kind of deep fakes, and as you say, it can also make them more convincing. 

""And that is why as part of my responsibilities chairing the National Security Council committee in both economic security and resilience, I am working with the democracy task force and my colleague Tom Tugendhat, the Security Minister, the Electoral Commission and others to make sure we are prepared for that.""

Australia offers Tuvalu islanders climate change visas

Tuvalu, a nation of low-lying atolls nestled in the South Pacific, is among the nations most at risk from rising sea levels

Citizens of climate-threatened Tuvalu will be given the right to live in Australia under a landmark pact unveiled on Friday.

Tuvalu, a nation of low-lying atolls nestled in the South Pacific home to 11,000 people, is among the nations most at risk from rising sea levels and is predicted to be largely underwater by the end of this century.

The scheme will see up to 280 Tuvaluans provided with visas each year allowing them to live, work and study in Australia.

It is the first time Australia has offered residency to foreign nationals because of threats related to climate change, local media reported.

Agreement described as ""˜ground-breaking' 

Anthony Albanese, Australia's prime minister, described the agreement as ""ground-breaking"".

""We believe the people of Tuvalu deserve the choice to live, study and work elsewhere, as climate change impacts worsen,"" he told a meeting of Pacific leaders in the Cook Islands.

""Australia has committed to provide a special pathway for citizens of Tuvalu to come to Australia, with access to Australian services that will enable human mobility with dignity.""

Kausea Natano, Tuvalu's prime minister, called it a ""beacon of hope"", adding it marked a ""giant leap forward in our joint mission to ensure regional stability, sustainability and prosperity""

Mr Albanese said the new bilateral partnership between the two countries came at the request of Tuvalu, which is part of the British Commonwealth.

Partnership called Falepili Union 

The partnership is called the Falepili Union, he said, and is based on the Tuvaluan word for the traditional values of good neighbourliness, care and mutual respect.

Under the pact, Australia will also vet Tuvalu's security arrangements with other nations, Mr Albanese said.

He said it was Australia's most significant agreement with a Pacific Island nation, giving ""a guarantee that upon a request from Tuvalu for any military assistance based upon security issues, Australia will be there"".

Although Australia has defence agreements with other Pacific Islands nations, in a region where China recently struck a security pact with Solomon Islands and is seeking to expand its policing ties and infrastructure projects, the Tuvalu treaty goes much further in positioning Australia as its primary security partner.

Mr Albanese said Australia would also add more funding to Tuvalu's Coastal Adaptation Project, which aims to expand land around the main island of Funafuti by about 6 per cent to help try and keep Tuvaluans on their homeland.

The annual cap on visas would ensure migration to Australia ""does not cause brain drain"", he added.

If all Tuvaluans decided to take up Australia on its offer - and if Australia kept its cap at 280 migrants per year - it would take about 40 years for Tuvalu's entire population to relocate to Australia.

Tuvalu has been defined by the United Nations as ""extremely vulnerable"" to the effects of climate change, with most of its landmass less than 16 feet above sea level.

If no action is taken, up to 95 per cent of land is projected to be submerged by high tides by 2100, according to the UN.

Half of the capital, Fogafale, is predicted to be flooded much sooner, by 2050.

Around 40 per cent of the main atoll Funafuti already gets submerged during periodic ""king"" tides that wash away taro and cassava which were the islands' staple crops.

Two of the atolls represented on its flag of 11 stars have already disappeared.

Statehood to remain in perpetuity 

In September, Tuvalu amended its constitution to say its statehood would remain in perpetuity, even if its physical territory disappears.

It has also vowed to build a digital version of itself in the metaverse in order to preserve the country's culture and history.

Experts are currently monitoring the region surrounding the new island to determine whether it will become a permanent fixture on Japan's map or disappear.

The new island could survive longer if it is made of lava or something more durable than volcanic rocks such as pumice.

""If only a cinder eruption, as it is now, it will be eroded by waves and is unlikely to remain for a long time, but if it turns into an eruption with lava, it may remain for quite a while,"" an official at the Japan Meteorological Agency told local media.

Wind farms 'gaming system to inflate millions earned when asked to halt production'

Study finds companies are 'exaggerating' claims about the amount of energy they will produce at times when network risks being overloaded

Wind farm owners appear to be ""gaming the system"" to inflate the tens of millions of pounds that they are paid not to produce electricity, a study has found.

A paper published in the International Journal of Industrial Organisation concluded that companies were ""exaggerating"" claims about the amount of energy they expected to produce at times when the transmission network risked being overloaded.

The behaviour increases the likelihood that wind farms will be paid to shut down, as well as resulting in higher payments than would otherwise have been given, to those asked to stop producing electricity, according to the economists who wrote the paper.

The findings will heighten concerns about Rishi Sunak's decision to relax the effective ban on onshore turbines introduced by David Cameron in 2015.

The ban was partly introduced in response to concerns among Tory MPs about the level of consumer subsidies paid to energy firms operating wind farms. 

Shortly before Mr Cameron's ban, this newspaper revealed that £11.1 million had been paid to a single wind farm to shut down over a three year period.

Last year, companies were paid £227 million not to produce electricity, according to the Renewable Energy Foundation, which compiles energy data.

RenewableUK, which represents renewable energy firms, said the constraint payments reflected ""a chronic lack of investment"" in the electricity grid.

But the academics proposed that the so-called ""constraint payments"" could be limited to a figure ""slightly above"" the value of the consumer subsidy that a wind farm would lose by not producing electricity. 

Such a move could reduce the total amount paid by up to 28 per cent, they suggested. 

They also suggested that there should be a financial penalty for ""false or biased declarations"" of the amount of energy that firms would have expected to produce.

The ""constraint payments"", which are ultimately added to consumer bills, are being fuelled by a high concentration of onshore windfarms in Scotland often leaving the electricity grid unable to cope on windy days.

As a result, wind farms are paid not to produce energy in order to avoid overloading the network.

""˜Clear restraints on the grid'

The latest study - by Michael Waterson, a professor of economics at the University of Warwick, and Mario Intini, assistant professor in applied economics at the University of Bari Aldo Moro - said: ""Scotland presents a prime example where generating firms have secured favourable deals but appear to have taken strategic advantage of infrastructure constraints and rules in their operations.""

The paper added that ""the concentration of British wind generation in Scotland provides clear constraints on the grid and in all likelihood places particular wind farms at an advantageous position in exploiting these constraints"".

The Western Link, a 530-mile high-voltage cable running from the west coast of Scotland to the north coast of Wales, was built to help overcome the problem by providing more capacity to transport green energy from onshore wind farms in Scotland, to England and Wales.

But the line, which became fully operational in 2018, has been dogged by difficulties.

Under the system of constraint payments, each wind farm owner asks for a particular sum per megawatt hour of energy its turbines would have produced had they been switched on. They also provide final physical notifications (FPNs) of how much energy they expect to produce. 

National Grid chooses whether to accept their bids.

Prof Waterson and Mr Intini studied a sample of 509 days between 2018 and 2019, examining the bids made by wind farm owners, including specifically during periods when it seemed like they would be asked to shut down - such as when the Western Link was not working.

""˜Scottish wind farms gaming the system'

They wrote that their findings were ""consistent with Scottish wind farms gaming the system"".

The paper states: ""The overall wind generation forecast when constraints are imposed is around twice what it is when they are not. However, the total FPN declared by Scottish wind farms is 2.50 times as much in constrained periods, in other words exacerbating the strong wind forecasts.

""This hints at something we explore more rigorously later - declared FPNs are clearly not an unbiased predictor of actual generation, instead being an exaggerated amount, but the fact that they are more exaggerated at certain times suggests that they may be being manipulated deliberately by wind farms.""

Prof Waterson and Mr Intini add: ""In sum, our results point to wind generators behaving as expected with respect to prices, and most significantly, seemingly raising their FPN declarations to take advantage of underlying conditions in order to increase the likelihood of being constrained, as well as setting them ""˜optimistically' more generally.

""They have the scope to do this because there is, remarkably, no penalty for false or biased declarations of FPN.

""Moreover, those firms that operate both wind farms and conventional generation potentially stand to gain by being paid to have wind farms constrained off whilst at the same time providing additional conventional generation to meet demand in England.""

""˜Everyone wants to see an end to constraint payments'

Barnaby Wharton, the director of future electricity systems at RenewableUK, said: ""Everyone wants to see an end to constraint payments, because they reflect a chronic lack of investment in the grid to unlock the huge quantities of clean power which we're now generating from renewables.

""It's important to understand that constraint payments are not unique to wind generation - they have been in place for fossil fuel generators for decades, so the gas industry receives them too. 

""We need to move from an antiquated grid which wastes power to one that's fit for purpose in the twenty-first century as fast as possible. Grid upgrades will solve this.""

Noisy earthworms may mean healthy soil, say researchers

The more noise that is in the soil, the more healthy it is likely to be, discover scientists at the University of Warwick

Noisy earthworms may be the answer to healthy soil, say researchers.

In the first study of its kind, scientists at the University of Warwick are using artificial intelligence (AI) to listen to the noise worms make.

The scientists say the sounds generated in soil can be recorded, measured and used to evaluate soil condition.

The work is a collaboration between the University of Warwick Crop Centre and Baker Consultants Ltd, which has been awarded a £250,000 grant from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to undertake the two-year research project investigating the feasibility of using the technology for monitoring soil health.

""The more noise that is in the soil, the more healthy it is likely to be,"" Dr Jacqueline Stroud, a soil scientist at the University of Warwick, told the Sunday Telegraph. 

""Different types of worms make different types of noise. This can be heard as they move through the soil which we can use to detect them and work out which type of worm they are.

""Whenever I visit farmers to help them assess the healthiness of their soil I ask them to dig a spade sample - 20cm by 20cm by 20cm - and check they have the three different types of worm in there: the surface dwellers, the horizontal burrowers and the deep burrowers. That is a good indication that that soil is healthy.""

Earthworms are vital to the health of soil and farmers are keen to know just how many are in their fields.

But finding out the number is a laborious process, with farmers forced to dig sample pits on their land before extracting the worms and sending the sample to be analysed in a specialist lab.

""On average, we would expect to see around six earthworms - containing those three different types, although in some samples we have found up to 16 earthworms,"" said Dr Stroud. 

""If the soil has all three types then it can be considered healthy. This new process allows us to asses quickly and accurately just how many worms are in a sample size and which types we can hear.""

A vital role
 

The study will use advanced AI to deliver rapid sample analysis and reporting, as well as developing a Soil Acoustic Meter for which a patent is currently pending.

Earthworms play a vital role in keeping soil healthy, which includes recycling nutrients, improving soil structure and repairing damaged soil by enhancing remediation.

The latter is a process by which micro-organisms consume and break down environmental pollutants converting them to non-toxic molecules.

As well as distributing nutrients and organisms and decomposing matter, worms are also important in the food chain, providing a crucial protein-rich source of food for other important species such as birds, hedgehogs and frogs.

""The aim now is to gather more data and improve the technology further,"" Andrew Baker, managing director of Baker Consultants, told the Sunday Telegraph. 

""We are going out to literally tens of thousand of hectares of land to build up a database of the sounds that can be heard in soil.

""That way we can use it to compare any new data we get through, allowing farmers to listen to their soil, run it through a computer and find out just how healthy their soil actually is.

""Ultimately, it is hoped that the study will help develop a system to monitor the activity of earthworms and other soil fauna, to help farmers grow crops more efficiently.""

Farmer's daughter who complained about 'sexist' will wins £650k payout after suing brothers

Judge finds Julie Mate was not properly recognised for her work that increased the value of farmland from £300,000 to £9 million

A farmer's daughter who claimed sexism resulted in her brothers being favoured in her father's will has won a £650,000 payout after she won a battle with her family to benefit from work she had done on the land.

Julie Mate and her sisters were left just £12,000 each after their father, Donald Mate, died in 1992. He left his share of the farm to her brothers, Andrew and Robert, and his wife Shirley, who later handed her portion to her sons.

Julie, 62, claimed she had sacrificed school and her social life as a child to work alongside her brothers on the family's 140-acre West Yorkshire dairy farm, and that she and her sisters were the victims of old-fashioned sexist traditions.

She said that she had wanted to return to the farm to work full-time as an adult, but her brothers had told her ""you're not coming back"" after she studied animal science at university.

She has now won a £652,000 payout from her brothers' fortune after a judge found it was her work which had led to the value of part of the land increasing from £300,000 to £9 million.

Judge Andrew Sutcliffe KC said the brothers had been ""unjustly enriched"" by Julie's years of work in getting the land removed from the Green Belt so it could be sold to developers to build a 250-house estate, and that it was right she should share in the windfall.

Looked into ways of making money

A few years after her father died, Julie started to look into ways of making money from the land, she claimed.

She said that she had been encouraged by her mother to look into the potential for redevelopment of 40 acres of farmland, known as Netherton Moor.

She deployed a planning consultant and worked on the project between 2008 and late 2015, claiming she relied on promises made to her by her mother that if she secured its allocation for housing, the proceeds would be shared equally in the family.

The land was ultimately included in the council's Local Plan in 2015, but Julie soon discovered that her mother and brothers had already agreed a £9 million sale to developers Persimmon Homes to build a 250-house estate without her knowledge.

And the following year, despite knowing she would be due a massive windfall, her mother executed a deed of trust handing her beneficial interest in the land to her two sons.

In a letter written to her sister Virginia, read out to the court, Julie wrote: ""To be extremely blunt, given the value of the farm - when dad died, but particularly now - we three have been extremely badly done to.

'Male chauvinism doesn't wash now'

""You can call it the outcome of a male-dominated farming tradition, bloody mindedness, or simply male chauvinism - whatever it was, and with no disrespect to Dad, it really doesn't wash nowadays.""

Julie sued her mother and two brothers in 2020, claiming unsuccessfully that she had been promised an equal share of the proceeds of sale if she managed to have the land removed from the Green Belt.

The judge said there was no documentary evidence to show that such promises were made and the first time Julie even mentioned them was in a letter in 2020.

But she also sued for ""unjust enrichment"", claiming that they had benefited hugely from her work and that she never intended to do it ""for nowt"".

The judge ruled in her favour on this point, accepting her evidence that ""at no time did she tell either of her brothers or Shirley that she would work on this project for nothing, without expectation of any reward"".

The judge awarded Julie a payment of £652,000 from her brothers, representing a 7.5 per cent share of the uplift in value of the land from its original value of £300,000 to the £9 million it sold for.

Planet-friendly diet cuts risk of early death by 25 per cent, Harvard study finds

The sustainable diet focuses on vegetables, greens, fruits and whole grains, while cutting down on meat, fish, eggs and cereals

Protecting the planet may also protect health, scientists have claimed, after finding ""green"" foods reduce the risk of an early death by 25 per cent.

Experts discovered that those who followed a more sustainable diet - eating predominantly vegetables, greens, fruits and whole grains, while reducing meat, fish, eggs and cereals, were less likely to die over the course of three decades.

The findings were based on the health outcomes of more than 100,000 people in the US, from 1986 to 2018, of whom more 47,000 died during the follow-up period.

Those who scored highest on the Planetary Health Diet Index - which measures how well people stick to the recommended daily intake of foods that are good for the planet - were 15 per cent less likely to have died from cancer or heart disease.

They also had a 20 per cent lower chance of death from neurodegenerative disease, and their risk of death from respiratory disease was halved. Overall a ""green"" diet cut the risk of an early death by a quarter.

The findings were presented at Nutrition 2023, the annual meeting for the American Society for Nutrition in Boston.

Linh Bui, a doctoral student in the Department of Nutrition at Harvard University's TH Chan School of Public Health, said: ""I have always been concerned about mitigating human impacts on the environment.

""A sustainable dietary pattern should not only be healthy, but also consistent within planetary boundaries for greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental parameters.

""The results confirmed our hypothesis that a higher Planetary Health Diet score was associated with a lower risk of mortality.""

The Planetary Health Diet takes into account both the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, bowel cancer, diabetes and stroke, as well as environmental impacts such as water use, land use, nutrient pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.

There is some evidence that plant-based foods such as whole grains, fruit, non-starchy vegetables, nuts and unsaturated oils were healthier and less harmful to the environment than red and processed meats, although it has been disputed.

A recent special edition of the journal Animal Frontiers claimed that meat is crucial for human health and warned against ""zealotry"" pushing vegetarian and vegan diets.

It warned that it is difficult to replace the nutritional content of meat, arguing that poorer communities with low meat intake often suffer from stunting, wasting and anaemia, driven by a lack of vital nutrients and protein.

Nearly 1,000 scientists across the globe have signed The Dublin Declaration, arguing that livestock farming was vital to society.

Ms Bui accepted that the PHDI may need to be adapted for different countries, depending on their culture or religion and cautioned that people with specific health conditions or food accessibility issues may find a planet friendly diet challenging.

She said: ""We hope that researchers can adapt this index to specific food cultures and validate how it is associated with chronic diseases and environmental impacts such as carbon footprint, water footprint, and land use in other populations.""

The NHS advises that red meat - such as beef, lamb and pork - is a good source of protein, vitamins and minerals, and that it can form part of a balanced diet, although it warns that eating more than 90 grams per day can raise the risk of bowel cancer.

More from The Telegraph

Honey bees aren't an endangered species; they're causing chaos

Yes, everyone loves them and keeping them has become a green hobby, but they'd feel differently if a swarm besieged their home

For days, there were only a few, upstairs - blown in through a window, I assumed, by the late spring breeze. But then more came downstairs, gaining ominously in number until one morning three weeks ago, I walked into the living room to find hundreds of the creatures crawling, seemingly lethargic, over the carpet.

""Wasps!"" I wailed to my analyst husband, Chris, who like me is 44. I frantically vacuumed them up and deposited them outside as fast as they arrived, until the pest controller arrived. Pointing at a cloud of black dots dancing around our third-floor chimney, he corrected me: ""You've got honey bees.""

Being gatecrashed by sugar plum fairies would have been simpler, and less controversial, to navigate. While not illegal, pesticides permitted to treat honey bees in a domestic setting are strictly limited, ethically questionable, and some pest controllers refuse to deploy them.

Short of advising us to stuff the fireplaces they'd been flying in through, and spend hundreds hiring a cherry picker to send someone up to the roof to physically extract them (with no guarantee of success) there was little he could do, the pest control man apologised, letting us know, for what it was worth, that we are far from alone.

This month beekeepers reported an increase in honeybee swarms - which happen when the old queen departs the hive with half the bees to set up a new home - caused by the sudden change in weather after a long, cold spring.

Usually, this split happens in a ""staggered manner,"" explains Matthew Richardson, president of the Scottish Beekeepers' Association, but because of the delay in decent weather ""the bees have been queuing up waiting to swarm and they're all going at once.""

For many, the image might gladden the heart. Chris's eyes certainly softened when I disclosed the identity of our uninvited guests and our 12-year-old daughter Rosie was delighted: ""They're an endangered species!""

But are they? In recent years, wildlife campaigners have made huge efforts to raise awareness of the importance of bees, of which there are around 270 species in the UK, including 24 species of bumble bees and hundreds of wild solitary bees that nest alone in cavities or underground.

Many are in decline - we have already lost around 13 species, including the short-haired bumblebee, last recorded in 1956, and the great yellow bumblebee in 1974. Another 35 species are currently at risk, with the use of pesticides in farming and destruction of pollen and nectar to feed off largely to blame - the UK has lost 97 per cent of its wildflower meadows since the 1930s.

Concern around honey bees, however, seems to stem from 2007, when an unexplained condition called colony collapse disorder (CCD), in which worker bees in a honey bee colony disappear, was officially recognised. Colony losses were reported in America and Europe and the potential impact on agriculture - according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the global value of global crops pollinated by honey bees in 2005 was estimated at over £150bn - was huge.

Within a decade, the threat of CCD seemingly passed, but our passion for honey bees continued, often in cities where beekeeping has become a fashionable ""green"" hobby. In 2021 UK Google searches for ""urban beekeeping"" jumped 21 per cent in a year. Celebrities who keep bees, meanwhile, include David Beckham and Jeremy Clarkson and last month a picture of the Princess of Wales wearing a beekeeper's suit while tending to a hive in her Norfolk estate was released to mark World Bee Day.

Yet honey bees, the only species that makes honey, are not at risk - and, experts warn, our obsession with breeding them could be detrimental to bee species that are. 

""There's definitely a popular misconception around bees,"" says Andrew Whitehouse of insect conservation charity Buglife, who says honey bees are ""not endangered, they're essentially livestock"" and believes misunderstandings began when charities such as his own started to raise awareness of the importance of all pollinating insects around 20 years ago: ""Perhaps the conservation organisations didn't explain things properly and well-meaning people reached for the solution which was to increase the number of honey bees."" 

At the same time as charities were starting to promote the importance of ""wild pollinators,"" he adds, CCD was becoming widely known: ""I think the two issues were conflated a bit.""

Because honey bees are good at collecting pollen and returning it straight to their hives, they are less efficient at pollinating some plants than wild bees, with whom they compete for pollen. And honey bee hives are bigger than most - containing a typical 50,000 bees, compared with 500 bumble bees in a hive. ""That's a lot of bee mouths,"" says Whitehouse, who stresses that ""beekeeping can be done in perfect harmony with the natural world"" but that ""unsustainable numbers of honey bees"" in areas lacking flower rich habitats is a problem because it ""puts further pressure on our wild bees.""

Bees in decline include the carpenter bee, named because it burrows into soft wood to lay its eggs, the large mason bee, limited to a couple of sites in the LlÅ·n Peninsula in North Wales, and the six-banded nomad bee, Britain's rarest species, now only found on Prawle Point cliffs in South Devon.

That the nomad is a ""cuckoo"" bee that lays its eggs in other bees' nest, and its choice of host, the long-horned bee, is also in decline, makes its preservation especially ""complicated"" says Whitehouse, whose charity works with local farmers and the National Trust to increase the amount of specialised habitat they require, and stresses we need ""urgent action to make sure they don't disappear.""

Because honey bee hives are frequently traded between keepers, diseases such as deformed wing virus and Varroa mite can spread, and in 2019, research from the University of Vermont found viruses in managed honey bee hives were also spreading to wild bumble bee populations, suggesting they should be kept away from vulnerable pollinators.

In truth, I'd prefer they were kept out of our home too (we live in the East Midlands). The British Beekeepers' Association (BBKA) advises those who find a swarm to search the directory on its site for a local volunteer beekeeper ""swarm collector"" to remove it. Julie Macken, 53, a beekeeper from West Oxen whose bees make products for her skincare company Neve's Bees, has collected three such swarms from gardens in the past week, by holding a cardboard box underneath the swam, knocking them inside and covering it with a sheet. But she admits, ""if they're high up on chimneys there's little we can do. I'm not qualified to climb a ladder. You might find they'll fly away, but I have seen them live in a chimney for years and you get honey seeping through the walls, which is not ideal.""

Indeed. In March, Andrew and Kate Dempsey, both in their early 40s and parents of two, discovered a six-foot piece of honeycomb under their floorboards after they noticed honey dripping down the walls of their family home in Folkestone, Kent. ""We kept cutting these floorboards away and more and more honeycomb kept appearing,"" said Kate, who spent weeks rectifying the ""horrendous"" mess she was quoted up to £10,000 to have dealt with professionally.

""If bees build combs in wall voids, ceilings, or other enclosed spaces, it can lead to structural problems, staining, and potential infestations of other pests like ants,"" says Paul Blackhurst, head of technical academy at Rentokil Pest Control. ""Once honey has been identified, it can be challenging and messy and can require invasive methods, potentially leading to further damage.""

He says in most cases treatment is not necessary - bees may decide to leave of their own volition. In any case Rentokil has a policy of not treating nests. Instead, the company refers people to the BBKA or a local beekeeper. But a local beekeeper can't help, and says getting bees out of chimneys is a job for a specialist. A second pest controller says he would use pesticides to destroy a nest, rather than trying to catch the swarm, which I don't want to do. Other ""bee removal"" businesses say they can remove nests without pesticides, using thermal imaging cameras to locate the colony and vacuums to remove the bees alive. But of course, they'll need to reach the chimney to do so.

Since stuffing our fireplaces with pillows, the number of honeybees flying inside has dwindled to around 50 a day - they arrive dozy, die quickly, and I don't worry about getting stung. Yet on a sunny day, the swarm around our chimney swells, along with visions of our home covered in honeycomb, and the question of whether to bee, or not to bee (and blow the budget on a cherry picker) buzzes ever louder.

Eat turnips instead of tomatoes during shortages, Therese Coffey suggests

Key moments

Chosen by us to get you up to speed at a glance

People should eat turnips instead of salad vegetables while supermarkets grapple with shortages, Environment Secretary ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey has suggested.

Ms Coffey told MPs on Thursday said people ""would be eating turnips right now"" if the UK was more focused on seasonal eating.

Her comments came in response to a question in the House of Commons about shortages on shelves, with major supermarkets rationing sales of items such as peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes.

Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, accused the minister of taking a high-handed approach, summing up Ms Coffey's comments as: ""Let them eat turnips"".

A Downing Street spokesman said the Environment Secretary was ""setting out the importance of celebrating the produce that we grow in the UK.""

""Ultimately it's for individuals to choose what food they wish to buy,"" they said.

Major supermarkets Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and Aldi have all begun limiting the sale of some peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes to three per customer amid a squeeze on supply caused by bad weather in Morocco and Spain. 

Former Sainsbury's chief executive Justin King blamed Brexit for the disruption, telling BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that the food industry had been ""significantly disrupted by Brexit"", as the sector was ""very integrated across Europe"".

A Downing Street spokesman played down suggestions that Brexit was to blame, saying supermarkets had cited ""poor weather in Spain and North Africa"" for the shortages.

A spokesman for the British Tomato Growers Association (BTGA) said domestic crops would not be available for some weeks. They said: ""The British tomato season will soon begin and we expect significant volumes of British tomatoes on shelves by the end of March and into April 2023.""

Ms Coffey said: ""Even if we cannot control the weather, it is important that we try and make sure the supply continues to not be frustrated in quite the way it has been due to these unusual weather incidents.""

Senior officials in Morocco urged British officials not to let the current tomato shortages spoil post-Brexit diplomatic relations and promised imports would resume within days.

Morrocan food chiefs said ""occasional and involuntary"" disruption should not affect ""a solid and long-standing relationship of trust between the two countries"".

A spokesman for Moroccan Foodex, which monitors exports for the Moroccan Government, said: ""Regarding the recent disruptions in the supply of tomatoes, they are explained by an unfortunate accumulation of factors and circumstances.""

These included an ""unusual"" bout of cold weather that caused a slowdown in plant growth and fruit maturity, as well as ""significant"" rainfall which delayed fruit picking on farms.

Bad weather in the Strait of Gibraltar has also ""caused significant maritime traffic disruptions"".

However, the Foodex spokesman said: ""It should be noted that climatic conditions have improved in recent days in Morocco, and therefore the return to normal is expected for the next few days.""

Morocco signed a post-Brexit trade deal with the UK in 2019 helping exports to the UK surging by approximately 40pc from 2020 to 2022.

Tomato production in Spain, another major market for Britain, dropped 22pc over the first weeks of 2023, according to the country's export association, FEPEX.

It said: ""Vegetable production has returned to a normal pace. The effect on the better supply will be seen in the coming weeks.""

LSE prepares first listing of 2023

A Saudi property developer is poised to become the first company to list on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) this year in a rare boost for the beleaguered market. 

My colleague Simon Foy has the details:

DarGlobal, which focuses on international luxury developments, will raise $72m (£60m) through a direct listing on the main market in London, which is expected to value the business at around $600m. 

The move represents the first listing on the LSE this year after a prolonged dealmaking drought triggered by the war in Ukraine continued into 2023. 

Ziad El Chaar, chief executive of DarGlobal, said: ""London [is] the best location for us as we look to access new capital and build our global visibility with development and luxury brand partners.""

Share prices dip for banks and health giants going ex-dividend

Share prices have fallen for the banks and healthcare majors going ex-dividend, ultimately dragging down the FTSE 100. 

Reports during early trading indicated that some banks, including Barclays and Standard Chartered, and healthcare giants AstraZeneca and GSK, and other big companies traded ""ex-dividend"", meaning that the stock's dividend is paid to the previous owner even after it has changed hands. 

Here are the end-of-day figures:

Standard Chartered: share price dropped 2.3pc to 746.20p

AstraZeneca: share price dropped 2.21pc to 11,246p

Unilever: share price dropped 1.73pc to 4,192.5p

GSK: share price dropped 0.87pc to 1,468.91p

Barclays: share price dropped 0.23pc to 172.43p

A stock's price usually drops by the amount of the declared dividend on the ex-dividend date.

FTSE 100 decline continues

The FTSE 100 ended another day in the red, closed down 0.29pc at 7,907.72. 

Britain's blue-chip index was hampered by reports that banking and healthcare majors traded without an entitlement for a dividend payout, including GSK, AstraZeneca, Unilever, and Standard Chartered.

However, losses were limited by a surge in Rolls-Royce after its boss outlined a strategic overhaul. My colleague Howard Mustoe has the full details.

Yesterday, the aerospace and defence company was within the top-five FTSE 100 fallers. Today, the British manufacturer tops the risers leaderboard after its share price jumped 22.47pc to 131.8p.

However, the domestically-focused FTSE 250 finished up 0.56pc to 19,790.49.

LME to reopen nickel trading during Asian hours

The London Metal Exchange's nickel market is returning to Asian trading hours, ending the suspension introduced after last year's metal crisis.

From March 20, the Exchange will reopen its nickel market during Asian trading hours - bringing it forward to 1am from 8am London time. ""This is expected to further contribute to liquidity rebuilding in the LME Nickel market,"" the exchange said.

It lifts restrictions introduced last March when spiking nickel prices during Asian trading hours ignited a runaway short squeeze.

Fears of shortages triggered by sanctions against major producer Russia pushed prices up as much as 250pc, meaning investors who bet heavily against nickel faced hefty losses.

Among them was Chinese industrialist Xiang Guangda, known as ""Big Shot"", whose company Tsingshan Holding Group, the world's biggest nickel and stainless steel producer, faced losing billions of dollars.

US climate envoy backs Biden's World Bank nomination

John Kerry, the United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, gets behind Joe Biden's nomination of former Mastercard chief Ajay Banga to become the next World Bank president. 

Ajay Banga is the right choice to take on the responsibilities of @WorldBank at this critical moment. The climate crisis requires new thinking and creative vision regarding finance, so that we can meet the challenge of the energy transition. (1/3)

Ajay has proven his ability as a manager of large institutions, and understands investment and the mobilization of capital to power the green transition. (2/3)

He can help put in place new policies that help deploy the large sums of money necessary to reduce global emissions and help developing and vulnerable countries adapt, build resilience, and mitigate the impact of greenhouse gases. (3/3)

Biden nominates ex-Mastercard chief to lead World Bank

President Joe Biden nominated former Mastercard boss Ajay Banga to become the next president of the World Bank.

Mr Banga, 63, who spent a decade as president and chief executive of Mastercard, currently serves as vice chairman at US investment firm General Atlantic.

The surprise nomination comes after current World Bank leader David Malpass, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, last week unexpectedly announced plans to resign by the end of June.

""Ajay is uniquely equipped to lead the World Bank at this critical moment in history,"" said President Biden.

""He also has critical experience mobilizing public-private resources to tackle the most urgent challenges of our time, including climate change,"" he added.

Whoever takes on the role will be tasked with reforming the nearly 80-year-old institution, headquartered in Washington. They'll also oversee billions of dollars of funding to achieve the bank's goal of tackling climate change and poverty.

The final selection isn't expected until early May.

Veg rationing: Leeks are next

British shoppers should also brace themselves for a leek shortage, growers have warned. 

Tim Casey, chairman of the Leek Growers Association, explained: ""Leek farmers are facing their most difficult season ever, due to the challenging weather conditions. Our members are seeing yields down by between 15pc and 30pc.""

The supply of home grown leeks will be exhausted by April, with no British leeks available in shops between May and June, he predicted. 

UK production of leeks has been dented by record high temperatures last year, followed by a lack of rainfall and more recently a period of extreme cold weather. 

Handing over

Ok, I'm off to eat some tomatoes I've got in the fridge, or maybe I should seek out a turnip? Either way, Adam Mawardi will guide you through the next few hours.

Why are UK supermarkets rationing fruit and vegetables?

Fruits and vegetables are being rationed in supermarkets as grocers struggle to source enough fresh produce. But why?

Tesco, Asda, Aldi and Morrisons have all imposed limits on the number of peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes customers can buy, with warnings from some industry experts that restrictions could be in place for weeks.

Other supermarkets have experienced shortages but have not yet imposed measures to limit purchases.

Why is this happening?

Senior business reporter Daniel Woolfson explains here why supermarkets all face weeks of shortages.

FTX founder charged with making 300 illegal political donations

Sam Bankman-Fried and his co-conspirators allegedly made more than 300 illegal political donations in the United States, according to a new indictment against the FTX cryptocurrency exchange founder.

The donations, totalling tens of millions of dollars, were unlawful because they were attributed to a ""straw donor"" or made using corporate funds, it was claimed in the fresh counts unsealed in a Manhattan federal court today.

Prosecutors claimed this often allowed Mr Bankman-Fried to evade contribution limits on individual contributions to candidates.

Overall, the new indictment contains four fraud charges and eight conspiracy charges.

Mr Bankman-Fried was previously hit with eight counts of fraud, money laundering and other charges over the collapse of the now-bankrupt exchange. He has pleaded not guilty in those cases.

Prosecutors claim Mr Bankman-Fried used the stolen customer funds to plug losses at Alameda Research, his hedge fund.

Alameda's former chief executive, Caroline Ellison, and a former FTX executive, Gary Wang, have both pleaded guilty to fraud charges and agreed to cooperate with the investigation. 

Ms Ellison and Mr Wang have not been cited under the new indictment among the co-conspirators, who have not been named.

Nvidia surges as shift into AI pays off

Nvidia jumped in early trading after giving a bullish revenue outlook for the current quarter, suggesting that a push into artificial intelligence processors is helping offset sluggish demand for personal computer chips. 

Sales in the three months ending in April will be about $6.5bn (£5.4bn), the company said, ahead of estimates of just under $6.4bn, according to data complied by Bloomberg.

Shares in the California-based company rose as much as 12.3pc, adding more than $56bn (£46.5bn) in market value and taking its year-to-date gains to about $200bn, a rise of nearly 60pc. 

The forecast signals that Nvidia's push into AI computing chips is paying off. 

Under chief executive and co-founder Jensen Huang, the company has parlayed its dominance of graphics processors into a strong position in the growing market for AI hardware. 

Wall Street rises at opening bell

US markets have opened higher even as the latest data indicated that the labour market remains tight.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.4pc to 33,166.44 at the opening bell while the S&P 500 gained 0.7pc to 4,019.30.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 1.1pc to 11,619.28.

Netflix cuts prices in 30 countries

Netflix is cutting prices in more than 30 countries, the biggest round of reductions in its history, as it battles growing competition and slowing subscriber numbers.

Technology editor James Titcomb has the details:

The streaming giant is reducing monthly fees by as much as half in certain markets in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. 

The move is a reversal for Netflix, which has historically raised prices as its library of TV shows and films expands. 

The company's growth has stuttered in recent months and it has introduced a cheaper advertising-supported version in an attempt to boost numbers. 

Netflix's cut comes as viewers are faced with a glut of streaming options. 

Netflix, which helped pioneer video streaming, competes with Disney, Amazon, Apple, and a string of US networks such as HBO, Paramount and NBC.

Pound slips as US labour market remains tight

The pound has edged lower against the dollar as new data showed the US labour market remains resilient in the face of the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases meant to cool the economy.

Sterling has dropped 0.1pc against the greenback toward $1.20.

Applications for unemployment benefits in the US for the week ending February 18 fell by 3,000 last week to 192,000, from 195,000 the previous week, the Labor Department said. 

It is the sixth straight week claims were under 200,000.

Wall Street poised to move higher

Markets on Wall Street are still expected to open higher as the number of Americans filing for state unemployment benefits in the previous week unexpectedly fell.

Data showed the number of Americans filing for state unemployment benefits in the week ended February 18 were 192,000 compared to 195,000 a week before. Analysts expected 200,000 new claims.

Separately, a second reading for fourth-quarter gross domestic product data rose by 2.7pc from a 2.9pc increase in the last quarter. 

Investors are growing in confidence that the Federal Reserve's peak interest rate would be within levels already priced in by markets. 

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures contracts were up 0.2pc, S&P 500 was up 0.4pc and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.8pc.

Fruit and vegetable shortages could last a month, says Coffey

Shortages of some fruits and vegetables may last as long as another month, the Environment Secretary has told the Commons.

Therese Coffey told MPs: 

I am led to believe by my officials after discussion with industry and retailers, we anticipate the situation will last about another two to four weeks.

It is important that we try and make sure that we get alternative sourcing options. That is why the department has already been in discussion with the retailers.

It is why there will be further discussions led by ministers as well, so that we can try and get over this and try and avoid similar situations in the future.

Even if we cannot control the weather it is important that we try and make sure the supply continues to not be frustrated in quite the way it has been due to these unusual weather incidents.

Ms Coffey also warned Labour to ""be careful about making sure that we continue to have confidence in the food supply chain"" as shadow environment secretary Jim McMahon asked a question on the issue.

Ben & Jerry's developing ice cream that won't melt

Ben & Jerry's and Magnum owner Unilever is trying to make its ice creams hardier in an effort to cut down on emissions.

Senior business reporter Daniel Woolfson has the details:

Unilever is experimenting with ways to store its ice cream at warmer temperatures so that freezers can run at lower temperatures.

The company has been trialling warmer freezers in Germany and also reformulating some ice creams to withstand higher temperatures without melting, losing their structure or texture.

Unilever ultimately wants to be able to keep its frozen treats at 10 degrees Fahrenheit (-1c), rather than the current zero Fahrenheit (-18c), to crack down on greenhouse gas emissions, according to The Wall Street Journal (WSJ).

Read what the impact of the move could be if it is successful.

Oil climbs after lengthy losses

Oil has risen  ""” after the longest run of losses this year ""” as prices swung with a fluctuating dollar and traders looked toward US inventory figures due later.

Brent crude, the international benchmark, has climbed 1.2pc today north of $81 a barrel but remains down 6.3pc from when it neared $87 on February 13.

West Texas Intermediate has jumped 1pc toward $75. 

The dollar's fortunes have driven crude in recent days, with gains tempered by Federal Reserve minutes released Wednesday that were more closely aligned with the market's monetary tightening outlook.

Crude has been under pressure this week as renewed expectations of rate hikes countered longer-term optimism about Chinese consumption rising later in the year. 

Intensive talks with EU on Northern Ireland trade continue, says No 10

Britain is still in talks with the European Union over changes to Northern Ireland's post-Brexit trading arrangements, the Prime Minister's spokesman said, as expectations for a deal this week fade.

Asked if a deal on the Northern Ireland protocol would be announced by the end of the week, the spokesmasn said: ""We are still in intensive negotiations.

""Those have made progress, which is to be welcomed. As you heard from the prime minister directly yesterday, there is still more to do.""

It comes as Sir Keir Starmer used a speech in Manchester to unveil five new ""missions"" for a Labour government.

Genus shares surge as China demand grows

Animal genetics company Genus has seen its shares surge as much as 14pc on the FTSE 250 amid hopes of recovery in Chinese demand.

The livestock breeding and agricultural consultancy was boosted in the second half of last year by an improvement in profit from China, with higher hog prices during the period.

The company is expecting to make final regulatory submissions by the end of the year for its gene editing programme for the prevention of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus - known as PRRSv.

It is also increasing its research and development spending.

Revenue during the six-month period was up a quarter to £350.2m whole adjusted pre-tax profits grew 14pc to £42.2m.

Its chief executive Stephen Wilson has announced his decision to retire by the end of September. A search for a successor is underway.

New home registrations hit 15-year high

New home registrations surged by more than a quarter last year in the strongest 12 months for the supply of fresh housing since 2007, according to an industry body.

However, supply waned during a weak end to the year in the wake of the mini-Budget.

The National House Building Council (NHBC), which released the figures, said that across the UK, 191,801 new registrations were recorded in 2022.

That number was 26pc higher than in 2021, according to the figures given to the PA news agency, and marked the highest annual total since 198,467 in 2007.

Builders register homes with the NHBC before work starts, so the figures indicate the supply of homes in the pipeline.

However, the final three months of 2022 had been ""challenging"" after a strong performance earlier in the year.

There was a 21pc drop in new home registrations in the last quarter of the year compared with the previous quarter as the impact of September's mini-Budget and wider economic challenges took hold, the NHBC said.

It said London was particularly affected by the fall in registrations towards the end of the year, with northern England and Wales also being impacted.

'Significant volumes' of tomatoes by March, say growers

Consumers have been reassured they can expect to see ""significant volumes"" of British tomatoes on supermarket shelves by the end of March as retailers impose buying limits to cope with a shortage.

The British Tomato Growers Association (BTGA) said shortages which have seen Tesco, Asda, Aldi and Morrisons impose buying limits are mainly down to a lack of imports but the local growing season is due to begin soon.

The BTGA said in a statement: 

Many people have commented on the current lack of fresh tomatoes in some supermarket stores.

Whilst this is predominantly a consequence of the lack of imported product at this time of year, the British season will soon begin and we expect significant volumes of British tomatoes on shelves by the end of March and into April 2023.

The British tomato season runs from the end of March until November each year.

Inflation at 2pc by December, says Santander

Santander has become the latest bank to predict that inflation in Britain will fall later this year more rapidly than it had previously forecast.

Its analysts have said price rises will drop to the Bank of England's 2pc target by December and fall further to a low of 0.6pc by June next year, ending 2024 at just 1.2pc.

However, UK chief economist Victoria Clarke said she remains ""concerned that whilst headline inflation looks set to fall rapidly, core inflation could remain sticky amidst the tight UK labour market and strength in pay growth"". 

She added that the bank's core inflation forecasts do not fall below 2pc in our projections this year or next.

This week Citigroup forecast that inflation will fall down to 2.4pc in the final three months of the year and dip to 1.9pc in the first quarter of 2025.

Eurozone core inflation hit record in January, data show

Underlying inflation in the eurozone hit a record in January, revised data showed, likely cementing the European Central Bank's plan to raise interest rates by another half-point next month.

Core price gains reached 5.3pc ""” more than an initial reading of 5.2pc ""” Eurostat said. 

Headline inflation, which includes food and power, also ticked up by 0.1 percentage point to 8.6pc after Germany's figure turned out to be higher than the agency's initial estimate.

European Central Bank (ECB) officials led by President Christine Lagarde said at the their last meeting that they intend to lift the deposit rate to 3pc from 2.5pc when they gather next to set borrowing costs. 

With that move now seemingly locked in, even more attention will fall on the policy path beyond March 16.

Following tough remarks last week from Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel, markets expect the peak of the ECB's rate cycle at about 3.75pc.

Including the actual German figures, core inflation ticked up slightly month-on-month in January. Interestingly, services inflation continues to trend down while goods inflation is up. Expect those trends to reverse in coming months. pic.twitter.com/wkKoWUuOsI

Global outlook improving, says US Treasury Secretary

The global economy is in a better place today than many predicted months ago, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said, while reiterating her calls for support to Ukraine on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion.

Ms Yellen's comments highlight a shift in tone on the global economic outlook from the last time the world's top policymakers met in October.

She was speaking at a press conference in Bengaluru, India, where finance ministers and central bank governors from the G20 countries are gathering until Saturday. 

She said: ""The challenges we face are real, and the future is always uncertain. But the outlook has improved since we gathered in the fall.""

Her comments come just a few weeks after the International Monetary Fund said it saw a ""turning point"" for the global economy and raised its growth outlook for the first time in a year.

At home, Yellen pointed to a resilient US economy, where headline inflation has moderated over the past few months and the labour market remains strong.

Gas prices steady as Asian demand picks up

European gas prices have steadied this week after losing 35pc since the start of the year as demand increases from China and India.

The drop in the price of liquified natural gas to a 19-month low has made the fuel more affordable again the Asian buyers.

Dutch futures, the European benchmark, continue to trade around the â‚¬50 megawatt hour mark where it has been for the last few days.

A milder winter and surging supplies saw gas prices collapse in recent months from their record highs set in August last year in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Dutch front-month contracts are up 1.6pc today.

Pivot 'not imminent' on interest rates, says Bank of England chief

The Bank of England has been ""insufficiently"" aggressive in dealing with inflation in light of the scale of the multiple shocks if faced last year, according to one of its policy chiefs.

Catherine Mann said the financial conditions are ""now looser than what likely will be needed"" if the Bank is to stop inflation becoming embedded in prices and wage growth.

She warned that ""this constellation could yield extended persistence of inflation into this year and the next"".

Ms Mann is one of the most hawkish members of the Bank's monetary policy committee, having consistently voted for higher rate rises. In a speech at the Resolution Foundation, she added: 

I believe that more tightening is needed, and caution that a pivot is not imminent. 

In my view, a preponderance of turning points is not yet in the data. 

We have an inflation remit, and we will achieve it one way or another. 

Failing to do enough now risks the worst of both worlds - the higher inflation and lower activity of the 'purple' regime - as monetary policy will have to stay tighter for longer to ensure that inflation returns sustainably back to the 2pc target.

Drax profits nearly double as energy prices surge

Electricity generator Drax Group almost doubled its profits last year as it locked in soaring power prices driven by Europe's energy crisis.

The company beat estimates, posting £731m adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, it revealed in its annual results. 

The company, like other power producers, has benefitted from a surge in energy prices, prompting public backlash and windfall taxes. 

That has come despite rising costs of biomass ""” Drax's main source of generation ""” that it needs to import to burn in its flagship power station in Yorkshire, where workers have been on strike over a pay dispute.

Shares were down by 3.1pc making it the worst performing company on the FTSE 250 apart from property investor Supermarket Income REIT.

Management did not include formal guidance for the coming year. Drax did publish an analyst consensus showing estimates for record earnings of more than £1bn this year, after it was able to lock in higher prices for its electricity sales for the coming years.

Brexit to blame for supermarket fruit and veg rationing, says retail chief

Britain only has itself and Brexit to blame for food shortages in stores, the former head of Sainsbury's has said.

Justin King, a non-executive director at Marks & Spencer, said there was a ""genuine shortage"" of fruit and vegetables in the UK, but that: ""We did rather bring this problem on ourselves.""

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, Mr King, who headed up Sainsbury's for around a decade, said the UK was ""uniquely exposed to imports at this time of year"". 

He said the food industry had been ""significantly disrupted by Brexit"", as the sector was ""very integrated across Europe"".

His comments come after Tesco and Aldi yesterday became the latest to bring in restrictions on how many packs of fruit and vegetables customers could buy, in a battle to avoid empty shelves. 

It means Sainsbury's is the only one of the Big Four supermarkets not to have brought in limits. 

Morrisons and Asda announced their own restrictions earlier this week. 

Retail chiefs have argued the issues are not to do with Brexit, but instead weather conditions in the South of Europe and Northern Africa. 

The British Retail Consortium this week said: ""Difficult weather conditions in the South of Europe and Northern Africa have disrupted harvest for some fruit and vegetables including tomatoes and peppers.""

Only around 5pc of the tomatoes in store at this time of year are grown in Britain. Moroccan export chiefs told the Telegraph they would be back to supplying Britain at normal levels within the coming days. 

However, farmers have suggested the issues go much deeper and are just the ""tip of the iceberg"", pointing the finger at supermarkets for failing to pay more for produce, which led many growers not to plant in their greenhouses. 

Minette Batters, head of the National Farmers Union, earlier this week called for the Government to offer more support on energy costs to farmers.

Regulators 'got it wrong' on airline charging, says Heathrow boss

Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye said the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has ""clearly got it wrong"" in setting how much the airport can charge passengers.

He told the PA news agency: 

We are still loss making, and tomorrow I suspect we'll have IAG - one of the biggest airlines - announcing they've returned to profit, maybe even returning to dividends.

It shouldn't be the case that the economically regulated business which should have a smooth level of financing - that's one of the benefits of regulation - should still be loss-making when the unregulated airlines are back to profit already.

That's one of the things that shows the CAA has got the pricing wrong.

One of the reasons for that is that the pricing that they have set in their final proposals is lower for this five-year period than it was for the last five-year period, even though there are far fewer passengers and the financing costs are much higher because interest rates have gone up.

So the CAA has clearly got it wrong so far. We're hopeful that they will correct that in a couple of weeks, but if not then we have the opportunity to appeal.

Channel Tunnel operator's shares hit 16-month low

Channel Tunnel operator GetLink has suffered the worst drop in its share price since September 2020 after its full-year earnings fell short of expectations.

The stock is the third worst performing across France's SBF 120 Index, after an outlook for profits described as ""disappointing"" by some analysts.

GetLink expects earnings before charges like interest and taxes to be more than â‚¬910m (£802m), below the consensus of â‚¬1.9bn (£1.7bn).

Anglo American takes £1.4bn hit on Yorkshire mine

Anglo American has taken a $1.7bn (£1.4bn) writedown on the giant fertiliser project in Yorkshire that it rescued from collapse three years ago

Shares in the British mining company have fallen 1.4pc after it said capital spending on the Woodsmith project would be about $1bn (£830m).

The company had repeatedly delayed unveiling its development plans, after it bought the business in a 2020 from owner Sirius Minerals in a deal worth about half a billion dollars.

It said the mine - which will produce polyhalite - a type of potash found under the North Sea - is now expected to start sales in 2027.

The writedown reflects the difference in development approach from Sirius's plans.

Anglo American spent the last three years overhauling the mine designed by what was essentially a start-up, into a project that it sees as more suitable for a company of its size.

The company said: ""We believe that the changes we have made to the project have had a materially positive impact on the project's long term attractiveness and prospects"".

Rolls-Royce limits losses on FTSE 100

The FTSE 100 index has fallen as banking and healthcare majors traded without an entitlement for a dividend payout, but the losses were limited by a surge in Rolls-Royce after its boss outlined a strategic overhaul.

Some banks, including Barclays and Standard Chartered, and healthcare majors AstraZeneca and GSK traded ""ex-dividend"", meaning that the stock's dividend is paid to the previous owner even after it has changed hands. 

A stock's price usually drops by the amount of the declared dividend on the ex-dividend date.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 was down 0.2pc and is set for its third straight day of declines.

Engineering firm Rolls-Royce surged as much as 19pc after the company's new chief executive forecast more profit growth in 2023 after last year's profit beat expectations.

The domestically-inclined FTSE 250 midcap index rose 0.9pc, with John Wood Group jumping 32.3pc to the top of the index.

The oilfield services and engineering firm said it received and rejected takeover proposals from Apollo Global Management.

WPP shares surge as revenue grows

WPP shares have risen as much as 4.3pc this morning - eclipsed only by Rolls-Royce surging 19.4pc on the FTSE 100 - after it forecast further revenue growth despite an advertising slowdown.

The world's largest advertising agency said revenues had climbed 13pc to £14.4bn, ahead of analyst expectation, as it hailed strong performance driven by growth across all key agencies.

Chief executive Mark Read has been consolidating the group's large stable of agencies while folding in new technology and announcing partnerships with the likes of TikTok, Snap and Stripe. 

WPP's business bounced back following the ad spending freezes during the Covid-19 pandemic. As China reopens from its lockdowns, WPP announced the opening of its third campus in the country earlier this month.

Rolls-Royce shares surge as boss plans overhaul of ""˜burning platform'

Rolls Royce shares have surged 19pc after its new boss has launched a strategic review of the business just weeks after he described the engineering giant as ""a burning platform"".

Tufan Erginbilgic, who took over from Warren East as chief executive last month, said shareholders would not receive a dividend for 2022 as he vowed to boost profits and investor returns.

The company said it has identified seven key areas where it will seek improvements, from working capital to investment priorities and its culture.

Mr Erginbilgic, who spent two decades at BP, is pushing for Rolls-Royce to transform its operations, calling it a ""burning platform,"" the Financial Times reported last month. 

He has already shaken up operations after moving out the head of the civil aerospace unit while also bringing in BP veteran Nicola Grady-Smith as his chief transformation officer.

Read why the business has struggled.

FTSE 100 falls at the open

BAE Systems shares dropped 2.5pc as markets opened in London, dragging down Britain's blue chip index.

The FTSE 100 fell 0.3pc at the open to 7,907.05 but the domestically-focused FTSE 250 rose 0.2pc to 19,718.58.

Heathrow hit by lower passenger numbers

Heathrow airport has revealed it narrowed losses sharply in 2022 amid a bounce back in travel demand, but said profits were weighed on by surging cost pressures, lower passenger numbers and ""insufficient"" regulatory charges.

The group reported underlying pre-tax losses of £684m for last year, against losses of £1.3bn in 2021.

It said no dividends were paid in 2022 and none are planned for 2023 as it continues to rebuild after the industry was battered by pandemic travel restrictions.

The figures also come after last summer's major disruption for airports like Heathrow as the aviation sector struggled to cope with staff shortages and travellers were met with sudden flight cancellations and severe delays.

But Heathrow said it saw passenger numbers soar to 61.6m in 2022, up by 42.2m on a Covid-impacted 2021, which it claimed was the biggest increase of any major global airport.

Defence giant BAE posts record orders as Ukraine war boosts demand

Defence giant BAE Systems has reported record orders as countries respond to the ""elevated threat environment"" after Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

Britain's largest defence company took in orders worth £37bn last year and said its order backlog has risen to £59bn. 

Bosses said it was ""tragic that it took a war in Europe to raise the awareness of the importance of defence around the globe"".

Yet the company is well positioned to ""help national governments keep their citizens safe and secure in an elevated threat environment"", the company said in its annual results.

Sales increased by 4.4pc to £23.3bn, while underlying earnings per share increased by 9.5pc to 55.5p. It has increased its dividend by 7.6pc.

The FTSE 100-listed company posted flat operating profits of £2.4bn, but said that earnings on an underlying basis rose 5.5pc to £2.5bn as revenues leaped 8.9pc higher.

Chief executive Charles Woodburn said: ""Our record orders and financial performance give us confidence in delivering long-term growth and to continue investing in new technologies, facilities and thousands of highly skilled jobs, whilst increasing shareholder returns.""

Rolls-Royce's seven focal points for review

Here are Rolls-Royce chief executive's seven areas of focus for his strategic review of the business, announced in today's annual results:

Rolls-Royce to embark on strategic review as new boss vows 'materially high profit'

The new boss of Rolls-Royce has promised ""materially higher profit, cash flow and returns"" as he announced a strategic review into the engineering giant.

The business struggled as long-haul air travel was slower to recover from the pandemic than other sectors of the aviation industry.

The company said it has identified seven key areas where it will seek improvements, from working capital to investment priorities and its culture.

There will be no dividend for last year, even though its underlying operating profit of £652m was ahead of analyst estimates of £489m.

Chief executive Tufan Erginbilgic said: ""While our performance improved in 2022, we are capable of much more.""

Good morning

BAE Systems has seen its order book swell to £37bn as governments upped defence spending amid the war in Ukraine.

Chief executive Charles Woodburn said it was ""another year of strong results across the group"" as it upped its dividend and boosted sales by 4.4pc to £23.3bn.

What happened overnight 

Asian stocks were mixed following a broadly downbeat day on Wall Street as Federal Reserve minutes indicated a prolonged period of interest rate hikes.

Key stock indexes in Hong Kong and mainland China fluctuated. South Korea shares rose and Australian stocks fell. There was no trading of equities in Tokyo or Treasuries in Asian hours due to a holiday in Japan.

The 10-year US Treasury yield fell four basis points on Wednesday, although the decline moderated after the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve.

The minutes showed officials expect further interest rate increases to tame inflation. They also revealed that ""a few"" officials were open to a 50 basis-point hike in the central bank's meeting earlier this month when it raised interest rates 25 basis points.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3pc to 33,045.09, adding to the near-700 point drop from the previous day. Decline continued for the S&P 500, which closed down 0.2pc at 3,991.05.

On the other hand, the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite manged to pull itself into the green, finishing the day at 11,507.07, up 0.1pc.

The hairstyle to avoid if you're going bald

Noticed your hair thinning? Our new male grooming columnist is here to help

First, a disclaimer. I know how lucky I am to have a full head of hair at 40. It's increasingly grey, but it's there and - like my 80-year-old father's and his father before him - it's pretty abundant. I'm in the minority, however. By 35, two-thirds of men will have experienced some form of hair loss or thinning, so it's no wonder that the global industry devoted to preventing, slowing and navigating it is predicted to be worth almost £1.6 billion by the end of 2023.

Growing bald gracefully is a thorny issue: for every fellow who's happy to accept what the fates have dealt him, there's a man who's struggling with going bald and the impact it can have. ""˜It's a hugely emotive issue for men,' says Spencer Stevenson, who founded the Spex Hair initiative to create a community for men finding hair loss difficult, after he found himself thinning. ""˜There's no one-size-fits-all solution because it means different things to different people, but it can really affect a man's mental health,' says Stevenson, who in his endeavours has had hair transplants in the past. 

Transplants are a hot topic - celebrities including footballer Wayne Rooney and actor James Nesbitt have spoken about their experiences, lessening stigma around the procedure. But costing several thousand pounds a pop, it remains prohibitively expensive. Happily there are other options to consider.

Shop smart 

There are plenty of products out there promising to work hair-boosting miracles. But it's worth keeping in mind that parts of the hair-loss industry are designed to prey on men's insecurities, so be judicious in choosing products and opt for ones that are science-led, advises Stevenson. ""˜Nanogen products are very commonly used and well regarded,' he says. 

The brand's arsenal is broad, but an easy ""˜in' is its Shampoo for Men (£7.95), designed with amino acids that promote hair density. It won't move mountains, but can provide a little bit of bolstering. 

Scandinavian Biolabs products come with clinical research behind them - the brand's Bio-Pilixin Serum (£42) was developed using stem-cell technology and 93 per cent of users were satisfied during trials. 

Hims is also a respected name in the market, offering online consultations with a healthcare provider who can prescribe a package of treatments for you. Its Topical Hair Loss Spray (£27) contains Minoxidil, which promotes hair growth by reactivating dormant follicles.

The conceal deal

Stevenson points out that using ""˜make-up' - products applied to lend the appearance of thicker hair - is also a helpful ally in the battle of the bald. ""˜A lot of men do benefit from what we call ""concealers"",' says Stevenson. ""˜These work by combining with the hair shaft and thickens up the appearance of the hair.' 

Another option is Toppik Hair Building Fibers (£6.95), which are sprinkled on to thinning patches. The keratin fibres bond statically with your remaining hair to bulk it up - and the option to add a Fiberhold Spray (£11.95) to fix the fibres in place and make the area of coverage more localised is helpful, too.

To crop or not to crop

Ah, the question of clippers. ""˜Shaving to a very close crop is certainly one solution,' says Stevenson. ""˜It is empowering because you're taking the matter into your own hands, and if you're ready for it, it's like tearing off a band aid.' 

However, he adds, ""˜I'd recommend that any man in this position steel himself for the reactions, which can be jokingly unsympathetic in some situations,' he says, referring perhaps to laddish ribbing about slapheads or the Mitchell brothers. 

Domenico Casella, hairstylist at Neville Hair and Beauty in London's Belgravia, advises taking a more gradual approach. ""˜I would recommend reducing the length stage by stage,' says. ""˜This way it's less dramatic and allows you to get used to the idea of eventually having a close crop, and to the shape of your head.'

The hairstyle to avoid

You're not fully bald, but you're not exactly leonine, either. In which case there's one style to stay well away from: straggly and long on the sides, thinning up top. The fallacy for most men who've noticed things thinning is to make the most of the hair you've got - usually on the sides - and keep that bountiful. The issue here is that that it only serves to emphasise where the shortfalls are, and looks somewhat raggedy.

Think about your face furniture 

Stanley Tucci, Jason Statham, Mark Strong""¦ there are myriad examples of men who ""˜own' their bald-headedness. Take note of the little style touches that lend other points of interest: Tucci's thick-framed glasses or Statham's (likely somewhat manicured) sweep of stubble. Michael Douglas (not that one), founder of haircare brand MD London, maintains that a bald head means your teeth have to be in excellent condition. Perhaps a raffish foulard is your thing. 

Whatever the little nuance, it'll lend an extra, deliberate something, instead of looking apologetic about your polished head.

The cancer symptoms so many people miss

Early diagnosis can make a huge difference yet few of us know the common symptoms for the six deadliest cancers

Dave Dickinson looks back at his father's death in September 2021 and wonders if things could have been different. His dad, John, had been suffering with uncharacteristic back pain for two weeks when he went to the GP, who had a hunch something wasn't quite right.

""My dad rarely went to the doctor. The GP thought he looked unwell, so decided to run some bloods and send them off,"" says Dave, 38, an electrical engineer from Devon. 

The results of the blood test were unexpected and catastrophic. Dave's father had oesophageal cancer. A further scan revealed the tumour had spread down to the join with his stomach and was too advanced to be treatable. 

Tragically, four weeks later, at just 58, John was dead.

""It was so quick,"" recalls Dave. ""At the time, everything was such a blur but I remember my dad being very philosophical about it, saying he'd had a good life.""

Now, looking back, Dave wonders about the cancer that was growing insidiously inside his dad for years and has many unanswered questions.

""The cancer clearly didn't happen overnight,"" says Dickinson. ""He'd been suffering with indigestion for years. Could that have been part of this? Was it a symptom he shouldn't have ignored? Should he have gone to the doctor and even then, would it have been found?"" And then comes the hardest question of all: ""Could we have had more time with him?""

Oesophageal cancer is one of the six ""less survivable cancers"" that have a five-year survival rate of just 16 per cent - and persistent indigestion is one of the lesser-known symptoms. According to new research by the Less Survivable Cancers Taskforce, symptom-spotting is a huge problem for the six deadliest cancers - lung, liver, brain, oesophageal, pancreatic and stomach. 

The research revealed only one per cent of the 2001 adults surveyed were correctly able to identify the symptoms of liver cancer, and just two and three per cent respectively able to spot symptoms of oesophageal and stomach cancer. 

Anna Jewell, chair of the Less Survivable Cancers Taskforce, said it was ""deeply concerning"" that most people are unaware of common cancer symptoms.

More than 90,000 people are diagnosed with these six lethal cancers in the UK each year, leading to more than 67,000 deaths annually - around a half of all cancer deaths - and while 16 per cent of people, on average, survive five years after diagnosis, the taskforce is working to increase this to 28 per cent by 2029.

""Early diagnosis can make a huge and significant difference so it's essential that people become familiar with the symptoms, and are aware of any changes in their body,"" says Jewell. ""Any unusual or new symptoms - even if the symptoms seem unrelated to each other - must be taken to their GP.""

Consultant oncologist Professor Karol Sikora agrees. ""The earlier the cancer diagnosis the better the treatment options and the more chance of getting rid of it,"" he says. ""Stage 1 cancers are confined to the organ and are 90 per cent curable, Stage 2 cancers have travelled to the lymph nodes and have a cure rate of 70 per cent but with Stage 3 and 4 cancers, the cure rate drops down to 20 and 10 per cent as the cancer may be elsewhere in the body. If you have a symptom that persists and doesn't go away after two weeks, you need to seek medical advice.""

Surgery is the first treatment for most cancers - if caught early enough - with chemotherapy and radiotherapy being the two other most effective treatments. 

""It can be devastating to be diagnosed at a late stage when there are fewer treatment options,"" adds Jewell. ""Not only is it difficult for the person with the illness, but it has a huge impact on friends and family. It can be about fighting for more time with loved ones, which is very important.""

As well as the sudden loss of his father in 2021, Dave also lost his mother to pancreatic cancer in 2019. ""She had a stomach ache for a month or so and at first, she ignored it,"" says Dickinson. 

Eventually, she went to her GP who sent her home thinking it was an infection, but when she turned yellow, tests discovered a tumour in her pancreas that was causing problems in her liver. 

""She had a stent put in to open up the passageway between her pancreas and liver and that seemed to help and the prognosis was good,"" says Dickinson. ""We were optimistic she'd have treatment and live a cancer-free life.""

But the chemotherapy to shrink the tumour was problematic; Dickinson's mum kept getting infection after infection and the chemotherapy had to be stopped. Eight months after diagnosis, she passed away, at 56.

""It was very tough because she didn't want to talk about dying but at least we got a chance to tell her we loved her and to reassure her everything would be OK,"" says Dickinson. ""I do wish she'd been diagnosed earlier - you want as much time as possible - but it wasn't meant to be.""

According to Dr Sarah Holmes, medical director at Marie Curie UK, the country's leading end of life charity (mariecurie.org.uk), the length and quality of time you have with a loved one after a diagnosis is crucial. 

""If there's a short space of time between diagnosis and death, people spend their time grappling with the logistics of the illness, such as doctors' appointments, treatments, rather than making sure they're having quality moments and conversations with their loved ones,"" says Dr Holmes. 

""A shock death can compound the grief. If everything happens quickly, you can't process what's going on and guilt can even crop up - like ""˜should we have spotted something'? A longer time gives you a chance to work these questions through and adjust. It can be a very meaningful time.""

A reckoning awaits Elon Musk's renegade rocket rivals

After the success of SpaceX, a new wave of entrepreneurs are joining the race for the stars

By the age of 10, Peter Beck was dismantling and then reassembling entire cars in the remote farming town of Invercargill, New Zealand.

Encouraged by his polymathic father, the young Beck was building bikes from scratch at 14.

By the age of 18, he had developed a rocket that he strapped to a bicycle. The machine had no off switch or steering: ""You put it between your legs and prayed,"" he recalled.

Beck honed his engineering skills on what became a multi-year practical apprenticeship at Fisher & Paykel, New Zealand's appliance manufacturer. His time there culminated in redesigning both their products and production line machines.

However, he devoted every spare moment of free time to developing the Electron Rocket, even brewing the deadly and dangerous hydrogen peroxide needed to fuel the device in his basement.

""They were in New Zealand and didn't have an aerospace industry and didn't have anything beyond theory,"" says one leading executive from SpaceX who spent time working at what became Beck's company, Rocket Labs.

A part for a projectile might be sourced from racing cars, he recalled ""because that's all they had access to and knew"".

Today, Rocket Lab is second in the world only behind Elon Musk's SpaceX when it comes to the number of space launches it conducts each year.

The rise of the Rocket Lab and its founder Peter Beck - once derided by sceptics as simply a ""dishwasher repairman"" - is perhaps the most extraordinary tale in Ashlee Vance's new book, When The Heavens Went On Sale: The Misfits and Geniuses Racing to Put Space Within Reach.

Vance, a globe-trotting journalist at Bloomberg, previously wrote a biography of Elon Musk, the best known among the new crop of space cowboys seeking to put their homemade rockets into the atmosphere.

His latest book shows there are plenty more colourful characters in the industry beyond just the Tesla billionaire.

Among them is Max Polyakov, a Ukrainian whose parents worked in the Soviet space programme.

Polyakov made his money from online businesses in the early 2000s, including a dating website that was accused by the BBC of using fake profiles to lure subscribers. (An investigation found no systematic use of fake profiles but the company admitted it had not clearly labelled staff accounts).

Polyakov went on to spend around $150 million on his passion: space. He acquired the assets of Texas-based rocket company Firefly out of bankruptcy and gave American engineers a Russian-designed turbopump, a key piece of rocketry equipment.

For his troubles, he was pressured by the US government to sell his shares in 2022 on national security grounds.
Polykov has since acquired Dragonfly, a South African satellite operation, and he's now a British citizen - hopefully we haven't heard the last of him.

When Vance began researching his book a decade ago, there were about a thousand satellites in orbit.

Today, thanks to the collapsing cost of rocketry and cheap new mini-satellites, almost 9,000 are circling the earth. By the end of the decade, it will be around 30,000.

""We are in the early days of the next great infrastructure buildout,"" Vance says.

Companies such as Starlink, another Musk venture, and OneWeb are creating a fabric of data connectivity that reaches every corner of the world.

They plan to give the entire planet reliable and fast internet access. If realised, farmers in Africa could view live photos of their fields on their phones, for example.

While Nasa led the space revolution in the 1960s and 1970s, today it is private sector concerns that are on the bleeding edge of progress.

Over the decades, the US space agency grew very cumbersome with bureaucracy.

Nasa failed to take advantage of the rise of modern consumer electronics, which offered low cost parts off the shelf.

In the latter half of the 20th century, if you wanted ""plucky scientists chasing the final frontier,"" you wouldn't look to Nasa, says Vance.

By contrast, the new breed of renegade engineer-entrepreneurs such as Musk and Beck took ready advantage of cheap consumer electronics parts. What's more, they junked the outdated methods and materials still being used by Nasa.

""Strip away layers of bureaucracy dating back to the 1960s, and the staid thinking and you ended up in a place where the construction of rockets could be modernised and made more efficient,"" Vance says. ""New things were possible.""

Their daring in attempting to build new rockets shouldn't be underestimated, as Vance points out: ""It's a barely controlled bomb, that you then have to manoeuvre with great precision. Almost anything can go wrong.""

No clearer illustration of this is needed than the example of watching SpaceX's Starship rocket explode above the skies of Texas within minutes of launch last month.

The new generation of rocketmen - they are all men - has helped rescue the United States' reputation for space technology, which 15 years ago was looking shabby.

Vance says: ""China was going gangbusters, while we just had Boeing and Lockheed Martin - it was totally pathetic. Now we're the envy of the world.""

However, a key question remains unanswered: is sending rockets into space a sustainable business?

""Nobody knows if any of this is going to work economically,"" Vance says.

""It's like 1996, when investors were building out data centres and laying all this fibre, but didn't really know if there's a business there.""

While the business of the internet became huge, most of those early pioneers folded when the dotcom bubble burst in the early 2000s.

""Right now, all the businesses are imaging or communications, with a bit of science, and we're about to start tiny manufacturing in space,"" Vance says. ""This whole gamble is based on if you change these economics - somebody should be able to capitalise on it.""

Entrepreneurs and their investors don't have long to find a way of making money. Rocket launches are expensive business and low-orbiting mini satellites fall safely to earth after only three to five years of operation.

Not all of the entrepreneurs currently engaged in the space race are likely to make it work. Vance says: ""Quite clearly, we're going to have a reckoning in short order.""

Amazon woos French at farmers' markets in ""˜Project Ratatouille'

Big Tech giant running marketing campaign to 'Frenchify' its brand

Amazon is attending farmers' markets and spending more on TV ads in France in a bid to woo local consumers and suppliers in a campaign codenamed ""Project Ratatouille"". 

The e-commerce giant attended a Paris farming fair for the first time in March to show off its work with local suppliers. In 2021 it opened an online store of products made in France as part of its mission to appeal to locals.

The public relations drive, now in its third year, has been named after the Disney film Ratatouille, which features a Parisian rat who wants to become a chef, later befriending a young cook to whip up the famous ProvenÃ§al vegetable stew.

Bloomberg reported that the tech company's marketers were ""Frenchifying"" Amazon with several initiatives, including paying for a study that suggested eight in ten staff would recommend working for the firm. 

Another piece of research, paid for by Amazon and carried out by Roland Berger, found that 84pc of local shop owners in northeastern France said opening one of the firm's warehouses near them had a neutral impact on their business. 

The firm has launched a series of television ads to entice more customers to shop there. Its Prime Video streaming service also secured broadcasting rights to Ligue 1, France's top football division, in 2021.

The ""Ratatouille"" campaign was partly inspired by McDonald's efforts in the 1990s to improve its image in France by localising its menu with products such as the McBaguette.

Amazon launched its online store in France in 2000, where it now has 20,000 employees. 

However, it has had to grapple with local controversies, including a series of strikes over pay for its French staff.

During the pandemic, the tech giant was ordered to stop non-essential deliveries amid French lockdowns in April 2020. The company was forced to close its warehouses in France and suspend operations for five weeks. 

France has introduced laws to attempt to curb Amazon's growth in online book sales and protect its domestic independent bookseller market. 

Regulations that date back to 1981 prevent booksellers from discounting books by more than 5pc. In 2010 this rule was extended to cover e-books, while in 2014 offers of free delivery for books were banned. 

Amazon got around this change by offering deliveries for one cent, but in 2021 politicians introduced a minimum delivery fee of â‚¬3 for online book orders.

""For more than two decades, we've worked to earn the trust of our customers in France by contributing to their communities, providing good service, and offering a broad selection at low prices, even as the cost of living has escalated,"" an Amazon spokesman told Bloomberg. 

""Like many companies, we've always worked to share information about how we support the communities where we operate.""

Bird flu kills two cats in South Korea as experts probe the deaths of 36 others

The outbreak in the Seoul shelter, which has been placed in quarantine, comes after multiple sick cats in Poland tested positive for H5N1

Bird flu has killed two cats at a shelter in South Korea, with investigations underway to confirm whether another 36 with the same symptoms also died from the virus. 

The outbreak in the private Seoul facility, which has been placed in quarantine, comes after at least 29 sick cats across Poland tested positive for H5N1, with European health officials urging pet-owners to keep their cats indoors to reduce their exposure to the deadly virus. 

It is the first time since 2016 that avian influenza infections have been found in cats in South Korea, the government said, and no humans who came into contact with the animals have so far shown signs of symptoms. 

Surveillance is being ramped up within a six mile radius of the animal shelter. The source of the outbreak remains unknown. 

Although only two dead cats have so far tested positive, authorities are racing to test samples from another 36 felines who died between June 24 and July 26, according to Daesub Song, a professor at Seoul National University's department of Veterinary Medicine which initially investigated the outbreak. 

""In my lab, two samples from dead cats were identified as H5N1 positive,"" he told the Telegraph on Thursday. ""The other 36 cats were dead with [the] same symptoms. 

""However, most of them were submitted to the Korea government's diagnostic lab. Within this week, I expect that the government [will] announce the data. This case has [a] big impact due to the massive cat mortality rate and spillover from avian to mammal cases, as observed in Poland and some European countries.""

Increased vigilance

Since late 2021, bird flu has killed millions of birds across the globe, with 67 countries in five continents reporting highly pathogenic H5N1 outbreaks last year. More than 131 million domestic poultry have also died or been culled in affected areas. 

But the rising number of infections in mammals - outbreaks have been reported in 26 species, including farmed mink in Spain, otters in the UK, and sea lions in Peru - has generated particular alarm, raising concerns that opportunities for the virus to evolve to better infect people are growing. 

""The increase of [highly pathogenic] H5N1 cases in mammals, including cats, warrants more vigilance,"" GaÃ«l Lamielle, a regional surveillance coordinator at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization's regional office for Asia and the Pacific, told the Telegraph. 

But he added: ""Based on the current knowledge, no human cases of influenza avian H5N1 have been attributed to contact with cats"". 

Instead, human infections with H5N1 have been historically linked to close contact with sick birds or their environment, and it does not appear to be able to transmit easily from person to person. 

Yet in April, the virus was found to ""efficiently"" spread between ferrets in a laboratory - the first study confirming that the virus can spread from mammal to mammal. There are fears that the wider the spread in animals, the greater the potential for the pathogen to gain the mutations needed to spread more efficiently in people.

Ukraine: The Latest - Kyiv's counter-offensive 'imperiled' by attack on Kakhovka dam

Every weekday the Telegraph's top journalists analyse the Russian invasion of Ukraine from all angles and tell you what you need to know

Today on Ukraine: The Latest, we report on the breaking news of the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro river, assessing its environmental and social impacts, as well as on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. We also consider the strategic implications for the Ukrainian counter-offensive.

Assistant Comment Editor Francis Dearnley comments on why the attack has happened now:

The timing of this is hugely significant. Analysts this morning are saying that further to the potential impacts on agriculture and the environment, which will be catastrophic, the flooding could prevent further Ukrainian advances in the south and threaten the safety of Europe's largest nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia.

After the news of the dam's destruction filtered through, newsrooms across Ukraine sprang into action. As Ukrainian journalist Tetiana Bezruk describes:

Ukrainians are very organised. My colleagues and I are trying to get to the cities where people are located. I saw different volunteer organisations trying to get to people to provide them with humanitarian aid and legal assistance. We are all shocked, but it's our country, and we need to get help to those now in this situation. 

Senior Foreign Correspondent Roland Oliphant adds: 

I was speaking to an ambulance driver who was also involved in evacuations from a village just to the east, upstream from Kherson. To give you an idea of how fast the water is rising, they were driving out there early in the morning around 6am. There was already water around in the fields and beginning to cross the roads, but they could drive through. On the way back, after picking up a couple of elderly people who were unable to move themselves, they had to find other roads because the roads they used were already flooded.

Francis also assesses how the news may impact on Ukraine's support abroad:

There'll be many people waking up to this and they'll be asking ""˜what on earth has happened?'; their outrage at what is being perpetrated on the Ukrainian people will no doubt give an impetus to Ukraine from Western supporters. But I'm sure, amongst the Ukrainians themselves, they will say this is yet another example of why Russia cannot be allowed to win this war.

The job to change your life in 2024

Fancy a change of direction? From farming to holiday repping, why not try these ideas to shift your own life into a different gear...

When William Caldwell and his wife Charlotte left London to rent a farm in the Quantock Hills in Somerset, they didn't intend to stay more than a year. ""It was a question of getting farming out of our system,"" says Caldwell. The change of pace and direction was so invigorating, though, that they soon came to see farming as their life rather than a job. ""Change is always good but even more so when you're doing something active and guided by the seasons. We haven't looked back."" 

The Caldwells are now looking for other farmers to join their team, living in a cottage on the farm and taking a share of the profits. No experience is necessary, Caldwell says; just the right frame of mind, as with farming the boundaries between life and work are blurred. 

""You can feel so weighed down in highly paid city jobs where you're responsible for people's assets but taking a pay cut to take responsibility for animals or people or plants can be extremely enriching - everything suddenly makes sense,"" he says. 

This is why so many people find ski seasons, summer jobs at theme parks or resorts, and charitable placements to be so rewarding: throwing yourself into new surroundings with a new bunch of people can open up a whole world of possibilities, explains Richard Sinclair, founder of ski jobs website Sno.co.uk. Indeed, Meg Bellamy, who plays the Princess of Wales in the Crown, describes working as a red brick at Legoland Windsor as ""the best job ever"".  

""Seasons are not only popular among the ""˜gap yah' crew but they're a great stopgap when you're at a crossroads in life or looking for a stepping stone for your longer-term career goals,"" Sinclair says. 

For Caldwell, the most life-changing aspect of farm work is that he no longer craves a holiday. ""Farming is hard and physical, yet what you get out is a direct result of what you put in - it's very visceral and this works for me,"" he says. ""We've definitely never worked harder and yet neither of us feels the need to take a break."" 

If that sounds both wildly unrealistic and yet extremely tempting, read on for ideas to shift your own life into a different gear, starting with the job at the Caldwells' farm...

Plovers in Peril co-ordinators

The RSPB is looking for two organised and sociable people to support its Plovers in Peril campaign on Snettisham to Heacham, a stunning stretch of beach on the edge of the Wash in Norfolk. A rise of visitors and climate change is making it harder for birds there, such as ringed plovers and oystercatchers, to find safe places to nest and raise their young. The project co-ordinators will attempt to reverse this decline by protecting them during the vulnerable nesting season, installing seasonal fencing and signage, providing information and advice to beach users and working with local communities to raise awareness and inspire positive action. Project co-ordinators will run the WhatsApp group, email and newsletters, input research data, chair volunteer focus groups and create social media content. 

Dates: March to August 2024 (nesting season) one or two days a week, although this can be extended and the dates are fully flexible

Skills/Qualifications: Good communication (written and verbal); people skills; time management and basic IT skills and admin

Perks: You can do the work at home for most of the time and when you're on site, you'll be working in a beautiful location. A great opportunity to deepen your understanding of beach-nesting birds and other coastal wildlife and a chance to make friends and become part of a supportive team while gaining experience in a wildlife charity. 

Downsides: It's a remote location and the RSPB does not offer accommodation, so ideally you'll be local to Snettisham and Heacham or have your own car to travel there when required. 

Pay: It's a volunteer role although the RSPB provides equipment, training and uniform plus any expenses

The glaring flaw in Labour's plot to fix the housing crisis

Strategies modelled on European systems overlook the intricacies of Britain's market

As he sets his sights on winning the key battleground of house building at the next election, Sir Keir Starmer is drawing inspiration from post-war Britain.

As part of Labour's new ""pro-building"" agenda, local authorities will be given the power to buy land on the cheap for housing development - a move that harks back to policies introduced in the wake of the Second World War.

The Labour leader has already begun to align his party with a ""back the builders, not the blockers"" stance in a bid to seize on perceived Tory Nimbyism and address the nation's housing crisis. 

He also intends to reinstate annual house-building targets of 300,000 and boost home ownership in the UK to 70pc.

Labour's new law would allow local authorities to buy land with compulsory purchase orders at a market discount, with the Government providing the seller with some compensation.

But property experts warn that this is likely to simply push landowners to sell privately for a much healthier sum.

The Labour Party's latest plans have also provoked backlash from the property sector with housebuilders warning they will likely result in even fewer homes being built.

Labour's new law would see owners of land needed for housing development paid a price that excluded the premium associated with potential property development.

Experts say green belt and agricultural land typically goes for up to £20,000 per acre, but land with permission to build houses on it can go for anything up to £3 million per acre.  

A Home Builders Federation spokesman said: ""What should be questioned is whether these reforms will result in an increased supply of homes to help address the housing shortage our country faces.""

Emily Williams, director at Savills residential research, said: ""This idea has come around before, and historically what has happened is that it creates a two-tiered market. 

""People either undersell their land or people privately sell off land at premium prices. If this happens today, we could see developers pull out of building homes and instead invest in different uses like warehouses where the returns would be much stronger.""

A return to post-war Britain

Britain has used compulsory purchase orders to build homes before. After the Second World War, which saw virtually no new houses built for six years and half a million properties destroyed, the country suddenly needed to build 750,000 homes overnight.

With no time to negotiate and houses in dire need, Britain's post-war Government decided to force landowners to sell their land at agricultural values in the national interest.

In May 1946, post-war ""˜new towns' were born. The first to crop up included Stevenage, Crawley, and Hemel Hempstead, before the last were built in the late 1960s ""” including Milton Keynes, Northampton and Peterborough.

Simon Cox, of land agent Walter Cooper, said: ""Back then, it was an emergency. CPOs were mainly used to buy farms and estates. Lots of people had lost their sons, so had no-one to pass their estates onto.

""There was more of a national spirit back then. Veterans would be paid to work on these farms, so it was co-societal.""

CPOs were eventually dropped. Ms Williams added: ""Part of the reason this didn't work before was because the system became unfair. Some people were still paying full value for land while others were hugely discounted.

""People began to question whether this much government intervention in the private market was fair.""

CPOs have been used more recently by the Government to pave the way for the controversial HS2, the high-speed railway plotted from London to Manchester.

Those served with a CPO can file an injunction against it, but this can take years. Mr Cox cited one example in Hertford which took three years.

Nimby nation

Experts argue that Labour's plans do not address the main reasons for housing shortages ""” the onerous planning system and Nimbyism.

While Sir Keir has pledged to bring back housing targets, experts say his CPO plans will not help relieve planning backlogs.

The number of new homes that completed in the first quarter of the year was 20 per cent lower than in the last quarter of 2022.

Housebuilders have accused ministers and ""Nimby backbenchers"" of failing to tackle barriers to development, saying that red tape and hold-ups in the system were preventing millions of people from getting on the ladder.

Mr Cox said: ""The issue is people can't get planning permission, not that they don't want to develop their land. It doesn't seem to make much sense.

""Local planning departments are overworked and underpaid, with jobs available for upwards of three years. Some outsource to Australia.

""We need to ring fence planning department fees and run the departments like viable businesses. Right now, you've got planners dealing with local plans for a new porch at the same time as plans for a 700-unit new settlement.""

The Government has proposed to raise planning fees by up to 35pc to help fund departments, but this would still leave a £225 million shortfall in processing costs.

In the meantime, wait times on securing planning permission are at an all-time high.

Differences to Europe

Across Europe, countries already use similar orders to force landowners to sell. In Germany, the state buys land at use (or agricultural) value, then re-sells it to developers telling them what they can build on it.

There are different compensation options for landowners in Germany depending on who they are. Any compensation is based on an assessment that considers how much money the land owner is losing for not selling at a premium.

The Labour Party intends to align the UK with its European counterparts. 

But Stefania Fiorentino, a teaching associate at the University of Cambridge's land economy department, warned that the UK's planning system was much too different for it to work in the same way.

In Germany and other European countries, developers buying land already know what they can build on it. Unlike the UK, where it is up to developers to seek planning permission after they buy it.

Dr Fiorentino said the UK has a ""more discretionary"" approach to planning compared to its European neighbours.

She said: ""In Germany, the Netherlands and France, they have zoning plans which exist before building permits are secured. This means development rights are embedded in the land.

""The public sector buys the land, plans the infrastructure and then re-sells to the developer telling them what they can build. This is how they capture increasing value.

""In the UK, it is up to the developers to get planning applications. So the ""˜hope value' is a result of the planning permission.""

There are also concerns that the re-introduction of CPOs could open up local authorities to corruption. 

Mr Cox said it could allow local authorities to reject planning applications submitted by landowners, buy the land at a discount using a CPO, approve the planning application themselves and develop it.

He said: ""If planning systems were reformed, developers would be developing on these spaces already. This will just allow local authorities to buy it, then appoint their own consultants and a property ""˜devco' - which are owned to a degree by local authorities.""

A Labour spokesman said: ""For too long the Tories have stood aside while speculators have squeezed affordable housing, green spaces and homes for first time buyers.""

The billion-dollar mobile empire accused of existing on a pile of lies

Dozy Mmobuosi's entire enterprise was a Potemkin business, American regulators say

Dozy Mmobuosi was riding high. Photographed for the cover of GQ Africa a year ago, he was pictured leaning forward thoughtfully, hands clasped, billed as the ""tech entrepreneur changing the face of agriculture"".

His business, Tingo Mobile, had started out providing mobile phones to rural farmers in Nigeria. But within just a few years, it had grown into a multibillion-dollar empire with a listing on New York's Nasdaq stock exchange.

To cap it all, the London-based tycoon soon revealed he was bidding to buy the Premier League football team Sheffield United - lining him up to become the only black majority owner of a top-flight team.

There was just one small problem: Mmobuosi's businesses, as they were commonly understood, may never have existed. 

That is the extraordinary claim made this week by American regulators, who accused the 45-year-old Nigerian businessman - real name, Mmobuosi Odogwu Banye - of perpetrating an ongoing fraud of ""staggering"" proportions.

At its peak last year, his publicly traded company, Tingo Inc, was valued at $7.23bn (£5.7bn), according to Bloomberg data.

Yet according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the entire enterprise was a Potemkin business. It was built almost entirely on a mountain of sham documents, created to dupe Mmobuosi's auditors and investors, court filings say.

The allegations, if proven, are a stunning indictment of the ease with which stock market investors were duped by a business conjured out of ""thin air"". They also raise troubling questions for regulators and auditors, who spotted red flags only after huge sums of money had already changed hands. 

""Beginning in at least 2019, Mmobuosi created fake financial statements and forged supporting material to falsely portray Tingo Mobile as a thriving and profitable enterprise with hundreds of millions of annual revenue, profit and available cash,"" court documents filed by SEC said.

""In reality, throughout 2019, the company had no meaningful operations or customers and about $15 in its bank account.""

Alarm bells around Tingo were first sounded in June, by a small firm called Hindenburg Research.

Hindenburg is a short seller, the kind of activist investor that scours markets looking for companies that seem too good to be true.

This playbook typically involves carrying out in-depth research in search of anything that undermines what the business says publicly about itself.

If they find something sufficiently concerning, the short seller will place large bets against the company's shares, publish its findings and wait to make a killing when the stock craters. 

Hindenburg's note on Tingo Group was a classic of the genre. It described Mmobuosi's business - which allegedly spanned telecoms, food production and e-commerce - as ""an exceptionally obvious scam"".

Tingo Mobile claimed to serve 12m customers, the backbone of which were millions of Nigerian farmers. Yet when Hindenburg attempted to contact some farmers, they denied having anything to do with Mmobuosi's business.

Further checks with regulators revealed there was no record of Tingo being a licensed mobile operator either, Hindenburg said, while a visit to the company's office in Lagos uncovered ""only a handful of employees and a sign posted on its door by federal authorities stating that the company is delinquent on its tax obligations"". 

There were other signs suggesting Tingo might not be what it seemed. For example, Hindenburg found Mmobuosi claimed to hold a PhD in rural advancement from a Malaysian university but no record of this seemed to exist.

In 2019, he also announced plans to launch his own airline, urging customers to ""fly with Tingo Airlines today"" alongside pictures of Tingo-branded planes. It later emerged, however, that the planes were owned by other carriers and had Tingo's logo photoshopped onto them. 

Similarly, in February 2023, the company hosted a Nigerian minister for a groundbreaking ceremony for the opening of a $1.6bn food processing facility - but a picture the company said was a computer-generated design for the scheme was actually revealed to be a stock graphic of an oil refinery. 

Another deal the company announced was with Evtec Energy, a UK-based project manager hired to build solar panels for the food processing plant. But filings on Companies House say Evtec Energy is ""dormant"" and had zero cash as of March.

""Overall, we think Tingo is a worthless and brazen fraud that should serve as a humiliating embarrassment for all involved,"" Hindenburg wrote. ""We do not expect the company will be long for this world.""

Shares in two of Mmobuosi's companies plunged 48pc and 81pc following the report. 

Tingo said in August that it had appointed outside legal teams to investigate Hindenburg's report, much of which it disputed.

It said the lawyers had checked and confirmed its financials and stood by claims that it provided millions of phones to Nigerian farmers.

Meanwhile, after its own investigation, the SEC has since accused Mmobuosi and three of his companies  - Tingo International Holdings, Agri-Fintech Holdings and Tingo Group - of overstating their revenues, expenses, profits and assets to enable a huge fraud.

It says Mmobuosi ""fraudulently"" orchestrated sales of his companies.  

First, in 2021 when Tingo International Holdings - a US holding company he created - sold his mobile business to Agri-Fintech. And then again in 2022, when Agri-Fintech sold Tingo Mobile to Nasdaq-listed Tingo Group. 

Both deals were accomplished through all-stock mergers and valued Tingo Mobile at more than $1bn. 

To maintain the alleged ruse that his business was real, Mmobuosi is accused of creating fake bank statements, ledgers, and documents that were submitted to auditors and other parties to back up falsified financial statements. 

He is even said to have created websites for imaginary suppliers and customers before using their email addresses to respond to queries about Tingo from auditors. 

""These material misstatements created the false impression that Tingo Mobile was a thriving, multimillion-dollar business when in fact its operations and earnings were fabricated - causing significant, artificial overvaluation of the companies' shares and Mmobuosi's controlling stake in them,"" the SEC's court filings say. 

The fraud allowed Mmobuosi to amass shares ostensibly worth hundreds of millions of dollars, the claims add, and the tycoon has been seeking to liquidate them. 

Between May and July this year alone, he is said to have reaped $2m from selling stock in Tingo Group using a Swiss bank account. 

He has also sold $10.4m worth of shares in Agri-Fintech and has ""misappropriated assets"" worth at least another $26m, including a $10m inter-company loan paid directly to his personal bank account.

Some of his money was splashed on luxury cars, travel on private jets and his attempt to buy Sheffield United, which garnered attention from British newspapers. 

In London, Mmobuosi also promoted a charity, the Dozy Mmobuosi Foundation, which claimed to campaign for equal access to healthcare in Africa. 

The foundation was launched at a glitzy event in the Dorchester Hotel in September last year, compÃ¨red by the British-Congolese comedian Eddie Kadi.

A video on YouTube appears to show Mmobuosi, dressed in a tuxedo, glad-handing guests as musicians play in the background.

On Wednesday, staff at the Dorchester said they did not recognise Mmobuosi when shown his picture. ""No one knows anything,"" one employee told the Telegraph.

The SEC suspended trading in Tingo Group shares on November 14. 

Tingo Group, which could not be reached for comment on Wednesday, has previously said it will ""fully cooperate"" with authorities ""with the goal of achieving the resumption of trading in the company's securities at the earliest opportunity"".

Drink up now - a global beer shortage could be on the way

Climate scientists warn that global warming could hit supplies of hops, a key brewing ingredient, if current trends continue

A beer shortage could be on the horizon because global warming is damaging the production of hops, a study has found.

The crop, which gives beer its distinctive bitter flavour, is ripening 20 days earlier than it did in the mid-1990s as a result of steadily warming temperatures. Harvests are down 0.2 tons per hectare across much of Europe and the level of alpha acids, a key chemical for taste, is down 0.6 per cent.

Climate models and analysis predict that by 2050 there will be up to an 18 per cent reduction in the amount of hops, and a 31 per cent drop in alpha content.

Dr Martin Mozny, first author of the study, told The Telegraph that aromatic hops were the ""spice"" that determined a pint's aroma and flavour.

""According to our simulations, there is a risk of more expensive aromatic hops for breweries and a shortage of hops on the market,"" he said.

""More raw material will be needed to achieve the same taste and it could limit the production of beers.""

The study looked at hop production across Germany, Czechia and Slovenia, the ancestral homeland of beer, and found it was increasingly an unsuitable climate for hop cultivation.

The areas further south face the biggest threat in coming decades, data show, with northern Europe and the UK poised to become hop-growing hotspots in decades to come.

""Climate change threatens hop production worldwide. In Europe, areas in southern Europe are most at risk, while Hallertau in Germany and Zatec in the Czech Republic are least affected,"" Dr Mozny said.

""In general, the more northerly areas, where hops are already grown, will have a competitive advantage over the southern areas.

""UK growers will have a competitive advantage over southern Europe. Specific conditions (mainly soil and climate) will limit the shift of production further north, and overwintering conditions will also be a limit.""

But the shift further north may be necessary in order for production to continue at its current rate. Premium and craft beers are most at risk of the ongoing aromatic hop shortages because of a higher use of the crop.

Protection measures possible

However, despite dire warnings for European farmers there are steps they can take to protect their harvests, experts say.

Dr Mozny said: ""One of the measures is the construction of irrigation systems to stabilise production in times of drought.

""Another option is the appropriate selection and location of hop-growing areas (valley positions with higher water tables, shaded positions), the use of more resistant new hop varieties, growth regulators and cultivation technologies with an emphasis on sustainability.""

The study is published in Nature Communications.

Man crushed to death by robot that mistook him for a box of vegetables

Plant owner calls for 'precise and safe system' after second serious incident involving automated machinery

A South Korean man has been crushed to death by an industrial robot that mistook him for a box of vegetables.

The man, who was in his 40s, had been inspecting a problem with the robot's sensor at a distribution centre for agricultural produce in South Gyeongsang province.

According to the Yonhap news agency, the robot, which was placing boxes of peppers on to a pallet, grabbed the worker.

The robotic arm thrust the man against the conveyor belt, crushing his face and chest. He was rushed to hospital but later died.

An official from the Dongseong Export Agricultural Complex, which owns the plant, called for a ""precise and safe"" system to be established in a statement following the accident.

This was the second serious accident involving an industrial robot in South Korea in a matter of months.

In March, a man in his 50s sustained serious injuries after being trapped by a robot at a car manufacturing plant.

And in 2015, a 22-year-old worker at a German Volkswagen factory was killed by a robot.

Used for decades

Industrial robots have been used for decades to carry out routine tasks from assembly to sorting goods.

Their main function is to handle repetitive and, at times, potentially dangerous tasks.

A study published by the American Journal of Industrial Medicine earlier this year said 41 people had been killed by industrial robots in the US between 1992 and 2017.

The overwhelming majority of fatal accidents - 83 per cent - were caused by stationary robots, and the remainder by mobile ones.

Prosecutions have taken place, such as when Bart Matthews was killed in 1992 by an industrial robot in Silicon Valley. Matthews, who worked as a robot operator at Cybernetics Inc, was killed when the robot he was operating malfunctioned and started to wave its ""arm"" violently, striking Matthews.

Nearly four out of five of the accidents took place during routine maintenance of the robots, rather than when they were carrying out their tasks.

Relatives plead for safe return of Thai worker held hostage by Hamas as Asia repatriates citizens

Farmhand among scores kidnapped during assault on southern Israel

Dozens of Asian migrant workers and students were killed or captured by Hamas during its assault on southern Israel, leaving several countries in the region reeling from the onslaught.

Twenty Thais, ten Nepalis, and two Filipinos - all working or studying in kibbutzim near Gaza were among those murdered by the terrorist group.

Others, including 14 Thai nationals, are believed to have been abducted and taken to Gaza as hostages.

Among those missing is Kiattisak Patee, a Thai agricultural worker who was last seen in southern Israel on Saturday as Hamas launched its assault.

The 35-year-old was working on a chicken farm at the Re'im kibbutz in the Negev desert to support his family in Thailand.

""My mom cries every day and I don't know what to do to help her. I am so worried about him and I am worried about my mom and we cannot do much. I don't know if the Israeli government will be able to negotiate for the hostages,"" Mr Patee's sister, Kanjana, 22, told the Telegraph from her home in Surat Thani.

As soon as she heard the news of the killing spree, Ms Patee called her brother at his kibbutz situated about three miles from the heavily fortified border with the Gaza strip, and next to the field which hosted the Supernova music festival, where 260 people were killed.

""I was so worried and kept posting on social media everywhere. I tried to contact him and at first I could ring but no one picked up. I thought he might be hiding in the forest or in the field, and that was why I could not reach him,"" she said.

""Then I saw on social media my brother was on the list of hostages, and I kept ringing but I could not get through, like the phone was off. We are so worried sick.""

Pictures of his friends being held hostage, without Mr Patee, have compounded the family's fears.

He was nearing the end of his five-year contract at the farm after arriving in Israel in January 2019 in the hope of providing for his parents back home. He had already earned enough to help his father build a house in Udon Thani in north-east Thailand.

His family were concerned when they heard of previous skirmishes near the border with Gaza and tried to persuade him to return, but he said his employer liked him and wanted to renew his contract.

Mr Patee's situation is similar to many South and South East Asians working in Israel, where tens of thousands from Thailand, Nepal, India, Sri Lanka and the Philippines have flocked to bring financial relief to their families.

As their governments rush to bring them home, several do not feel they are in a position to leave.

Many are the breadwinners for multiple dependents, paying for their children's education, their parents healthcare, or building family homes. Some are still in debt after the costs incurred in securing their jobs.

Thailand has recorded the highest death toll of any foreign nation from the weekend attack.

While they grapple with whether to stay or go, grim accounts of foreign nationals caught up in the carnage continue to emerge.

Sunita Saetao could hear the bombs in the background as she spoke to her husband, Thawatchai, on Saturday, during what was meant to be a celebratory video call to mark their son's second birthday.

""He pointed in the direction where the terrorists fired their missiles ""¦ then we heard another bombing sound near the camp or inside the camp,"" she told Khaosod media.

He said he would call her after preparing a meal in case he needed to escape, but he never rang back.

Two days later, the family discovered Mr Saetao had been shot dead. 

""Right now, our family has no savings left. I don't know what to do, and I don't know how to bring his body back for burial,"" said his widow.

Facebook posts offer a glimpse of what is happening to people caught up in the onslaught.

Relentless gunfire can be heard in posts from chicken farm worker Anucha Bunyasan, who survived after fleeing the room where six of his friends were later killed.

In another video, agricultural workers crouch behind vans carrying boxes of aubergines as plumes of smoke rise from the fields. ""Go under the car, go, go, go!"" they can be heard shouting.

Several more graphic photos show the bodies of slaughtered labourers lying among the crops they had been tending.

Across Nepal, families are in mourning or anxiously waiting for news of their loved ones after ten university students were mowed down by terrorists who stormed the Kibbutz Alumim. One, Bipin Joshi, remains missing.

Each student had gained one of 265 coveted places on a ""learn and earn"" programme - a joint government initiative to train young professionals to improve Nepal's agricultural productivity.

Seventeen had arrived on the kibbutz in September for the 11-month internship. Only six managed to escape the bloodshed.

Ganesh Nepali, one of the victims described himself on Facebook as a ""future agriculturalist."" In his last post, at 1.22am on Saturday, he added seven pictures of the tranquil ""night view"" at Alumim. 

His classmate, Anand Sah, from the village of Sapahi in south-east Nepal, had made a commitment to plant 10 million trees in his lifetime and had aspirations to build a hospital in his community, reported the Himal Press newspaper.

A reporter who visited the village said Mr Sah's mother and grandmother ""fainted upon hearing the devastating news"" about the only son of the family, while his younger sister required medical attention.

""News of [the students] passing has plunged not only Anand's family, but the entire Sapahi village into mourning,"" he said.

Narayan Prakash Saud, Nepal's foreign minister, said on Tuesday that its citizens in Israel were being relocated to safer areas.

The Thai government on Wednesday said it would begin the slow process of evacuating 5,174 citizens out of about 30,000 residing in Israel who have registered to leave.

But the news is of little comfort to Ms Patee, who said her family felt helpless as they waited for news of her brother.

""There are some government officials going to my dad's house. They interviewed and supported him, but he is also worried sick about my brother and cannot sleep much,"" she said.

""All I can do now is follow the news, look for my brother on social media, and call my dad and be with my mom. We are all so worried and scared.""

""˜Doomsday' floods and landslides kill at least 40 in India

Extreme monsoon rainfall has demolished buildings, ripped down bridges, swept away vehicles and breached dams

More than 40 people have died following torrential rain in northern India that has unleashed catastrophic flooding and landslides across the region.

In footage shared on social media, the intense rainfall has demolished buildings, ripped down bridges, swept away vehicles and breached dams, with the worst of the destruction centred in the hilly state of Himachal Pradesh.

""It is an unimaginable situation. It is like a doomsday scenario unfolding before our eyes,"" Sushil Singh, a resident of Kullu, told the Telegraph.

The flooding and landslides has claimed 20 lives in Himachal Pradesh, according to officials. Nine people have died in Punjab and Haryana, seven in Rajasthan, four in Uttarakhand, and three in Uttar Pradesh.

Many rivers in north India, including the Yamuna in Delhi, surged beyond their banks amid the monsoon rains, submerging towns, villages, and crop lands. Thousands of people living in the floodplains have since been evacuated.

Scientists say climate change is responsible for the severe downpour, with Delhi recording 153 mm of rain in 24 hours on Sunday - the highest in a single day in July since 1982.

Dr Roxy Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, said global warming had intensified the monsoon season across the region.

""This is a clear climate change signal,"" he told The Telegraph.

""Monsoon patterns have changed in response to global warming. Instead of rains spread moderately through the season, now we have long dry and deficit periods interspersed with heavy rainfall events that cause floods. 

""In a changing climate, we see that mountainous regions - whether it's the Himalayan foothills or the Western Ghats - are particularly susceptible to heavy rains and landslides. The hills stop the abundant moisture flow and lift it, which falls as heavy rains.""

Delhi, Punjab, and Himachal Pradesh have received rainfall significantly above average this season, with percentages exceeding 100 per cent.

Authorities in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, the Himalayan states most severely affected by the disaster, asked people not to venture out of their homes unless necessary, given the imminent risk of flash floods.

""Please stay inside your homes because more heavy rain is expected in the next 24 hours,"" Himachal Pradesh's chief minister, Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu, said in an appeal on Sunday.

Health services have also been impacted by the recent downpour. In Jaipur, flood water engulfed the premises of Sawai Mansing Hospital, the city's largest healthcare facility, submerging multiple wards, including the critical radiotherapy section.

Video footage captured patients lying on stretchers in the hospital's corridors, while care assistants voiced their distress over the scarcity of beds and inadequate infrastructure.

India's meteorological department has forecast more rain across large parts of northern India in the coming days.

But Dr Koll said it would be ""difficult to predict"" where the flash floods will strike, particularly in the mountainous regions of northern India.

""We will have to depend on radars in such hazardous environments to monitor and forecast these events. With a radar, the maximum lead time that we could get is about three hours before such an event,"" he said.

Dr Aditi Mukherji, Director of the Climate Change Impact Platform at CGIAR Nepal, a global research partnership programme, says the destruction from the flooding is particularly acute because of excessive infrastructure development in the region, such as dams and roads.

""What we are seeing in Himachal Pradesh is partly a result of development models that did not factor in the caution while building in ecologically fragile zones,"" Dr Mukherji said.

""We need coherent planning that puts climate resilience at the heart of infrastructure development, something we are lacking now.""

The impact of the summer monsoon, which brings 70 to 80 per cent of South Asia's annual rainfall, has extended beyond India's borders; neighbouring Pakistan has also reported 86 casualties and injuries due to the recent heavy rains.

Dog meat protester threatens to kill himself if South Korea goes ahead with ban

Demonstrators threaten to release thousands of dogs into central Seoul to protest against proposed phase out by 2027

South Korean dog meat farmers took caged dogs to a protest against plans to ban their consumption after threatening to flood the capital's streets with two million canines.

About 200 farmers, restaurant owners and others in the dog meat industry gathered on Thursday for the rally in Seoul, where protesters scuffled with police outside the presidential office.

Tempers flared when the officers turned away a dozen trucks loaded with nearly 100 dogs that farmers had intended to release onto the street. Three protesters were detained.

Others chanted slogans, raised their fists and took turns making defiant speeches against the government's plans to outlaw the breeding and sale of dog meat for consumption.

One protester said he would kill himself if officials move ahead with the legislation.

""We'll fight. We'll fight,"" the demonstrators shouted.

The Korea Dog Meat Farmers' Association, which has long opposed moves to crack down on the industry, had threatened to release two million dogs near government landmarks in the capital as well as near the homes of ministers and other lawmakers.

Earlier this month, the government pledged to introduce legislation by the end of this year that would ban the centuries-old practice of eating dog meat and bring South Korea into line with the wider region.

Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore already have such restrictions in place.

A majority of Koreans oppose the eating of dogs and have never tried the meat.

Instead, they make up a nation of dog lovers - with more than six million households out of 51 million owning them as pets, inspiring a flourishing industry of animal accessories.

Yoon Suk Yeol, the president, and his wife Kim Keon-hee, own six dogs, including a retired guide dog and a rescue dog.

A Gallup Korea poll last year showed almost two thirds of respondents opposed eating dog meat. Just 8 per cent said they had eaten it within the past year.

South Korea, known more widely for its vibrant K-pop culture and gritty K-dramas, is also increasingly worried about its international reputation over the controversial practice.

Global celebrities like American actress Kim Basinger and French actress Brigitte Bardot have called for a ban.

Under the new bill, the dog meat industry would be phased out by 2027 and farmers would be offered financial support to dismantle their facilities and diversify into new lines of business.

However, the industry is calling for a longer grace period and direct financial compensation.

Some oppose the ban as a matter of principle. Ju Yeong-bong, who represents an industry group and led Thursday's rally, denounced the government for closing down an industry and ruling on what citizens choose to eat.

""We can't agree with the idea that it is barbaric, because all countries that have the tradition of animal husbandry have at some point eaten dogs and there are still countries where it's done,"" he said.

According to a government study last year, there are 1,150 dog farms in Korea which are collectively raising more than 520,000 dogs for consumption. Those figures mark a dramatic 35 per cent drop compared to five years ago.

Dog meat traders, however, claim there are more than 3,500 dog farms nationwide.

The Humane Society International/Korea, which has long campaigned for the outlawing of dog meat consumption and has rescued dogs from 18 squalid farms across the country, said the small but vocal farmer associations were not ""representative of a great many dog farmers who can see the writing is on the wall for this cruel and anachronistic industry"".

Sangkyung Lee, one of the group's campaigners, said the best thing the associations could do was to help farmers in the adjustment phase.

""What we need right now is calm and measured negotiation so that all sides can work together to sunset this industry and consign killing dogs for human consumption to Korea's history books,"" he said.

Arthur Boyt, roadkill enthusiast who waxed lyrical about polecat, badger ham - and dog - obituary

His motto was ""˜just because it doesn't have a label, doesn't mean it's not edible' and putrefaction was no barrier to enjoyment

Arthur Boyt, the roadkill enthusiast who has died aged 83, became an accidental fixture in British newspapers, with journalists ringing him up each year to quiz him on his eccentric Christmas lunch. 

Sometimes it was badger ham, or a polecat (which he claimed could serve four); more sensationally, there was beached sperm whale casserole with brussel sprouts, and his Christmas 2015 dish of dolphin, which he sautÃ©ed live on air on Jeremy Vine's Radio 2 show. The dolphin caused a minor scandal as it was technically property of the Crown; Boyt retorted that he was simply disposing of the dead body, which was within the law, and nobody had stipulated that the disposal should not be via his mouth.

But if he was mischievous and unrepentant about his eating habits, it was because he believed passionately that they were ethical. He would never kill an animal, and was revolted by factory farming. 

For Boyt roads were a deli counter, and of all the meats he scraped off the tarmac, his favourite was dog. ""DELICIOUS""¦ tender as veal with the consistency of lamb,"" he recorded, having first tried it in January 1978. Dog was only ever an occasional treat, however, because if the collar had a name on it, Boyt would do his utmost to reunite the deceased with its owner. 

Unclaimed, a large dog could furnish 15 meals and plenty of sandwiches. ""I once had four sandwiches for lunch, three of which were dog and one was hare,"" Boyt wrote in his memoir. ""I ate the hare first to give it time to get away before I sent the dog down after it.""

Cat he found bland, but much improved by redcurrant jelly. Once, he served cat fat from his dripping bowl to his unsuspecting sister, a fact he revealed to her only much later, in a speech at her son's wedding; in front of all the guests, the infuriated sister tried to beat him up.

Swan was muddy, bat was odd, and fox repeated on him - ""it tastes like it smells: a mixture of diesel and onions"" - but most other species, from otters to squirrels to stoats, he praised with an eloquence worthy of Elizabeth David. He even published his own recipes, for dishes such as hedgehog carbonara.

""What a race of spoilt fusspots we have become!"" Boyt said, demanding to know why Britons were so revolted by a rabbit, garnered from a roadside, that had ""grown up eating grass and wildflowers, the epitome of an organic existence"" and yet were perfectly happy to consume beef that had been ""standing all winter in its own excrement, fed on heavily fertilised fodder, supplemented with growth hormones and injected with antibiotics"".

His motto was ""just because it doesn't have a label doesn't mean it's not edible."" 

Putrefaction was no barrier to enjoyment, either. ""I've eaten stuff that is dark green and stinks,"" he said, claiming that roadkill - because he cooked it for long enough - never made him ill, whereas ""buffet food like sandwiches and scotch eggs"" had given him stomach bugs. 

The only bit of the animal he was too squeamish to eat was the eye's gelatinous lens, which turned into a hard white ball when cooked.  

Obsessively parsimonious, Boyt did not just dine from the roads, he dressed from them, too, washing encrusted vomit off fleeces he found discarded on the A39. A pioneer ""freegan"", he was so notorious for supplementing his lunch from the skip outside his workplace that he nearly ate a white bap filled with spit and sand, left for him by some builders as a prank.

As a romantic gesture, he gave up eating dog in 1996, when he married his second wife, Sue, a vegetarian, but their marriage was still tested by the prank callers who rang up at 2am, pretending to be the ghosts of animals Boyt had eaten, and by the badger heads he always had bubbling on the stove.

To reduce the smell, he started to casserole them instead of pressure-cooking them, but his preference for a ""greenish"" carcass drove Sue to have dinner in her bedroom, to avoid a row. ""I have to be discreet because I don't want her to rush off and leave me,"" Boyt told a journalist. ""I'd sooner have her than the badgers.""

Arthur Boyt and his twin brother Dennis were born at Watford on September 3 1939, the day that Britain declared war on Germany, to William Boyt, a solicitor, and Bessie, nÃ©e Legg. There were two older siblings, John and Naomi. 

The family were Exclusive Brethren, a sect of the evangelical Plymouth Brethren; there was no television, no Christmas festivities and no black pudding (the consumption of blood is forbidden in Acts). Their mother, a keen botanist, encouraged the twins' fascination with foraging outdoors; soon, they had a Wunderkammer of bleached skulls, glass bottles and Roman tesserae from nearby Verulamium.  

The twins' father died of a heart attack two days after their 10th birthday. They attended Brodick School,  then Watford Grammar, where Arthur saw Whiskey Galore! Not having seen a film before, he believed everything in it was real.

He got his taste for roadkill aged 13, when the twins, on one of their 100-mile cycle trips, came across a dead pheasant in Windsor Great Park. They liked the idea of dining at the monarch's expense, so asked their mother to roast it.  

In 1957 she died of a stroke. The now-orphaned Arthur read biology at university, then worked for seven years as an entomologist for Cooper, McDougal and Robertson, before joining the Fire Research Station as a librarian and researcher, making money on the side as a coach driver for Haberdashers' Aske's school. 

He married another of the Exclusive Brethren, Patricia, but in 1977 he was excommunicated for dissent; his wife left him and his twin brother cut him off. 

Indefatigable, he cycled across the United States, across Canada, and from Cairo to Khartoum, and twice ran the London Marathon in under three hours. But his passion was orienteering, for which he represented England well into old age, freely sharing his badger sandwiches with those he met on the way; for although he was pathologically averse to spending money, he had a Christian generosity to waifs and strays. 

Nature absorbed him. He took up bird-song recording, then ringing birds' legs. Snares drove him wild - he once found an emaciated badger that had been left, illegally, ensnared for two weeks - and he campaigned to have them consigned to the dustbin of history.

His run-ins with ""legal"" hunts trying to hide fox carcasses were legion (and often came to blows); and he harangued the RSPB, for which he worked as a surveyor, for tolerating the shooting of snipe, woodcock and golden plover.

He achieved his mild celebrity only in retirement, entertaining film crews from around the world in his house at Davidstow, Cornwall. In 2022 he published his memoir-cum-cookbook Roadkill, which aimed to fill the carnivorous gap left between Wild Food by Ray Mears and Richard Mabey's Food for Free. Roadkill offered such startling tips as not to be alarmed, when you defrost weasels in the microwave, to hear them whistle: this is just the steam escaping from their mouths. 

The last two years of his life were spent at Exmouth. His wife Sue survives him.

Arthur Boyt, born September 3 1939, died July 4 2023

Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov's ""˜dear' nephew handed top job by Putin at seized Evian owner

Kremlin allies are jockeying to control the most lucrative assets seized from the West

The 32-year-old nephew of Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov has been handed control of the Russian operations of Danone, after the Kremlin seized control of the French food maker's local business.

Yakub Zakriev, a deputy prime minister of Chechnya and its agriculture minister, has been named general director of Danone Russia, official documents show.

Mr Zakriev is the son of the elder sister of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who has referred to his relative as ""dear nephew"" on social media.

Mr Kadyrov is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and has publicly supported the war in Ukraine. 

The appointment of the regional warlord's nephew to run Danone Russia comes after Putin signed a decree on Sunday officially seizing control of the business, which owns brands such as Alpro, Actimel, and Evian. 

The Kremlin has been taking over the local operations of many Western businesses that have chosen to flee the country following the invasion of Ukraine. 

Putin's allies have been jockeying to take control of the most lucrative assets.

Russia also seized the local operations of Carlsberg over the weekend and two other allies of the Russian leader, Yuri and Mikhail Kovalchuk, have signalled their interest in Carlsberg's Baltika subsidiary, according to the Financial Times.

Mr Zakriev, who studied economics at Moscow State University, has worked in the Chechen government on and off since 2013 in different roles, according to local media.

Chechnya's minister for national policy, Akhmed Dudayev, said Mr Zakriev had ""huge experience of working in the most responsible positions.""

He said on Telegram: ""Choosing him as general director of Danone Russia shows that representatives of the team of Chechen President and Hero of Russia Ramzan Akhmatovich Kadyrov are talented and successful managers.""

Danone said last October it would relinquish control of its dairy food business in Russia at a cost of up to â‚¬1bn.

Putin has claimed Russia doesn't need the West and will depend on its own vast resources as well as allies such as China.

Solar-powered castles and heat pumps in Roman ruins as heritage bodies veer into net zero ""˜obsession'

Charities pushing to make buildings more eco-friendly face resistance from members

Heat pumps have been installed in ancient Roman drains and solar panels placed on a crumbling castle in a net zero push which risks ""damaging"" Britain's most precious historic buildings. 

Conservation charities including the National Trust and Historic England are adapting ancient buildings to make them more eco-friendly and meet ambitious net zero targets, despite resistance from members. 

A heat pump system has been installed in the ancient Roman drains which lie beneath Bath Abbey, while Historic Environment Scotland has installed solar panels on Crichton Castle, near Edinburgh. 

The heritage charity, in charge of 300 of Scotland's nationally important buildings, carried out the work in 2005 and upgraded the panels in 2019 in a bid to ""limit the impact of climate change on Scotland's wonderful old buildings"".

The solar energy system replaced a petrol generator, which is now only used as a back-up and allows the castle to access energy off the grid to power lighting, a computer and heating.

The National Trust has pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2030, 20 years in advance of the Government's target. 

Neil Record, who sits on the board of the National Trust members' forum, Restore Trust, said the net zero ""obsession"" was a ""disaster"" for Britain's heritage.

""The National Trust's principal objective is the preservation of its historic treasures. It's taken an inappropriate turn to take upon itself the net zero project.

""The National Trust isn't a major source of emissions. They want to publicise the fact they are, in their own mind, reducing their carbon footprint. They are spending members' money on virtue-signalling.

""I am very worried that the net zero obsession will lead us to damaging and irreversible changes to our precious historic buildings.

""If we start to destroy the fabric of historic buildings through this fashion - and it is a fashion - it would be a disaster for our heritage.""

The charity, which owns over 500 historic houses, castles, parks and gardens, has installed heat pumps at sites including Wimpole in Cambridgeshire, Powis Castle in Wales and Croome in Worcestershire.

Some critics have questioned whether its net zero target - as well as opposition to recent government moves to water down pollution targets for housebuilders, and the publication of a controversial report that linked Winston Churchill to slavery - reflects the views of members and its conservation mission.  

Some of the Trust's over five million members have described feeling ""betrayed"" at the apparent change of direction.

Restore Trust, founded in 2021, describes itself as a ""forum where members, supporters and friends of the National Trust can discuss their concerns about the future of the charity"".

Its website states: ""The National Trust carries out a vital and complex task in looking after historic buildings, collections, gardens and countryside. 

""It needs to maintain high standards and cannot afford the distraction of ephemeral trends and political activism.""

A document compiled by Historic England informs conservationists how net zero upgrades can be installed so as to minimise their visual impact, such as by painting heat pump vents in the rooms of listed buildings so they appear to blend in with the room's dÃ©cor. 

In one example, it shows the garden of a Grade-II listed farmhouse being dug up to accommodate a ground source heat pump.

Edward Levien, commercial director of Isoenergy, a firm which specialises in installing heat pumps in historic and listed properties, including for the National Trust, said that the charity was investing ""a lot of money over the years in renewables and they've got a long pipeline of a lot of heat pump projects and some solar"" planned for the future.

The firm has led projects installing heat pumps for the National Trust at Kingston Lacy in Dorset, Buscot Park in Oxfordshire and Cambridgeshire's Wimpole Hall, and worked on fitting heat pumps in Bath Abbey's ancient Roman drains.

He said: ""In the work we do with the National Trust the main considerations are archaeology and trees. We have watching teams to do inspections in and around the building to make sure we're not unearthing anything that should be conserved.

""We did find a priest tunnel once that no one knew was there.""

He said his firm also discovered ""a skeleton in a field"" at a non-National Trust property in Wiltshire when installing a ground source heat pump.

""The police were called and [they] cordoned off the area,"" he explained, adding that the remains were removed and later proven to be ""very old"".

He was unable to comment on the skeleton's precise location or say what happened to it after its discovery.

He said that ""the main challenge with old leaky buildings is the design of the system itself [and] calculating the heat loss of an old building"" due to poor insulation.

While ground source heat pumps could be hidden, he said, air source pumps are more visible and installers needed to ""look at taking that away from the building to not impact visuals"".

He said that when submitting proposals to local authority planners for installing carbon-neutral heating and energy sources ""most of them get waved through"".

He added: ""A lot of councils have declared climate emergencies and need to be seen to be doing the right thing.""

While heat pumps do not require planning permission, installing them in listed buildings or conservation areas still requires approval from a local council.

Chris Yates, senior manager at the Federation of Environmental Trade Associations, a green energy industry body, questioned whether some of the green upgrades to historic buildings would work properly. He said if a property is not insulated a heat pump will be ""working harder"" and is ""not going to be as efficient.""

He added: ""If proper heat loss calculations are done on the property and then it's [decided] what needs to be done to insulate it fully, it may be that the heat pump can be used.

""There are people that have done it and there tends to be a return on investment but that depends on good heat loss calculation from a qualified installer.""

However, in large old properties, like cathedrals, castles or palaces, fitting adequate insulation ""would probably be more tricky"", he added. 

Shrewsbury Flaxmill Maltings, a Grade I listed five-storey 18th century flaxmill operated by Historic England, incorporated a bivalent heating system which kept gas boilers to top up ground source heat pumps during the winter when it installed the carbon-neutral tech in 2021.

The heritage charity said that the budget for the project would not stretch to cover the cost of installing enough boreholes to fully heat the site with heat pumps, which now provide 69pc of its energy needs.

A Historic England spokesman said the project demonstrated how heat pump insulation can make a ""real difference"" on a larger scale and that introducing energy efficiency measures helped make buildings sustainable for the future.

A spokesman for Historic Environment Scotland said: ""As part of our commitment to become net-zero by 2045, HES has a responsibility to reduce our carbon emissions and explore innovative approaches to sustainable and renewable energy."" 

A spokesman for Restore Trust said the group supported efforts by the National Trust to make its properties more energy-efficient, but said: ""The National Trust's first duty is to look after the properties in its care for future generations, and nothing must be done which would be detrimental to landscapes or the historic fabric of buildings.""

A National Trust spokesman said: ""The Government's own research shows there is no property type or architectural era that is unsuitable for a heat pump.

""The use of renewable heating in many of our houses has enabled us to improve the conservation conditions for our fragile collections alongside the fabric of our historic buildings.""

Appetite for ultra-luxury Japanese food fuels surge in £200-plus a head restaurants

About 100 restaurants across the UK now offer meals costing more than £150, double the number in 2022 and more than half are in London

The number of restaurants charging more than £200 a head has surged by more than 50 per cent in the past year as Britain's appetite for ultra-luxury Japanese food increases.

Those with expensive tastes pay more than £200 for a meal at some 46 restaurants in the UK, up from 30 in 2022, research by Harden's restaurant guides revealed.

More than half of these are in London, where 11 restaurants charge more than £250 per guest.

About 100 across the UK offer meals costing more than £150, double the number in 2022.

Among some of the priciest are Japanese omakase restaurants where the chef decides what to serve, with a couple of ultra-luxurious outlets having opened in the past 12 months.

Sushi Kanesaka in the Dorchester Hotel on 45 Park Lane opened in July 2023 and offers an 18-course omakase menu for a minimum of £420 per head. Its sample menu includes such dishes as Ebifurai of Scottish Lobster with Japanese Tartar Sauce and Binchotan Grilled Kobe Beef with Wasabi And Shio.

Restaurants offering omakase, which means ""I'll leave it up to you"" in Japanese, generally offer just two or three sittings a day and have very limited seating.

The growth in popularity in sushi omakase menus, as well as other types of luxe tasting menus, has helped fuel the surge in extravagant eating.

Aragawa, a Japanese restaurant recently opened in the capital, outstrips the costs of even these with diners offered five choices of steak costing up to £900 for a 14oz serving.

Peter Harden, editor and co-founder of the Harden's restaurants guide, said: ""It is tempting to conclude that the capital is becoming a playground for what used to be called ""˜the jet set'.

""But historically one of the striking features of the London restaurant scene has been its lack of a top tier of splurgy, expensive destinations such as those that have long characterised top-end dining in Paris and Tokyo.

""Perhaps it is perverse to complain if London can now hold its own internationally.""

In 2016, there was just one restaurant in London and five across the UK that charged more than £150 per head.

But that figure has soared to 110 in 2023, up from 77 in 2022.

The research also revealed that inflation and energy price hikes had caused restaurants which charge customers £100 per head or more to raise prices by an average of 10.7 per cent in London and 14.7 per cent outside the capital.

The annual London guide from Hardens, due to be released in December 2023, will note 123 newcomers, the lowest number since its 2012 edition.

There were 77 restaurant closures in 2023 reflecting ""tepid"" growth and putting it on a par with 1990 levels, according to the guide.

More from The Telegraph

As a cancer survivor it's one thing me having Aspartame - but with my children it's another

You want to set your children a good example when it comes to wholesome food and drink, but obsessing over risks isn't healthy either

Sometimes it feels as though every day brings a new headline about a seemingly innocuous ingredient that scientists have discovered gives you cancer. It's tempting to pull the duvet over your head and think: if everything gives you cancer, what's the point in worrying about any of it? Well, as someone who has been through treatment for breast cancer, and would do anything to avoid it happening again, I'm here to tell you that it's worth paying attention.

Most recently, a carcinogen identified by the World Health Organisation is the chemical sweetener Aspartame. Most of the coverage has revolved around Diet Coke, and I understand why. 

Using a brand name with a sensational headline saying ""it could give you cancer"" is a better headline than one naming a chemical most people haven't heard of.

But it does mean that those of us who don't drink Diet Coke - or any drink that includes Aspartame - which the WHO are now saying is fine to drink, are lulled into a false sense of security. On reading the news, before this latest development, I picked up the first two things I saw in the kitchen and looked at the ingredients. First, a packet of onion bhajis we had bought to go with a homemade curry. The second was my husband's sugar-free gum, which happened to be on the kitchen counter. Both products contain Aspartame.

It's all very unnerving. And if there's one thing more stressful than the idea that something I consume might be giving me cancer, it's watching my children consume it. Seeing my eight-year-old son with the YouTuber ""status drink"", Prime, at a friend's house, I had to restrain myself from blurting out ""but it contains acesulfame-k!"" 

A sweetener similar to Aspartame, acesulfame-k is also being studied for cancer risk, but all of these chemicals experts say can disrupt metabolic processes and mess with your gut bacteria, causing inflammation and impaired immunity. Seeing my son drink it was almost like watching him self-harm. I know that sounds extreme, and I don't want to be glib about real self-harm, which is a huge issue for many parents of older children. But I'm using that to illustrate how painful it was for me to watch.

Which brings me to another issue: hypervigilance around what we eat and drink. This is common if you've been through a traumatic health-related experience such as cancer treatment. It's easy to fixate on foods that might increase or reduce your risk of cancer. But - oh, the irony - this obsession is also bad for your health. The anxiety it causes is linked to a dysregulated nervous system, increasing your risk of everything from viruses and infections to, yes, cancer.

Clearly, telling someone who has been through treatment not to obsess over avoiding getting cancer again is pointless. Once you have that information, you can't ""un-know"" it. But ensuring that my children are nourished and informed about healthy eating is not my only job. I also have a responsibility to not pass on food neuroses. I want them to enjoy time with friends, where ultra-processed foods are often rife, without anxiety about what they eat.

Now I have some simple rules around the food and drink that we have in our house, which I don't make a big deal about in front of the kids (or my husband, who didn't enjoy being told about the Aspartame in his chewing gum, funnily enough). I look at labels and avoid anything that belongs in a science lab rather than a kitchen. I focus meals around whole foods, making an effort to expose my family to as many different types of vegetables as I can. Without making a thing of it, I'm normalising eating well most of the time, so they'll naturally learn that the ultra-processed stuff they eat at birthday parties is an occasional indulgence, rather than an everyday food.

And in helping them learn to adopt a healthy, relaxed attitude towards food, not obsessing over ingredients or feeling anxious about what they eat, I'm hoping to teach myself the same thing.

Disease spillover risk ""˜overlooked' as scientists find four species of coronavirus in UK wild bats

None of the coronaviruses identified in British bats can currently infect humans, according to researchers

The disease spillover threat posed by British bats has been ""overlooked"", scientists have warned, after finding four species of coronavirus in the UK's wild population.

After screening faecal samples from 16 bat species found in Britain, researchers identified four coronaviruses - including two completely new pathogens - according to a paper published in Nature Communications on Tuesday.

One of the four samples was related to Mers - which has killed more than 850 people worldwide - and another from the same sarbecovirus family as Sars-Cov-2, the virus which causes Covid-19.

The scientists stressed that none of the coronaviruses identified in the British bats can currently infect humans, but warned that their presence demonstrates that there is a risk that should be more closely monitored.

Bats' ability to suppress their immune systems means they can coexist with millions of potentially deadly pathogens - including known viruses such as Sars, Ebola and Zika.

Researchers have estimated that more than 66,000 people are infected by viruses carried by bats every year across southern China and southeast Asia, and earlier this year researchers in Myanmar found that more than 10 per cent of people in rural regions had already been infected with Sars-like coronaviruses.

""˜Spillovers can happen anywhere'

However, the Nature Communications study warned that, despite obvious risks, not enough research has been done to identify and quantify risks in the UK.

Prof Vincent Savolainen, director of the Georgina Mace Centre for the Living Planet at Imperial College London and lead author of the report, told the Telegraph it was ""reassuring"" that none of the coronaviruses found in British bats had jumped to humans, ""given we must have been exposed to them for a very long time"".

But he added: ""With habitat destruction all over the world, wildlife and humans are getting closer. Spillovers can in theory happen anywhere, not only southeast Asia and China.""

Prof Francois Balloux, director of the UCL Genetics Institute and co-author of the paper, said: ""In many parts of the world, we have decent surveillance of the pathogens circulating in humans and domestic animals but not so much in wildlife. Increased surveillance should improve public health preparedness and food security, and also be beneficial for biodiversity conservation.""

He told the Telegraph that he had been ""utterly puzzled we found two new species of coronaviruses in UK bats,"" considering how much people have obsessed over Sars-Cov-2 in the last two years, and said the small size of this study suggests that more coronaviruses are in circulation.

""In terms of risk, European and African coronaviruses could be equally problematic but remain understudied. That said, the next pandemic is relatively unlikely to be caused by a coronavirus. There are many pathogens with pandemic potential. The next pandemic could be caused by a totally different virus, and maybe not even a virus,"" Prof Balloux said. 

However Dr Rachael Tarlinton, an associate professor at the university of Nottingham who was not involved in the study, said the risk of a new virus with pandemic potential emerging in the UK remains very low.

""What is slowly becoming clear... is that the viruses found outside southeast Asia are really quite different,"" she said. ""Southeast Asia really does seem to be a hotspot for emergence of sarbecoviruses into new hosts in a way that isn't occurring in other regions. It is extremely unlikely that the next coronavirus pandemic will originate in UK bats.""

The quiet Brexit success story Remainers don't want to talk about

Britain boasts a resilient services sector in spite of many doomsday predictions

The looming anniversary of the 2016 vote to leave the European Union is already prompting a flurry of assessments on the impact of Brexit on the British economy. 

These evaluations range from the sensible and balanced, through to the silly or even hysterical. It is unfortunate, but perhaps not surprising, that the latter seem to be the most popular.

Take the services sector. If one thinks back to all the apocalyptic claims made by Remainers, our services industry should be a smoking ruin by now. 

Instead, the opposite is true: it has been a success story, and that will only become more obvious.

For a start, the UK's exports of services have performed strongly over the last year. 

This partly reflects buoyant global demand for the types of services in which the UK is comparatively strong, including financial services, other business services such as advertising or legal services, and education. 

But there is no sign of a Brexit hit here.

This applies to individual sectors as well. Brexit is supposed to have dealt a severe blow to the UK financial services industry by ending unfettered access to the EU's Single Market. 

This has made it harder for many firms to do business in the rest of Europe and some have had to increase their presence in EU member states.

However, the overall impact has been far less than feared. As much as £1.3 trillion of assets may have been transferred from the UK to the EU, but this is largely just a question of where transactions are booked. 

Very few jobs have followed - perhaps 7,000 in a sector employing over a million - and much of the associated tax revenue seems to have stayed in the UK.

In the meantime, London remains by far Europe's most competitive financial centre. Indeed, according to the latest Global Financial Centres Index, Edinburgh and Glasgow both ranked above Dublin and Milan.

Of course, it is not enough just to say that Brexit has been less damaging than expected. It was supposed to benefit the City. But this is a process. 

There are worries that the EU will succeed in using its regulatory powers to force more activities to migrate to the bloc, including more euro-denominated business.

It says a lot that the EU is unwilling to play fair here, though perhaps we should not be surprised that countries like Germany and France are putting the interests of their own financial centres above those of the households and businesses that benefit from access to the City.

However, the UK now has the opportunity to build on its existing competitive strengths in financial services. 

As in many other areas, the jury is still out on the willingness of this government (or perhaps that should be ""the Blob"") to take advantage of the post-Brexit freedoms. 

But the ""Edinburgh Reforms"" - a package of measures to boost the financial services sector announced in December - are a large step in the right direction.

Britain's universities remain the envy of Europe, if not the world. 

The UK could surely come up with its own programme of international research and collaboration to rival the EU's Horizon scheme. But more clarity here would ease concerns over the post-Brexit arrangements too.

Other services sectors have also faced new challenges. Instead of automatically gaining access to all EU markets, the ability of UK professionals such as accountants and lawyers (as well as people working in the performing arts) to do business in each country depends on the local rules. 

However, the situation here is improving as businesses become more familiar with the rules in each country. And the direction of travel is towards mutual recognition of a wider range of professional qualifications.

As for the services economy in the UK itself, the labour shortages faced by many businesses are often blamed on an exodus of EU workers after Brexit. But this is hard to square with the fact that net migration to the UK hit a new record of 606,000 last year.

In reality, the end of ""free movement"" has reduced the UK's dependency on cheap labour from the EU, with the transition made easier by the more liberal rules for migration from the rest of world.

Many European countries that have previously relied heavily on migrant workers are in the same boat. Germany, in particular, is also struggling with labour shortages as workers from the rest of the EU returned home during Covid and have not come back. 

What's more, it is harder for any country to attract workers from Eastern European economies, notably Poland, which are now booming themselves.

Admittedly, the post-Brexit migration system is not working perfectly. The headline figures hide a number of mismatches in individual sectors. 

For example, hospitality businesses now need more part-time workers to offset the loss of full-time staff from the EU.

There is also a case for more flexibility on visas in sectors such as social care and seasonal work in agriculture. However, these bugs can be fixed. Given time, the UK's relatively flexible labour market will adjust. 

Economic inactivity is already falling as better pay and conditions attract more people back to work.

Finally, the UK has only just started to take advantage of the freedom to negotiate new agreements which will open up more opportunities for international trade in services, as well as goods. 

These opportunities too will only grow over time.

This does not necessarily require giant trade deals. A good example is the mutual recognition of professional qualifications under a ""Memorandum of Understanding"", now in place with some US states. 

But liberalising the trade in services will be a key benefit of joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, spanning Asia and the Americas.

In short, Britain's services industries continue to thrive - despite Brexit scaremongering.

Covid Inquiry: Boris Johnson apologises for calling long Covid 'b-----ks'

Key moments

Chosen by us to get you up to speed at a glance

Boris Johnson apologised for remarks he had scribbled in notes about long Covid, in which he called the condition ""bol-----"" and compared it to Gulf War Syndrome.

""The words that I described in the margins of submissions about Long Covid have obviously been now publicised and I'm sure that they have caused hurt and offence to a large number of people who do indeed suffer from that syndrome, and I regret very much using that language and should have thought about the possibility of future publication, and I regret it very, very much.

""What I was trying to do,"" he said, ""was get to the heart of the matter, get to the truth of the matter, and to try to get my officials to explain to me exactly what the syndrome was, and it actually took quite a long time before I got a proper paper on it.""

He later defended his description of the condition as Gulf War Syndrome, saying that while he meant ""no disrespect to Long Covid patients"", ""there are also people who think they may be suffering, I think this is now accepted, from something associated with the Gulf War.

""So what I was trying to say was - where is the line, and please can someone explain to me what this is?""

Live Reporting

That is all for today

The Covid Inquiry has ended for the day. Thank you for following The Telegraph's live coverage.

Mr Johnson will return on Thursday when he will give evidence for a second day.

Johnson finishes giving evidence

Mr Johnson will return on Thursday when he will give evidence before the Covid Inquiry for a second day. 

Johnson: 'Hardly surprising' Hancock came under fire

Mr Johnson said it was ""hardly surprising"" that Matt Hancock and the department of health were coming under fire for the ""chaos"" going on in the department during the pandemic. 

He told the inquiry that many ""super-confident"" people in government during the pandemic were ""racked secretly with self-doubt"".

""I was aware, yes, certainly I was aware that the DHSC was under fire from loads of people, but that was hardly surprising because the country was going through a horrific pandemic,"" the former prime minister said.

""The point is, you've got a lot of very talented, sometimes super-confident, who are crushed with anxiety, racked secretly with self-doubt and self-criticism and who externalise that by criticising others and it's human nature, and when you're the leader in those circumstances your job is to work out what is justified and what is people sounding off and what is political nonsense.

""And my judgement was that Matt Hancock on the whole was doing a good job.""

Professional classes had an easier lockdown, Johnson admits

Many commentators have suggested that those advocating for lockdowns were the ""˜laptop classes' who did not understand the burden on normal working class families and frontline workers. 

""We didn't think hard enough about the impact of lockdown on different groups and frankly it was much easier for people with professional jobs to sit out the lockdown than it was for others, whether they were in the hospitality sector or whatever,"" he told the inquiry. 

""A lot of people who were on lower incomes really had a pretty tough time of it and it was vital to focus on those people and do everything we could to help them through lockdown but to realise lockdown was hitting those groups particularly hard.

""That was a reason why you have to be so careful about going into a national lockdown in September.""

Johnson apologises for remarks about long Covid

""The words that I described in the margins of submissions about long Covid have obviously been now publicised and I'm sure that they have caused hurt and offence to a large number of people who do indeed suffer from that syndrome, and I regret very much using that language and should have thought about the possibility of future publication, and I regret it very, very much.

""What I was trying to do,"" he said, ""was get to the heart of the matter, get to the truth of the matter, and to try to get my officials to explain to me exactly what the syndrome was, and it actually took quite a long time before I got a proper paper on it.""

He later defended his description of the condition as Gulf War Syndrome, saying that while he meant ""no disrespect to long Covid patients"", ""there are also people who think they may be suffering, I think this is now accepted, from something associated with the Gulf War.

""So what I was trying to say was - where is the line, and please can someone explain to me what this is?""

Nicola Sturgeon among others created confusion, suggests Boris Johnson

Boris Johnson told the Covid Inquiry that different messaging from devolved administrations created a risk of confusion during the pandemic, reports Blathnaid Corless.

The former prime minister was asked about a part of his witness statement in which he remarked that the devolved nations did not always align with England or the UK's interests.

Mr Johnson told the inquiry in his evidence that the collaboration was ""excellent"" and there was ""far far more that united us than divided us"".

""I was making a much more limited point, and it's no disrespect to the First Minister of Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, they understandably were looking to talk to directly to their own electorates, there were going to be times when they differed from the main UK Government message, and I thought that was sometimes a risk of being confusing at a time when we really needed to land messages simply.""

Asked about comments he was said to have made that it was optically wrong to be seen meeting the leaders of devolved nations, as it may look like a ""mini EU"", Mr Johnson said: ""Well, I'm not certain that I said that to them in so many words, but maybe you've got some evidence that I did.

""I certainly thought that was a risk, and from time to time I felt that the coherence of the UK message was being undermined, and there's got to be a way to protect it.""

Britain needed more 'unified message', says Johnson

Boris Johnson insisted Britain needed a ""unified message"" rather than separate guidance from the devolved administrations, including Scotland's SNP government.

""I think that there's an issue, it's not a huge, huge issue, nothing like as big as many of the other issues that the Inquiry needs to look at,"" he said.

""But we do need to sort it out - we need a better way to get a unified message for the UK.""

Johnson: I wasn't 'truly sure' about the data

Boris Johnson admitted he had taken the ""˜extraordinary' step of locking down the country without being ""˜truly sure' about the data.

In messages from March 26 2020, just days after the country had been locked down, Mr Johnson questioned whether the death figures were accurate.

He wrote: ""We have no idea how many Covid deaths are truly additional. When Covid fatalities are recorded we had no idea whether this is merely present or actually the cause of death.

""We have no idea what proportion may have had the disease asymptomatically already So we have taken these extraordinary steps without being truly sure how deadly it is.""

Giving evidence at the inquiry, Mr Johnson also admitted he did not know which government measures had led to the reduction in cases.

""I think it was cumulative,"" he said. ""I think the R started to go down because of a series of things we did and popular anxiety about Covid anyway.""

He added: ""You asked if I believe lockdown worked. I do. But as a lay person we need to understand with a lot more granular clarity exactly what these NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions) deliver.""

Hugo Keith put it to Mr Johnson that ""˜we will never know' whether measures introduced pre-lockdown, such as shutting non-essential retail and closing schools would have brough R below one, making lockdown unnecessary.

Mr Johnson said: ""Yes, I suppose that's scientifically regrettable but I thought we had not time to find out we couldn't wait."" 

Emphasis between lockdowns was on 'new tactics'

Boris Johnson said the question in summer 2020 was ""what's the tactics - the objective is still ""˜protect the NHS, save lives', do we have any new tactics now"".

He had been asked about Sir Patrick Vallance's claims he wanted to ""push opening too fast"" and ""let it rip"".

Simon Case's damning WhatsApp verdict on Boris Johnson

I gave resisting lockdown 'pretty short shrift'

Mr Johnson said he had given short shrift to the idea of not locking down at all.

Baroness Hallett pointed out to him that critics of the lockdown policy have questioned whether lockdowns caused more harm than good in the long term, and asked him if he had considered not locking down at all.

He said: ""I'm afraid to say at that stage I gave it pretty short shrift because I thought that my job was to protect human life and that is the number one duty of government and I thought that if the NHS was overwhelmed, then the risk of truly tragic scenes in the UK was very real.

""Thank heavens that did not happen thanks to the amazing work of the NHS and hundreds of thousands of people but I felt I had to do what I could to give them the best possible chance and I had no other tool.""

Analysis

Boris Johnson just showed a flash of frustration.

It was over the WhatsApp messages that Dominic Cummings had sent from a meeting between Mr Johnson and Rishi Sunak, then the Chancellor, early in the pandemic. Mr Cummings had urged Lee Cain, Downing Street's top communications figure, to ""get in here he's melting down"" and said Mr Johnson was ""saying stupid s---"".

The WhatsApp messages from 19 March 2020, just a few days before the first nationwide lockdown was announced, made headlines when they were published a few weeks ago. When pressed today on Mr Cummings's comments, Mr Johnson became more animated than elsewhere in his appearance as he dismissed the idea he was going back and forth on policy in the meeting.

Instead the former prime minister insisted that he had already decided a lockdown was needed but had to talk about the seriousness of the economic impact with his chancellor. ""I've got the chancellor of the Exchequer with me saying that there's a risk to the UK bond market,"" Mr Johnson said, his voice more raised than previous responses.

""This matters massively in this country""¦ I have to go through the arguments and that is what I was doing,"" he added.

It was a hint, perhaps, of the frustration that Mr Johnson feels about what one of his most senior advisers at the time - Mr Cummings - was saying behind his back. By the end of that year the Johnson-Cummings relationship had totally deteriorated.

Mr Cummings left Downing Street at the end of 2020 and became a fierce and vocal critic of his former boss, in the end publicly advocating for his ousting as prime minister.

First lockdown built on 'uncertain foundation'

Boris Johnson said the UK had ""run out of wiggle room"" in light of rising Covid cases and the risk that the NHS could be overwhelmed. ""I sensed more needed to be done,"" Mr Johnson added.

Asked about the ""uncertain foundation"" he used to make that decision, Mr Johnson said: ""I accept that. I'm troubled by the decisions that I took for all sorts of reasons, and none of them as we said at the beginning were easy.

""The Government clearly from some quarters gets criticised with going ahead with a lockdown. As we were discussing earlier the very word ""˜lockdown' doesn't really appear in government vocabulary until the 14th [of March, 2020] but we did it completely on the 23rd.

""I think it was really a measure of my anxiety about the curve. It seemed to me that the... I no longer had the luxury of waiting. It was over. We had to... What I was hearing from the scientists, my sense that probably they were right to be doubtful about the efficacy of the measures, I had a hunch that that might be correct but I couldn't know. I thought we were out of time and we had to do everything that we could. So that's why we went.""

I was able to act decisively, Johnson insists

Asked about suggestions by Lee Cain and Dominic Cummings that he could not make up his mind, Boris Johnson said: ""I had made up my mind... I've got the chancellor of the exchequer with me saying there's a risk to the UK bond markets and our ability to raise sovereign debt.

""This matters massively to people in this country. It matters to the livelihoods of people up and down the land.

""I had to go through the arguments, and that is what I was doing.""

Johnson: It would have been 'totally negligent' not to weigh up economic costs

Boris Johnson said the legal complications of introducing the first lockdown were ""enormous"".

""I'm now more or less in virus-fighting mode,"" he said of his mindset at the time. ""We've got to sort this out, so then there's a series of things we do leading up to the 23rd.""

Hugo Keith KC said Mr Johnson would be ""inhuman"" if he had not agonised about what was to be done, but added: ""Is it fair to say that you made your doubt and oscillation clear to those around you?""

""I think it was my job to address all the consequences of what we were doing and to test the policy, which I was as you can see determined that we deliver and get on and do,"" the former prime minister replied.

""Even though it was a completely novel policy, absolutely a dramatic thing to do, what [Lee Cain] is referring to here is a conversation with the chancellor where I'm talking about the downsides, I'm talking about the costs... It would have been totally negligent not to have had such a conversation, not to have gone through with HM Treasury the economic ramifications of what I was proposing to do. I needed to do that.

""It didn't in any way divert us from the crescendo of actions that we took.""

Lockdown 'very, very destructive' for lots of Britons, says Johnson

Boris Johnson has admitted the impacts of lockdowns were ""very, very destructive to a lot of people"".

Mr Johnson told the Covid Inquiry: ""At every stage I was weighing the massive costs of what we were doing to people's psyches, to people's life chances.

""When you talk about an economy you're talking about people in all walks of life who suddenly can't get to do the thing that they need to do to earn a living. What we were obliged to do was very, very destructive for a lot of people who were least able to bear the costs and least able to manage it."" 

'We had to accelerate'

Boris Johnson told the Covid Inquiry:

My impression was on the 13th, the radical change that you refer to is really one about the timeliness thing.

What I think Sage saw, and what was conveyed to me by the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Adviser, is that the virus was now spreading much more rapidly in the UK than they had bargained for, and therefore we had to accelerate.

So I think it was a confluence of opinion, but the people I talked to on the Saturday morning were the people you'd expect. It was Chris [Whitty], Patrick [Vallance], Imran [one of Mr Johnson's aides], my other advisers... I wouldn't want to allow the Inquiry to run away with the idea that it would have just all soldiered on had it not been for the intervention of No10.

I think Sage themselves had seen very seriously and very clearly that something needed to be done.

March 13, 2020 'key moment' Covid response pivoted

Boris Johnson pinpoints March 13, 2020 as the ""key moment"" when the UK's Covid response pivoted as he was called back.

Mr Johnson performed an about-turn over his handling of Covid as he announced sporting events, concerts and other ""mass gatherings"" would be cancelled from the following week.

Johnson: I shouldn't have shaken hands with hospital patients in March 2020

Boris Johnson said the measures that could be taken to ""depress"" the first wave of the virus ""were all very much couched with caveats about timeliness and going at the right moment"".

""If I could offer a suggestion as to what was really going on, I think that it is clear we simply didn't realise how fast the disease was spreading. If you remember the predictions were that the peak was going to come in mid-May or June, I think, and it was really well in advance of that.""

Mr Johnson said he could not remember using the phrase ""business as usual"" or any debate about its use.

He also said he should not have shaken hands with people on a visit to the Royal Free Hospital on March 1, 2020.

""I shouldn't have done that in retrospect,"" he said. ""I should have been more precautionary but I wanted to be encouraging people.""

Boris Johnson fights back tears during evidence

Boris Johnson fought back tears as he cast his mind back to 2020 and the onset of the virus.

""We have to be realistic about 2020. The whole year, that whole tragic, tragic year...

""We did lock down. But then it bounced back after we unlocked.""

The Inquiry resumes

Boris Johnson was shown a WhatsApp message from Dominic Cummings in which the aide wrote on March 3, 2020: ""[Boris] doesn't think it's a big deal and he doesn't think anything can be done and his focus is elsewhere, he thinks it'll be like swine flu and he thinks his main danger is talking economy into a slump.""

Mr Johnson said a Cobra meeting had taken place the previous day and said Covid was ""starting to be an issue of concern to me"".

""I couldn't figure out why I was getting these conflicting messages about whether something could happen, the scale of the [estimated death figures] and what it was going to be. I think the part of the message that is still correct at that point is if at that point what is going to be the lasting damage from this, I would still have probably said it's going to be what we do to fight it rather than the actual impact of the disease. But I was increasingly concerned about it.""

He added: ""I couldn't see, yet, the plan. I couldn't see what... So the NPIs were to me pretty far-fetched still in my imagination. I was still gestating that.""

'The Covid Inquiry has already made up its mind on who to blame: Boris'

There are echoes of The Third Man in this Covid Inquiry, writes Philip Johnston.

The key figure, played by Orson Welles, is spoken about all the time but is never seen until late on (principally because he is thought to be dead). But on Wednesday, at last, exposed by a light cast into a darkened doorway, we will finally see Harry Lime, aka Boris Johnson, a knowing smirk upon his face. You can almost hear the zither music.

Like Graham Greene's character, he has already been tried in absentia, his reputation trashed by former colleagues, medical evidence produced to demonstrate his cavalier indifference to human lives, with even his best friends no longer able to deny the truth. Boris must sometimes wish he had staged his own death as well.

Memories are short. Mr Johnson is now said even by his former colleagues to have been singularly ill-equipped to lead the country through a pandemic, and yet at the outset, and for many months afterwards (until the parties), he enjoyed high popularity ratings. 

Philip Johnston: The guilt for the disaster of lockdown is collective

Worst case scenarios had gone wrong before, says Boris Johnson

Boris Johnson has said the government was so slow to respond to Covid because worst case scenario models had turned out to be wrong in the past.

In the 2009 swine flu pandemic it was predicted up to 65,000 people might die while just 457 people succumbed to the virus. Likewise only 178 people died from mad cow disease caused by infected beef despite claims it could kill 136,000.

""We could see the mathematical implications and the reasonable worst case scenario, the problem was we didn't think, and this was our mistake, that the reasonable worst case scenario was likely to happen.

""The tragedy is that we were operating on a fallacious, inductive logic about previous reasonable worst case scenarios, and this one and this was the one where I am afraid the worst predictions turned out to be correct,"" he said.

Lunch break

The Covid Inquiry has broken for lunch and will be back at 1:40pm.

Analysis

Confused series of questions by Hugo Keith. The KC has suggested that Boris Johnson was blinded to the impending seriousness of Covid-19 because he was looking back at the Mad Cow Disease (BSE) and Swine Flu scares which had lower death rates.

He questioned whether Mr Johnson should have taken Covid-19 more seriously when it emerged the fatality rate was around two per cent.

Pointing to discussions early in the pandemic, he asked Mr Johnson: ""You noted that high fatality figures had been given for BSE and Swine Flu, and you expressed scepticism about the possible number of deaths. BSE did not have a two per cent fatality rate. Swine flu did not have a two per cent fatality rate. Covid had a two per cent fatality rate.""

He's right about swine flu - which ended up having an infection fatality rate of around 0.02 per cent. But BSE is a different matter. The fatality rate of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease - the human form of BSE - is 100 per cent. Nobody survives. And it is fair to say that in both cases, early estimates had been vastly wide of the mark.

In 2009, chief medical officer, Professor Sir Liam Donaldson, predicted that 65,000 people might die of H1N1 swine flu, but just 457 people died over an eight month period. Likewise Professor Roy Anderson of Oxford University predicted up to 136,000 deaths from BSE. In the end around 178 people died in Britain from eating infected beef.

Responding to Mr Keith's questions, Mr Johnson replied ""I do remember the BSE scare and I remember the immense destruction that it did to the agricultural sector in this country and the way that all turned out. ""I think it would be fair to say I wanted to probe them on their forecasts and try to understand the basis on which they were making them.""

Johnson: I was anxious public would tire of lockdowns

Boris Johnson was asked about the public's willingness to comply with lockdown measures.

""You have to keep doing it and so my anxiety was in the absence of therapeutics and in the absence of a vaccination programme, what would happen if we simply went into a hard lockdown early, and then had no alternative but to come out?

""To answer your main question it was an anxiety, a problem that was very prevalent during those very early days.""

Nadine Dorries: Boris Johnson was 'the grown up in the room'

Ms Dorries, a staunch supporter of Mr Johnson and his former culture secretary, wrote on X:

Having watched Cummings and Caine give evidence to #covidenquiry and now watching @BorisJohnson
It's obvious who was the grown up in the room.
Boris not stabbed one person in the back and avoids criticising others who were dealing with an unknown pandemic in difficult""¦

Johnson: Tackling Covid was always going to come at a cost

Boris Johnson told the Covid Inquiry: ""In disasters such as this, the actions that government take inevitably also have costs and I'm sure we're going to come on to this but that's the balance we have to strike.""

He said his thinking in late February was as follows: ""I'm looking at a problem that is being presented to me, I need to know what the plan is going to be. I've told you that I don't like the look of the way it's going in Italy, at all, and we need to do something.""

He added: ""That is the day, I remember, the 28th [February, 2020], I remember having a long conversation with [Chris Whitty]... when he takes me through NPIs, what were later referred to as lockdowns, and he tells me about pros and cons, he gives a sketch of the behavioural fatigue argument and he takes me through the issues. So I think what I'm saying is, well, if this is the problem, then when I am going to be given the menu of options about what we're going to do about this?""

Former prime minister: Mad Cow Disease influenced Covid response

Boris Johnson said he was influenced by memories of Mad Cow Disease in Britain, which ""wasn't nearly as fatal as people had originally believed"" and cost ""an awful lot of money"", when decided on what measures to take in the early days of the pandemic.

Asked about claims by one of his aides, Imran Shafi, who said he had expressed scepticism about fatality figures from Covid, he said he could not remember that.

""But I do remember the BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy or so-called mad cow disease) scare and I remember the immense destruction that did to the agriculture sector in this country.

""I think it would be fair to say I wanted to probe them on their forecasts and to try and understand what they were making.""

Johnson: I 'couldn't believe' fatality estimates

Boris Johnson said he was troubled by the ""sheer number"" of potential fatalities as a result of the pandemic.

""I couldn't believe it, to be honest with you. What the paper also said was it may be like a bad flu pandemic, or it may be milder than that. And I thought, well, we have plenty of bad flu pandemics in the UK and we also have... And if it's milder than that it won't be an exceptional thing at all. So why am I also being told that the [estimate] is 520,000?""

Asked about the pace of work on the virus from February 14 to February 28, and whether this represented a ""lost opportunity"", Mr Johnson replied: ""I think there were things we could have done and should have done if we'd have known quite how fast it was spreading.""

Boris Johnson: I look back at early stages of Covid response 'with horror'

Boris Johnson said that by February 2020 ""the scenes from Italy really rattled me"" as the European country's hospitals struggled to cope with the virus.

""I remember seeing a note somewhere saying that the fatality rate in Italy was eight per cent because they had an elderly population and I thought ""˜well, my God, we've got an elderly population, this is appalling.' And my instinct was this cannot possibly be right, this number.

""Just so you know I look at all this stuff in which we seem so oblivious with horror. We should have twigged. We should collectively have twigged much sooner. I should have twigged.""

Mr Johnson insisted there was nonetheless a ""lot going on"" to coordinate the pandemic response, and it started to ""mount in tempo"" after the half-term break, in which Mr Johnson took a holiday during which he insisted he was working, at the end of February 2020.

Exclusive: Boris Johnson personally apologised to Helen MacNamara over Cummings WhatsApp

Boris Johnson personally apologised to Helen MacNamara, the deputy cabinet secretary during part of his premiership, over how she was described in rude WhatsApps.

At the Inquiry this morning the former prime minister said he had apologised to one government figure for what was said about them in WhatsApps but did not give a name.

The Telegraph understands from an ally of Mr Johnson that the individual he has apologised to was Ms MacNamara. It is unclear how the apology was communicated or when.

Earlier in the year it emerged that Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson's senior Number 10 adviser, called Ms MacNamara ""that c---"" and said he would ""handcuff her and escort her"" from Downing Street in one WhatsApp message.

Mr Johnson was a member of the WhatsApp group where the message was posted.

When Ms MacNamara gave evidence to the Inquiry she said the message had been ""horrible to read"" and criticised Mr Johnson for not stepping in and reprimanding Mr Cummings. Mr Cummings did not dispute the accuracy of the message when he appeared before the Inquiry but denied it showed he was misogynistic, arguing he was just as rude about male colleagues.

Ms MacNamara has been contacted for comment.

Johnson: We were not prepared enough with test-and-trace

Boris Johnson said he had not attended a ""tabletop exercise"" referred to in a Cabinet readout on February 6, but that he was sure his officials would have been present.

Asked what his exact plan was to deal with the virus, he replied: ""The plan was that we would try to isolate, test and trace people as they arrived... My impression was that we had a good testing system.

""To answer your question directly, I can't be confident I said in that meeting ""˜what is the plan?'""

Mr Johnson went on to say messaging during the pandemic ""was the most important tool we had to deal with the virus"".

""We've talked about borders and we've talked about test-and-trace. Borders didn't really offer a panacea, test-and-trace we were sadly not as well-prepared as we should have been.""

Analysis

Boris Johnson is deploying quite a clever argument when it comes to those now infamous WhatsApps from Dominic Cummings, Simon Case and others expressing exasperation at his Number 10 operation.

The former prime minister argues, in essence, that any expletive-ridden messages or fierce criticism of colleagues are effectively just signs of frustrated employees letting off steam.

He says that curt and frank outbursts are to be expected, given all the pressures of the job and the challenge of tackling a once-in-a-century pandemic.

And he insists that similar tensions existed between senior figures in Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher's administrations.

At one point Mr Johnson argues: ""The worse vice in my view would have been to have had an operation where everybody was so deferential and so reluctant to make waves that they never expressed their opinion"".

He says it was ""much more important to have a group of people who were willing to doubt themselves and doubt each other"".

In short: Rude WhatsApps showed government figures were willing to challenge each other, which was a good thing. 

Johnson: The alarm bells didn't ring loudly enough in Whitehall

Boris Johnson said the government was not able to ""comprehend the implications of what we were actually looking at"".

""If we had collectively stopped to think about the mathematical implications of some of the forecasts that were being made, and we believed them, we might have operated differently. The problem was that I don't think that we attached enough credence to those forecasts.

""Because of the experience we had had with other zoonotic diseases, I think collectively in Whitehall there was not a sufficient loud enough klaxon of alarm. I don't blame people, I just think it was the experience they'd had all their lives.""

Mr Johnson went on to say he was ""agnostic"" about the virus in the early stages.

""I took what Matt had to say very seriously. I thought he wasn't badgering me for no reason, but on the other hand I'd had the experience that you described. I was waiting for that advice, I was waiting for the tone to change.""

Whitehall wasn't prepared for scale of Covid, suggests Boris Johnson

Boris Johnson suggested ""the Whitehall mind"" was not prepared for the scale and nature of the pandemic.

""The concept of a pandemic did not necessarily imply to the Whitehall mind the kind of utter disaster that Covid was to become.

""And that may sound odd, but what I'm trying to say is that I think people were still thinking about things like an influenza pandemic or some of the other diseases that I've mentioned.""

Mr Johnson said he had not seen a worst-case scenario projection of 800,000, insisting he saw a ""different figure"" at the time.

'We [were] just underestimating the pace and contagiousness of Covid'

Boris Johnson said the Government was not ""oblivious"" to the pandemic and ""a lot of planning"" was put in place.

""What is going wrong, possibly, is that we are just underestimating the pace, the contagiousness, of the disease, and you can see very clearly from that crucial moment of transition from the 12th to the 13th of March how radically the scientific appreciation of the situation had changed.""

Boris Johnson: I 'underestimated' scale of Covid challenge

Boris Johnson said there was a ""default mindset"" that Covid would be ""relatively benign"" in the UK.

""That was basically because people were operating on the basis of their lived experience... I think it was a human natural response of people based on what they themselves had seen and observed in their lifetimes.""

Pressed by Hugo Keith KC on whether his government had ""failed to understand"" the scale of the crisis, Mr Johnson answered: ""I certainly think it would be fair to say of me, the entirely Whitehall establishment, scientific community included, our advisers included, that we underestimated the scale and pace of the challenge. You can see that very clearly in those early days in March, from late February through to the sequence of NPIs and lockdowns.

""You can see that we were all collectively underestimating how fast it had already spread in the UK. We underestimated, we put the first peak too late, we thought it'd be in May/June, that was totally wrong, I don't blame the scientists for that at all but that was the feeling, and it just turned out to be wrong.""

Analysis

Boris Johnson was right to say that Britain's Covid pandemic death rate was not as bad as feared. 

Last year, research by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in the US calculated the excess death rates for 191 countries and territories and found that the UK was roughly in the middle at 102.

Previously, countries have been judged by death rates alone, which would place Britain at 168 - the 24th worst in the world.

Critics of the Government's pandemic response have often cited this figure as justification for calling for tougher Covid restrictions.  But Britain was found to have an excess death rate of 126.8 per 100,000, very close to France - which had 124.4 per 100,000 - and Germany, with 120.5 per 100,000.

Sweden, which did not lock down, was found to have one of the best excess death rates in Europe, with 91.2 per 100,000. Only Finland, Luxembourg and Iceland fared better. 

The UK excess death rate is close to the average global excess death rate of 120 per 100,000.

Boris Johnson: Covid wasn't escalated to me 'until much later'

Boris Johnson said: ""Everybody, had they stopped to think about it, could see the implications of the data, they could see what was happening in the numbers, the percentage of fatalities in China, but I don't think that they necessarily drew the right conclusions in that early phase.

""Which is no fault of theirs, what happened was something that was completely outside someone's living memory, what we were dealing with is like a once-in-a-century event. I just don't think people computed the implications of that data... It wasn't escalated to me as an issue of national concern until much later.""

Johnson quizzed on Cobra meetings

After a 10-minute break, the Inquiry has resumed with a focus on the events of January and February 2020.

Asked if Matt Hancock made ""repeated"" attempts to ""raise the alarm"" with him about Covid-19, Boris Johnson said he certainly recalled a conversation on January 7, 2020 but added: ""I don't, to be frank, remember all those conversations, but it's true that we will have spoken on many occasions because we generally spoke quite a lot.

""I think that in that period, January really to the end of February, towards the end of February, Covid was pretty much like a cloud on the horizon no bigger than a man's hand, and you didn't know if it was going to turn into a typhoon or not... It became clear much later.""

Mr Johnson said there were cabinet discussions about the pandemic in January and February, and a ""crescendo of activity about it... In government, it wasn't yet being escalated to me as something of really truly national concern.""

Hugo Keith KC noted five Cobra meetings, chaired by Matt Hancock, took place in the space of a month. ""A Cobra is a regular occurrence in government when there's something a particular department is leading on,"" Mr Johnson insisted.

""I think I was aware of handling it, I can't say I was aware that he was handling in that way [Cobra meetings] on those particular dates. My instructions to him were to keep me posted and I would do whatever I could... Clearly, by the end of February, I'm getting anxious about what we're doing.""

Analysis

Boris Johnson was quizzed on why excess deaths from Covid were worse in Britain than many other European countries.

Although Mr Johnson disputed how badly Britain had done, he also argued that the country had an extremely elderly population, living very closely together, with many people suffering from comorbidities which put them at risk from the virus.

Certainly, he is right to warn that comparing raw numbers is unhelpful in determining which country did better in its Covid response, as nations have vastly different population densities, social mixing, demographics, family structures and healthcare. For example midway through the first wave, Ireland had 65 deaths per million people while Britain had 145 deaths per million.

However, the population density of Ireland is lower than in Britain, approximately 186 people per square mile compared to 727 people in the UK. And while 83 per cent of Britons live in urban areas, just 63 per cent of Irish people do.

The German population density is also lower than the UK at 623 people per square mile and France, which has consistently been lower than Britain, is just 309 people per square mile. Just 76 per cent of Germans live in urban areas and 81.5 per cent of French people, again lower than the UK. London, which saw the most cases in the first wave was also the largest city in Europe, with nearly nine million people. In contrast, Berlin has just 3.7 million and Paris 2.1 million.

The median age of citizens is also likely to play a role in the final death figures. Italy did particularly badly but its median age is 47.3 years while Ireland's is 38.2. Britain is 40.7  Compared to Britain's 66""‰million inhabitants, Italy has around 60""‰million and Spain 46.94""‰million, so it might be expected for overall figures to be lower.

Boris Johnson: People were getting 'very frazzled' by pressures of pandemic

Mr Johnson told the Inquiry: ""People, as you can see from the Whatsapps, were getting very frazzled because they were frustrated. Covid kept coming at us in wave after wave and it was very very hard to fight it and people were doing their level best.

""When people are critical of the guy at the top or they're critical of each other that's a reflection of the difficulty of the circumstances. 

""When it became easier in the spring during the vaccine rollout people's tone changed. Of course it did. But it was a reflection of the agony that the country was going through and that the government was going through"". 

Boris Johnson: Situation in October 2020 was 'appalling'

Hugo Keith KC quoted Sir Patrick Vallance describing Boris Johnson as ""all over the place"" and ""completely inconsistent"", before Sir Patrick's claim that on October 25, 2020, Mr Johnson ""[began] to argue for letting it all rip, saying, yes there will be more casualties but so be it - ""˜they have had a good innings'.""

Asked if he would accept it is ""extraordinary"" that figures including Simon Case and Sir Patrick should be commenting in such terms about his competence and performance, Mr Johnson said: ""No, no, I think this is wholly to be expected. And this is a period in which the country is going through a resurgence of the virus, you're looking at the October [2020] period. Patrick, the CSA, talks about inconsistency and we've just got to face the reality.

""I've got to face the reality as prime minister that the virus seems to be refusing to be suppressed by the measures we've used so far, we're going to have to use different measures... Of course we're changing. But so did the collective understanding of the science. And if you look back at what happened during Covid we had radically different views over the period over the efficacy of masks, over whether asymptomatic transmission could take place. We had a totally different view within months about whether ventilators would be needed.""

Mr Johnson said the lack of a vaccine or a ""way out"" in October 2020 put him in an ""appalling"" situation.

""At this particular moment, I'm sure we'll come to the October/November lockdowns, my anxiety was that we were going to have to do the same thing over and over again. And I think what those notebooks reflect and all those comments reflect is the deep anxiety of a group of people doing their level best who cannot see an easy solution and are naturally self-critical and critical of others.""

Analysis

Is Boris Johnson a details man? The question is another at the heart of the debate playing out at the Covid Inquiry throughout its work and especially today.

Allies have often argued that the former prime minister could engage with specifics carefully when he wanted to, but was more a big picture politician than some predecessors.

During this morning's inquiry Mr Johnson has made an admission: That he did not often read the raw minutes from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, which is widely known by its acronym Sage. ""I did from time to time look at the consensus minutes"", Mr Johnson said at one time. At another he says he looked at the minutes ""once or twice or maybe more than that"".

It is pointed out to him that the minutes - sometimes only eight or nine pages long - were designed to distil their discussions and be easily understood.

Mr Johnson accepts he only rarely read the minutes, but insisted he got summaries of the minutes from Sir Patrick Vallance, then the government's Chief Scientific Adviser (CSA), and Sir Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) for England.

He says at one point: ""I was very very much impressed by and dependent upon the CMO and the CSA, both of whom are outstanding experts in their field. It felt to me that I couldn't do better than that."" It is a tangible example of a time Mr Johnson, rightly or wrongly, chose not to dive into the underlying specifics of scientific advice, relying on summaries instead.is Johnson's competence had been doubted by senior officials.

Boris Johnson: Candid WhatsApp messages 'creatively useful'

The Inquiry was shown WhatsApp messages sent by Simon Case, the Cabinet Secretary in which he said Dominic Cummings had ""zero discipline"" and defied requests from Boris Johnson to stop talking to the media, before going on to write: ""I've never seen a bunch of people less well-equipped to run a country.""

Mr Johnson insisted this was part of ""day-to-day"" friction.

""If you'd had the views of the mandarinate about the Thatcher government in unexpugated WhatsApps, I think you would have found that they are pretty fruity. WhatsApp conversation is intended to be, although clearly it isn't, ephemeral, it tends to the pejorative and the hyperbolical.

""I think the worst vice in my view would have been to have had an operation where everyone was so deferential and so reluctant to make waves that they never expressed their opinion, they never challenged and they never doubted. It was much more important to have a group of people who were willing to doubt that and to doubt each other. And I think that was creatively useful, rather than the reverse.""

Boris Johnson: Hancock had defects but I stuck by him

The Inquiry was shown a message sent by Dominic Cummings to Boris Johnson on May 7, 2020 in which he wrote:

Hancock is unfit for this job. The incompetence, the constant lies, the obsession with media bulls--t over doing his job. Still no f---ing serious testing in care homes, his uselessness is killing god knows how many. This morning you must ask him when we will get to 500k per day and where your plan is for testing all care home workers weekly.

It was also shown a message sent by Mr Cummings two days later in which he told Mr Johnson ""you need to think of binning Hancock"".

Mr Johnson said: ""First of all in politics there's never a time, when you're prime minister, you are constantly being lobbied by somebody to sack somebody else. It's just what, I'm afraid, happens and it's part of life. Everyone is constantly militating against some other individual for some reason of their own. It's just I'm afraid that's the nature of it.

""It is perfectly true that this adviser in particular had a low opinion of the health secretary. I thought he was wrong, I stuck by the health secretary, I thought the health secretary worked very hard. He may have had defects but I thought that he was doing his best in very difficult circumstances and he was a good communicator.""

Boris Johnson: Gender balance of my team should have been better

Boris Johnson was asked about messages which showed he criticised Matt Hancock, his former health secretary, using the words ""totally f---ing hopeless"".

""I would say that my job was not to uncritically accept that everything we were doing was good, although as it happens I do think that the country as a whole had notable achievements during the crisis.

""My job was to try to get a load of quite disparate, quite challenging characters to keep going and through a long period and to keep doing their level best to protect the country. That is my job.""

Asked about Helen McNamara's claims that Dominic Cummings contributed to a ""toxic atmosphere"" and Simon Case telling him that ""top drawer"" people had refused to work in his administration because of a culture of toxicity, Mr Johnson said: ""I was not aware of that. I did not see any sign of that... We had no difficulty getting wonderful people to step forward.

""I think if I might make one self-criticism, or another self-criticism, I think the gender balance of my team should have been better and to your earlier question, looking back at it, when I was running London it was great and it was 50:50 and it was a very harmonious team. I think sometimes during the pandemic too many teams were male-dominated... I think that was something to do better.""

Johnson: 'Good and healthy' debates took place over pandemic response

It was put to Boris Johnson that Mark Sedwill reportedly described his administration as ""brutal and useless"" and claimed it was ""hard to motivate"" people.

""Again, I think that actually what you're looking at in all this stuff is a lot of highly talented and highly motivated people who are stricken with anxiety about what is happening, about the pandemic, who are doing their best and who like all human beings under great stress and great anxiety about themselves and their own performance will be inclined to be critical of others.

""And I think that will have been the same of any administration facing the same sort of challenges on that scale.""

Mr Johnson said it was a ""good and healthy thing"" that there were heated discussions and debates between ministers, advisers and other figures.

""What we were generally trying to do was make sure we delivered the best possible service for the people of the UK who were going through an absolutely terrible, terrible time. And it would not have been right if we'd have a lot of WhatsApps that said ""˜aren't we doing brilliantly, folks, isn't this going well?'.""

Boris Johnson apologises for language used in WhatsApps seen by inquiry

Hugo Keith KC said while the Inquiry had no interests in the ""salacious"" nature of some of Dominic Cummings's WhatsApp messages, ""his communications revealed an abusive and misogynistic impact"".

""It's fair to say that in the round that material paints an appalling picture, not all the time, but at times, of incompetence and disarray.""

Boris Johnson replied: ""I think it is certainly true that this Inquiry has dredged up a phenomenal quantity of the type of material that would never have been available to any previous inquiry to do with dealings in No10 because it's WhatsApp... That's a good thing because you can get a texture for the feeling of the relationships and the human beings.

""First of all a lot of the language and style that you refer to is completely unknown to me or to anybody else on that group. I apologise to one person who suffered abuse in those well-publicised WhatsApp exchanges. But I would make a distinction between the type of language used and the decision-making processes of the Government and what we got done.

""And I would submit that any powerful and effective government, has, and I think of the Thatcher government or the Blair government, a lot of challenging and competing characters whose views about each other might not be fit to print, but get an awful lot done, and that's what we did.""

Boris Johnson asked about Eat Out to Help Out

Boris Johnson was grilled on the lack of ""transparent"" analysis and evidence provided to him about the merits of Rishi Sunak's Eat Out to Help Out programme, which ran across August and September 2020.

""I think that there was certainly transparent economic analysis of the cost of some of the measures that we were obliged to enact,"" Mr Johnson said.

""Of course what was not public, and what is not traditionally public, is ministerial conversations and discussions between ministers. But the perspective I was being offered by the Treasury was a very useful one, just as the perspective of the Department for Health was very useful.""

 

Boris Johnson: I read Sage minutes 'once or twice'

Asked if he ever read the minutes of Sage meetings, Boris Johnson said: ""I think I did once or twice... I'd look at what Sage actually said, and Sage produced a lot of documentation.""

He hailed Professor Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance for distilling their contents into ""very clear summaries"".

""I think I did, from time to time, look at the minutes... In retrospect, it might have been helpful to hear the Sage conversation unpasteurised itself.""

Mr Johnson confirmed he read only a fraction of the hundreds of meeting minutes.

Boris Johnson: My cabinet were more reluctant to lock down than me

Boris Johnson said a ""huge number of decisions"" had to be made directly by him during the pandemic, but others were the subject of ""exhaustive cabinet discussions"".

Hugo Keith KC quoted Michael Gove and Sajid Javid's criticisms of overly centralised decision-making, and Dominic Cummings describing the cabinet at the time as ""largely irrelevant"".

""I don't think that's true,"" Mr Johnson responded. ""There were really excellent cabinet discussions about the trade-offs. In fact to make a comment about the cabinet as a whole in terms of the speed of lockdowns, which is what we're talking about, I think it is probably fair to say that the cabinet was on the whole more reluctant to impose NPIs necessarily than I was.""

Mr Keith noted the decision to lock down on Monday, March 23 was only debated by Mr Johnson's cabinet after the event. Mr Johnson said: ""I'm fairly certain we had at least a long cabinet call to discuss it.""

Asked who ultimately had to weigh up competing considerations, he replied: ""That's the job of a prime minister, only the prime minister can do that. But I think that wasn't a bad way of doing it, to have different interests represented by different departments.""

Boris Johnson: There were no easy choices - except the vaccine rollout

Boris Johnson insisted he had to take ""very, very difficult decisions"" during the pandemic.

""The issue of timeliness of lockdowns was clearly one we considered very hard at the time and you will have seen from the evidence there were very strong arguments against going into lockdown too early, especially when it came down to those series of March NPIs [non-pharmaceutical interventions].

""You'll remember the arguments that were made, two arguments, against early action, and they were the risk of behavioural fatigue and then the risk of bounce-back, or uncoiling the spring. They were made powerfully and they certainly had an effect on me.""

He added: ""I suppose it was an easy decision to say we should go ahead with the rollout of both Pfizer and AstraZeneca as soon as they'd been approved by the MHRA. When it came to the balancing of the need to protect the public and the need to protect the NHS, and the damage down by lockdowns, it was incredibly difficult.""

Baroness Hallett interrupted to admonish the behaviour of some of those present, saying it was ""unfortunate"" she had to ask people to leave but that proceedings must be allowed to go ahead.

Boris Johnson: Age and density of British population to blame for excess deaths

Questioned about why the UK ended up with its rate of excess deaths, Boris Johnson said: ""I think that the statistics vary and every country struggled with a new pandemic.

""And I think the UK from the evidence I have seen was well down the European table and even further down the world table.

""If I had to answer why I think we faced particular headwinds, I would say it was irrespective of Government action. We have an elderly population, an extremely elderly population, who do suffer sadly from lots of Covid-related comorbidities. And we are a very densely-populated country, the second most densely-populated in Europe, and that did not help.""

Asked if he accepted Government actions contributed to excess deaths, Mr Johnson said other countries had ended up ""statistically with more excess deaths"" than the UK, adding: ""I don't know.""

Analysis

Boris Johnson has apologised for mistakes made when tackling Covid. But what mistakes, exactly? That is the early focus of some of the questioning today.

In his written statement Mr Johnson says: ""We - I - unquestionably made mistakes, and for those I unreservedly apologise."" But the former prime minister is less forthcoming about what specifically he is saying sorry for.

When pressed, he picks out messaging issues between the leaders of each of the UK's four nations. Pushed further, Mr Johnson eventually says: ""Were there things we could have done differently? Unquestionably. But I would struggle to itemise them before you now in a hierarchy.""

It is a fascinating exchange and one that underpins Mr Johnson's testimony. The next two days we will see if the blanket ""˜sorry' will be followed by specific admissions of error.

Boris Johnson: I take personal responsibility for all decisions made

Asked about the difference between the personal responsibility he takes and that of the Government, Mr Johnson said: ""I take personal responsibility for all the decisions we made.""

Also asked if he takes responsibility for the speed of the Government's response in January, February and March 2020, he replied: ""Of course.""

Pressed on whether he takes responsibility for decisions around lockdowns, the spread of Covid in care homes the discharge of patients into the care sector, the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, the speed at which restrictions were eased and not introducing a circuit-breaker lockdown, he repeatedly replied: ""Of course.""

Mr Johnson went on: ""With hindsight it may be easy to see things that we could have done differently. At the time I felt that, and I know that everybody else felt that we were doing our best in very difficult circumstances to protect life and also to protect the NHS.""

Asked if decisions made by the Government led to more excess deaths in the UK than might otherwise have been the case, he said: ""I can't give you the answer to that question. I'm not sure. I noticed that in your opening preamble you produced a slide saying that the UK was second only to Italy in excess deaths. That's not to my knowledge the case. All I'll say is many other countries suffered terrible losses from Covid, and the evidence that I've seen suggests we were well down the league table and well down the world table.

""But that is of course no comfort to the bereaved and their families. That seems to be the statistical reality.""

Mr Johnson insisted the Office for National Statistics data put the UK about ""16th or 19th"" out of 33 countries, to which Mr Keith said the UK was one of the worst off countries in western Europe, if not the second worst off.

Boris Johnson: We were doing our level best

Boris Johnson is asked about the ""mistakes"" he refers to in his witness statement to the Inquiry.

""I think if you look at my statement, I point out that we relied so much on messaging to help contain the virus and we needed the public to understand the message in as straightforward a way as possible. They really did, by and large.

""One problem we had that I mention is that because of the very natural and proper right of administrations to have their own approach... So the BBC would have one message from No10, then a slightly different one from Scotland or whatever. I think we need to sort that in future.""

Asked about the primary mistakes that caused ""terrible suffering"" and asked why he was apologising in his witness statement, Mr Johnson replied: ""So many people suffered, so many people lost their lives. Inevitably in the course of trying to handle a very, very difficult pandemic in which we had to balance appalling harms on either side of the decision, we may have made mistakes. I don't want to try to anticipate the discussion which I'm sure we will get into about the timings of NPIs, lockdowns- Inevitably, we got some things wrong.

""I think we were doing the best we can at the time, given what we knew, given the information we had at the time, I think we were doing our level best. Were there things that we should have done differently? Unquestionably. But I would struggle to itemise them all for you now in a hierarchy. I think I'd find it easier to try and explain what happened as we go through.""

Boris Johnson asked about missing messages

The inquiry is shown a WhatsApp in which Simon Case, the Cabinet Secretary, wrote:

PM is mad if he doesn't think his WhatsApps will become public via Covid inquiry - but he was clearly not in the mood for that discussion tonight! We'll have that battle in the new year.

Mr Johnson said he had handed over ""all the relevant WhatsApps"" to the Inquiry, before he was asked about 5,000 or so messages that could not be retrieved from an old phone.

He said he did not perform a ""factory reset"" on his mobile phone.

""I haven't removed any WhatsApps from my phone. I've given everything I think you need,"" Mr Johnson said.

'What we were trying to prevent is the loss of life, absolutely'

Boris Johnson said he believed the independent inquiry, which he announced in 2021, is ""the right way forward"".

Mr Johnson was reminded by Hugo Keith KC of the more than 230,000 Covid-linked deaths, which Mr Keith said ""is a shocking figure and a terrible loss of life"".

The former prime minister said: ""That is certainly the core of the tragedy.""

Asked if the number of deaths is one of the most important markers against which his administration should be measured, Mr Johnson replied: ""I certainly think it's the... What we were trying to prevent is the loss of life, absolutely.""

Asked if he accepted that the bereaved are entitled to ""no less than a full and rigorous scrutiny"", he said: ""Yes.""

The moment Boris Johnson swore on the Bible

Boris Johnson: 'I am deeply sorry'

Boris Johnson swore on the Bible before taking his seat at the Covid Inquiry.

Hugo Keith KC noted Mr Johnson was prime minister throughout the whole of the pandemic.

The former prime minister said: ""Can I just say how glad I am to be here at this inquiry, and how sorry I am for the pain and the loss and the suffering.""

Baroness Heather Hallett interrupted him to ask a protester to sit down, before requesting that the ushers escorted the protester out.

Mr Johnson went on: ""Can I say that I understand the feelings of the victims and their families, and I am deeply sorry for the pain and the loss and the suffering of those victims and their families.

""And grateful though I am to the hundreds of thousands of healthcare workers and many other public servants and many other walks of life that helped to protect our country throughout a dreadful pandemic I do hope that this inquiry will help to get the answers to the very difficult questions that those victims and those families are rightly asking so that we can protect ourselves better, help each other to protect ourselves better and prevent further suffering.""

'Failing to respect confidentiality undermines the inquiry'

Baroness Heather Hallett, the chairman of the Covid Inquiry, said: ""Before we start I'd like to express my concern about reports in the press of the contents of Mr Johnson's witness statement to the inquiry and what his evidence will be.

""Until a witness is called and appears at a hearing or the inquiry publishes the witness's statement, it is meant to be confidential between the witness, the inquiry and the core participants, and I wish to remind all those involved in the inquiry process that they must maintain this confidentiality so as to allow the sharing of materials prior to hearing between those most involved in the inquiry process.

""Failing to respect confidentiality undermines the inquiry's ability to do its job fairly, effectively and independently.""

Protests and a press conference outside Covid Inquiry

Not long now...

We can expect Boris Johnson's evidence to the Covid Inquiry to start in about 10 minutes' time.

You will be able to follow live on this blog.

Long Covid 'sidelined, disbelieved and ignored', says campaigner

Natalie Rogers, of the Long Covid Groups, said the evidence heard at the inquiry ""has confirmed that long Covid has been sidelined, disbelieved and ignored"".

Speaking at a press conference outside the inquiry, Ms Rogers insisted the condition ""was never given the importance it deserved"".

""People with long Covid are the surviving victims of the pandemic, and the millions injured by Covid-19 have faced huge struggles to have their illness recognised and get the care that they desperately need.

""Due to an almost complete absence of messaging from our Government, the public have essentially been kept in the dark about this relatively common and debilitating consequence of a Covid infection.""

She went on to accuse ministers of ""the prioritisation of the economy over health"".

Boris Johnson accused of 'grotesque distortion of the truth'

Aamer Anwar, the lead solicitor for the group Scottish Covid Bereaved, told a press conference outside the Covid Inquiry, told a press conference the evidence heard so far ""has exposed a deadly culture of impunity, of arrogance, of incompetence and blaming everyone else but themselves"".

Mr Anwar accused sections of the media of ""orchestrated attacks... to defend Boris Johnson"", adding: ""For the families we represent, this inquiry has robustly acted without fear or favour.

""Boris Johnson is expected to issue an apology this morning, yet he will claim he saved thousands of lives. For many of the bereaved, that will be a grotesque distortion of the truth. In Boris Johnson's words, instead of solving a national crisis, his government presided over a ""˜total disgusting orgy of narcissism'.

""He did let the bodies pile up and the elderly were treated as toxic waste. As a result, over a quarter of a million died from Covid... The families impacted by Covid deserve the truth today.""

Guto Harri: Boris Johnson ""˜let down very badly' by civil servants

Boris Johnson was ""let down very badly"" by senior civil servants during the pandemic, his former director of communications has said.

Guto Harri told Times Radio: ""The tragedy for me is that three of the most senior aides that he had, including somebody who's meant to be the professional head of the neutral civil service, had a pathetic little WhatsApp group together.

""And they were just bitching about the prime minister and his wife, dare I say, when they should have been executing what were the difficult judgement calls made by him and the elected cabinet members at the time. That's the real tragedy of this...He was let down very badly by them.""

However, Mr Harri insisted Mr Johnson would not use his two days of evidence at the Covid Inquiry to ""settle old scores"", adding: ""He's going there with a constructive attitude to help the judge come to the right conclusions about future action.""

'Let the bodies pile high'

A van parked outside the Covid Inquiry is displaying a banner with the faces of some of those who died with coronavirus during the pandemic and the words ""let the bodies pile high"", attributed to Boris Johnson.

Mr Johnson has denied that he said ""let the bodies pile high"" in advance of the second lockdown after losing the argument on the return of a full shutdown.

On whether he used other expressive language, however, he is expected to accept there were times where he did. However, he will argue that he was trying to test and provoke advisers around him so he got a better idea of what they were saying to him.

According to two separate accounts, the former prime minister barked in frustration on October 30, 2020: ""No more ----ing lockdowns. Let the bodies pile high in their thousands!"" It is alleged that three different people overheard the remark and have confirmed what he said.

Johnson believes Covid Inquiry should examine lockdown harms

Boris Johnson believes the Covid inquiry should urgently examine the harms caused by lockdown, The Telegraph understands.

The former prime minister, set to appear before the inquiry on Wednesday and Thursday, has told allies he thinks it is legitimate to ask whether the right questions are being addressed.

In particular, Mr Johnson, who was prime minister through the pandemic, is concerned that the impact of lockdown on the economy and children's education has not been adequately examined.

He would also like the inquiry to consider whether the virus was man-made - a question raised by Michael Gove during his appearance at the inquiry last week. Mr Gove was told this issue was outside the scope of the inquiry.

Johnson: It is legitimate to ask if right questions being asked

Demonstrators already outside Covid Inquiry

Boris Johnson may have arrived to the Covid Inquiry three hours early to avoid protesters.

But grieving families who lost loved ones during the pandemic have already shown up outside the venue:

Why I'm crumbling in the face of my glut of urban plums

Gardening is becoming an increasingly unpredictable pursuit due to climate change - and it is a struggle to adapt

Has anyone else's garden gone - no other word for it - bananas? Metaphorically, although maybe literally, too. A chap in my London borough recently made the BBC news when his banana plant started to fruit for the first time.

Possibly the last time, once this tropical novelty realises it's been plonked in a herbaceous border in Hackney, not Honduras. But global warming has seen Norway producing its own wine so calculating air miles just got a whole lot more complicated.

My own plot is in such disarray that I really don't know where to start, although ""all over again"" sounds uncomfortably close to the truth.

Earlier this summer my Victoria Early Rivers tree went berserk and produced so many plums the dogs were staggering around, tipsy on fermenting windfalls and I had to give away bulging plastic bags full of fruit once the freezer was full.

Normal rhythms no longer apply; I was gutted earlier this week to find that my apple tree had shed its entire crop into the pond, a full month early, while I was on holiday in Scotland, unable to mount any sort of patrol.

All five of my much-loved fish were dead: Shakira Shakira and Shaun Mendez the magnificent koi carp who came when called, along with Fan Boy Three, Zebrugge and Bandit the goldfish. I felt guilt and shame on finding them, floating grotesquely in the turbid pool created by the rotting apples.

Meanwhile my spring bulbs have started to push up; hyacinths and crocuses in August, anyone? And a friend reveals her wisteria has gone so loco that it is strangling her (notoriously indestructible) fig tree, while her cherry tree is naked as the day it was planted.

Gardeners of course love to moan and humblebrag about triumphs they have plucked from the jaws of disaster a la: I just popped the stems in some water and hey presto, I bagged my first gold medal at Chelsea.

But now the elements are no longer predictable and neither are the timings, I fear I've forgotten what to do or when to do it. Before anyone asks, yes I have researched Mediterranean-style planting and been bowled over by Beth Chatto's magnificent dry garden.

Unfortunately my garden is dry but not very sunny, ""thanks"" to the huge trees that border it, which have had preservation orders plastered on them, despite the fact at least one is dangerous.

I'd happily chop them down and replace them with a banana plantation and a cashew orchard but the council are implacable. So instead, as ever, we gardeners must adapt. Did I mention I also have dogs careening joyfully around the place?

Try nurturing hostas with two rambunctious terriers on the go. Short of rolling barbed wire over the herbaceous border, nothing will stop them.

I need help. Dear green-fingered Telegraph readers I defer to your horticultural wisdom; please tell me how I can make my globally-warmed garden grow""¦

A Telegraph tour of the English high street: Fishergate, Preston - much friendlier than I'd expected

I found an area that is proud, historic, cheerful and enterprising, but also an area whose future could go in either direction

The traditional British high street was, for so many, the beating heart of their town. But as huge chains consumed spaces once filled by local independent businesses - and struggling firms began to disappear entirely - was the soul of our towns lost? Christopher Howse is travelling the nation to speak to local people about their high street. How it has changed, what they miss""¦ and why there are still joys to be found. This week, Christopher takes a tour of Fishergate in Preston, Lancashire.

I felt much better after a cup of tea and a scone in Bob & Berts, a warm, bright, modern cafe at the station end of Fishergate, which serves as Preston's high street.

I'd made the mistake of starting at Starbucks, which charged £7.10 for a meagre cheese toastie and a raspberry lemonade. A couple of young women in headscarves sat sadly at the next table. 

Starbucks is in the Fishergate Shopping Centre and, with its neighbours Poundland, TK Maxx, Shoezone and McDonald's, could be anywhere. The shopping centre also shelters the empty Debenhams department store with its big To Let sign. The shopping centre's previous owners went into administration in 2013.

Preston, a city of 130,000 on the river Ribble, has a large park celebrated for egg-rolling or ""pacing"" at Easter and a proud industrial past. I must say immediately that Fishergate turned out to be much friendlier than I'd expected. I'd spent a drizzly time exploring the area just to the north of the station. It has a mixture of industrial decay, small houses with a strong presence of yet-to-be-prosperous people of south Asian origin and university accommodation.

I hadn't realised that what I came to think of as ""student farming"" played such a prominent part in the life of English towns. The depressing hotel where I'd stayed - between a busy road and the railway - was identical to the student housing next to it - where the residents have to stay for more than a night or two.

But near the University of Central Lancashire stands one of the architectural marvels of Preston. (The other, beyond the east end of Fishergate, is the controversial 1960s Brutalist bus station.) Here, though, in the area called Maudland, with its strange-sounding street called Maudland Bank, is the exhilarating spire of St Walburge's Church - 309ft high, the tallest parish church spire in the land. It was finished in 1854 to the design of Joseph Hansom, the man who invented the two-wheeled cab of the same name.

St Walburge's has something in common with some older buildings in Fishergate. In 2007 its closure was threatened, but to what use could it be put to preserve it from ruin? Parishioners began a fundraising drive with a Lancashire Hotpot Supper, but it would have taken a lot of hotpots to maintain a whacking great church. Its future was only secured when it was taken on by the Institute of Christ the King, a bona fide Catholic set-up devoted to the Tridentine Mass.

The cafe Bob & Berts offered the more humble attraction of a loo plus Nine to Five and Take on Me sounding cheerily over the loudspeakers. I assumed the place was a local start-up, but it is in fact a modest chain originating in Northern Ireland, with half a dozen branches now in the North of England. When I congratulated the young woman at the counter on the free butter and jam available and the metal cutlery, she replied humorously, ""That's why people come here. You should come back."" I wouldn't mind.

Shops close early by London standards. By six, Fishergate was deserted. One shop still open was the Sainsbury's Local, which has found a new use for an old commercial building of some splendour, ""the best building of its type in Preston"" in the opinion of Pevsner's Buildings of England. 

The proud stone frontage in Renaissance style, with vermiculated rustication, animal masks gripping festoons and five bays of windows, with columns supporting classical pediments, was built in 1856 for the Preston Banking Company, formed to serve the growing prosperity of the town's mills. The first manager, Henry Graves, lived above the shop.

Sainsbury's opened here in 2014, eight years after HSBC closed the bank branch; inside are rows of white-painted Corinthian pillars. That evening something had gone wrong with deliveries. ""They've only got sliced bread and barm cakes,"" complained one disappointed shopper.

Fishergate runs eastward from the railway station half a mile to the spire of St John's, in what is by then Church Street. First recorded in 1094, the parish church was in 1853 unsentimentally pulled down and rebuilt, luckily to rather a fine design. Since Preston was made a city in 2002, it has been restyled as Preston Minster, as is the fashion for civic churches.

St John's tall spire is a sort of lighthouse marking the eastward limit that Saturday morning shoppers are likely to wander, unless they feel a sudden need for vaping gear or a nail manicure amid decaying buildings. There used to be another spire defining Fishergate, 197ft high, on the town hall built of local stone in 1867 to the designs of Sir Gilbert Scott. It had all the magnificence a northern municipality could wish. An imperial staircase, only a little less grand than the architect's Foreign Office in London, led to a first-floor Council Chamber and Guild Hall, spacious, stately and elaborately ornamented.

But 80 years later, on March 15 1947 a fire took hold, rushing up the tower and letting blazing beams of wood fall and strike the four-ton 15cwt bell, tolling weirdly in the night till it crashed down. The ground floor was patched up, and a petition of 8,000 called for the Town Hall's restoration. But in 1962 it was demolished. Pevsner remarks with understatement that Crystal House, a block on a podium built in 1963, ""is not a worthy successor"". Prestonians voted it their favourite building to be demolished. 

As I mixed with the Saturday morning shoppers, a thin elderly man, sidling along the wall on the other side of the road, called out: ""How are you, sir? I like your beard."" Under the canopy of the closed-down BHS, a man lay in a sleeping bag. Outside M&S a man asked for change. But the signs of rough-sleeping were nothing compared with my nightly walk home in central London.

The shoppers out and about had an air of prosperity. Fishergate is pleasant to walk down because it has been reduced to a single lane of sparse traffic. Some were bound for the Market Hall, purpose-built in 1973 on the site of a market centuries old.

I liked the stall that sold wigs and sewing supplies and the cheese was a treat just to look at. The mackerel on the fish counter looked freshly painted but my favourite outlet, with a steady throng of shoppers, was Livesey's the butcher's. It offered the best roasting topside and bargains such as beef neck bones at four for £3 and pigs' feet at £1.90 a kilo. A complicated piece of repartee between one of the butchers and a woman shopper in a woollen coat concerned bones that she was told she might see. ""You shan't be showing me anything,"" she cried, roaring with laughter.

In the cooked section were piles of pies of every size: Gornal's butter pies, Castle pork pies, Greenhalgh's steak puddings, Manchester tarts. 

Adrian Livesey has been running his shop for 40 years. He is well-built and ruddy as a butcher should be and wears a butcher's hat, a striped apron and a big grin. ""We've bucked the trend here at the market. People are getting skint nowadays,"" he points out. ""Instead of takeaways, I say, ""˜Why don't you have a go and cook?'"" One thing he is worried about is parking for customers.

Nearby is the modern emblem of Preston, the Bus Station, built in 1968 and beloved by fans of Brutalism. It provided stands for 80 buses, 40 on each side of a long building beneath continuous car-park balconies resembling a giant hoover attachment. 

One problem was pedestrian access through subways - smelly, dark and threatening. In 2012 it was decided to demolish it, but in 2013 it was listed as a building of architectural and historic interest.

It has been improved by removing bus bays from one side and making a (windswept) square. The trouble now is planning blight. A £700 million development planned a decade ago has come to nothing, and the old Tithebarn pub which gave the scheme its name stands boarded up. In a back street nearby, graffiti, rubbish, abandoned bedding and vomit showed inner-city decay at its most repellent.

But Preston's Fishergate remains a proud, historic, cheerful and enterprising high street less blighted than many with empty shops. Its future could be down or up.

Coming soon on Christopher's tour of Britain's high streets: High Street, Yarm, North Yorkshire... Shields Road, Byker, Newcastle (""Britain's worst high street"")... Watergate Street, Chester... Abbeygate Street, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk...

10 wildlife invaders costing us a fortune - from Japanese knotweed to grey squirrels

With invasive alien species now a £4bn problem in Britain, here's what you should do if you find destructive flora or fauna on your patch

Invasive alien species are now a £4bn problem in Britain, with more than 2,000 critters and fungi killing trees en masse, causing structural damage to buildings, and prompting clean-up campaigns running into millions of pounds. The extent of the destruction has been revealed in a new report funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), which found that the cost of invasive non-native species (INNS) has risen by 135 per cent since 2010.

""We already knew the costs were huge,"" says RenÃ© Eschen, senior scientist at the Centre for Agriculture and Biosciences International (CABI) and lead author of the study. 

Still, the scale of the findings - which include an average of 12 new species taking root here each year - have come as something of a ""surprise"", Eschen admits. The report adds that ""˜there remains a significant gap in our understanding of the size and nature of the economic impacts of INNS""¦ and assessment of the costs are needed to prioritise investment in prevention, intervention and management.' 

Here are the 10 most damaging species currently plaguing Britain:

Hymenoscyphus fraxineus (ash dieback)

This tree-killing fungus wasn't present in Britain at the time of the last report, yet ""all of a sudden, it has become by far the most expensive species [where damage is concerned],"" Eschen explains. An Asian import that arrived in the UK in 2012, it tallies £883.5m in annual damage (close to four times the second place saboteur) via major clean-up costs around railways, roads, and other public land.

The disease kills 80 per cent of trees infected, with initial signs including blackened or dead leaves, twigs and live shoots acquiring a purple tinge, and diamond-shaped lesions where older branches join the tree's trunk. There is currently no cure, but it is hoped that between one and five per cent of the UK's two billion ash trees are genetically resistant to the disease, meaning they could survive and produce dieback-resistant species in the future.

Japanese knotweed

Introduced as an ornamental garden plant in the mid-19th century, Japanese knotweed generates around £246.5m of repair work annually, growing through cracks in areas such as pavements, walls and fences, damaging lightweight structures such as garages and conservatories, lifting pipework, and blocking drains. England is the worst affected country in the UK, accounting for over 80 per cent of cases. 

One 2012 study found that its presence reduced a property's price by between 5 and 15 per cent. Spraying or injecting the stems (with approved herbicides) can get rid of the problem, though it typically takes three years to treat, at a cost of £1,000-£5,000 for a domestic garden. However, Government guidance advises that you don't attempt to treat knotweed yourself unless you have the appropriate skills and experience, as certain chemicals, for example, require a certificate of competence for use.

Rabbits

The costliest species in 2010 - causing more than £260m a year in damage to crops - Britain's rabbits are now not quite as costly, according to the latest report, mainly because viral infections have reduced the size of the wild population. But around £170m in damage is still caused by rabbits each year in the UK. Introduced as pets by the Romans 2,000 years ago, their grazing can kill a number of plant species as well as trees and shrubs (if the bark is gnawed). 

The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) warns that ""˜killing rabbits will rarely give more than a short-term reduction in numbers,' and advises wrapping part-chewed trunks in black polythene to help the area to callus over (along with other rabbit-proofing measures, such as fences), and the use of animal repellents including aluminium ammonium.

Rats and mice

Edible dormice (Glis Glis) were brought over by the Rothschilds in the early 1900s, brown rats first came to the UK on boats in the 18th century, while house mice arrived on trading vessels during the Stone Age. These rodents are most commonly found in homes, gardens and woodlands, and can cause major damage, often posing a fire hazard by tearing up drywall and insulation, and exposing and chewing through wires. England's rodent-related damage is three times higher than the rest of the UK, at a total cost of £84m annually. Pest control is vital here and expense depends on the size of the problem; a rat exterminator call-out starts at around £50.

Cockroaches

The two main types of cockroach found in the UK are the German and the Oriental species, which confusingly hail from southeast Asia and the Black Sea respectively. The £70m worth of damage cockroaches inflict on the UK each year is borne by humans, rather than land or property. They are a significant public health risk, carrying diseases such as salmonella, gastroenteritis and dysentery, and are most commonly found in commercial premises where food is handled, mostly restaurants. Pest control, via chemical killers and bait traps, can eradicate the problem.

Deer

Only two of the six species found in the UK are native: the red and roe deer. Fallow, sika, muntjac and Chinese water deer all come from other shores. Deer can cause substantial damage to woodlands via ""˜fraying' - where males rub bark from the main stem of a tree, leaving it in tatters - ""˜thrashing' (males whipping low branches with their antlers), and ""˜browsing,' when they cause damage to tips and shoots while feeding. Their eating and trampling through crops is especially expensive in the east and south west of England (where cereal crops are planted), with the total annual destruction coming in at £63m. For domestic land, the RHS recommends netting or high fences. As many as 350,000 dear are culled each year on private land.

Grey squirrel

In 1876, grey squirrels were brought to Britain from North America as an ornamental species to populate the grounds of stately homes. By 1930, however, the level of damage they wreaked - including stripping bark from trees, creating ""˜open wounds,' and destroying maize and fruit crops - was identified, and the practice swiftly stopped. Previously described by conservationist and broadcaster Chris Packham as Britain's ""most unpopular non-native invader,"" the population - and the havoc it causes - is most pronounced in England (though Northern Ireland sees double the cost of the damage carried out in Wales and Scotland). The CABI study puts the total bill at £40.5m, though a 2021 report from the Royal Forestry Society warned that disturbed timber, lost carbon revenue and tree replacement will cause £1.1bn in costs over the next 40 years. In the garden, squirrels can be deterred by artificial birds of prey, like owls and falcons, and the damage they do managed by caging fruit trees and pots. For public land, there is a Squirrel Accord, made up of 41 leading conservation and forestry organisations, government agencies and companies, which is considering various measures, such as birth control.

Varroa mite

Infestations of varroa mites, originally found in eastern honey bees in Asia, deplete bee populations, which costs the UK £22.5m each year. When the mites attach themselves to bees, their foraging performance is much reduced, meaning they can't help to pollinate the 70 species we rely on them for, for food. They can also cause the entire breakdown, and death, of bee colonies. (An infestation last year triggered a bee lockdown in New South Wales, Australia, during which time no honey bees could be moved across the state.) 

Monitoring hives, buying mite-resistant honey bee stock, installing small-cell honeycombs (in which it is thought mites struggle to reproduce) or introducing brood breaks (where there are no babies in the nest) can help to clear out early-stage infestations.

Box tree moth

Accidentally introduced to the UK from southeast Asia, box tree moths can rapidly overwhelm hedges, eating the plants and leaving a brown skeleton in their wake. Capable of laying hundreds of eggs (larvae) when they find a bush, swathes of caterpillars then chomp at their new environment - a £15.4m defoliation issue that is especially bad in London. Checking box plants often from early spring can prevent the population from growing, according to the RHS; pheromone traps and pesticides may prove necessary for infestation control.

Green spruce aphid

Native to continental Europe, the green spruce aphid (or elatobium abietinum) is a sap-sucking insect that takes to spruce trees during late autumn to spring, causing discolouration and needle loss. This reduction in needles affects the volume of timber trees produce. Treatment to curb this £14.5m desecration isn't possible with larger trees (as the whole thing must be treated), but for smaller plants, pesticides should be used in late August or September, according to the RHS, ""with a further treatment on a mild, dry day in early February.""

Five species that could be next to invade our shores

 

Asian hornet

Of the 19 alerts issued by the Non-Native Species Secretariat (NNSS), the vespa velutina is the biggest potential threat to Britain, capable of killing off insects like honeybees (thereby damaging other native species). They spread rapidly in France in 2004, and a number of sightings have been recorded in the UK since 2016. Vigilance is strongly encouraged around major ports in southern parts of England and Wales, particularly during April to November when they are most active (they peak in August/September).

Water primrose

South Africa's native ludwigia grandiflora has been found in some parts of England and Wales. Having already become a serious pest in countries such as France, where it causes a reduction in native species in water, it also raises the risk of flooding. 

Purple pitcher plant

The carnivorous sarracenia purpurea is a bog-dwelling plant native to north America, where ""it outcompetes native bog vegetation, may impact on invertebrate communities, and disrupts [the nutrient cycle],"" according to the NNSS. Twenty suspected sites where it is growing have been found in England, along with two in Scotland.

American lobster 

These US and Canadian imports could harm UK lobster stocks, say the NNSS, by carrying disease, competing for resources, and interbreeding. UK guidance is to record suspected sightings of the homarus americanus, and retain them for collection from the Marine Management Organisation.

Carolina fanwort

A few populations of the cabomba caroliniana, originally found in South America and southern parts of North America, have made it to south east England. While these have yet to become invasive due to the climate, the NNSS warns that they could have ""potentially large impacts on native aquatic communities and may also affect aquaculture, damage equipment, and impede recreational activities.""

Smart motorway cameras 'not facing the road'

Some devices are focused on the ground, pointing at the sky or looking at fields of sheep rather than roads where there is no hard shoulder

Broken CCTV cameras meant to spot motorists stranded in live lanes on smart motorways can leave National Highways staff struggling to get ""eyes on"" life-and-death emergencies, a whistleblower has said.

A source in one of the Government-owned company's control centres has revealed how staff are left ""exasperated"" after reporting failing cameras that do not get repaired for ""ages"".

Analysis by The Telegraph of the network's live feeds has revealed how some are focused on the ground, pointing at the sky, looking at fields of sheep or honed in on houses and industrial estates rather than monitoring motorways where there is no hard shoulder.

The study by the The Telegraph of camera footage from the M1, M6, and M25 showed some cameras were failing to return to their ""homing position"" after the tilt and zoom controls had been used by National Highways staff.

Other CCTV cameras were waterlogged or covered in condensation, obscuring the view.

A National Highways spokesman insisted that the CCTV camera's resting position is not ""critical"" to its performance because it can still be moved, adding that CCTV is one of a number of ways stranded vehicles are detected.

""We are aware of problems experienced by operators in relation to camera resting positions, and we are already working with camera suppliers to address this issue,"" she said.

During two days of analysis of live feeds, two live lane breakdowns were spotted on the M25 after cars came to a halt on live lanes after failing to reach an emergency refuge area.

In both cases, the ""red X"" symbol on overhead gantries closed the lane to traffic, and speed limits were imposed. No one was injured. In the first incident, a passing traffic officer spotted one stricken vehicle. In the second case, a member of the public alerted authorities, and the vehicle was towed to an emergency area with the help of the police.

However, the feed illustrated the perils faced by motorists, traffic patrol staff, and police who end up just feet from fast-moving lorries and cars.

In April, the Government announced all planned future smart motorways would be cancelled following numerous coroners finding how the removal of the hard shoulder had contributed to fatal collisions.

National Highways operates nearly 4,000 cameras either fitted to gantries straddling the carriageways or on 40ft (12m) high masts.

According to its website, the cameras, which do not enforce speed limits, provide staff at traffic operation centres a ""bird's-eye view"" of the motorway network.

The source said a computer system called Dynac ""loads up"" cameras when an incident is detected.

""In the worst case scenario, CCTV may be broken so we can struggle to see anything,"" the source added, explaining how some ""infrastructure defects"" had not been repaired despite being reported months ago.

""In other instances, the image can be very poor or obscured. Some may have been knocked from their homing position by bad weather.""

The Telegraph found nine cameras on the M25 had severe condensation, limiting the view. On the M6, some default positions looked at a power plant, a housing estate, fields of livestock, and the ground and sky.

On the M1, some feeds were marked ""FAULT: camera communication failure"", another said ""optics management error"", while others showed only trees.

Claire Mercer, whose husband Jason died on the M1 smart motorway in 2019, said: ""National Highways is not taking the serious problems with smart motorways seriously at all.

""Time after time the tech is shown to not be up to the job, and people are still dying.""

A spokesman for National Highways added how broken down vehicles on ""all-lane running"" smart motorways can be spotted by a ""whole system of inter-related safety features"", including radar which covers the entire network.

""All plans for new smart motorway schemes have been cancelled, and we are investing £900 million until 2025 to improve the safety features of smart motorways. This includes work to fix broken traffic cameras,"" she added.

Diving seabird numbers plunge 90pc near offshore wind farms

Scientists find dramatic fall in population of red-throated loons in the North Sea before and after offshore wind farms were installed

Populations of a diving seabird plummeted by more than 90 per cent after offshore wind farms were built, a study has found.

Data from German scientists looked at the number of red-throated loons in the North Sea before and after the installation of five offshore wind farms.

Numbers of the birds were found to be up to 94 per cent lower within half a mile of the wind turbines, on average, after they were built.

Wind turbines installed in the North Sea are seen as a key way to generate enough renewable electricity to allow for the phasing out of fossil fuels and to help reach net zero ambitions.

The study focused on five wind farms in the North Sea which are close to the coast of Denmark and Germany.

One farm, called Butendiek, experienced a 99 per cent decline in numbers of red-throated loons.

Numbers dropped by two thirds

""In all cases, the wind farms created a kind of halo around these constructions, with low to very low abundances of loons,"" the scientists, led by Kiel University, write in their study.

The impact was felt further afield too, with an average decline of 52 per cent in bird numbers up to six miles from the turbines.

Two of the offshore wind farms, Helgoland and Austengrund, saw numbers of red-throated loons drop by more than two thirds within a six-mile radius.

The scientists used data from ships, aircraft and digital aerial surveys collected during March and April between 2010 and 2017.

A model was then created which tracked the loon density and how it changed after the wind farms were built.

The red-throated loon, also known as the red-throated diver, is the smallest and lightest of the UK's diving birds. Most of its food is fish, which it catches by swimming underwater for up to 90 seconds at a time.

Shetland is a stronghold for the red-throated loon. They can be found there year round but during the summer more than 21,000 birds flock to UK shores around Scotland as well as the east and west coast.

Previous studies have found wind farms can affect other species, but no other seabird has been found to be so deleteriously impacted by offshore turbines, the authors claim.

""Although renewable energies will be needed to provide a large share of our energy demands in the future, it is necessary to minimise the costs in terms of less-adaptable species, to avoid amplifying the biodiversity crisis,"" the scientists write in the study published in the journal Scientific Reports.

The bird is not known to be a particularly fussy eater but the scientists speculate that the turbines have such a significant effect on them by getting in the way of how they hunt.

Movements are restricted

r""When foraging for their highly mobile prey, loons are now more restricted in terms of their larger-scale movements because their former foraging area has been split into smaller units by the establishment of several offshore wind farms,"" the scientists said.

Aly McCluskie, senior conservation scientist at RSPB, told The Telegraph: ""This helpful new study adds to the existing evidence that offshore wind farms can have major impacts on birds.

""This particular study focused on the impacts of offshore wind farms on a group of waterbirds called red-throated divers in the German North Sea. However, the seas around the UK are some of the most important anywhere globally for a wide range of bird species, including waterbirds and seabirds, and include Special Protection Areas for red-throated divers.

""These are already predicted to be impacted by offshore wind farm developments. Undoubtedly the scale of future offshore wind development proposed for the UK's seas will have further huge impacts on our already under-pressure bird populations.

""It is therefore vital that as we rapidly grow renewables to tackle climate change we also ensure that we protect and recover our marine environment by avoiding the most important places for wildlife and restoring nature to our seas at scale.""

Southern England being prepared for massive solar farm expansion

Farmland equivalent to 40,000 football pitches could be repurposed under Ofgem plans

Farmland equivalent to 40,000 football pitches could be turned into industrial solar farms across southern England under plans by Ofgem to boost green electricity generation close to London.

It suggests 20 gigawatts of electricity could be generated by new solar farms across the Home Counties and East Anglia, meaning the installation of up to 60 million industrial solar panels. Another 4-6GW would come from onshore wind farms, comprising 2-3,000 wind turbines, also in the Home Counties and the South. 

The total output would roughly equate to 13 nuclear power stations.  

The proposal could cut CO2 emissions, reduce bills and boost energy security for the South, but solar farms take up 2,500 acres of land for each gigawatt of power.

It means those benefits would come at the price of turning up to 50,000 acres of fertile farmland into industrial-scale solar parks and wind farms and so could be hugely controversial.

The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) has warned the plan could see many tenant farmers thrown off their land, increase pressure on the green belt, and see rural landscapes altered forever.

However Ofgem, the Government's energy regulator, says it could help cut consumer bills by £51bn over 15 years. The proposals are part of its wider plans for ""locational pricing"" under which the wholesale price of electricity, which is currently the same across Britain, would instead vary by region.

The price in each region would instead be based on local supply and demand, as well as how close power stations are to consumers.

For consumers the highest bills would be seen in regions like London and the south east, which are most distant from northern and offshore wind farms.

Conversely, consumers in regions like Scotland, which already have thousands of turbines both onshore and around their coasts, would pay much less.

Ofgem's research suggests that making electricity prices higher in the south east, where demand is strongest and supply weakest, would incentivise solar developers. 

They would be encouraged to buy up swathes of farmland in a region stretching from London to Bristol and up to Norwich and Cambridge for solar parks and wind farms.

Its report, just published, divides the UK into seven pricing zones with southern England and East Anglia in regions GB6 and GB7.

It said: ""Attracted by higher nodal [regional] prices and the better climatic condition ""¦ more than 20GW of new solar generation capacity is forecast to be sited in GB6 and GB7 by 2040.""

A spokesman said: ""Consumer benefits of locational pricing could reach £51bn between 2025-2040 ""¦ For domestic consumers, this would be equivalent to £56 a year saving."" 

He admitted, however, that Scottish consumers would gain most with savings averaging £60 while Londoners would benefit by just £10 a year.

Those most affected by solar farms say such savings are small compared to the damage done to landscapes. Paul Harding, of Great Wymondley Village Association, in Hertfordshire, said: ""Our local residents in Wymondley already face being consumed by two solar farms, taking a total of 123 hectares of quality farmland in precious green belt very close to conservation areas and listed buildings simply because we are near a substation.

""Each part of the country should contribute to the national good in the way it most effectively can and for the south east that is not covering our farmland with solar panels.""

David Mairs, of CPRE Kent, said: ""Swathes of land have been sacrificed for solar farms across our county. Cleve Hill on the North Kent Marshes, mooted at the time of application as the largest in the country, was wrong on every level. Thanet, in the east of the county, is effectively ring fenced by wind farms, ruining the seascape.

""We accept that some solar farms and offshore wind farms are going to happen, but the gung-ho approach being suggested is not justifiable, on landscape grounds alone.""

Other green campaigners say regional pricing and generation is essential. Simon Skillings, an analyst at E3G, an energy think-tank, said locational pricing would be essential to keeping bills down and boosting renewables. He said: ""It has to happen to avoid wasting huge amounts of money. Our view is that it will be impossible to run the electricity system efficiently without it. ""¦This is not a big policy choice - it's a necessity.""

Some energy companies are also enthusiasts. Rachel Fletcher, economics director at Octopus Energy, which supplies 5.3m UK customers, said the company was strongly in favour of locational pricing partly because it would cut costs for all consumers and help the UK cut its carbon emissions faster.

She said: ""Locational pricing will benefit every household in the UK. It would incentivise the growth of renewables closer to where electricity is consumed and it would mean we would use our grid in the most efficient way.

""This wouldn't just bring bills down for consumers, it also means we wouldn't have to plaster our beautiful countryside with more pylons through unnecessary grid infrastructure. It would also attract energy-intensive industries like data centres to areas where renewable energy is already abundant, creating thousands of jobs along the way.""

Trade bodies are more cautious - warning the upheaval of changing an established system would deter investors. Solar Energy UK's director of policy and delivery Gemma Grimes said: ""Making energy prices more volatile, disrupting investor confidence and increasing the cost of capital at this time would be deeply unhelpful."".

A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesman said it would soon be consulting on locational pricing and the potential for expansion of solar power: ""We are considering a range of options and incentives to better match where energy is generated and used, helping to ensure a fair deal for consumers.

""We continue to work closely with industry and stakeholders to develop and refine options for reform, ahead of a further consultation expected this autumn.""

Fake Chinese honey imports spur Spanish producers to demand EU action

Cheap products from China add to a swarm of problems for Spain's beekeepers, who say their businesses are under threat

Spanish honey producers are demanding the EU change its labelling laws to stop the industry from collapsing due to cheap imports of fake honey from China.

Cheap products from overseas have added to a swarm of local problems for Spanish beekeepers, who say they will be driven out of business if no action is taken to defend an industry that provides crucial pollination for the rest of the country's agricultural sector.

""Chinese honey doesn't pollinate plants here in Spain,"" said JosÃ© Luis Delgado, a beekeeper from DurÃ³n in Guadalajara province, a heartland for honey production thanks to its proliferation of flowering herbs such as lavender, thyme and rosemary.

COAG, Spain's agricultural union, and other beekeeper associations are demanding a change in EU labelling rules on the blended honeys sold in supermarkets.

There is currently no obligation to state what proportion of a blended honey comes from which country, meaning a product can appear half-Spanish when, in fact, as little as 1 per cent of it could be made up of honey from Spain.

A 2023 study carried out for the European Commission showed that half of the honey imported into the EU is being marketed fraudulently as it is not pure and contains sugar syrups, with China the biggest culprit.

Pedro Loscertales, COAG beekeeping sector chief, said consumers needed better information. In the meantime, he said, ""buying directly from beekeepers is the best guarantee of authenticity and quality of honey"".

Spain is Europe's biggest honey producer with more than three million beehives, but Mr Delgado, the farmer, describes an industry on its last legs, reeling from the triple whammy of drought, disease borne by mites and a price squeeze.

Most of Spain's 36,000 beekeeping farmers are itinerant, moving their hives around the country on trucks to keep up with seasonal blooms.

""I think half of these traditional producers will fall by the wayside because their honey is sold by the barrel-load, with no special labelling, and they cannot compete with imports on price,"" Mr Delgado told The Telegraph.

The average cost of honey imported into the European Union is â‚¬2.32 (£2) per kilo, with the typical cost of production in Spain above â‚¬3 and rising due to inflation.

Prices paid barely change

After a series of dry years, production of honey in Spain has fallen by 30 per cent since 2018, and yet, Mr Delgado said, the prices being paid by distributors have barely changed.

Mr Delgado is attempting to reverse the industry tendency toward cheap blends, selling his organic honey in half-kilo jars at â‚¬8 each.

""Quality is what we have in Spain. The best thing I can leave my son is 100 customers who love our honey, rather than five tonnes of annual bulk production.""

The son of a family doctor, honey became Mr Delgado's passion by chance when his brother was given a hive as a present.

""I lifted the lid off and became totally fascinated just standing there looking at the complexity of it all. I was so lucky the bees were happy that day and didn't sting me; otherwise, that would have been the end of me and beekeeping.""

The ""˜blissful' tourist hotspot that has become the world's most polluted city

Chiang Mai attracts millions of travellers, but it is competing with megacities like Delhi and Shanghai for the world's worst air quality

On a good day, the views from the golden temple's ""˜mountain throne' are spectacular. But today is not a good day. 

Rather than a panoramic perspective of Chiang Mai, tourists and pilgrims making the trip to Wat Phra That Doi Suthep - one of the most sacred spots in northern Thailand - gaze down at a thick layer of smog. 

""The haze has been very bad this year,"" says Pat, a local taxi driver, as he navigates a winding mountain pass. ""I think now we have four seasons: summer, winter, rainy, and the haze.""

Each year, Chiang Mai attracts millions of backpackers and holiday-makers keen to soak up its laid-back atmosphere and explore the lush forests, mountain hikes and hillside villages nearby. The Lonely Planet describes it as a ""blissfully calm"" place to recharge. 

But in recent weeks the tourist hotspot, which is home to 120,000 people, has been competing with megacities including Dhaka, Delhi and Shanghai for an unexpected title: the world's worst air quality. 

And on Monday, for the second time this month, Chiang Mai topped the charts. 

""˜Burning season' 

According to IQAir, which produces an air quality index based on real-time readings from 100 cities internationally, Chiang Mai led the rankings with a ""very unhealthy"" 216 at noon - anything above 51 is worrying. At the same point Thailand's hectic capital, Bangkok, stood at 80, while in Britain, Birmingham was measured at 25 and London just eight. 

""In Chiang Mai, the haze is seasonal,"" said Prof Chaicharn Pothirat, a pulmonary consultant and professor of medicine at Chiang Mai University (CMU). ""But over the last 20 years, the intensity and duration has become worse and worse."" 

While a surge in traffic and industrial development is driving pollution in Bangkok, Chiang Mai and the surrounding region is hit every year by the ""˜burning season', which generally peaks in February and March across northern Thailand, Laos and Myanmar. 

Farmers - many working with major agribusinesses - use fire to clear land for the next sugarcane or rice crop cycle, while wildfires erupt in the dry forests, and some hunters burn to promote growth in certain areas. This makes it easier to track their prey, said Prasong Ranea, a retired hunter and farmer in Pa Tung Ngam, a village 60 miles north of Chiang Mai. 

""Even when the government imposes zero burning [rules], people continue,"" he told the Telegraph last week. ""Many have no other way, they can't afford machines or think it's the best way to hunt."" 

But experts are increasingly concerned about the health and economic consequences of the haze, and are urging political parties to change tact and put the environment at the forefront of their campaigns in Thailand's upcoming elections. 

""˜I tell my patients to leave'

""As a daily practitioner, I can see that health is deteriorating - especially in the last few years,"" says Prof Pothirat, in his cosy office at the Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital, where an air purifier is on at full pelt. 

""Most people cannot afford to relocate at this time of year, but I tell my patients who are foreigners or have relatives in the south to leave to protect themselves."" 

Most damaging for health is PM2.5, tiny particulate matter which has been linked to an increased risk of conditions including heart disease, strokes and lung cancer. 

On Monday lunchtime, the concentration of PM2.5 around Chiang Mai hit 183 micrograms per cubic metre - five times the level deemed safe by the World Health Organization. Prof Pothirat said the ""lung-breaking"" surge will be deadly for some. 

His research has found that every time the concentration of particulate matter PM2.5 jumps by 10µg/m³, there is a 1.6 per cent increase in non-accidental mortality in Chiang Mai. In Chiang Dao - just south of Pa Tung Ngam village and close to some of the most intense burning - excess deaths jumped by 3.5 per cent with every 10µg/m³ increase. 

A separate study from 2017 estimated a 20 per cent drop in air pollution could prevent up to a quarter of avoidable deaths each year across Thailand. Meanwhile, according to government figures, 200,000 people were admitted to hospital with pollution-related respiratory issues in the week concluding March 9, and more than 1.3 million so far this year. 

""We see more serious health problems in Chiang Mai at this time of year,"" Prof Pothirat says. ""But the government, politicians, they also have the idea that PM2.5 air pollution just comes temporarily, that it's a short term problem. And they underestimate the future health effects.

""Young, healthy people might notice fewer health impacts straight away, but PM2.5 increases inflammation, impairs lung function. In the next [few] years or in a decade, they'll be sicker than they would have been with clean air ""¦ it's taking time from their life expectancy."" 

""˜Bookings fell by 50 per cent'

There's also a strong business case to tackle pollution, added Dr Witsanu Attavanich - an environmental economist at Kasetsart University in Bangkok, and co-founder of the Thai Clean Air Network advocacy group.  

""Air pollution makes people get sick, and they then have to spend money on healthcare,"" Dr Attavanich says. ""But there's an opportunity cost too - businesses lose money when people stay at home to avoid the pollution, people can't work when they're unwell, productivity drops.""

He cited research estimating that in 2019, PM2.5 pollution alone cost Thai households 2.17 trillion baht - equal to around 11 per cent of gross domestic product. 

In Chiang Mai, there are mounting fears the city's smokey reputation will deter visitors. Earlier this month the president of Chiang Mai's Tourism Industrial Council, Pallop Saejiew, told the Bangkok Post that although widespread cancellations are yet to be reported, companies specialising in outdoor activities have seen reduced demand.

""At the start of March, it was a problem - tourists were not coming, I would say I had a 50 per cent drop in bookings,"" says Mr Tee, owner of Chiang Mai Tee Tours, perched in his booth on a sidestreet in the city's old town. ""I [have] worked in tourism for 30 years""¦ and I think tourists are becoming more aware of the pollution."" 

Still, some argue that the negative headlines are unfair, especially as the world's most polluted places do not always share data. Air quality sensors used internationally also vary, as do their placement, which could skew the measurements. 

""There's a perception Chiang Mai is an apocalyptic hellscape - it's not,"" says Dr Mark Ritchie, executive director of International Sustainable Development Studies Institute, based in the city. ""Overall Bangkok is much more polluted, it's only at this time of year that Chiang Mai has a lot of smoke - even then, it's gone when there are big storms.

""Air pollution is a national issue, not a Chiang Mai issue""¦ and the biggest problem in Thailand is not burning but traffic, industry, and massive urban development.""

""˜We're still suffering'

Still, few dispute that northern Thailand has a major problem, and public frustration is mounting. As a thick yellow haze engulfed Chiang Rai on Monday, a city three hours north of Chiang Mai, close to the border with Myanmar, protesters rallied outside the district office to call for more action. 

Experts, too, are frustrated at the slow progress tackling air quality under the current government - especially the failure to pass a Clean Air Bill in parliament, which is seeking to create a dedicated agency to tackle the problems and introduce higher taxes and penalties on major polluters. 

Many are also disappointed that no political party has chosen to put it at the forefront of their ongoing election campaigns, with Thailand set to go to the polls on May 14. 

""Politicians need to take more action,"" says Dr Somporn Chantara, head of the Environmental Science Research Unit at CMU. ""It might be said that the government has done a few good things, but it's clearly not been successful yet because we can all see that the pollution is still here. And we're all still suffering.""

Dr Chantara's team at CMU have been working with a network of partners on projects to mitigate the health ramifications of burning - including vending machines for free N95 masks on campus and the creation of ""˜green zones' fitted with air filters and purifiers at some nurseries and hospitals.

""I've always been worried about the impact on my son - when you breathe the haze, over time it accumulates. You can feel it,"" says Sunaree Khamlaa, a villager in Pa Tung Ngam, where the small kindergarten is dust free. ""So I was relieved, I hope it helps.""

CMU and other NGOs are also working with farmers to encourage alternatives to burning and use technology to better track fires so firefighters can rapidly respond, before fires become too large. 

But Prof Pothirat warned that the government's approach has been largely reactive, not proactive. Recently in Chiang Mai, for instance, local officials urged residents to avoid outdoor activities, temporarily closed several national parks due to fires, and handed out face masks because of the pollution threat. 

""They were trying to calm people down, but none of this solves the root causes of haze,"" he says, suggesting initiatives such as financial incentives for farmers who don't use fire should be expanded. 

""To really solve the problem, Thailand needs a bigger budget, tighter laws and more monitoring of the private sector,"" adds Dr Attavanich. ""And reducing the haze means also working with our neighbours. But we should not have to fight this hard to breathe.""

Elephants are a dream for safari lovers - but a nightmare for local farmers

A microbrewery in Botswana is creating a recipe to relieve tensions between people and pachyderms

As horizontal lightning darted across the sky on a cloud-covered evening in the Okavango Delta, we could just make out the lumpy shapes of elephants loitering on the track ahead. Our guide stopped the Land Cruiser as they came nearer and we sat motionless, transfixed. 

There were around 30 of them, some tentatively sniffing the night air with their periscope-like trunks, others protectively shuffling small shadows - their tiny calves - between their legs. Like gracious ghosts, they moved silently before they disappeared into the bush.

Botswana has the highest population of elephants on Earth: around 130,000 migrate along ancient trails around the world's largest inland delta, which spans some 6,000 square miles in full flood. 

There is something truly special about being in the presence of these pachyderms simply going about their daily lives - but not everyone would agree. What might be a dream sighting for safari lovers is the stuff of nightmares for local farmers living on the edge of poverty and trying to grow food for their families despite the onslaught of hungry elephants in harvest season.

But it seems the Okavango Craft Brewery (OCB) in Maun, the sleepy gateway town to the Delta, has found a recipe for relieving tensions between people and pachyderms. Their beers come with a distinctly feel-good flavour, simultaneously saving elephants and transforming farmers' lives.

On a hot, clammy afternoon a few days after that eerie elephant encounter, I downed a glass of chilled Delta Lager the colour of liquid gold in the bougainvillea-filled garden of the Taproom, OCB's pub beside the brewery. My husband, Will, had chosen a refreshing Panhandle Pale Ale, named after the remotest part of the Delta, and Graham McCulloch, the microbrewery's director, was enjoying a pint of Old Bull Stout. ""I grew up on Guinness,"" he said, with a distinct Dublin lilt, ""so I insisted we do an Irish stout!""

We could have chosen a Session IPA called Kingfisher, or The Matriarch, a powerful 6 per cent American Amber Ale. Or Mowana cider, the local name for the baobab tree. All the drinks have names linked to the area or its inhabitants: my favourite was the Mock Charge, a non-alcoholic beer created during Botswana's Covid ban on alcohol.

Another common factor in OCB's beers is that they are all made with millet. Yes, millet. It's an unusual ingredient in the brewing world, but the popular staple crop grows well in this semi-arid environment. Unfortunately, elephants like it too, especially when planted on their migratory paths where many farming plots are located. Therein lies the problem: when they share the same space and sustenance, the lives of both people and pachyderms are at risk.

""People get charged and sometimes killed, but you have to protect your field if you live in a landscape with elephants,"" Graham said. ""Yet there are solutions that can reduce conflict and reduce the killing of elephants but also generate a value in elephants. People will actually say: ""˜We want these elephants; don't shoot them because they have a value to us.'""

As well as co-founding OCB, Graham and his wife, conservation biologist Dr Anna Songhurst, established the NGO Ecoexist to foster coexistence between elephants and people. They spent 10 years undertaking research while living in the Eastern Panhandle region.

Ecoexist persuaded the authorities to move farming plots away from the migratory paths to safer field clusters of up to 800 hectares, often containing hundreds of plots. They taught 70 ""elephant aware"" farmers about sustainable practices that produce greater yields of millet from smaller areas, and about protecting their crops using solar electric and chilli fences (elephants hate chillies). 

All this involved more work for the farmers and, as an incentive, Graham wanted to create a new market that would pay a premium for their surplus millet. Northern Botswana's first microbrewery was born.

It had a rocky start, opening in 2019 just before the Covid lockdown. Strong local support kept it going and the Taproom pub opened in August 2021. We sipped our beers to a soundtrack of soothing reggae and the buzz of customers young and old, all enjoying the relaxed vibe. 

Its manager Jonathan Pierce, once a barman at a Wetherspoon pub in Leeds, gave us a tour of the brewery. Among all the shiny steel fermentation tanks, kegs and pipes stood a huge old wooden barrel full of rare 100 per cent millet beer.

This is its premium Marula Sour Ale, sold in wax-dipped champagne bottles. ""It's selling well,"" Graham said, ""and it tastes amazing!""

OCB's success is testament to the team's tenacity and commitment. Last year, they won two medals in the African Beer Cup, the largest beer competition on the continent. And their beers are now sold in hotels in Maun and Botswana's capital, Gaborone, in Kasane near Chobe National Park, and at safari camps across the Okavango.

Perhaps OCB's most important success, however, is that Ecoexist has trained another 200 farmers in elephant-aware practices, with more waiting eagerly in the wings. Although there are no safari camps or lodges in the farmers' remote localities, visitors can fly to their villages for new community tours set up with Ecoexist and Maun-based Helicopter Horizons. 

""The easiest way is to helicopter guests in,"" Graham explained. ""This means we can connect more communities to tourism and bring more benefits into the villages as a direct reward for coexisting with elephants.""

Back in the Taproom after our brewery tour, Will and I felt it only right that we should celebrate this situation with another drink. Just by buying a beer, we were buying into conservation. We raised our glasses to the farmers reaping their rewards for saving the elephants of the Okavango.

Essentials

The Okavango Craft Brewery offers tours, including a tasting of four beers, for $25 (£21).

Helicopter Horizon Tours offers a scenic and beer-tasting flight from $295pp and a Conservation & Co-existence Cultural Experience tour that includes a guided visit to a village supported by Ecoexist for $1,070pp.

OCB's craft beers can be enjoyed at Xigera Camp, Wilderness's DumaTau, Vumbura and Mombo, and camps in Khwai Private Reserve. Many hotels and lodges in Maun serve their beers, including Desert & Delta's Sedia Hotel from $78pp B&B

Putin has debased and exiled Russia's own geniuses

Technical brains are being devoted to death and destruction

Is it unpatriotic to work in technology? It could well be, a gathering of Russian software developers, entrepreneurs and officials was warned by the country's top internet official. 

""If you want to harm the country, invest in training IT specialists in the Russian Federation. You can't harm Russia more,"" Dmitry Marinichev told a Civic Chamber event in October 2015.

As Putin's tanks rumbled towards Kyiv 18 months ago, one of Russia's most valuable assets began to wish it was somewhere else. 

Officially the state made efforts to keep technology workers inside the Federation, and many IT employees were halted at the borders. But many made it through, and this exodus accelerated with Putin's draft last autumn. 

According to official government figures, around 100,000 employees in technology emigrated in 2022 - some 10pc of the total workforce. But really, that trend had been underway for some years, thanks to the policy that Mr Marinichev was articulating in 2015. Yet to erase any doubts, he doubled down.

""First an army comes on a territory, then merchants, and then there is state power and a market. It's only that way, and no other way,"" he told Novaya Gazeta, the independent newspaper that shut down soon after the invasion of Ukraine. 

""Therefore if at a government level we choose the regimen of ""˜Russia against all', then we will have no chance to sell our products and technologies except by conducting geopolitical expansion in the world."" In which case, Marinichev explained, why bother developing a tech sector?

""Preparing IT specialists for foreign-based technologies is essentially to undermine Russia's sovereignty,"" he said.

By then it wasn't something that Marinichev himself, a technology entrepreneur and advocate, sounded particularly keen on. But the direction of travel was set: Russia was turning away from global markets, and becoming an autarky.

A third of Russia's GDP growth between 2015 and 2021 came from the tech sector, some $47.8bn. The latest sanctions are far more severe than those that followed Putin's invasion of Crimea. 

Today Russia is cut out of global supply chains and financial markets. Putin has been obliged to move closer to China, leading to a wide-ranging Sino-Russian science and technology pact. And in this endeavour, Russia now finds itself very much the junior partner.

Perhaps the biggest blow is to Russian technologists own self-esteem. From Russian-born executives and venture capitalists to aspiring developers still in school, Russians pride themselves on being able to get along with anyone, pretty much anywhere. The country has a rich history of valuing its technologists and scientists highly; in the Soviet era, boffins and engineers were heroes.

Russian universities still turn out world class physics, engineering and maths graduates, and Russian developers have a global reputation as reliable and inventive problem-solvers. But technology is heavily dependent on human capital, and today, all that employees need for the day job goes in their carry-on luggage.

In recent years, this has created a growing diaspora, one documented in a fascinating ethnographic study by authors Mario Biagioli and Vincent Antonin LÃ©pinay, From Russia With Code. From over 300 interviews with technology workers, inside and outside Russia, what emerges are fiercely independent technology professionals and communities who seek to navigate their way out of a risky business environment.

""Connections were being built with Western businesses,"" says one digital entrepreneur with teams across Europe. ""The evolution of digital services generally made it much easier to export business norms and law effectively."" But state gangsterism was ever-present. ""When you're sitting on their money it's a different relationship - they want to get paid.""

And after Putin's ""special military operation"", technology workers could no longer view the regime as a temporary aberration that could be endured. The autarky was now permanent.

Yandex is Russia's biggest digital company and one of the few in the world to have fended off the Google search monopoly, and on merit. It's now a giant, offering services ranging from food delivery to transport. 

Once described as a nation within a nation, Yandex independence has diminished, and around a sixth of its workforce has emigrated, according to some estimates.

Among the beneficiaries of the tech exodus are Georgia, Bulgaria and Serbia, all boasting cosmopolitan capital cities that welcome younger software developers. But the biggest beneficiary of all has been Israel. In the old Soviet Union, engineering was one of the careers most open to Jews - Government work was not available - and 40pc of engineers were women. 

The first post-Soviet waves of migration transformed the Israeli economy, and Russians were followed by Ukrainians. Tens of thousands more have followed since the invasion of Ukraine. 

Israel not only offered citizenship, but employers took risks too, allowing them to learn on the job. Last year, Yandex co-founder Arkady Volozh, a billionaire before Yandex's stock price crashed, became a citizen.

Russian technical ingenuity is evident on the battlefield, as its engineering talent is bent to the dark arts of cyber warfare and electronic sabotage. Note how talk of wars fought largely by drones has diminished a little recently; a report this May by the Royal United Services Institute said Ukraine was losing 10,000 drone a month to crude and clever countermeasures. 

An army of a million robots can be disabled at a keystroke, exploiting a bug left by sloppy code.

It's a tragedy for Russia that its best technical brains are devoted to death and destruction, and not building businesses for the future, like Yandex.

Small mammals ""˜disappearing before our eyes', warns report

State of Nature says all species declined by 19pc in UK and 40pc of bird species threatened with extinction

Harvest mice and field voles are ""disappearing before our eyes"", warn the authors of a new report that finds one in six UK species are at risk of extinction.

Among those at greatest risk are harvest mice and field voles, which are particularly threatened by intensive agriculture, said authors of the latest State of Nature report.

Overall, all species have declined by 19 per cent since monitoring began in 1970, according to the latest State of Nature report.

Birds are at greatest risk, with more than 40 per cent threatened with extinction, as well as around a third of amphibians and reptiles, and more than a quarter of fungi, lichen and terrestrial mammals.

The report, led by the RSPB and backed by over 60 research and conservation organisations, is an update to a 2019 study and examined more than 10,000 species and their habitats, relying on volunteer sightings.

""Small mammals that are just disappearing in front of our eyes, because at very large scales, we've been losing the habitats that they depend on. They're really the cogs of the ecosystems,"" said Fiona Mathews, professor of environmental biology at the University of Sussex. ""Things like harvest mouse, or field voles, lots of the small furry things that nobody ever notices, but they are ecosystem engineers.""

She said the figures raised doubts over whether the Government's legal target to halt species decline by 2030 would be met.

""It's all very good to set targets,"" she said ""The challenge is to make sure that it's not just a number picked out of the air, but it's actually followed up with action.""

The report came as the Government confirmed a delay to a scheme for housebuilders to offset their impact on nature that was due to start in November.

The biodiversity net gain scheme will be delayed until January, after housebuilders complained they had not been given enough clarity on how the scheme would operate.

Craig Bennett, chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts, said: ""The State of Nature report is a stark reminder that politicians must not let nature drop down the agenda - there is far too much at stake.

""We desperately need better policies that properly fund nature-friendly farming, end the poisoning of lakes and rivers, and create larger wild and more natural areas - including in towns and cities.""

The report's authors said human activity was to blame for depleting more than half of the UK's biodiversity, and found that only one in seven wildlife habitats were in a good condition.

They called for more nature friendly farming, including a reduction in pesticide use, the reintroduction of beavers and the restoration of habitats such as peatlands.

Richard Gregory from the RSPB said reducing meat and dairy consumption would help boost biodiversity.

""Independent evidence talks about the need to reduce meat consumption and dairy consumption, because there's strong independent evidence to show that these two things are having quite a negative impact on biodiversity locally and globally,"" he said.

National parks

A new poll has found that more than 70 per cent of British people think the country's national parks should be used to provide habitats for wildlife, rather than prioritising food production.

A majority of the public, 53 per cent, also support a reduction in grazing on national park land where it is causing a reduction in local wildlife, according to YouGov polling for Green Alliance, an environment think tank.

The Government is currently considering changes to the management of Dartmoor, which could set a precedent for the reduction in the numbers of livestock on other national parks.

Responding to the report, ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey, the Environment Secretary, said the Government was ""committed to increasing the amount of habitat for nature to thrive"".

The invisible killer haunting Laos 50 years after the Vietnam War

US officials including Kissinger approved a relentless bombing campaign in Laos. The legacy remains deadly in the munitions-strewn country

At first glance, the scene is unremarkable: women in wide-brimmed hats are dotted across a rice paddy field nestled in the Laotian mountains, toiling under the relentless sun.

But instead of sickles, the women are carrying heavy metal detectors. Their buckets aren't full of the staple crop, but scraps long buried in the ground. And at the edge of the plot, an ominous sign with red skulls screams ""DANGER"".

At this site just outside the tiny village of Sop Hun, decontamination technicians are meticulously clearing up the legacy of a ""secret war"" so intense it earned Laos - then home to fewer than three million people - the grim status of the world's most bombed nation per capita.

Between 1964 and 1973, as the US attempted to suppress communism in southeast Asia and cut off North Vietnam's supply lines, American pilots unleashed more than two million tonnes of ordnance on this landlocked county in 580,000 attack sorties. On average, a planeload of bombs was dropped on Laos every eight minutes for almost a decade.

""The bombing was constant, people used to hide in caves underground to survive it,"" says Khamsone Laomany, a war veteran who fought with the Americans. Lying on the floor beside him is his prosthetic - 53 years ago, the 78-year-old lost his right leg when he collided with an undetonated explosive as he was racing across the mountains to escape enemy fire.

Though brutal, incidents like this are expected during war but in Laos, they never stopped. Since the Paris Peace Accords were signed 50 years ago at least 25,000 people, half of them children, have been killed or injured by unexploded bombs - including 63 in 2021 alone.

Many of these accidents have involved cluster munitions, a controversial weapon now banned in more than 120 countries yet - to Laos' disbelief - currently deployed by both sides in Ukraine.

These bombs are indiscriminate; they break apart mid-air and scatter hundreds of smaller submunitions, known here as ""bombies"", across a wide area. And while they're meant to detonate on impact, the ""dud rate"" is high: up to 30 per cent of the 270 million dropped on Laos never exploded.

Instead they are littered, dormant but deadly, across huge swatches of the country - remnants of a long-forgotten ""shadow war"" that ended five decades ago, but continues to stymie development and turn daily activities into a ""game of Russian roulette"". Ukraine, people here say, should take note - Laos may offer a glimpse of the European nation's future.

""We're still affected by the conflict, people still have difficulty surviving after all this time,"" says Ket, a section commander for the NGO Humanity and Inclusion (HI) in Phongsaly, the northernmost province tucked between China and Vietnam.

""It used to make me angry, but now I think anger is not a positive thing,"" adds the softly spoken 30-year-old, known only by her first name. ""I would like to bring to the power countries and leaders: think of the impacts of war, especially the impacts of cluster munitions. I don't want to see this happen again. Please, see Laos as a case study and stop.""

Later that day, Ket slips into the bright blue blast suit and heads back out to set the fuses. After some six hours methodically combing the rice paddy field for ""war trash"", the team of eight - including seven women - has uncovered two Blu 26 submunitions and a 20mm artillery bullet.

Now it's time to blow them up.

""This is the most challenging part of my day,"" says Ket. ""If I did some small mistake, I might kill myself as well. It's high risk for me, but I think it is part of my duty.""

Ket was compelled to join HI by personal experience; a neighbour was killed while farming at a plot near her home in neighbouring Hampheung province. Most here have similar stories. The team leader's father was injured by UXO when she was four - he was lucky to escape with his eyesight - while the field medic's friend had both her legs amputated after a blast.

""Of course my family worry that this job isn't safe,"" says Ket. ""They ask, can't you do something with less risk? But I tell them just living in Laos is a risk. I'm proud of my tasks here, that I am a person to help clear the UXOs and make this land safe. Accidents are too common.""

As Ket readies the ignition to detonate the munitions in-situ, the rest of the team fan out around a 300 metre radius to ensure the site is clear and warn the nearby school - children's laughter fades away as pupils are told to return indoors. Soon, everything is set.

""Haa, sii, sam, song, nung,"" a man shouts, counting down from five to one before deep, powerful blasts puncture the peace and reverberate around the valley with surprising force. Two plumes of thick smoke seep into the air above the spots the bombies once laid, hidden for decades under layers of soil.

It's hard to know how many of these cluster munitions remain scattered across Laos, though estimates suggest just 10 per cent of some 80 million left when the war finished have been cleared. In 2019, the US Congressional Research Service said it could take at least another 100 years to decontaminate the country.

""The most horrific thing about this is the amount of bombs dropped ""¦ and the amount of war trash left, which people have to figure out a way to live with,"" says Sera Koulabdara, the chief executive of the advocacy group Legacies of War. Now based in the US, her family left Laos when she was six after a school friend lost her leg in an incident outside their home.

""It's not just about the tragic fatalities and injuries, the land has been held hostage,"" she adds. ""Laos has a highly agricultural economy - but how do you expect the people to move forward, the economy to move forward, when dealing with this situation? Lots of the challenges [Laos] faces today come from the legacy of war, the chaos left behind.""

Clearing this land is a slow, repetitive process which got off to a slow start. Nationwide, bomb clearance organisations eventually launched operations from 1994; North Vietnam's communist allies Pathet Lao took control after the war, and for two decades the nation was largely isolated from the wider world.

But in Phongsaly, it was only last year that work to rid the region of UXOs began, part of a government-led strategy to map contamination levels nationwide and redistribute resources.

Despite being a Pathet Lao stronghold, the province was not as heavily bombed as contested central or southern Laos. But Route Four - a winding road that snakes through forested mountain peaks - was a strategically important supply chain and access point for the North Vietnamese army, making it a regular target for the US Air Force.

""The northern provinces have been less invested in, just because of the scope of the contamination elsewhere and limited resources,"" says Alexandra Letcher, a regional Armed Violence Reduction Specialist with HI, an organisation that has launched awareness, rehabilitation and decontamination programmes across Phongsaly.

""But since we started here, we've found everything from huge aircraft bombs - their size is just really incredible - to bombies, which are most common.""

The lack of clearance operations until now has forced locals to live and work alongside these explosives for decades, even in places known to be contaminated.

Roughly 30 years ago, Bounsuly Soulinthong's little brother Samly was one of three children who died in a blast while foraging for sweet potatoes on a hillside above Khoua - a small village on the Nam Ou river, an hour southwest of Sop Hun.

""The scraps hit my brother in the head. I saw him as they rushed him to get help, the side of his face was completely blackened from the explosion,"" says Mr Soulinthong. Samly died not long after he reached the hospital; he was only seven years old.

""Everyone used to say we looked quite similar,"" adds Mr Soulinthong. ""I often think about what he'd look like now, and what his life might have been like - especially now my daughters are his age ""¦ I've told them they never can go to the hills near here.""

Many have adopted this approach, with development projects abandoned and farmland avoided due to UXOs. But this has not been an option for others, including Bouaphai Boutsady. The steep plot where Samly died is her only land, farming her only income.

For three decades she's still grown vegetables and rubber trees there, developing ad hoc strategies in the hope of reducing her risk - all for a yearly income equivalent to £800.

""Of course the accident is in my mind still when I worked on my land, but what choice do I have? I just try to be careful - I dig softly and slowly and not too deep,"" she says. ""But I need to eat, I need to provide for my family.""

Somehow, and despite spotting several more UXOs, the 63-year-old has had no accidents. And now she never will: her half hectare plot was among the first to be cleared when HI arrived last year.

With contamination so widespread and the region's steep peaks making work laborious and slow, the NGO works with the government to prioritise clearance sites - farmland, areas near schools or health clinics, and sites earmarked for development are top of the list.

""I no longer have fear when I go to my land,"" says Ms Boutsady. ""It is strange not to feel that emotion there anymore. It was like anything could happen to anyone at any time - the bombies had a huge impact on every part of our lives.

""I don't know if the people who dropped them realised the impact would last to the next generation? But they should know now. People in power, people who create war, I would encourage them to look and see that bombies kill people, kill villages, for a long time.""

This sentiment is widespread across Laos; almost everyone The Telegraph spoke to said they struggle to comprehend why cluster munitions, which have caused so much harm here for so long, are still being deployed elsewhere.

In recent decades, Laos has been increasingly vocal about this issue on the international stage, and played a major role in the creation of the Convention on Cluster Munitions in 2008.

More than 120 countries have since joined this international treaty, including the UK, but there are notable absences - including Russia, Ukraine and the US. As the fighting continues in Europe, all three have been involved in their use.

""As the world's largest victim of cluster munitions""¦ [Laos] expresses its profound concern over the announcement and possible use of cluster munitions,"" the Foreign Ministry said in July, when reports that America would send several shipments to Ukraine first emerged.

""[Laos] calls upon any state or actor to refrain from all use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions as prescribed in the Convention on Cluster Munitions, so that no one in the world would be victimised by such [a] heinous weapon.""

The US has since sent three shipments to Ukraine, with the White House arguing that while it recognises the risks for civilians, the threat to Ukrainian people if Russia gains more territory is ""intolerable"".

""I'm really trying to inspire my country, the USA, to adopt a more humane policy,"" says Ms Koulabdara. ""The reason we're so against it is obvious, we need to learn from history, learn from our last use in Laos.

""But we also know that these weapons will eventually harm Ukrainian men women and children, potentially for decades ""¦ Because of their indiscriminate nature, these weapons should be treated in the same way as chemical weapons.""

For Mary Wareham, advocacy director of the Arms Division at Human Rights Watch, the US transfer demonstrates the importance of destroying stockpiles - ""if countries have them, they'll use them"". And because many of the cluster munitions being sent are relatively old, it's not clear what the ""dud rate"" will be.

""The US transfer does also bring into question the emerging norm, stigmatising any use by any actor under any circumstance,"" she says. ""The US is basically saying this is a special case and nothing else will work ""¦ that chips away at the norm everybody's been trying so hard to put in place over the last 15 years.""

Back in Sop Hun, three boys kick a ball around a dusty clearing in front of the village hall. As darkness descends the boys, sporting Manchester City and Paris Saint Germain football shirts, pause to talk to the Telegraph. Have they ever come across a bombie?

""I saw one by the river and picked it up,"" says 12-year-old Anaithap, gesturing down the slope behind the concrete building. ""When I told my parents they were so angry, they kept saying I was so lucky to be alive still. But I didn't know it was a UXO, it looked like a pÃ©tanque ball.""

Later, as the decontamination team shares dinner and Beer Lao at a long table in the village hall - their makeshift home while they work in the nearby fields - they explain this confusion is common.

PÃ©tanque, a game similar to boules, has been popular here since the French introduced it in the former colony. But children often see the round, metal cluster munitions and mistake them for lost pÃ©tanque balls.

""Many children pick up bombies thinking they're toys, we hear this a lot,"" says Ket. It's why awareness and education programmes are as important as the land clearance operations, she adds.

But there are concerns that some of these projects are under threat; in recent few months, HI has had to downsize its teams in Hampheung due to financial constraints.

""It's been very, very difficult [to raise funds],"" said Ms Letcher. ""It's tough when you come to the end of a project and there's no visibility on other funding, we have no option but to scale down operations. Hopefully, hopefully, we can find something soon.""

HI is the only organisation operating in Laos that does not currently receive US funding, which has been steadily increasing since Barack Obama became the first sitting President to visit the country in 2016.

Still, aid to clean up the UXOs pales in comparison to the cost of the bombardment - in 2023 dollars, the US spent $16 million every day bombing Laos for nine years. According to Legacies of War, funding to decontaminate now stands at just $45 million per year.

""The bombs that were dropped on Laos ""¦ are American bombs,"" says Ms Koulabdara. ""So from my perspective, this should be a top priority and funding should be guaranteed until we get the job done.""

But as the decontamination team refills their glasses and tuck into plates of sticky rice and larb salad, they admit they're unsure if Laos can ever truly be free.

""I think we have to try for the next generation, but I don't know, there are so many""¦"" says Ket, shaking her head instead of finishing the sentence. ""It's just a very big task.""

South Sudan battles a four-year flood

Unrelenting rain is keeping rivers and wetlands at record highs throughout the year, with devastating consequences

In South Sudan, the dry season won't come. The country is battling its fourth year of historic flooding, impacting one million citizens and submerging entire villages in its wake. 

While flooding is not unusual in the east African country, the current scale and ferocity is. 

""We are technically entering the dry season now, but water levels have increased again. The water extent seems to have increased by 3,000 kilometres in the past week - it is out of the ordinary,"" said Charlotte Hallqvist, a UNHCR spokesperson speaking from the country's capital Juba. 

""The water from the previous floods is not disappearing before the next rains come down,"" she added.

December to February are typically the driest months for the landlocked nation, where the rivers subside and the Sudd wetlands air out. 

According to NASA, the unrelenting rains in recent years is causing rivers and wetlands to remain at record highs throughout the year.

""It's a chronically understudied region,"" said Dr Liz Stephens, professor in climate risks and resilience at the University of Reading. She explained that the flooding is as a result of the rain that falls upstream in the basin, not locally. 

""It will certainly take years for the floods from 2021 to recede, because the land is disconnected from the main river, so floodwaters have to evaporate rather than drain away,"" Dr Stephens said.

Emergency meetings were held last week to assess the water levels. 

A total of about 47,700 km² of land now appears to be under water, the UN said. 

""There is no sign of the water receding. We are seeing a permanent climate change, permanent climate displacements,"" Ms Hallqvist added.

The fallout of the multi-year flood has been - and continues to be - disastrous. 

Mothers spend the bulk of their day scavenging for water lily bulbs to feed their children, while elderly couples stand waist-deep in the swamps trying to rebuild their dikes. 

Drone footage shows the occasional roof of a house, crowns of Acacia trees, or snippets of road. The economic damage is estimated to be on the order of £542 million.

""It looks like the sea but you can see the tops of people's homes,"" said Ms Hallqvist.

Crops are being wasted, and livestock is dying - a tragedy for a country where 63 per cent are living in an emergency level of food insecurity.

An estimated 1.4 million children face malnourishment, and 2.9 million are on the brink of starvation. These figures have surpassed levels seen in 2013 and 2016, during the country's brutal five-year civil war. 

Across the country, thousands of people are being forced to move, perhaps permanently, from their traditional lands. Such a huge movement of tension is a tinder box for already fractious tensions.

""South Sudan is already fragile and insecure, and ethnic tensions are on the rise,"" said Ms Hallqvist. ""We are seeing traditional pastoralists can no longer use their lands and are moving into other lands, occupied by other sedentary communities. And that is causing conflict.""

The country is still reeling from a conflict which left nearly 400,000 people dead. The peace deal signed in 2018 has done little to stop endemic violence, and now some villagers have become trapped by new water borders - unable to flee outbreaks of fighting. 

Meanwhile, a total of two million people are displaced internally, and a further 2.2 million are displaced in neighbouring nations. 

Some of the refugee camps have been cut off by water, too, with boats driven by charity workers the only way in and out.

""One displacement camp basically looks like an island, surrounded by water, and only protected by these dikes,"" said Ms Hallqist. ""There is no road in or out.""

According to MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res, the stagnant water has also contributed to a rise of malaria and water-borne illnesses, and more frequent snake bites.

""It is important to ensure that wastewater systems in internal displacement camps are, as much as possible, resilient to flooding, because when these are impacted the incidence of water-borne diseases increases,"" Dr Stephens said.

Locals are working to establish new ways of living and incomes. 

In Warrap State, small-scale farmers have started turning the floodplains engulfing their village into rice fields. Women in Unity State are taking part in a local initiative to make cooking fuel out of invasive water hyacinth weeds as an alternative to charcoal and firewood.

But Dr Stephens said there are no simple solutions to flooding in a country where the vulnerability of the population is driven largely by ongoing conflict.

Meanwhile, the United Nations Refugee Agency said the country's crisis has been ""forgotten"" and remains one of its most underfunded. 

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has predicted that South Sudan's floods will only worsen with rising temperatures. However, Dr Stephens noted that there isn't a great deal of understanding on how the country is affected by climate change yet, and that similar scale flooding happened in the 1960s.

Peter Caton's exhibition will be at the Oxo Gallery February 8-19.

Supermarkets begin rationing fruit and vegetables

Key moments

Chosen by us to get you up to speed at a glance

Fresh fruit and vegetables are being rationed at two of Britain's biggest supermarkets after poor foreign harvests and a domestic farming crisis led to shortages expected to last for weeks.

Asda and Morrisons are restricting how many tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce and peppers customers are allowed to buy following the squeeze on supplies. 

Asda is limiting shoppers to a maximum of three items each across tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, lettuce, salad bags, broccoli, cauliflowers, and raspberries.

From Wednesday, Morrisons will only allow customers to buy a maximum of two each of tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, and peppers.

Neither supermarket has said how long it intends to keep restrictions in place, but a spokesman for the British Retail Consortium (BRC) warned that disruption is likely for a few weeks.

The issues come after the amount of fresh produce coming from Spain and north Africa tumbled owing to a poor harvest from flooding and cold temperatures.

Meanwhile, farmers in the UK said that high energy prices mean domestic producers have not sown enough to fill the gap.

Imports are critical to keeping supermarkets stocked during the winter and spring, when Britain typically produces just 5pc of its own tomatoes and 10pc of its lettuces, and ships the rest from overseas. Moroccan authorities have also moved to block some exports of tomatoes, onions and potatoes because of fears over the country's own food security.

British growers today lashed out at a lack of foresight from supermarkets, which they said had become overly reliant on overseas suppliers.

Jack Ward, head of the British Growers Association, said that rationing was predictable after months of squeezing UK suppliers, whose payments for produce have not gone up as much as their costs.

He said: ""If the retailers weren't prepared to say to growers, 'we'll support you, we'll give you the price that you need', then the crops didn't go in the ground.

""There is just this determination to sell vegetables at lower and lower costs, without really worrying about the long term sustainability and this is finally coming home to roost.""

Mr Ward said similar issues with supply were likely to occur ""time and time again"" without making the UK supply chain more resilient.

He added: ""We've been lulled into a false sense of security, that there will always be somewhere in the world that can deliver, the supply chain has done a fantastic job of finding somebody somewhere around the world that can supply. And we've come to the end of the road in that regard.""

The Lea Valley Growers Association, whose members produce about three-quarters of Britain's cucumber and sweet pepper crop, said normally UK salad vegetables would begin appearing on shelves at this time of year, but that glasshouses had been left empty.

Lee Stiles, who heads up the association, said: ""If the supermarkets had supported growers with an additional cost price increase, they would have planted.""

The current issues with supply are expected to continue for some time. Andrew Opie, of the BRC, said: ""While disruption is expected to last a few weeks, supermarkets are adept at managing supply chain issues and are working with farmers to ensure that customers are able to access a wide range of fresh produce.""

The Government, meanwhile, came under fire on Tuesday for failing to protect UK farmers from rising energy costs. The National Farmers' Union said Royal botanic gardens such as Kew were better protected from rising energy costs than vegetable growers.

Minnette Batters, the organisation's president, said that a government scheme unveiled at the start of the year to help companies cope with their bills does not cover any ""farming or growing"" businesses.

She said the ""seemingly ridiculous"" situation meant food for British families was currently unprotected while businesses such as stationery manufacturers were supported.

Ms Batters said that ""without doubt"" there would be more empty shelves in supermarkets in the coming months without government support.

The production of salad ingredients such as tomatoes and cucumbers is expected to fall to the lowest level since records began in 1985, she added.

The Energy Bills Discount Scheme, unveiled in January, allows eligible businesses and non-domestic energy users to receive a discount on high energy bills until 31 March 2024.

Eligible businesses on the list include ""Botanical and zoological gardens and nature reserve activities"" and those that ""manufacture of paper stationery"".

While dairy and milk farmers are also given support under the scheme, vegetable producers have been left out.

Gen Z drives surge in female entrepreneurs

Gen Z has driven a surge in the number of women starting companies, according to a government-backed review of female entrepreneurship.

Senior technology reporter Matthew Field has the story:

A report by Dame Alison Rose, the chief executive of NatWest, for the Treasury, found more than 150,000 new companies were created by women across the UK last year.

Young entrepreneurs led the spike in new companies, with a leap of almost a quarter in the number of new businesses being started by under 25s.

The Rose Review found the number of companies led by all-female founding teams was 151,603 in 2022, according to the latest study, up from 145,271 in 2021 and 56,269 in 2018, when the review was first launched.

Gen Z female founders were behind nearly 17,500 new businesses, the report found, compared to just 785 at the time of the first Rose Review.

Dame Alison said: ""It's a testament to the resilience and entrepreneurialism of female founders that they are creating more companies than ever before.""

Kevin Hollinrake, the small business minister, said: ""Seeing the number of businesses started by 16 to 25-year-olds increase by a quarter reaffirms the UK as a place of opportunity for all.""

The latest review found that one fifth of all new company incorporations were entirely led by female founding teams, compared to 16pc in 2018.

The Rose Review also announced new plans to provide three million places to female entrepreneurs on courses, compared to 800,000 last year.

Dame Alison said: ""In the coming year we will continue to provide fresh initiatives offering mentorship, guidance and inspiration for founders, alongside securing new commitments from financial services institutions to make it easier for female-led companies to access vital capital.""

The report added that 190 financial services groups had now signed up to the Investing in Women code, representing £1 trillion in assets under management, which requires they report data on female investing.

While the number of female led start-ups has increased, female entrepreneurs still suffer from a steep funding gap compared to male-led businesses.

A report from the Female Founders Forum, published in November, found just 16pc of equity financing went to companies with at least one female founder.

The amount of venture funding going to all-female teams, meanwhile, was around 6p in every £1.   

Spotify's top podcast exec departs amid restructuring

Senior podcast exec Max Cutler is leaving Spotify, as the company restructures its podcast operation as part of cost-cutting measures. 

His departure comes less than a month after Dawn Ostroff, who oversaw content and advertising, Bloomberg News reported. 

Cutler, who founded a podcasting business acquired by Spotify, oversaw the platform's deals and partnerships with major podcast creators, like Joe Rogan, Emma Chamberlain and Alex Cooper of Call Her Daddy.

Paperchase to make 900 workers redundant

Paperchase's remaining stores will close within weeks, resulting in around 900 redundancies.

The administrators of Paperchase confirmed that 106 high street shops will close after they failed to locate an interested buyer for the remaining business. 

It comes after Tesco stepped in and bought the Paperchase brand last month, just as the struggling stationery chain collapsed into administration. The deal did not include Paperchase's stores. 

The retailer, founded in 1968 by two art students, previously hired auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers and administrators from Begbies Traynor, the professional services firm, to lead the sales process and advise on the company's options. 

However, the auditors have now confirmed that the remaining shops will begin closing within weeks as their stock levels reduce. Paperchase's online store ceased trading last Friday.

Hunt: Energy budget surplus won't benefit UK public finances

Falling energy prices won't benefit the UK's public finances despite lowering the costs of household utility bills, according to Jeremy Hunt.

The projected decline in the cost of the government's Energy Price Guarantee is balanced by a fall in revenues from a tax on oil and gas company profits

""We don't have that windfall,"" Hunt said today. ""The net difference is marginal.""

It comes after The Telegraph reported that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been handed an £11bn windfall ahead of his spending review after experts predicted the ""worst phase"" of the European energy crisis had passed.

In a timely boost ahead of the Spring Statement in March, the Chancellor gained extra financial firepower thanks to the shrinking cost of the Energy Price Guarantee.

Gas prices have plummeted since the guarantee was launched, dramatically cutting how much the Government must pay to keep household energy bills down.

However, the suprise budget surplus didn't represent a ""recurrent"" improvement in the national finances, Mr Hunt said today.

FTSE 100 closes below 8,000

Still, the internationally-focused index has slightly recovered from being dragged below 8,000 points in early trading after HSBC dampened investors' expectations of a sustained income bonanza from rising interest rates worldwide. It's lowest point today was 7,952.48

The FTSE 250 also slumped 1.23pc to 19,850.85.

Hunt: US green subsidies are a ""very real competitive threat""

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt has described the United States' Inflation Reduction Act, which pledges hundreds of billions of dollars of subsidies for new clean energy projects which cut greenhouse gas emissions, as a ""very real competitive threat"".

Speaking at a green energy conference in London, Mr Hunt said: ""This is not a time when it's going to be easy for us to access the GDP equivalent of $369 billion.""

He continued:

We have to remember in that equation that the U.S. is somewhat coming from behind, because the previous president was not remotely interested in net zero...

So there is some catch-up element in what the U.S. is doing, but it is a very real competitive threat.

US economy remains resilient, data indicates

The sweeping declines on Wall Street markets today comes as US business activity steadied in February, according to closely watched data.

The S&P Global flash February composite purchasing managers index climbed 3.4 points to 50.2, as the service sector regained its footing, suggesting a resilient economy that is keeping some pricing power intact.

While the gauge is the highest in eight months, it is barely above the 50 level that separates growing and shrinking activity.

The group's composite measure of employment at manufacturers and service providers rose to a five-month high, indicating still-solid demand for labour. 

While growth in input costs eased, the index of prices received climbed to a four-month high.

Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: ""The survey data underscore how the upward driving force on inflation has now shifted to wages amid the tight labor market.""

Such sustained wage pressures may encourage Federal Reserve officials to consider additional interest-rate increases and keep higher borrowing costs in place for longer, which has spooked markets.

Ofgem launches investigation in British Gas

Ofgem has announced a ""comprehensive, independent and wide-ranging review"" into British Gas after its subcontractors were revealed to be breaking into homes to fit prepayment meters.

The investigation into British Gas will examine whether the firm had taken all steps required under its licence to help domestic customers with debt before installing a prepayment meter or disconnecting them.

It will also look at whether British Gas and anyone working for the supplier assessed if a customer's ""mental capacity and/or psychological state is such that installation of a prepayment meter would be severely traumatic to a customer and make their condition significantly worse"".

Further, it will investigate if those working on fitting meters for British Gas had the necessary skills - including the ability to assess the mental capacity and psychological state of the customer on the doorstep - and was ""fit and proper"" to enter customers' homes.

A British Gas spokesman said: ""The allegations around our third-party contractor Arvato are unacceptable and we immediately suspended their warrant activity.""

Wallmart and Home Depot drag down US markets

Wall Street stocks fell early following mixed results from Walmart and Home Depot as concerns about higher interest rates continued to weigh on markets.

Both retail giants, also listed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, were lower after offering lacklustre forecasts for the coming year.

Walmart alluded to consumer inflation as a drag while it forecast much slower revenue growth, while Home Depot expects flat sales in its fiscal year of 2023.

Analysts are also watching Treasury bond yields, seen as a proxy for US interest rate policies, which remain upward-bound as investors prepare for more Federal Reserve rate increases.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.3pc to 33,397.44. The broad-based S&P 500 shed 1.2pc to 4,031.11, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 1.5pc to 11,614.55.

Tuesday marks the resumption of trading after markets were closed on Monday in observance of Presidents' Day.

Fruit and veg crunch caused by seasonal reliance on imports

Supermarkets are facing a particular crunch in supplies of tomatoes and lettuce due to the UK's heavy reliance on imports from the EU at this time of year.

Retail editor Hannah Boland has this analysis:

Industry figures suggest that in March, only 5pc of tomatoes sold in UK supermarkets come from farms across Britain, with the bulk - 85pc - sourced from the EU, and the remaining 10pc from the rest of the world. 

It is a similar picture for lettuces at this time of year, with one in every ten lettuce grown in Britain and the other 90pc from EU farms. 

However, the picture flips in the summer months, with British tomatoes accounting for 60pc of those sold in supermarkets by June and 95pc of lettuces having been grown in the UK. 

This is why industry chiefs are hopeful that the supply issues will not last months, but instead will run for the next few weeks, until production picks up in Britain. 

Walmart gets cautious on economic outlook

Walmart truck a cautious note in its economic outlook for 2023 as the US retail bellwether forecast full-year earnings below estimates and warned that cautious spending by consumers could pressure profit margins.

Shares of the world's largest retailer fell 0.8pc in early trading as the company continued to battle price-hikes from many of its product suppliers in a high-inflation environment.

Higher US consumer prices, amid loftier costs for rental housing and food, have raised fears the US Federal Reserve could further lift borrowing costs to cool domestic demand, leading to an economic downturn in the second half of the year.

Wallmart was the owner of Asda until it sold the business to the Issa brothers and TDR Capital in 2021 but it retains a share in Britain's third largest supermarket,

Chief financial officer John David Rainey told Reuters:

There's still a lot of trepidation and uncertainty with the economic outlook. 

Balance sheets are continuing to get thinner, savings rate is roughly half of what it was at a pre-pandemic level and we've not been in a situation like this where the Fed is raising at the rate that it does.

So, that makes us cautious on the economic outlook because we simply don't know what we don't know.

US markets hammered at the open

It has been a brutal open on Wall Street as  retailers Walmart and Home Depot delivered a double blow to traders returning after a long weekend amid worries that interest rates will remain higher for longer.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell or 0.4pc at the open to 33,699.69. 

The S&P 500 opened lower by 0.7pc at 4,052.35, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.3pc to 11,640.37 at the opening bell.

Supermarkets not limiting items

It is understood that Lidl, Co-op and Sainsbury's have not introduced limits on the amount of fruit and vegetables shoppers can buy.

EU and UK making progress on protocol, says Sefcovic

European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic has said that the EU and Britain have made progress in their talks about the Northern Ireland protocol but are not done yet.

Mr Sefcovic declined to tell journalists when exactly an agreement might be reached. He told a press conference:

Morrisons to ration fruit and vegetables from tomorrow

Supermarkets have begun rationing items of fruit and vegetables after a poor harvest in Spain and north Africa left gaps on supermarket shelves.

Asda is limiting customers to a maximum of three items each across tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, lettuce, salad bags, broccoli, cauliflower, and raspberries.

From tomorrow, Morrisons will only allow customers to buy a maximum of two each of tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, and peppers.

Poor yields from harvests on the continent and North Africa have hit supplies, which bosses hope will improve in coming days/weeks.

An Asda spokesman said: ""Like other supermarkets, we are experiencing sourcing challenges on some products that are grown in southern Spain and north Africa.

""We have introduced a temporary limit of three of each product on a very small number of fruit and vegetable lines, so customers can pick up the products they are looking for.""

The company is seeking alternatives to produce from Spain and Northern Africa, with the UK growing season due to begin soon.

Supermarket shelves have been left bare after a weak crop in key markets and the imposition of tighter restrictions on exports by Morocco.

Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said: ""Difficult weather conditions in the south of Europe and northern Africa have disrupted harvest for some fruit and vegetables including tomatoes and peppers. 

""While disruption is expected to last a few weeks, supermarkets are adept at managing supply chain issues and are working with farmers to ensure that customers are able to access a wide range of fresh produce.""

Tesco fruit and vegetable shelves also empty amid supply hit

Tesco has reportedly said it is suffering with supply chain problems for some tomatoes and peppers but does not have any restrictions on purchases in place.

Britain's second biggest supermarket Sainsbury's is understood not to have any limits on how many items of fruit and vegetables that customers can buy.

The Telegraph has contacted all of the UK's major supermarkets for comment and clarification on whether they are limiting purchases.

Russia sends record amounts of oil to China

Russian exports of discounted crude and fuel oil to China jumped to record levels last month as Vladimir Putin tried to circumvent Western sanctions against Moscow.

Flows of oil from the Kremlin were at their highest level than at any point since the invasion of Ukraine a year ago.

It surpassed a record set in April 2020, according to data intelligence firm Kpler.

China is toe-to-toe with India as the biggest buyer of Russian crude after the war in Ukraine reshaped the pattern of global energy deals. 

Moscow has had to offer discounts to entice a shrinking pool of customers, a move welcomed by Asian buyers trying to control inflation.

Russia's overall crude and fuel oil exports to China reached 1.66m barrels a day last month, according to Kpler data as of February 20.

The uptick in Chinese buying is evidence the country's economic recovery is picking up after ending its zero-Covid restrictions last year, which should help to lift global oil prices as demand increases.

Last week, Russia announced it would cut production by 500,000 barrels a day from next month amid a cap on prices imposed by the EU and the G7.

Newcastle and Manchester Building Societies step closer to merger

Newcastle Building Society and under-pressure smaller rival Manchester Building Society have been given approval by the industry watchdog to bypass a member vote over their plans to merge.

Newcastle - the UK's eighth biggest building society - and Manchester have now agreed the terms of a deal after entering into exclusive talks last August over a tie-up.

But the pair said they had put in a formal request with the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) to forgo a member vote in order to speed up the deal, given the ""risks and the financial uncertainties facing Manchester"".

The PRA has since granted the request, allowing the two mutuals to join forces by way of a board resolution, without the need to put it before their members ""in order to protect the investments of shareholders or depositors"", according to the lenders.

It comes as Manchester is facing strain on its balance sheet, despite having taken action to lower its risks, such as stopping new mortgage lending in 2013.

US markets expected to fall at opening bell

Wall Street is expected to open lower as disappointing results from Home Depot added to fears that interest rates will remain higher for longer.

The No 1 US home improvement chain dropped 3.8pc in premarket trading after its fourth-quarter comparable sales fell short of estimates on higher supply-chain costs and weak demand due to inflation.

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down 0.8p while the S&P 500 is poised to begin the day off 0.8pc. Nasdaq 100 contracts were down 0.9pc.

Recent economic data points to a resilient economy with inflation far from the Fed's 2pc target, raising bets for two or three more 25 basis point hikes and lower chances of rate cuts at year-end.

Credit Suisse shares hit record low amid investigation

Credit Suisse shares fell to an intraday record low after a report that the chairman is facing an investigation over comments last year amid huge client withdrawals.

Swiss financial markets regulator Finma is seeking to establish whether the comments from bank representatives including chairman Axel Lehmann were misleading, according to a Reuters report. 

In a Bloomberg TV interview in early December, Mr Lehmann had said that outflows had ""basically stopped"" after it had disclosed the loss of 84bn Swiss francs (£75bn) of client assets in November. 

By the end of the quarter, that figure had risen to 110.5bn francs (£98.7bn).

The remarks were made before the close of a crucial $4bn (£3.3bn) capital raise and helped arrest a sharp decline in the share price.

While total quarterly withdrawals exceeded Credit Suisse's initial disclosure, their exact timing after November is unclear.

The stock slid as much as 9pc to 2.58 francs. The shares have declined about 6.5pc this year.

Finma and Credit Suisse declined to comment on the report.

Economy still faces 'uncertainty and volatility', insists No 10

Uncertainty and volatility remain risks to Britain's fiscal position, the Prime Minister's spokesman has said, after data showed the Government ran an unexpected budget surplus in January.

Asked whether the surplus meant the country could expect tax cuts at next month's budget, the spokesman said it was usual to see a surplus in January. He said: 

We shouldn't place too much emphasis on a single month's data. 

Borrowing remains at record highs and there is significant uncertainty and volatility, both clear risks to the fiscal position.

Microsoft and Nintendo sign 10-year contract for Call of Duty

Microsoft and Nintendo have formalised their agreement to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms for a decade in a move designed to allay fears about the blockbuster game becoming an Xbox exclusive.

The two companies have ""negotiated and signed a binding 10-year legal agreement"" that will see Call of Duty released to Nintendo players the same day and with the same features as its Xbox version, Microsoft president Brad Smith tweeted. 

The Washington-based company committed to do so in December, contingent upon its proposed $69bn (£57bn) acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard going through.

Microsoft headed into a showdown with European Union competition watchdogs by insisting its takeover will ""bring more competition"" for gamers but pledging to show willingness to address concerns.

Mr Smith told reporters ahead a closed-door hearing in Brussels: ""We're more than willing, given our strategy, to address the concerns that others have, whether it's by contracts, like we did with Nintendo this morning, or whether it's by regulatory undertakings, as we've consistently been open to addressing.""

We've now signed a binding 10-year contract to bring Xbox games to Nintendo's gamers. This is just part of our commitment to bring Xbox games and Activision titles like Call of Duty to more players on more platforms. pic.twitter.com/JmO0hzw1BO

Holiday Inn owner's shares slump amid weak China demand

Sales and profits have rebounded at Holiday Inn owner InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) amid an increase in travel following the easing of pandemic restrictions.

Nevertheless, IHG saw its shares fall as much as 2.9pc amid continued weak demand in China where zero-Covid measures continued to have an impact on operations last year.

Keith Barr, chief executive officer of IHG, said that the group ""saw demand return strongly in most of our markets"".

The London-listed group revealed that overall revenues grew by 34pc to $3.9bn (£3.2bn) in 2022, compared with the previous year.

As a result, operating profits increased by 27pc year-on-year to $628m (£523m).

IHG, which runs 6,164 hotels, was lifted by returning demand in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where sales jumped by 82.2pc.

However, its share have fallen 1.1pc after a slow recovery in the Chinese market, where the business saw a 25pc slump while restrictions remained in place.

Post Offices can finally send international parcels again

All Royal Mail international services have finally been reinstated at Post Offices following last month's cyber attack.

The incident on January 11 meant Post Offices were unable to handle international mail or parcels at its 11,500 branches, although domestic services were unaffected.

 Post Office managing director of parcels and mails Neill O'Sullivan said:

Postmasters have been the innocent victims of this faceless crime, unable to support businesses and consumers wishing to use their expertise to get parcels sent abroad. 

For many small businesses, Post Offices are an integral part of their business set-up and this has been a challenging time for them too. 

We have worked day and night in partnership with Royal Mail to reinstate all international services via our branch network.

Post Office will be ""providing additional remuneration"" to postmasters for handling international items, with a new fixed payment worth 85p per item and 3pc extra commission for international labels sold in branch.

Brent crude edges higher after earlier swings

Oil has edged higher after plunging earlier as investors weighed the prospect for further US monetary tightening against signs of improving demand from China.

Brent futures retreated below $84 a barrel but are now above the mark again after closing 1.3pc higher on Monday. 

Meanwhile, US-produced West Texas Intermediate has risen 1.4pc today above $77 a barrel.

Prices have bounced within a relatively tight range this year, and a measure of volatility remains near the lowest level in 13 months.

Market watchers continue to weigh concerns that more Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes will sap demand, against expectations that China's reopening will drive an increase in commodity buying. 

The world's largest importer has been buying more oil from Russia and snapping up ships for cargoes from the US as it ramps up imports.

Carbon permit costs hit â‚¬100 per tonne

The price of permits in the European Union's carbon market has hit â‚¬100 (£88) per tonne for the first time, a milestone that reflects the increased costs that factories and power plants must pay when they pollute.

The benchmark EU Allowance (EUA) contract rose to a high of â‚¬100.70 per tonne.

EUAs are the main currency used in the EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS) which forces manufacturers, power companies and airlines to pay for each tonne of carbon dioxide they emit.

It forms part of the bloc's efforts to meet its climate targets.

Union's strike threat after Treasury's January surplus

A union boss has issued a warning to the Government after the Office for National Statistics said there was a public sector net borrowing surplus of £5.4bn in January.

Public and Commercial Services union general secretary Mark Serwotka said: 

The Government says it cannot afford to give our hard-working members a pay rise, but this morning's news there is a surplus of £5.4bn changes that narrative.

Ministers have no excuse for not putting some money on the table. If they don't, our strikes will continue to escalate.

Farming grants of £168m to 'invest in new technology'

More than £168m in grants are to be made available to farmers this year, farming minister Mark Spencer has announced.

Money will be available to boost food production, pay for equipment and automation, and fund smaller abattoirs.

Speaking at the National Farmers' Union (NFU) conference in Birmingham, Mr Spencer said the money will come from the farming innovation programme and the farming investment fund.

It will sit alongside the environmental land management schemes (ELMs), which pay farmers for improving biodiversity on their land.

ELMs have taken five years to draw up and are the replacement for the EU common agricultural policy.

Farmers can be paid for planting hedgerows and maintaining wildflower meadows and peatland. Mr Spencer said: 

The role farmers play in putting food on our tables as well as looking after our countryside is crucial. We know that sustainable food production depends on a healthy environment, the two go hand in hand.

Helping farms invest in new technology as well as bringing in nature-friendly schemes will support the future of farming.

Russia to only cut oil output for March, deputy PM says

A 500,000 barrel-per-day cut to Russian oil production announced this month will apply only to March output for now, deputy prime minister Alexander Novak has reportedly said.

It comes as the US deputy Treasury secretary Wally Adeyemo said America and its allies will impose new sanctions this week to crack down on Russia's efforts to evade the measures and export controls aimed at forcing Moscow to end its war in Ukraine.

The Russian TASS news agency reported that Mr Novak said: ""We will watch how the situation on the market develops, and decisions... will be made from this. Now, the decision is for March.""

The cut will be made from January output levels, Mr Novak added. 

He has said production stood at 9.8m-9.9m barrels per day last month. 

Moscow's efforts to sell its oil globally have been complicated by an EU ban on purchases of Russian oil products from February 5 and price caps on oil.

Russia's decision to cut oil production was announced only nine days after oil cartel Opec+ - of which Russia is a member - agreed to leave production cuts agreed last year in place.

Russia has 'all financial resources it needs' says Putin

Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that Russia has all the financial resources it needs to guarantee its national security and development despite Western economic sanctions.

In a major speech to Russia's two houses of parliament, he said Russian firms had rebuilt their supply chains and that Moscow was working with other countries to build new payments systems and financial architecture.

Russia's $2.1trn economy is forecast by the International Monetary Fund to grow 0.3pc this year, far below China and India's growth rates but a much better result than was forecast when the war began.

Putin said Russia had been oriented on the West since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. He quipped that no ordinary Russians shed tears over the loss of yachts and property in the West by rich Russians.

Russia was turning to major Asian powers and Putin called on businesses to invest in the Russian economy.

Putin claims Western sanctions have not defeated Russia

Vladimir Putin has said that Western countries had imposed sanctions on Russia to make its people ""suffer"" but that it had not succeeded in defeating it on the economic front.

In a major speech ahead of the first anniversary of his country's invasion of Ukraine, Putin said: ""They want to make the people suffer... but their calculation did not materialise. 

""The Russian economy and the management turned out to be much stronger than they thought.""

Speaking of the areas of Ukraine which have declared independence in sham referenda, Putin said: ""We have already begun and will continue to build up a large-scale programme for the socio-economic recovery and development of these new subjects of the Federation (territory annexed from Ukraine). 

""We are talking about reviving enterprises and jobs in the ports of the Sea of Azov, which has again become an inland sea of Russia, and building new modern roads, as we did in Crimea.""

'We doubt it will last' says economists as UK private firms rebound

The pound has rallied and the FTSE 100 rebounded from steep falls after stronger than expected data on growth in public sector companies.

But there is nothing like an economist's projection to bring you back down to earth.

Capital Economics UK economist Ashley Webb said the sharp rebound in the flash UK composite PMI in February ""suggests the economy continued to remain resilient to the dual drags from high inflation and high interest rates"". 

However, he doubts this will last ""as the drag from higher interest rates intensifies, triggering a recession this year"". He said:

Overall, the PMIs suggests that the resilience in economic activity from last year continued at the start of this year. 

But given our view that the Bank of England will raise interest rates further, from 4pc now to a peak of 4.5pc, we still expect the economy to slip into recession before long.  

PMI data 'nothing to celebrate,' says Lloyds economist

Rhys Herbert, senior economist at Lloyds Bank, said:

The economy seems to have performed better than the PMI data implied over the autumn and winter months.

Many expected the UK to be in recession by now, with the PMI now showing the end of a consistent trend of contraction over seven months. 

However, official figures suggest that so far least we've narrowly avoided recession.

Even that economic picture is nothing to celebrate, particularly as there is little reason to expect a drastic improvement anytime soon. 

However, the ongoing slowdown in inflation may be enough of catalyst for growth to continue to keep us out of recession territory.

ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§#PMI data signalled that the #UK private sector climbed back into growth territory in February (Feb: 53.0; Jan: 48.5). The rebound was achieved across both sectors and accompanied by a further cooling in inflationary pressures. Read more: https://t.co/Gb8jPPrB7I pic.twitter.com/NIOwvbbOgS

Pound rallies amid private sector recovery

The pound has bounced after the stronger than expected data showing growth in the UK's private sector recovered to an eight-month high, confounding analyst expectations.

The S&P Global/CIPS flash UK purchasing managers' index soared from 48.5 in January to 53 in February, according to the survey, which is based on preliminary data.

It is the first time in six months that the index has shown growth - anything above 50 is considered to be growth in the sector.

The pound has risen 0.6pc following the release of the data to be worth more than $1.21.

Economic output unexpectedly grows in UK, data show

The UK economy performed better than expected this month according to a closely-watched gauge of market activity.

The S&P Global flash purchasing managers' index PMI rose to 53 from 48.5 in January, its highest reading since June last year.

A reading above 50 indicates growth in activity, while below means there has been a contraction.

New orders rose to 53.1, after coming in at 49 in January.

Services rose to 53.3, well ahead of forecasts of a contraction at 49.2. Manufacturing also surpassed expectations, measuring at 49.2, better than the 47.5 estimated by analysts.

 

Eurozone recovery gathers pace, figures show

Europe's economic recovery accelerated this month, a key economic gauge if output has indicated.

The S&P Global flash PMI for the eurozone reached a nine-month high of 52.3 in February, up from 50.3 in January.

Services PMI rose to 53, up from 51 in January. A figure above 50 indicates growth.

However, manufacturing suffered a steeper than expected hit, falling to 48.5, worse than estimates of 49.3.

#Eurozone flash PMI reaches 9-month high of 52.3 in Feb (50.3 in Jan), as services activity performs strongly and manufacturing returns to growth. The data are consistent with rising #GDP in the 1st quarter so far. Read more: https://t.co/RT2iYtsY7t pic.twitter.com/nAKtJGHJG0

HSBC drags down FTSE 100

The exporter-heavy FTSE 100 has fallen 0.7pc, dragged lower by HSBC after the London-headquartered bank dampened investors' expectations of a sustained income bonanza from rising interest rates worldwide.

HSBC dropped 1.5pc despite a surge in its quarterly profit as Europe's biggest bank said it expects net interest income to be at least $36bn (£30bn) in 2023, falling short of forecasts of $37bn.

The decline in HSBC shares dragged the banking index down nearly 1pc.

Shares of Holiday Inn-owner InterContinental Hotels Group fell as much as 2.2pc even as it reported a higher full-year profit.

Investor focus will also be on initial estimates for the S&P Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) due at 9.30am, which are expected to show a modest improvement in British economic activity in February from the previous month.

The domestically focussed FTSE 250 midcap index was also down 0.6pc.

Tighter Budget 'probably still on its way', say economists

Record tax revenues from workers and capital gains taxes may have helped to offset massive spending on energy bill support and soaring debt interest payments, but do not expect a Budget bonanza from Jeremy Hunt.

Total receipts were £107.8bn, well above the £103.1bn the OBR forecast, as self-assessed income tax receipts of £21.9bn recorded their highest January figure since records began in April 1999. 

However, Capital Economics deputy chief UK economist Ruth Gregory said:

With the OBR poised to slash its medium-term GDP growth forecasts, any hopes he might be able to give away a significant amount of money, while sticking to his previous debt-reduction plans, may be disappointed.

Less costly energy price subsidies and stronger income tax receipts were the main sources of January's borrowing undershoot. 

As such, the figures paint a far more upbeat picture of the economy than the recent survey data. 

Overall, it's likely that the Chancellor will have some wiggle-room in the Budget to fund near-term tax cuts and/or spending rises. 

But probable downgrades to the OBR's assumptions about the economy's potential to grow could yet reduce the Chancellor's £9.2bn (0.3% of GDP) headroom against his fiscal mandate for 2027/28 and limit his ability to significantly scale back the planned fiscal squeeze.

'Impact of climate change really hit home', says NFU president

Here is some more of Minette Batters' speech which she is due to deliver at the launch of the NFU annual conference later:

Labour shortages and soaring energy prices are hitting the poultry industry, already reeling from avian influenza, as well as horticultural businesses and pig farms. 

Meanwhile, other sectors are facing an uncertain future as direct payments are phased out against a backdrop of huge cost inflation, with agricultural inputs having risen almost 50pc since 2019. 

And the impact of this? UK egg production has fallen to its lowest level in nine years. In 2022, UK egg packers packed almost a billion fewer eggs than they did in 2019.

This was also the year that the potential impact of climate change really hit home. The extraordinary temperatures we experienced in July topped the previous record by almost a degree and a half. 

While many parts of the country have experienced huge amounts of rainfall recently, impacting farming operations over autumn and winter, some counties still remain in official drought status.

Despite all this, NFU members and the farmers and growers of Britain continued to bring in the harvest, to produce the nation's food and to keep the country fed through tough times. 

Inheritance tax receipts on target for annual record

The Government is on target to break its annual inheritance tax record as receipts for January 2023 totalled £578m, up from £443m in the same month a year ago. 

It takes the total inheritance tax take for the 2022-23 financial year so far to £5.9bn, £853m higher than through the same period last year.

It means the Treasury is only £178m short of its record £6.1bn inheritance tax receipts for the prior year, with two months to go.

Stephen Lowe, group communications director at retirement specialist Just Group, said: 

The Chancellor has struck a seam of gold with recent inheritance tax receipts as he looks set to receive another record haul this financial year - and with more to come.

Receipts are likely to race past official predictions for the next few years. 

The combination of frozen thresholds and property prices that have soared over the years mean that receipts could continue to grow over the coming years.

While it's good news for the Treasury there will be many people for whom an inheritance tax bill will be a nasty shock. 

Improved economic outlook easing pressure on Government, says PwC

The Treasury's net borrowing was in surplus by £5.4bn in January, which was £5bn higher than the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) expected.

Jake Finney, economist at PwC UK, said the latest public sector finances data from the Office for National Statistics showed the ""improved economic outlook"" is easing pressure on the Government. He said:

Tax receipts picked up in January, as workers and companies settled their tax bills. However, this was partially offset by large spending on energy bills support and one-off payments to the EU relating to historic custom duties.

Debt interest payments reached £6.7bn in January, the highest January figure since monthly records began 26 years ago. 

This reflects the fiscal consequences of higher RPI inflation and higher interest rates. Higher debt servicing costs as a share of total revenues will leave the public finances more exposed to future economic shocks.

In the coming months, falls to natural gas futures prices should start to gradually bring down the cost of the Energy Price Guarantee scheme. However, we expect this will be partially offset by reduced tax receipts due to lower than expected inflation.

Clock ticking to secure Britain's food supply, warn farmers

Surging prices mean ""the clock is ticking"" for Britain's food supplies, farmers have warned.

The National Farmers' Union (NFU) will launch its annual conference later with a message from president Minette Batters saying ""volatility, uncertainty and instability are the greatest risks to farm businesses in England and Wales today"".

She will also raise concerns about ""labour shortages and soaring energy prices"" hitting farmers, pointing out that UK egg production has fallen to its lowest level in nine years. 

Ms Batters will tell the conference's 1,500 delegates: ""More often than not - it has been incredibly hard getting government to back up its rhetoric with concrete actions. 

""The time is nearly up for government to demonstrate its commitment to food and farming in our great country, not just by saying they support us, but by showing us they do. 

""I won't let the opposition off the hook either, I believe the rural vote will be crucial in the next election.""

Here is some more of what Ms Batters will say as she launches the organisation's annual conference today:

There are three key lessons we can take from this extraordinary year.

As the global population continues to rise, and parts of the planet become less suited to producing the food we eat, we have an opportunity, and a duty, to get the best out of our maritime climate. 

Secondly, in the face of climate change, we should be unwavering in our commitment to achieving net zero and contributing to our energy security through on-farm renewables generation. 

And thirdly, we should never take our food security for granted.

But the fact remains, volatility, uncertainty and instability are the greatest risks to farm businesses in England and Wales today. 

Critically, those consequences will be felt far beyond farming, they will be felt across the natural environment, and in struggling households across the country.

Markets fall as Government surplus narrows

The markets do not appear to be reassured by the record tax income for the Government in January.

The Treasury managed a surplus of £5.4bn, ahead of expectations of a deficit, but still well below the surplus of £12.5bn in the same month a year earlier.

The FTSE 100 was down 0.2pc to 7,995.62 points in early trading while the FTSE 250 has dropped 0.2pc to 20,067.88.

Record tax revenues save Chancellor from bigger headache

Record tax revenues from workers and capital gains taxes helped to offset massive spending on energy bill support and soaring debt interest payments, official figures show.

Economics editor Szu Ping Chan has the latest:

In the final set of public borrowing figures before Jeremy Hunt delivers his Spring Budget, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the government received £5.4bn more in taxes in January than it spent on public services.

This is much higher than the £8bn deficit forecast by economists and £5bn larger than forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's tax and spending watchdog.

January is traditionally a month where the Treasury receives more than it spends as businesses and workers, including the self-employed pay their tax bills.

The ONS said self-assessed income tax receipts were £21.9bn in January. This is the highest monthly figure since records began in 1999 and a third higher than receipts received a year ago.

Capital gains taxes, which are paid on the profits of disposed assets such as buy-to-let properties if they have increased in value, stood at £13.2bn, another record high.

Hunt: 'We're rightly spending billions'

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, said:

We are rightly spending billions now to support households and businesses with the impacts of rising prices - but with debt at the highest level since the 1960s, it is vital we stick to our plan to reduce debt over the medium-term. 

Getting debt down will require some tough choices, but it is crucial to reduce the amount spent on debt interest so we can protect our public services.

HSBC profits slip after Covid impact

Banking giant HSBC has announced a dip in 2022 pre-tax profits last year, calling the ongoing impact of Covid-19 the main factor in its financial performance.

The Asia-focused lender said it made $17.5bn (£14.6bn) before tax, down more than seven percent on-year, while reported revenue increased four percent to $51.7bn (£43.1bn).

In a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange, HSBC detailed the tough global economic climate international banks are facing.

It cited renewed virus outbreaks in Hong Kong and mainland China as denting last year's economic growth.

It added that global uncertainty sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, elevated inflation and rising interest rates contributed to a difficult financial environment that it expects will spill into 2023's earnings and even eclipse the toll of the pandemic.

""We are already seeing... a cost of living crisis affecting many of our customers and colleagues,"" Mark Tucker, the group's chairman said in a statement.

However, after-tax profits rose $2bn to $16.7bn (£13.9bn), while fourth-quarter pre-tax profit nearly doubled from $2.5bn to $5.2bn (£4.3bn).

Record tax revenues offset Government energy support spending, says ONS

Record tax revenues from workers and capital gains taxes helped to offset massive spending on energy bill support and soaring debt interest payments, official figures show, writes economics editor Szu Ping Chan.

In the final set of public borrowing figures before Jeremy Hunt delivers his Spring Budget, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the government received £5.4bn more in taxes in January than it spent on public services. 

This is much higher than a £8bn deficit forecast by economists and £5bn larger than forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's fiscal watchdog.

Public sector debt excluding public sector banks was £2,492.1 billion at the end of January 2023, or around 98.9% of gross domestic product - with the debt to GDP ratio at levels last seen in the early 1960s.

Budget surplus narrows as debt interest costs surge

The budget surplus narrowed sharply in the biggest tax month of the year for the Government as rising debt costs hit the public finances.

January normally delivers a large surplus for the Treasury as income tax payments are due.

However, the £5.4bn that the Government received - taking in more in tax revenue than it spent - was well below the £12.5bn surplus recorded in January last year.

Debt interest was £6.7bn, according to the data from the Office for National Statistics, which was the highest January figure since monthly records began in April 1997.

In January 2023, the public sector spent less than it received in taxes and other income, resulting in a surplus of £5.4 billion.

This was a £7.1 billion smaller surplus than in January 2022.

Good morning

Public sector borrowing figures have given the Chancellor a boost as he prepares to deliver his Budget next month.

The Government managed a surplus of £5.4bn in January, well ahead of economists' expectations of a £7.9bn deficit.

However, the surplus was £7.1bn smaller than at the same time a year ago.

What happened overnight 

Asian shares were mostly lower in quiet trading after US markets were closed for Presidents Day.

Shares dropped in Tokyo, Sydney and Hong Kong but rose slightly in Seoul and Shanghai. 

Analysts say worries about weakening demand persist in Asia, as companies cope with rising energy and raw material costs and consumers hold back on spending.

In Japan, a preliminary manufacturing indicator, the flash purchasing manager's index, fell to 47.4 in February from 48.9 the month before. That was the weakest reading in more than two years.

Stocks in Tokyo closed lower, with the benchmark Nikkei 225 index losing 0.2pc to 27,473.10, while the broader Topix index fell 0.1pc to 1,997.46.

The latest data from Australia, called the Judo Bank PMI, showed private sector activity remained in contraction for the fifth straight month. 

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.2pc to 7,336.30. South Korea's Kospi gained nearly 0.2pc to 2,458.72. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 1.6pc to 20,561.77, while the Shanghai Composite gained 0.1pc to 3,294.37.

In the currency markets, the dollar was flat, after a three week rally. Treasury futures, which did trade Monday, fell slightly.

World's first octopus farm criticised over ""˜cruel' plan to freeze them to death

About one million of the molluscs, known for their intelligence, will be produced for food every year despite animal welfare concerns

The world's first octopus farm being built in Spain's Canary Islands has been criticised as ""cruel"" over its plans to freeze the animals to death.

The farm would produce around one million octopuses for food every year, despite concerns over animal welfare, according to plans revealed by the groups Compassion in World Farming (CiWF) and Eurogroup for Animals.

The plans, from Spanish seafood company Nueva Pescanova, show that the octopuses would be kept in tanks shared with other octopuses and under constant light, when in nature the animals are solitary and prefer dark conditions.

The octopuses would be killed by being placed in water at a temperature of minus 3C, a method already used commercially to slaughter fish and which studies have shown results in a slow, stressful death.  

The World Organisation for Animal Health says the ""ice slurry"" method ""results in poor fish welfare"" and the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) has argued that the technique should be banned unless fish are stunned beforehand.

The animal rights groups also say that confining octopuses in barren underwater tanks will cause the animals suffering and risk aggression, territorialism and even cannibalism.

According to a report by CiWF, experimental trials to farm octopuses suggest that the mortality rate in these systems would be around 20 per cent.

The Canary Islands' General Directorate of Fishing must decide whether to approve the ground-breaking facility, set to comprise around 1,000 communal tanks in the port of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.  

The two animal rights groups have called on the Canary Islands authority not to license the octopus farm and also asked the European Union to step in by banning such facilities.

Elena Lara, research manager at CiWF, said the octopus farm ""will inflict unnecessary suffering on these intelligent, sentient and fascinating creatures, which need to explore and engage with the environment as part of their natural behaviour"".

She also noted that octopuses' carnivorous diets require huge quantities of animal protein to sustain, ""contributing to overfishing at a time when fish stocks are already under immense pressure"".

Calls for EU to ban octopus farming

""We're calling on the EU to include a ban on octopus farming before it ever sees the light of day, in order to avoid plunging more sentient beings into a living hell,"" said Reineke Hameleers, CEO at Eurogroup for Animals.

Nueva Pescanova announced in 2019 that it had achieved a breakthrough in research that meant it could be possible to farm and breed octopuses in communal tanks. The animals adapted to group life, the company said, ""without territorial aggression"".

The company plans to supply international markets including the US, Japan and South Korea with 3,000 tonnes of octopus a year, which CiWF calculated would mean between 10 and 15 octopuses living in each cubic metre of tank space.

Eurogroup for Animals told The Telegraph that Nueva Pescanova had applied for EU funding from the EU's Recovery and Resilience Facility to support its octopus farming project.

""This would be an inappropriate usage of EU public funding that is meant to drive sustainable development,"" said Ms Hameleers.

Nueva Pescanova did not respond to The Telegraph's request for comment on the allegations of cruelty surrounding the planned farm.

Don't heed warnings of Day After Tomorrow ocean collapse, says Met Office

Climate scientists said a paper suggesting the Atlantic Ocean current tipping point could occur as early as 2025 was ""˜overdramatised'

Warnings about the imminent collapse of an ocean system, imagined in the film The Day After Tomorrow, should not cause despair, climate scientists have said.

A paper published in the journal Nature this week suggested the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation was likely to collapse by 2057, and possibly as early as 2025.

But its methods have been criticised as oversimplistic and its conclusions overdramatised, leading to concern they could undermine the public perception of climate science.

The AMOC is a flow across the entire ocean, carrying warmer surface waters northward towards the UK and Greenland and bringing cooler waters back down south at up to 3,000 meters deep.

It is not the same as the Gulf Stream, which is a more stable near-surface current driven largely by winds, although it crosses paths with the AMOC at some points.

It is estimated that the tipping point for collapse would happen in 2057, with a possible range between 2025 and 2095. A press release for the study said the collapse could happen ""potentially any time from 2025"".

If the AMOC were to collapse it would have severe impacts on the global climate over the course of several years, affecting global precipitation, including possibly weakening the African and Asian monsoons.

Britain's winter temperatures would plummet closer to those of Siberia or northern Canada and summers would be drier, impacting agriculture and infrastructure.

""˜It is terrifying'

AntÃ³nio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, said the new temperature records should prompt swift action to cut emissions. ""Climate change is here. It is terrifying. And it is just the beginning,"" he said. ""The era of global warming has ended; the era of global boiling has arrived.""

Some possible impacts of AMOC collapse were imagined in the 2004 film The Day After Tomorrow, starring Dennis Quaid, although the film was dismissed as largely unrealistic.

Some were quick to question the conclusions and methodology of the paper, which was widely covered in international media.

One of the main concerns is that sea surface temperatures are not a reliable proxy for changes in the AMOC because temperatures can be impacted by several different factors.

""As far as we're concerned in the Met Office, the paper is far too simplistic,"" said Richard Betts, the Head of the Climate Impacts at the Met Office Hadley Centre.

He added: ""There's still no evidence that we're kind of past the point of no return in terms of devastating impacts.

""On the basis of one paper, don't despair.""

Others said the paper was a stark reminder of the risks if the world continues to increase fossil fuel use.

""This study is yet another warning that we should be doing everything in our power to accelerate action to decarbonize the economy and get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible,"" said Tim Lenton, director of the global systems institute at the University of Exeter.

Penny Holliday, a marine physicist at the National Oceanography Centre said warnings about AMOC's imminent collapse were a distraction from action on near-term climate change.

""The AMOC collapse is possible, but it's not very likely. So I don't think it's the thing to focus on,"" said Ms Holliday, who is the UK's lead on a global research project into the subpolar AMOC that has been running since 2014.

She added: ""You might worry about an asteroid hitting the Earth. It could happen. But it's not very likely. So there are other things to worry about.""

""If a paper sends a message that's too strong and kind of over-dramatises the results of their analysis, it can be a bit damaging in terms of people's views of climate science,"" she said.

The assessment of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is that the AMOC is unlikely to collapse this century, and scientists are not certain that it will fail at all even as the climate warms.

The AMOC is notoriously difficult to predict, because observational data only goes back to 2004, and current models cannot account for all of the complex influences on the ocean system. Data since 2004 shows fluctuations in the strength of the system which appear to last for around a decade.

The new research this week used historical data on sea surface temperatures as a proxy for the strength of the AMOC to construct a model of possible future change.

Italy could face EU fines over ban on lab-grown meat

Meloni's ministers move to protect the country's culinary heritage but critics say new law will hamper the fight against climate change

Italy could face EU fines over a ban on lab-grown meat aimed at protecting the country's culinary heritage and farmers' livelihoods.

The law prohibits the production, sale and consumption of laboratory-produced food ""from cell cultures or tissue derived from vertebrate animals"".

Factories breaching the new rules will face fines of up to 150,000 euros (£131,000) and risk being shut down, while owners may lose their right to obtain public funding for up to three years.

The law was passed by Italy's lower house of parliament on Thursday, having already been approved by the Senate.

The bill was introduced by Francesco Lollobrigida, minister for agriculture and ""food sovereignty"" in Giorgia Meloni's Right-wing government.

Lollobrigida sceptical of new innovations

Mr Lollobrigida, who is Ms Meloni's brother-in-law, and grandnephew of the actress Gina Lollobrigida, said the approval of the law ""puts Italy at the vanguard of the world"".

""We are proud to be the first country to ban it,"" he said.

Mr Lollobrigida has waged a campaign in defence of Italy's traditional food products and takes a dim view of scientific innovations.

He is also sceptical of food products that contain flour made from insects and has called for them to be clearly marked as such on packaging.

The new law also bans the use of terms such as ""steak"", ""burger"" and ""salami"" for plant-based vegan or vegetarian products.

The ban on synthetic meats was backed by Coldiretti, a powerful farmers' organisation. Farmers were concerned that if approved, synthetic meats would harm the consumption of traditional products such as steak, prosciutto and mortadella.

""˜Heavy fines' warning

Laboratory-grown meat is currently not permitted in the EU. But opposition politicians said that if the bloc does eventually decide to allow it, Italy would be in breach of single market rules.

""With the ban on the production and distribution of cultured meat, the Meloni government exposes Italy to the almost certain risk of infringement procedures and heavy fines,"" said Piercamillo Falasca, the deputy head of the opposition +Europa (More Europe) party.

Without the ban, Italy could have become ""a lead producer of cultivated meat"" because of its expertise in the food sector, he said.

Proponents of synthetic meat argue that it is more climate-friendly than traditional livestock production because it produces significantly less greenhouse gas emissions and requires less water and land.

The process would also offer customers a product that does not involve the killing of cattle, sheep, pigs and other animals.

Bill ""˜isolates Italy'

The Good Food Institute, an advocacy group, said the ban would hamper the fight against climate change and force Italian experts in the field to go abroad to seek work.

""This bill not only deprives consumers of choice but also isolates Italy from the investment and job creation offered by this burgeoning industry,"" said Francesca Gallelli, the institute's public affairs consultant.

""The debate surrounding cultivated meat in Italy has been fuelled by misinformation, as hearings in the Senate intentionally excluded cultivated meat companies and supporters while allowing false claims from opponents of this sustainable food,"" she added.

Lab-grown meat can be produced with 92 per cent less emissions than conventional beef, the institute said.

Only a few countries in the world have given the green light to the production and consumption of cultivated meat.

Singapore became the first country in the world to do so, in December 2020. It was followed by the US in June this year.

""The fact that cultivated meat has passed this rigorous approval process shows that it will be part of a safe and sustainable food future,"" the Good Food Institute said.

""But it is likely to be some years before people in Europe are able to buy cultivated meat from the supermarket.""

How climate change is ending the sporting dreams of India's young

The effects of India's catastrophic floods, which have intensified in recent years, go far beyond material loss

Samarth Chavan would have been a Taekwondo black belt were it not for the floods.

The 19-year-old had spent his whole life training and preparing for the examination which would have confirmed his status as an expert in the martial art. 

But two weeks before the big day, in August 2019, disaster struck in the form of flooding that devastated his family's farmland in the village of Khochi, in western India's Maharashtra state, ruining £1,700 worth of sugarcane crops.

""The water was at least 20 feet high in the fields,"" recalls Samarth. ""Even the utility pole wasn't visible.""

Despite their best efforts, the Chavans were unable to salvage the sugarcane crops and began working in other families' fields to make ends meet. With the focus on survival, young Samarth missed his exam. He hasn't returned to Taekwondo since.

""Had it flooded two weeks later, he would have been a black belt champion by now,"" says his father, Ranjit.

""˜Our dreams are now dependent on rain'

The effects of India's catastrophic floods, which have intensified in recent years as a consequence of climate change, go far beyond material loss.

As seen in the case of Samarth Chavan, prospects for a better life are now being lost to the floodwaters, trapping victims in cycles of poverty, unable to ever escape.

Yet Samarth isn't alone. At least not in India. 

""Because of recurring climate disasters, many young athletes are suffering from adjustment disorder,"" says Shalmali Ranmale, a clinical psychologist who has closely observed the fallout from the floods. 

""This affects their training, and eventually, financial conditions drive them to quit sports.""

For the past two decades, India has witnessed an average of 17 flood events per year, making it the second worst flood-affected country, after China, impacting 345 million people across the country.

Last year alone, from January 1 to September 30, India experienced extreme weather events on 241 out of 273 days. For now, there is no indication that weather conditions in the country are going to improve.

Against this backdrop, the blossoming careers of the young rest on a knife-edge, vulnerable to Mother Nature's whims.

""Our dreams are now dependent on rain,"" says Gauri Babar, 17, another resident of Khochi village who had reached red belt in Taekwondo and was aspiring to go further in the sport.

""I was training for over five years,"" she says. Determined to take her career to the next level, Gauri doubled her training time to over four hours a day. ""I was inspired as I was just a step away from earning a black belt which would make my family proud.""

But this all changed when the August 2019 floods hit. Water gushed into her home and family field over the course of half a day. Like Samarth, focus turned to survival, rather than training.

""˜With the changing climate, nothing is certain'

Somehow trying to recover from the trauma without help, Gauri attempted Taekwondo after seven months. ""But everything changed."" She couldn't focus because of the trauma and debt the floods had left her with. Eventually, she quit in 2020. 

""With the changing climate, nothing is certain,"" Gauri says.

Both Gauri and Samarth were victims of sudden moments of catastrophe, but the fallout from flooding and heavy rainfall can be drawn out over many months, slowly eroding the ability of India's budding athletes to take their sport to the next level.

In the wake of the August 2019 floods, Taekwondo trainer Amit Jambhale, from Khochi, noticed that his students' performances were weakening with each passing month.

""It kept getting worse,"" he reflects. ""From two hours of practice daily, most of them have dropped out today"".

He attributes these dropping numbers to the changing climate. After the 2019 floods, his poorer students from the region's agrarian communities lost their crops and source of income. 

Some managed to briefly get their lives back on track by seeking loans at exorbitant interest rates, but what followed next was incessant and untimely rainfall, further flooding 18 months later, and crippling heat waves. 

As a result, says Jambhale, his students' families kept losing agricultural produce and have since been plunged into acute poverty, where even eating food twice has become a luxury.

Financially destitute and unable to source enough food to fuel their training, Jambhale's students have had no choice but to turn their back on Taekwondo.

These first-generation champion athletes from historically oppressed communities once envisioned a bright career in sports. Now, they work odd jobs in factories, helping parents with farming or milking cattle to make ends meet. Many are even on the verge of dropping out of college because they can ill afford the fees.

""Even if the flood-affected athletes have stronger willpower, they still don't get a good diet because most of them have either lost everything to floods and have no money to buy healthy food,"" says community healthcare worker Maya Patil from Kutwad village in Maharashtra's Kolhapur district.

Patil also worries about the gendered impacts of flooding. ""If a girl has quit sports and isn't employed or enrolled in a college, then definitely she will get marriage proposals, and many aren't given a choice,"" she says.

The female athletes she talks to often say they have no one to share their problems with. ""It keeps mounting and eventually leads to much frustration, which manifests in several issues like hypertension,"" says Patil. 

In 2019-2020, the National Family Health Survey found that 31 per cent of women in the Kolhapur district had elevated blood pressure - a staggering 134 per cent rise from the 2015-16 levels. 

The mental health impacts aren't restricted to Kolhapur. A 2019-2020 study in the south Indian state of Kerala found that out of 276 respondents, 92 per cent of females and 87 per cent of males still reported subclinical psychiatric symptoms a year after the flood. 

The paper concluded: ""Tailored psychological interventions are warranted to counter the long-lasting impact of flooding on the mental health of individuals.""

The next generation of athletes

Not all have lost hope in the face of climate change and are actively developing solutions for India's emerging athletes.

Ananda Powar remains one of the finest kabaddi players to emerge from Kolhapur's Jambhali village, winning several accolades. Kabaddi is a South Asian contact sport played between two teams of seven players. 

""I've 11 fractures, and this is all because of my love for kabaddi,"" the 35-year-old says proudly.

However, despite his significant wins, he couldn't make a kabaddi career and works as a full-time farmer. ""In the last four-five years, there has been a massive change in the climate,"" he explains. 

His father and uncle collectively own eight acres of farmland and once reported bumper sugarcane produce. 

During this time, Powar kept winning medals, aiming to play for the national team. However, as sugarcane production started falling because of heat waves, erratic rainfall and hailstorms, the debt began to rise, eventually forcing him to abandon his dreams and take up farming.  

Yet Powar hasn't completely walked away from kabaddi and now spends much of his time training the next generation. ""I couldn't make a kabaddi career, but that hasn't stopped me from coaching others,"" he says.

The more children he worked with, Powar eventually realised that ""as soon as students cross the age of 16, they start feeling the pain of additional responsibilities like helping the family make ends meet"".

As a result, he is deliberately training those at a much younger age. ""Even if they are flood affected, these students aren't burdened with responsibility because they are so young.""

At times of flooding, Powar provides students with the millet and food grains he harvests in his field. Today, he trains over 40 girls aged 10-18. His work has yielded results, as several of his students compete at district, state, and national levels and have already made their careers in kabaddi. 

After quitting Taekwondo, Samarth has been helping his family with farming. He thought of pursuing nursing but that would have cost him £985, equivalent to selling 35,000 kilograms of sugarcane, which he could not afford. 

""It doesn't help even if you are talented,""says his father, Ranjit. Now, Samarth is pursuing a science course. But, ever since he stopped training, his mother, Surekha, 39, says she has seen a rise in irritability and helplessness. ""With recurring floods, it's obvious, but I never expected it to be so frequent."" 

Samarth's younger sister, Shravani, 16, was also forced to give up Taekwondo after six years of training. Another emerging career lost to climate change.

Everyday, the siblings reflect on what could have been.""Shravani and I had a dream of earning the black belt together, but we are trapped in the floods,"" says Samarth, pointing towards the uniform he brought three years ago, which now lies untouched in his rustic iron wardrobe.

Russian ""˜spy ships' threaten to sabotage UK energy supply

""˜Ghost' vessels mapping wind farms and communication cables prompt Tory calls to expand Armed Forces to deal with Kremlin threat

Russian spy ships are mapping wind farms and key communication cables off the coast of Britain as part of plans to sabotage critical infrastructure.

Details of the covert ""ghost ships"" missions were published as Downing Street and GCHQ chiefs warned of a surge in Russia-aligned hackers aiming to ""disrupt or destroy"" energy facilities such as power stations.

A fleet of Russian boats, often disguised as fishing trawlers or research vessels but with armed guards, has been observed by European intelligence agencies conducting mass reconnaissance close to British coastal energy and communications networks.

Possible targets are believed to include internet cables, offshore wind farms and connectors carrying electricity and gas pipelines, an investigation found.

One ship doing underwater ""research"" was tracked touring wind farms off the east coast of the UK, while another is thought to have entered the Moray Firth on Nov 10 last year.

Tobias Ellwood, the Tory chairman of the Commons defence committee, told The Telegraph ""the penny must drop"" over Russia's attempts to undermine British security as he called for an expansion of the Armed Forces in the wake of the revelations.

Mr Ellwood said: ""We simply can no longer protect our near seas and, rightly, step forward further afield, with our current peacetime-sized Navy, Army and Air Force.""

On Wednesday night, GCHQ chiefs warned that Western nations were battling a surge in Russian hacking activity as Vladimir Putin's cyber troops set their sights on vital infrastructure.

Oliver Dowden, the Cabinet Office minister, said Russia-aligned hackers who have been attacking Ukraine have ""turned their attention to the UK"".

Criminal hacker groups in Russia have increasingly been targeting Western countries in recent months, especially Nato members supporting Ukraine. Experts say ""patriotic"" young Russians are carrying out cyber attacks against Western organisations and businesses.

National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) bosses have issued a formal warning to critical national infrastructure operators about the renewed threat.

Lindy Cameron, the chief executive of the NCSC, said: ""If the UK is to be the safest place to live and work online, then resilience must urgently move to the top of our investment shopping list.""

GCHQ's security arm also warned of an expansion in mercenary ""hacker for hire"" operations, in which highly skilled cyber companies offer their services to the highest bidder.

Details of the Russian sabotage plot in the North Sea emerged from a joint investigation by the public broadcasters of Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Russia is thought to be drawing up plans in the event of a full-scale war with the West.

There has been an increased focus on the safety of North Sea infrastructure amid heightened tensions with Russia, particularly in the wake of the attack on the Nord Stream pipeline.

Last year, Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, warned that Norway's oil and gas infrastructure was ""particularly vulnerable"" because it had become Europe's main supplier.

The Royal Navy is purchasing two dedicated sub-sea surveillance ships, expected to come into service this year.

Senior officials from AIVD, the Dutch equivalent of MI5 and MI6, previously warned that Russia had been caught mapping installations in the North Sea after a vessel was intercepted near a wind farm last autumn.

In February, a Russian ship without its automatic identification system, which lets the vessel be tracked, entered Belgian and Dutch waters. At the time, the Dutch intelligence services accused Moscow of ""trying to map what the Dutch energy supply looks like"".

Around 50 Russian ""ghost ships"" are believed to be operating in the North Sea as part of the sabotage plot.

The investigation by the Scandinavian broadcasters identified the ship as the Admiral Vladimirsky, officially registered as an oceanographic research vessel, as a possible spy boat.

Footage of the ship showed a man armed with a military-grade rifle and wearing a balaclava was on board as their journalists approached it.

The vessel, which sailed for a month with its transmitter turned off, was tracked by a former UK Royal Navy expert in the vicinity of seven wind farms off the coast of the UK and the Netherlands on a single mission.

It was reported to have slowed down when it approached the infrastructure. The ship was the same one announced to have entered Belgian waters, reports citing security sources said.

It was reportedly spotted off the Scottish coast last year, when it was allegedly sighted entering Moray Firth on Nov 10.

Niels Fastrup, of the Danish broadcaster DR, said: ""According to our experts and intelligence sources we've been talking to, the purpose of that stop was also to investigate the Seagreen wind farm in order to look for possible vulnerabilities to exploit in the event of an escalation in the current conflict situation between Russia and the Western world.""

A Danish intelligence officer told the broadcasters sabotage efforts were being planned by Russia in the event of a full-scale conflict with the West. The head of Norway's intelligence services said the efforts were vital for Russia and controlled directly from Moscow. 

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""The Government takes the security and resilience of our national infrastructure very seriously. That is why we increased Royal Navy presence patrols after the Nord Stream incident and have invested £65 million in the first of our two Multi-Role Ocean Surveillance ships.

""We continue to review all our investments and activities against the full range of threats and risks.""

Offshore Energies UK, the trade body for the offshore sector, said the safety of its installations was a matter of ongoing discussions with the Government.

How avocados became a blood-soaked fruit - and cursed a generation

When this strange green interloper arrived on our shores in the 1960s, nobody would have guessed the knock-on effects they could have

Many years ago, my friend Simon was asked what he wanted for his 16th birthday. He thought for a few moments, then asked his parents for something that was rather exotic. It arrived at school the following day, to be greeted by a crowd of excited teenage boys. Most of us had never seen anything like it before. Younger and more sophisticated readers will struggle to believe this, but that outlandish gift was a simple avocado.

This was, I should mention, Somerset in the 1970s. Back then, in the days of Vesta Chow Mein ready meals and Instant Whip, even lasagne was a rare treat. So we gazed upon that glamorous green interloper in much the same way as the wartime generation must have greeted the banana.

Well, haven't we come a long way since then? Even in the steadfastly old-fashioned Wiltshire village where I live now, my children have avocado on toast for breakfast. In doing this they are not only bang-on trend, but they've been unwittingly thrust into the forefront of the culture wars: not something which usually bothers those of us who prefer Weetabix.

They are nutritious, meat-free, high in unsaturated fat but low calorie, and they look very attractive on Instagram. No wonder they have become synonymous with millennial consumerism. But this week there was a new development in the world of avocado worship.

After news that Mexican drug gangs have been profiting from the business, the London-based El Pastor chain of Mexican restaurants announced that it was offering ""cartel-free"" avocados, guaranteed to be untainted by crime and mob violence. The El Pastor supply chain is monitored to ensure that no money gets to the drug-runners.

Avocados are referred to as ""green gold"", with farmers in Mexico being forced to take up arms to defend themselves against drug cartels. It is fast becoming a ""conflict commodity"" like blood diamonds from Africa. In fact, so lucrative is the fruit that Mexico - by far the world's largest producer with control over 30 per cent of global production - is dedicating ever more acreage to avocado plantations. But with greater spoils comes greater threat from organised criminal gangs who extort protection fees from farmers. Illegal deforestation and logging comes naturally in attendance as an increasing amount of land is cleared to meet the breakfast demands of wealthy westerners.

But it's not the only country mining the wildly profitable avocado seam. Colombia - already engaged in mortal combat with cocaine cartels - has seen its avocado production skyrocket, so much so, that it's now the world's second largest producer. Much of south and central America is in on the game - for the UK and much of the EU, the Hass avocados in supermarket aisles most likely hail from Peru - but this devotion to avocado farming does have devastating ramifications. 

Aside from violence, racketeering and deforestation, in 2015, New York Magazine reported that so much water is required for Chile's avocado plantations that the rivers and groundwater stores are being drained faster than they are being replenished. Across the Americas and up to California (the US being the 13th largest producer), the water demands of avocado farming are causing some to call the practice unethical.

But such geopolitical upheaval has done seemingly little to stop the demand. So how did the fruit become such a precious commodity? The cult of avocado toast can arguably be traced back to Gwyneth Paltrow, who featured a piece of toast topped with a vegan mayonnaise spread, crushed avocado and salt in her 2013 cookbook It's All Good.

She was aided and abetted by Nigella Lawson, who in 2015 revealed her own recipe on her TV series, prompting a 30 per cent spike in UK sales. But there is another claimant. Australian restaurateur Bill Granger claims he smeared avocado on toast as far back as 1993 at his cafÃ© in Sydney. 

Now there is no escape. There is a National Avocado Day, celebrated every year on July 31 (although the real avocado day is Superbowl Sunday, when Americans eat their way through guacamole dip that traditionally accompanies the game). You can even buy coffee served in an avocado husk, as well as dresses and socks with avocado patterns, and even avocado-print pants.

The avocado certainly took its time to reach us. It was known in central America as far back as 10,000BC as the ahuacatl, which became a euphemism for testicles (in much the same way as we say ""plums""). The Spanish explorer MartÃ­n FernÃ¡ndez de Enciso is credited as the first European to sample the fruit. ""That which it contains is like butter,"" he wrote, ""and is so good and pleasing to the palate that it is a marvellous thing.""

Despite this enthusiasm, the avocado wasn't exactly an instant hit. ""The fruit's popularity was slow to spread, only being cultivated in the US at the end of the 19th century,"" says the Larousse Gastronomique. ""It did not reach French recipe books until the 1950s"".

We British had to wait until 1968 before avocados became widely available. It was a time when the country was opening up to new foods, partly under the influence of writer Elizabeth David. Among the imports she championed was the avocado.

They reportedly first went on sale in Marks & Spencer, marketed as avocado pears, but initially got a muted reception. One customer wrote a letter of complaint to the store after serving one with custard.

Nobody has embraced the avocado more than the millennial generation, born between 1981 and 1996. Perhaps they were influenced by the 1982 children's book Avocado Baby, in which an avocado diet gives the young hero almost Popeye-like strength.

According to the Hass Avocado Board, a US-based marketing group, millennials spend 5 per cent more on avocados than any other group; 80 per cent of millennials bought an avocado at least once in 2018.

And it is here that we must reluctantly enter the divisive and somewhat baffling world of the culture wars. Millennials are renowned for their political activism, but a rigid devotion to social justice and a fancy for avocado on toast (which can set you back around £14 at some cafÃ©s) is not entirely compatible.

Aside from the farms putting enormous strain on local water resources and being the source of land clearance and cartel violence, there are even more unpleasant aspects involved in the serving up of a simple ""avo on toast"". In September last year, Piers Morgan was in typically robust form as he skewered a representative of Animal Rebellion. Billions of bees, he said, are flown into California to help pollinate avocado crops, and many of them die. ""Billions of bees get slaughtered so you can have your avocados,"" said Morgan, denouncing the ""total hypocrisy"" of the campaigners.  

And let's not forget that an avocado in the UK must first be transported across the globe. A 2017 study by the Carbon Footprint Ltd consultancy claimed that a pack of two avocados had an emissions footprint of 846g of CO2 - double that of 1kg of bananas.

The fruit has even been thrust into the debate about young people and home ownership. Australian property developer Tim Gurner made headlines in 2017 by suggesting that more youngsters could afford property if they didn't have such expensive tastes in food.

""When I was trying to buy my first home, I wasn't buying smashed avocado for $19 and four coffees at $4 each,"" he said.

He was echoing remarks by the Australian author and demographer Bernard Salt. ""I have seen young people order smashed avocado with crumbled feta on five-grain toasted bread at $22 a pop and more. I can afford to eat this for lunch because I am middle-aged and have raised my family. But how can young people afford to eat like this? Twenty-two dollars several times a week could go towards a deposit on a house."" In response, young hipsters said they were spending money on avocado treats precisely because they would never be able to buy a home.

While we're on the subject of millennials, reports consistently suggest that they aren't having as much sex as previous generations. That surely puts to bed, if you'll excuse the phrase, the idea that the avocado is an aphrodisiac.

If you ask me, that mistaken belief arose when an excitable researcher got the wrong end of the stick after listening to the Ballad of Barry And Freda, by Victoria Wood. You might remember that this involves leaning backwards over a hostess trolley, being beaten on the bottom by a copy of Woman's Weekly, and the following plea from Freda: ""Let's do it, let's do it, I feel I absolutely must / I won't exempt you, I want to tempt you, want to drive you mad with lust / No cautions, just contortions, smear an avocado on my lower portions.""

Please do not try this at home. Unless, of course, Gwyneth and Nigella have given the go-ahead.

Why the ""˜tree whisperer' says we're planting too many

World-renowned conservationist Peter Wohlleben explains his fears that mass-planting schemes could spell disaster

Peter Wohlleben has a plan to save the global canopy. And for the German forester turned bestselling author and conservationist, who is known globally as the ""tree whisperer"", it involves a somewhat unexpected argument: we should stop planting new trees.

Wohlleben claims that mass tree planting schemes in the countryside - of the sort eagerly championed by politicians - can in fact lead to ecological disaster. Often these trees are fast-growing non-native conifers which he says are ""green deserts"" for wildlife and ill-equipped to cope with the violent mood swings of a rapidly changing climate. 

In England alone, the Government has promised to plant 30,000 hectares a year by 2024. Wohlleben describes tree planting targets as the modern equivalent of Catholic Letters of Indulgence, which were awarded by the church in the Middle Ages as a remission of sin in return for a generous donation. ""That is exactly how it works today,"" says Wohlleben. ""You buy a paper that says if you fly somewhere and plant 10 trees then your sins are forgiven... It means we don't have to change our way of life, because trees will do the job.""

In his previous book, The Hidden Life of Trees, which propelled Wohlleben to global fame and earned him enough money to build a forest academy close to his home in the Eifel mountains of Western Germany, the 59-year-old outlined the astonishing ability of trees to communicate, adapt and support one another.

His latest, The Power of Trees, is more of a trunk-thumping polemic warning that without urgently changing our ways, we risk losing forests altogether. We are talking via Zoom, with Wohlleben sitting in the small office in the forester's cottage he shares with his wife, Miriam, who first urged him to start writing up his observations from a three decade career working in forests for a mainstream audience. Outside, late spring snow is softly falling. The pair, who have two children, have been married for 35 years.

Wohlleben's book has been translated into 47 languages, but rather than buying a new house, or a yacht, they have decided to invest all of the proceeds into campaigning to save forests. ""Before that [book] we lived a happy life and didn't need the money for anything so thought the best thing to do with it would be [to encourage] better forest management to save more trees,"" he says. 

There are some instances in which he claims it is appropriate to plant a forest from scratch, such as seeding open expanses of agricultural land where there are no older trees nearby. But otherwise Wohlleben believes we should simply allow nature to take its course, removing land from agriculture and enabling forests to naturally regenerate with native species which encourage biodiversity and possess healthier root systems far better adapted to extreme weather. 

In The Power of Trees, he cites research suggesting that trees pass their experiences on to their descendants far quicker than previously assumed, making them better adapted to cope with climate change. Old growth beech and oak trees can survive summer droughts by tapping into winter rainfall deeper in the soil, while newly-planted spruce, for example, are far less adaptable.

Old forests can still thrive in spite of climate change, he argues, and by cooling the landscape provide an incredibly effective barrier against it. An ancient beech on a summer's day can exhale up to 130 gallons of moisture which in turn promotes more rainfall. But stopping planting new forests, instead allowing old ones to reclaim agricultural land and naturally regenerate, does mean two things: using less wood and eating less meat. 

Wohlleben stopped eating meat four years ago, but admits he still misses the taste. ""I think we have a choice: less water, higher temperatures and meat every day, or meat once a week, locally colder climates, more rain and a better life,"" he says. To compensate farmers he proposes a system of subsidies whereby money is paid to landowners on the cooling impact of their estates.

Reducing timber consumption is a similarly thorny task. Globally, consumption of wood is forecast to increase nearly threefold from 2.2 billion cubic metres consumed today to 5.8 billion in 2050. Wohlleben claims such a rise in demand is impossible to reconcile with the fact so many newly-planted forests are dying. 

In order to use less wood, he argues, the easiest thing would be to stop burning it and recycle far more instead. Burning wood, he argues, is worse for the environment than burning coal. He is talking in particular about biomass burning of wood pellets for energy which in the UK stands at around 15 per cent of our timber consumption. Predictably, he also gives rather short shrift to domestic wood-burning stoves. ""I can understand everyone who says the gas prices are too high so they have to use it,"" he says. ""Okay, but in the future there won't be any timber to burn.""

He says that planting new forests will not be able to meet the demand as they are often trees taken from nurseries with stunted root systems which make them highly susceptible to the record heat and drought caused by global warming, as well as a host of pests and diseases. 

Last summer's record-breaking heatwave across Europe and beyond is a case in point. 

Experts have warned it will lead to a ""cascade of tree mortality"" over the coming years. According to a recent study conducted by researchers at the Technical University of Munich, the last major drought in Europe in 2018 led to the largest mass die of trees for 170 years.

""People always want to do something,"" he says of mass tree planting schemes. ""And that is exactly why we are where we are now, because we have done too much.""

His reservations about human interventions do not, however, extend to towns and cities where numerous studies have shown the powerful cooling abilities of street trees. It has been estimated that strategic urban planting can reduce temperatures by between 36F(2C) and 46F(8C). Here, Wohlleben argues, every tree counts. And beyond the science he acknowledges that every tree planted also helps fulfil a very human need: hope.

The Power of Trees by Peter Wohlleben is published by Greystone Books. He is appearing at Cambridge Literary Festival on 22 April & The Linnaean Society of London on 23 April

Apple unveils Vision Pro AR headset in most significant launch since iPhone

Key moments

Chosen by us to get you up to speed at a glance

Apple has unveiled an AR headset called the Vision Pro in the tech giant's most significant product launch since the iPhone, promising that it will be ""a new kind of computer"".

The device, which resembles a pair of ski goggles, projects apps such as web browsers, video calls and games into a wearer's visual field, making them appear huge.

The device is Apple's first foray into augmented reality, which Tim Cook, the chief executive, has said is the next major frontier in technology.

Unlike existing virtual reality (VR) headsets, wearers will be able to see the world around them while using the device. Other people will also be able to see the user's eyes through the headset's screen.

Price and user experience

Apple said the Vision Pro, which will cost $3,499 (£2,814), will be ""the most advanced personal electronics device ever"" when it is released next year.

The Vision Pro will be controlled using hand movements, eye tracking and voice instructions.

Apple showed off users experiencing a ""personal movie theatre"" while sitting on a plane, projecting several huge computer screens on a desk, and watching different sports games at the same time on multiple virtual televisions. The device will scan users' irises to verify their identity, for example to make payments or enter passwords.

Welcome to the era of spatial computing with Apple Vision Pro. You've never seen anything like this before! pic.twitter.com/PEIxKNpXBs

Mr Cook described the Vision Pro as ""a new kind of computer that augments reality by seamlessly blending the digital world with the real world"". He said it was the ""first Apple product you look through, not at.""

He also suggested that the device was the start of a long-term push into AR, saying it will ""introduce us to spatial computing"". Mr Cook has said that he ultimately wants the company to be able to fit the technology into eyeglasses.

He said the device ""will change the way we communicate, collaborate, work and enjoy entertainment"".

The high price of the Vision Pro means it will be likely to be out of reach for many people at first, although the ""Pro"" branding suggested that cheaper versions are likely to be released in future.

The product has been the culmination of years of work on AR, which has been a priority for Mr Cook but has so far struggled to become a mainstream technology.

Lightweight design

It is designed to be lightweight and not overheat, connecting to an external battery that wearers hold in their pocket. The battery will last for around two hours, or the device can be plugged in.

The launch of the device kicks off a new rivalry with Mark Zuckerberg's Meta, who has bet the Facebook owner's future on AR and sister technology VR. Meta last week announced a new version of its Quest headset.

Apple shares hit an all-time high on Monday in anticipation of the launch, valuing the world's biggest company at $2.9 trillion, but fell after the company revealed the Vision Pro's higher-than-expected price and its announcement that the new product would not be released until next year.

Apple said the Vision Pro will be released early next year in the US, and in other countries later in 2024. The staggered launch suggests initial supplies may be limited.

According to Apple, Vision Pro will revolutionise spatial computing in the way that the Mac changed personal computing and the iPhone mobile computing.

Apple Watch gets fitness upgrade

Next up is the Apple Watch, which is on version 10 of its operating system.

Apple has introduced a ""smart stack"" that will allow users to quickly rotate between ""quick views"" of different apps such as music controls, timer and the calendar.

As usual, there are new watch faces and tweaks to the fitness app, which has become a key selling point of the wearable device.

WatchOS also has new features for cyclists allowing users to view new metrics such as FTP, a measure of cycling fitness, and power zones.

There are updates for Apple's health features too. Users can log their state of mind, and the iPhone Health app will match that to other variables such as exercise levels.

Apple boosts artificial offering with i0S 17 update

Apple has previewed the upcoming version of its iPhone operating system, iOS 17, which will be released later this year.

The software will feature a ""live voicemail"" feature in the phone app, which will transcribe voicemail messages as they are being in real time, allowing phone owners to pick up a call if it is urgent.

FaceTime will allow people to leave video voicemail messages. 

Apple is also significantly upgrading its autocorrect feature, with the feature understanding entire sentences so it can correct words with context. It has also upgraded predictive text, suggesting words as you type in a similar way to Gmail.

The iMessage app is receiving a ""check in feature"" that will automatically alert loved ones when you get home.

Many of the features are a subtle rebuke to criticisms that Apple has missed the AI wave.

Apple unveils 'best and most capable lineup in the history of the personal computer'

Apple has unveiled a 15-inch version of its popular MacBook Air laptop, in addition to the 13-inch version that is currently the world's best-selling computer, technology editor James Titcomb reports.

The 15 inch MacBook Air is 11.5mm thin and weighs around 1.5kg, as well as boasting 18 hours of battery life. It will cost $1,299 - which is likely to equate to roughly the same figure in pounds.

Sales of Apple's laptops have been boosted in recent years by the launch of computers featuring its in-house M series of chips. However, they fell by around 32pc in the last quarter as the pandemic boom in computer sales faltered.

Apple also unveiled a new version of its high-end Mac Studio computer, featuring a new M2 Ultra chip, and a new Mac Pro, which is used for demanding tasks such as video editing and 3D simulation.

It means that all of Apple's computers now feature the company's own processors. Tim Cook calls it the ""best and most capable lineup in the history of the personal computer.""

Apple begins Worldwide Developers Conference

Apple's annual developers conference in California has kicked off.

The tech company has so far unveiled its new M2 Ultra, the most powerful chip made for a personal computer ever, plus the 15-inch Macbook Air, the world's thinnest laptop.

Chief executive Tim Cook is also expected to debut the VR headset, which will be the first time that the world's largest company has moved into a new product category since launching the Apple Watch nine years ago.

Ex-F1 owner to make offer for Center Parcs

CVC Capital Partners, the former owner of Formula One, is poised to table an offer for Center Parcs.

The Luxembourg-based private equity firm is reportedly among the potential buyers considering a takeover of the British chain of family holiday resorts.

Any offer made by CVC would be through its long-term Strategic Opportunities investment fund, Sky News reported. 

The potential buyout would expand CVC's UK staycation portfolio, having bought the majority stake in rival Away Resorts in 2021.

It follows reports last month that Center Parcs owner Brookfield Property Partners had appointed investment bankers to identify potential buyers for the resort's UK holiday village.

The Canadian property giant is reportedly seeking between £4bn and £5bn from the sale, which is managed by Bank of America, Barclays and Eastdil Secured.

CVC Capital Partners was approached for comment.

FTSE 100 closes flat after disapointing US services report

The FTSE 100 has roughly flat after a sharp decline during the late afternoon. It closed 0.1pc lower at 7,599.99.

The blue-chip index sank after the Institute for Supply Management's closely watched gauge of US services unexpectedly fell to the lowest level of the year.

Combined with softer orders, the decline indicates service providers are experiencing sluggish demand.

The mid-cap FTSE 250 index closed 0.19pc lower at 19,113.55. 

JP Morgan boss has 'no plans' to run for US presidency

Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan, has shutdown fresh speculation that he plans on running for the White House. 

""As he has said in the past, Jamie has no plans to run for office,"" a JP Morgan spokesman told Bloomberg. ""He is very happy in his current role.""

It comes after the long-time JP Morgan chief executive, who has been in his role since 2005, last week hinted at a political career once he steps down from the Wall Street titan. 

""I love my country, and maybe one day I'll serve my country in one capacity or another,' he told BloombergTV. 

New York hedge fund investor Bill Ackman said last week that Mr Dimon should run for president in 2024, describing him as a political centrist who could beat President Joe Biden in a primary. 

Hunt plans biggest shake-up of employee ownership schemes in 23 years

Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is planning to make it easier for employees to own shares in the companies they work for in a bid to boost economic growth.

Economics reporter Melissa Lawford has the details:

The Government has launched a call for evidence asking businesses for their views on how to improve Save As You Earn (SAYE) and the Share Incentive Plan (SIP) in what is set to be the biggest reform of employee ownership schemes in 23 years.

The call for evidence, which was first announced in Mr Hunt's Spring Budget, will likely be the widest consultation on these schemes since the introduction of the SIP in 2000.

The SAYE scheme allows employees to buy discounted shares in their company if they save money each month for three to five years, while the SIP scheme enables employers to sell shares directly to employees, or offer them as awards, tax free.

New analysis by HM Revenue & Customs shows that 81pc of employers who use the schemes found they helped boost businesses...

Handing over

I'll say cheerio for now at this point and hand over our live blog to Adam Mawardi.

I leave you with the latest gauge of the services sector in the US, which nearly stagnated in May as business activity and orders slowed.

The Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) overall gauge of services fell to 50.3, the weakest level this year, from 51.9 in April. 

The business activity index, which parallels the ISM factory output index, fell for a fourth month to a three-year low of 51.5. Combined with softer orders, the decline indicates service providers are experiencing sluggish demand.

The picture for services was more positive in the S&P Global US Services purchasing managers index, also out today:

Price pressures remain strong, says Lagarde

Christine Lagarde said inflation pressures remain powerful and borrowing costs will be raised further to tackle them.

The European Central Bank President said the full effects of the ECB's action to date is still materialising, as she reiterated that there is no clear evidence that underlying inflation has peaked. 

Food inflation remains elevated, she told the European Union in Brussels. She said:

Price pressures remain strong. 

Our future decisions will ensure that the policy rates will be brought to levels sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to our 2pc medium-term target and will be kept at those levels for as long as necessary.

Discussing eurozone banks following the wider turbulence in the industry, Ms Lagarde was optimistic. She said:

Financial stability in the euro area has proved robust so far, but we continue to assess possible risks, taking into account a wide range of indicators. 

We do not see a trade-off between financial stability and price stability in the euro area.

S&P 500 on verge of new 'bull market'

US stocks are drifting to begin what could be a quiet stretch following weeks of gains that rallied Wall Street to the edge of a so-called ""bull market.""

The S&P 500 was 0.2pc higher in early trading, and if it finishes the day there, it will be more than 20pc above where it was in mid-October. It has wobbled since and the index was last flat.

Such a rally would mean the stock market has transformed from its frigid ""bear market,"" where Wall Street's main measure of health fell more than 20pc over nine months, into a powerful bull, indicating stocks will largely rise.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1pc, while the Nasdaq composite was 0.2pc higher.

Apple poised to close at record high ahead of mixed-reality headset launch

Apple shares surged by more than 1pc as markets opened putting the world's largest company on track to close at a record high as it prepares to unveil a mixed-reality headset at its annual software developer conference.

The launch will see Apple make its first big move into a new product category since the introduction of the Apple Watch nine years ago.

It will also put it in direct competition with Facebook-owner Meta Platforms.

Like Meta's Quest Pro from last year and Quest 3 announced last week, Apple's device is likely to blend a video feed from the outside world with a virtual world displayed on screens inside the headset.

Shares of the iPhone maker have risen 1.6pc to hit a record intraday high of $183.76.

European gas prices jump 20pc

European gas futures jumped 20pc, the biggest jump since March amid signs of a tighter liquefied natural gas market and potentially stronger Asian demand for the fuel.  

Benchmark month-ahead Dutch futures rose as much as 20pc to more than â‚¬28 a megawatt-hour after last week skidding to the lowest level in two years. The UK equivalent increased by more than 21pc. 

The continent is still finding its footing after a historic energy crisis triggered by the severe supply cuts following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 

Europe has amassed higher-than-usual storage levels after a relatively mild winter, record imports of liquified natural gas (LNG) and tepid demand.  

However, traders are mindful of persistent risks, including the possibility of even lower Russian supplies and competition with Asia for LNG. 

US shipments of the fuel ""” vital for Europe's energy security ""” are currently more profitable to Asia in July, August and September, according to Bloomberg.

There's also a link to the oil market. Saudi Arabia on Sunday agreed to curb crude supply further in July to help shore up sagging oil prices. Long-term LNG contracts are often linked to oil, meaning buyers may prefer spot shipments for now.

OUCH! European #gas futures jumped >20%, the biggest jump since March amid signs of a tighter LNG market and potentially stronger Asian demand for the fuel. This again widens the price gap w/US natural gas. (via BBG) pic.twitter.com/cHnqIarRCz

US markets cautious at the opening bell

Wall Street began the week tentatively amid concerns about the impact of potential cuts in Saudi Arabian oil production next month.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened flat at 33764.04 while the broad-based S&P 500 edged up 0.1pc to 4,286.79.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose by 0.1pc to 13,257.53.

City beats Paris and Frankfurt in investment race

The City has reasserted its credentials as Europe's leading financial centre after figures showed an increase in foreign investment in Britain.

The UK landed 76 financial service projects in 2022, up 17pc from the previous year despite the economic downturn and political instability in Westminster, according to analysis by EY.

Britain was way ahead of France in second place, which had 45 projects, a fall of 25pc, while Germany and Spain followed with 31 each.

The rise in the UK was thanks to an increase in American investment, with 21 US-backed projects ""” up a quarter year-on-year. 

Anna Anthony, UK financial services managing partner at EY, said even in challenging times, investors see the UK ""as the most attractive European financial services market"".

Brokerage fined £17m for role in controversial tax scheme

Financial regulators have handed out a £17.2m fine over a company's role in controversial so-called cum-ex tax transactions.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said brokerage ED&F Man Capital Markets ""enabled"" significant volumes of dividend arbitrage trading that allowed millions of euros to be illegitimately claimed from Danish tax authorities. 

It is the fourth case brought against London brokers in relation to the trades and the largest penalty yet.

Therese Chambers, the FCA's joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said: ""It is completely unacceptable for authorised firms to make money from this kind of trading."" 

ED&F Man did not dispute the FCA's findings and was given a 30pc discount in the fine. 

Danish and German investigators separately raided the London offices of ED&F Man in November.

Cum-ex took advantage of tax laws that seemed to allow multiple investors to claim refunds of a tax that was paid only once. 

Germany abolished the practice in 2012. Some traders then targeted Denmark in similar trades and the country has said it suffered a loss of more than $2bn (£1.6bn).

Gold miner Polymetal eyes sale of Russian arm

Anglo-Russian gold and silver miner Polymetal International could be eyeing up a sale of its Russian subsidiary following the resignation of its top two bosses and being targeted by Western sanctions.

The London-listed firm, which primarily operates in Russia, said it is considering ""all possible options"" regarding divesting the Russian arm.

Shares in the company have dived since Vladimir Putin led an invasion of Ukraine in February last year.

Prior to the war breaking out, shares in the business were trading at around 1,100p. They have since lost more than 80pc of their value and are now worth about 180p.

Polymetal's chief executive, Vitaly Nesis, and chief financial officer, Maxim Nazimok, cut ties with the Russian arm of the business completely, the company said.

But they remain with the wider group and are focusing on operations in Kazakhstan, where the firm plans to relocate from its current domicile in Jersey and escape the risk of further sanctions.

It is likely to result in the company de-listing its stocks from the London markets.

It said: ""In the light of recent developments, and in the interests of preserving shareholder value, the board and the special committee have decided to consider all possible options available for divestment of JSC Polymetal and its subsidiaries.""

Oil price rallies higher amid Saudi cuts

Oil has surged even higher after Saudi Arabia said it would cut production by a million barrels a day in July.

British Airways and Boots warn staff data stolen in massive hack

Tens of thousands of British Airways and Boots staff may have had their banking and personal details hacked following a cyber attack on their payroll provider, the Telegraph can disclose.

Chief business correspondent Oliver Gill and technology editor James Titcomb have the details:

BA has written to all of its 34,000-strong workforce warning them of a ""cyber security incident which has led to the disclosure of personal information about colleagues paid through British Airways' payroll in the UK and Ireland"".

An email to BA staff - seen by the Telegraph - warns that the compromised information includes names, addresses, national insurance numbers, banking details and other information.

Boots has also emailed its employees saying that staff's names, surnames, employee numbers, dates of birth, email addresses, the first lines of their home address and national insurance numbers have been affected. It said a ""very small number"" of employees may have had other data compromised.

Read how the hack relates to Zellis, which provides payroll services.

Airline industry profits expected to double to $10bn this year

The airline industry's trade body is doubling its estimate for global industry profits this year as a surge in flying drives up ticket prices.

Airline executives from the 300 airlines represented by the International Air Transport Association descended on Istanbul over the weekend for the start of the organisation's 79th annual general meeting.

Global industry profits are now expected to reach $9.8bn (£7.9bn) this year, more than double the $4.7bn forecast in December, the IATA said today. 

It expects some 4.35bn passengers to travel in 2023, around 96pc of 2019 levels.

The trade body's director general Willie Walsh, said: ""Taking everything into account we believe this will be a good year for aviation."" 

More than 1,520 participants are taking part in the IATA AGM, the first being held since all Covid restrictions were lifted.

On the agenda are topics including sustainability, as carriers navigate the path toward achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050, as well as airlines' recovery from Covid and lessons learned from 2022's host of operational challenges. 

US markets face lacklustre open

Wall Street is poised for a subdued start to the week as investors weigh the possibility of a pause in interest rate rises by the Federal Reserve at its upcoming policy meeting.

US stocks rallied on Friday after a labour market report showing moderating wage growth in May, while investors welcomed a Washington deal that avoided a catastrophic debt default.

The benchmark S&P 500 closed at a fresh nine-month high on Friday and the tech-heavy Nasdaq scaled a new one-year peak, underpinned by gains in megacap technology stocks that have outperformed the broader market this year.

Traders are pricing in a 78.2pc chance that the Fed will hold interest rates at the conclusion of its June 13-14 policy meeting, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool, though they expect another hike in July.

In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1pc, while the S&P 500 looks flat. Futures on the Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 0.2pc.

Final Eurostar train to Disneyland Paris departs

Eurostar has ended its service to Disneyland Paris, while its Amsterdam link faces being suspended for nearly a year.

The final train from London St Pancras to Marne-la-Vallee, a station next to the theme park, departed at 10.34am today as the operator focuses on its core routes to Paris and Brussels.

Meanwhile, Dutch media reported that infrastructure secretary Vivianne Heijnen has warned that no Eurostar trains will be able to run to or from Amsterdam Centraal, the capital's main station, from June 2024 until as late as May 2025, while it is renovated.

Eurostar's direct trains to Disneyland Paris have been popular with British families since they began running in 1996.

Passengers travelling on the route in future will be forced to change trains, adding time and complexity to their journeys.

Pound slumps as markets weigh-up Fed rate raise

The pound has slumped against the dollar as markets priced in around a one-in-four chance of the US Federal Reserve raising benchmark rates this month after all, following robust jobs data on Friday.

Sterling has dropped 0.6pc against the greenback to well below $1.24.

The dollar index - which tracks the greenback against six peers - had come off the boil last week, after some Fed officials voiced a preference for a pause in rate hikes and after a breakthrough in US debt ceiling talks calmed market jitters.

Despite a surprisingly high payroll figure for May, indicating the US economy may still be running hot, analysts said the Fed may still have scope to pause rate rises as wage pressures eased and unemployment rose from a 53-year low.

Markets now put the probability of a 25 basis point hike at the meeting on June 13-14 at about 27pc.

Oil and gas 'part of our energy mix for many, many years' says Starmer

Sir Keir Starmer has tried to reassure trade union critics that Labour's energy plans would not hit jobs, claiming that oil and gas would be necessary for ""many, many years"" to come.

GMB union general secretary Gary Smith warned the party's policy to ban new oil and gas extraction licences in the North Sea would create a ""cliff edge"" that will hit jobs.

Speaking on a visit to Hinkley Point C in Somerset, Sir Keir stressed that adapting to climate change and tapping new sources of energy would bring fresh opportunities. He told broadcasters:

I think we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity now to seize the jobs of the future.

Oil and gas will be part of that, because where there is existing licences they will go on to the 2050s and so oil and gas will be part of our energy mix for many, many years to come.

But we need to seize the opportunities for the next generation of jobs. And that is in renewables, it is in nuclear, Hinkley Point C here today, staring at the future.

We have got 9,000 people working on this site, they are going to power the UK and they are the jobs of the future.

Mortgage deals pulled as market expects interest rates to rise

Another 200 residential mortgage deals were pulled over the weekend as the average rate on a two-year fixed rate deal jumped to 5.72pc.

Economics reporter Melissa Lawford has the details:

In total, 699 residential fixed-rate deals have disappeared from the market in the last two weeks - equivalent to more than one in eight mortgage deals, according to Moneyfacts.

Lenders are repricing deals fast after surprisingly high inflation data triggered large jumps in expectations for future borrowing costs.

The average rate on a two-year fix (across all deposit sizes) has climbed from 5.33pc to 5.72pc in 13 days, a jump of 0.39 percentage points. 

This means that a buyer taking out a typical £200,000 loan will have to pay an extra £780 per year compared to if they had secured a mortgage deal two weeks earlier.

The average rate on a five-year fix has climbed from 5.01pc to 5.41pc over the same period.

Asos shares surge 15pc after '£1bn takeover approach'

Asos shares have surge higher after it was reported that the troubled online fashion retailer had received a £1bn takeover approach from a company backed by China's Alibaba.

The retailer was approached by Turkish online fast fashion firm Trendyol in late December, according to a report in the Sunday Times.

It is believed that the proposed deal would have valued Asos at between £10 and £12 a share.

Talks are not thought to be active but news of the recent bid interest sent shares in Asos jumping 15pc higher at one stage in morning trading.

Trendyol - which in 2021 raised £265m from Alibaba and $1.5bn (£1.2bn) from other investors including SoftBank and the Qatar Investment Authority - is said to have been working with advisers from Morgan Stanley on the approach.

Asos has seen its shares tumble as sales have languished and costs rocketed, with customer spending coming under pressure and shoppers returning to the high street.

It was booted out of the FTSE 250 in the recent FTSE reshuffle due to its hefty stock market declines.

The group was last month forced to raise funds in order to strengthen its balance sheet, with a £75m investor cash call, as well as entering into a new £275m debt facility. Asos declined to comment on the reported takeover interest.

UK 'must future-proof' City's financial services sector

After the EY report showing the UK retained its crown as Europe's top destination for financial services investment, City of London Corporation policy chairman Chris Hayward said:

London continues to lead Europe in attracting foreign direct investment in financial services, and the sector is proving resilient despite the global challenges facing the UK economy.

That is good news for every household, because a strong City creates the wealth and jobs that support the economy and fund our public services.

But it is vital that we continue to build on this success. We must future-proof the sector to ensure we remain globally competitive and the natural choice for foreign investors.

Government borrowing costs edge higher

The cost of Government borrowing has begun ticking higher again at the start of this week as concerns linger about the health of Britain's economy.

The yield on two-year gilts, which are sensitive to rises in interest rates, has risen by seven basis points to 4.4pc today, while 10-year bond yields have climbed six basis points to 4.2pc.

Both remain around the levels seen during Liz Truss's short-lived time as prime minister.

Yields are ticking higher around the world amid worries over potential inflation that could be caused by rising oil prices, as Saudi Arabia plans to cut production by a million barrels a day from July.

Ten-year US Treasury yields have risen nearly five basis points while German 10-year bund yields have climbed nearly six basis points.

EU to extend ban on Ukrainian grain imports

The European Commission is expected to extend its ban on Ukrainian grain imports until September 15, Poland's agriculture minister has said.

The EU set restrictions until today on imports of wheat, maize, rapeseed and sunflower seed from the war-torn country to ease the excess supply of the grains in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.

Those countries had complained that cheaper Ukrainian grain was making domestic production unprofitable and had asked the EU to extend the ban.

Poland's agriculture minister Robert Telus tweeted: ""We have received from the EC a draft of a new regulation banning the import of four products to the five countries. The effective date provided for in the draft is September 15 this year. It's a draft but I hope it will come into force from tomorrow.""

Ukrainian wheat, maize, rapeseed and sunflower seed can be sold to any other country in the 27-nation bloc.

The EU had earlier liberalised all imports from Ukraine to help Kyiv's efforts to fend off Russia's invasion. The five countries became transit routes for Ukrainian grain that could not be exported through its Black Sea ports because of the war.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday called for the unconditional removal of all export restrictions on Ukrainian agricultural products at talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

UK services sector grows for fourth straight month

Britain's dominant services sector continued to expand last month but increased wage pressures pushed up cost inflation to a three-month high, according to a closely-watched survey.

The S&P Global/CIPS UK Services purchasing managers' index delivered a reading of 55.2 in May, down slightly from 55.9 in April but above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction for the fourth consecutive month.

Robust sales pipelines and greater willingness to spend from consumers, despite ongoing economic uncertainty, helped to boost order volumes in May. 

However, the overall rate of input price inflation edged up to a three-month high amid elevated wage pressures and continuing supplier price hikes.

Tim Moore, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: 

Service sector businesses have experienced strong growth so far in the second quarter of 2023, fuelled by resilient demand for consumer and technology services, combined with a post-pandemic tailwind as households switched from spending on goods to services.

Higher salary payments more than offset lower fuel costs, which meant that overall input price inflation edged up to its strongest for three months in May. 

Fueled by resilient demand for consumer and technology services, growth across the #UK's service sector remained robust in May (#PMI at 55.2; Apr: 55.9). This was despite still severe #inflationary pressures. Read more: https://t.co/Rt4oTQPxyX @cipsnews pic.twitter.com/KaO0MAcgtL

Mondi cancels sale of Russian facility

Packaging and paper group Mondi has pulled out of its deal to sell part of its Russian business to venture capital firm Augment.

It said it would not go ahead with the sale of Mondi Syktyvkar and two affiliated entities after a lack of progress in gaining the necessary approvals.

In a statement, the company said it remains committed to selling Syktyvkar and ""will continue to assess all alternative divestment options"".

A separate deal announced in December to dispose of three Russian packaging converting operations to Gotek Group is not affected.

New car registrations on longest run of expansion since 2015

The number of new car registrations in the UK has increased for the tenth straight month - its longest run in eight years - as the market continues to bounce back from the pandemic.

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said registrations increased by 16.7pc in May.

Despite the boost, sales are 21pc down on pre-coronavirus levels in 2019.

Fall in inflation will be 'gradual,' says ECB chief

A European Central Bank chief has said the surge in inflation is only slowly easing, and the dangers of a resurgence exceed those of a more rapid retreat.

Governing Council member Boris Vujcic told Bloomberg: ""Disinflation is expected to be gradual, with the risks still tilted upward driven by risks coming from the tight labour market and underlying price pressures in the services sector.""

The Croatian central bank chief spoke just under two weeks before the ECB next sets borrowing costs, with investors and economists widely expecting another quarter-point increase in the deposit rate to 3.5pc.

It is unclear whether the ECB's programme of rate increases will end at the following meeting, in July, or persist into the next one, in September. 

Mr Vujcic said wage pressures in the eurozone are ""still very lively, and we still need to see where it will stop"".

Gas prices tick higher as Saudi oil cuts deliver boost

European natural gas prices jumped along with oil after Saudi Arabia pledged additional crude-output cuts that could help provide a floor to the gas market.  

The kingdom on Sunday agreed to curb supply next month to the lowest level in several years, as the Opec+ cartel seeks to shore up sagging oil prices.

Long-term contracts in the liquified natural gas market are often linked to oil prices ""” meaning LNG buyers may prefer spot shipments for now. 

Dutch gas futures surged as much as 7.5pc and last traded 3.4pc higher at just below â‚¬24.50 per megawatt- hour.

German exports bounce back amid US and China demand

German exports bounced back in April after falling a month earlier, official data has shown, but analysts said it was too soon to see a recovery in Europe's recession-hit largest economy.

Germany exported goods worth â‚¬130.4bn (£112.4bn) in April, data published by federal statistics agency Destatis said, a 1.2pc increase on the previous month.

In March, demand for goods made in Germany plunged by 6pc.

The bounce-back was driven by a 4.7pc jump in exports to the United States, which was once again Germany's biggest export destination.

Exports to China saw a 10.1pc increase, while those to European Union countries rose by more than 4pc.

Imports fell 1.7pc in April to â‚¬112bn, leading a trade surplus of â‚¬18.4bn euros for the month.

ING bank economist Carsten Brzeski said the April rebound in exports is ""too little to make us happy"".

He said: ""Trade is no longer the strong resilient growth driver of the German economy it used to be.""

Saudi cuts help boost FTSE 100

The FTSE 100 edged up as energy companies were boosted by a pledge by top oil exporter Saudi Arabia to cut supplies.

The resource-heavy FTSE 100 has added 0.5pc, boosted by a 1.1pc jump in energy firms as oil prices advanced following Saudi Arabia's pledge to cut production by another one million barrels per day from July.

The mid-cap FTSE 250 added 0.3pc, aided by a 5.9pc surge in Asos after a Turkish retailer backed by China's Alibaba reportedly made a bid for the UK retailer.

The broader retail sector housing the stock added 0.4pc.

UK listed shares of Indivior surged as much as 10.3pc to over a four-month high after the drugmaker said it agreed to settle a lawsuit by US states accusing it of illegally suppressing generic competition for its opioid addiction treatment Suboxone.

New business lobby group launched ahead of CBI crunch vote

One of the UK's biggest business groups has positioned itself to replace the Confederation of British Industry a day ahead of a crunch vote to determine the future of the scandal-hit organisation.

The British Chambers of Commerce announced a new business council including major companies such as BP and Heathrow Airport and said large corporations were ""looking for a different kind of representation"".

It comes as the CBI fights to secure its future following a series of sexual harassment allegations, with its members poised to vote on a turnaround plan on Tuesday.

It was first cast into chaos in March when The Guardian newspaper published allegations of misconduct against the CBI's then director general, Tony Danker.

Mr Danker apologised and said that the offence or anxiety he had caused was ""unintentional"". He stepped aside while outside lawyers investigated the claims against him.

Before long though the floodgates opened - another dozen or more women approached The Guardian saying they had been victims of sexual harassment while working for the business group.

Shevaun Haviland, the British Chambers of Commerce's director general, said: ""The voice of business needs to be heard loud and clear, and now is the right time for us to speak up.""

Markets rise at the open

The FTSE 100 rose as markets opened as the commodity-heavy index was boosted by surging oil prices.

The blue-chip index climbed 0.3pc to 7,632.87 while the midcap FTSE 250 rose by the same amount to 19,206.11.

UBS poised to complete Credit Suisse takeover this month

UBS has said that it expects to complete its takeover of longtime rival Credit Suisse as early as next week.

The two Zurich-based banks are uniting in a 3 billion-franc (£2.7bn) deal that was arranged hastily in March by the Swiss government and regulators after Credit Suisse's stock plunged and jittery depositors quickly pulled out their money.

The merger was aimed at stemming upheaval in the global financial system after the collapse of two US banks shook confidence in the sector. The takeover will leave UBS as Switzerland's single banking titan.

UBS said today that it expects to complete the acquisition by as early as June 12.

It said: ""Completion is subject to the registration statement, which covers shares to be delivered, being declared effective by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and to satisfaction, or waiver by UBS, of other remaining closing conditions.""

The reputation of 167-year-old Credit Suisse was pummelled in recent years over stock price declines, a string of scandals and the flight of customers worried about the bank's future.

Prince Harry to take on Mirror over hacking claims

The Duke of Sussex is due to appear at the High Court today as his case against the publisher of the Daily Mirror over alleged unlawful information gathering begins.

Prince Harry is suing Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) for damages, claiming journalists at its titles - which also include the Sunday Mirror and Sunday People - were linked to methods including phone hacking, so-called ""blagging"" or gaining information by deception and use of private investigators for unlawful activities.

His claim is being heard alongside three other ""representative"" claims during a trial which began last month and is due to last six to seven weeks.

Prince Harry alleges about 140 articles published between 1996 and 2010 contained information gathered using unlawful methods, and 33 of these have been selected to be considered at the trial.

MGN is contesting the claims and has either denied or not admitted each of them. The publisher also argues some of the claimants have brought their legal action too late.

The Duke is due to arrive at the court in London today and is due to enter the witness box on Tuesday, when he will face cross-examination from MGN's lawyers.

Diageo boss' retirement brought forward after 'significant setback' in surgery

The world's largest spirits maker has brought forward the appointment of its new chief executive after its boss suffered complications in surgery on a stomach ulcer.

Sir Ivan Menezes, who has led Johnnie Walker maker Diageo since 2013, had announced he would retire this summer, with Debra Crew due to take over as chief executive on July 1.

However Diageo announced today that Sir Ivan, who was knighted in the King's first New Year's Honours list, has ""suffered a significant setback due to complications, which followed emergency surgery on the ulcer"". 

As a result Ms Crew has been appointed interim chief executive with immediate effect, ahead of her formal ratification to the role in July.

The company said:

Our thoughts are with our much-loved colleague, Ivan, and his family.

Out of respect for Ivan and his family's privacy, we will not be commenting further at this time.

Oil prices rise as Opec cuts production targets

Oil prices have rallied after Saudi Arabia said it would cut production by an extra one million barrels a day in July in an attempt to prop up the crude market.

The Arab state will lower its output to its lowest level in several years as Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said he ""will do whatever is necessary to bring stability to this market"".

It follows a tense meeting of the Opec+ cartel of oil-producing nations over the weekend, where the 23-member group decided it would not deepen its recent cuts to output.

Vivek Dhar, director of mining and energy commodities research at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, called Saudi Arabia's decision a ""voluntary cut"" that was ""notable more for downside protection"" .

Oil in New York tumbled 11pc last month amid concerns over the outlook for demand, especially in China. 

Today, international benchmark Brent crude has already climbed as much as 1.5pc to more than $77 a barrel, while US-produced West Texas Intermediate has risen as much as 1.6pc toward $73.

Saudi Arabia has sacrificed further market share to stabilise the market. 

While others in the group pledged to maintain their existing cuts until the end of 2024, Russia made no commitment to curb output further and the United Arab Emirates secured a higher production quota for next year.

Saudi Arabia's production cut in July could be extended, but the Saudis will keep the market ""in suspense"" about whether this will happen, Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said.

The minister has repeatedly sought to hurt bearish oil speculators, warning them to ""watch out"" in the build-up to Sunday's meeting.

Vandana Hari, founder of Vanda Insights, told Bloomberg TV: ""Saudi Arabia would ideally want prices to be above $80 a barrel, and it is now trading around $77 a barrel."" 

She added that if the health of the global economy falters, the short sellers ""will be back in no time"".

Good morning

Oil prices have advanced after Saudi Arabia said it would cut production by a million barrels a day from July, sacrificing market share in an attempt to prop up the crude market.

Brent crude, the international benchmark, has already climbed as much as 1.5pc to more than $77 a barrel, while US-produced West Texas Intermediate has risen as much as 1.6pc toward $73.

The real danger of wild swimming - and it's not what you think

As England's rivers are dubbed a ""˜chemical cocktail' of ""˜wet wipe reefs' and ""˜fatbergs', we map the UK's cleanest waterways for bathing

The wild swimming revolution has been well-documented. These days city-dwellers ritually flock to rivers and lakes at the first sight of sun, with holidays and even hen-dos now framed around the pursuit. But is there a dark secret lurking beneath the surface of our favourite swimming spots? 

Last week, Twitter user Jo Harding posted an image of a young boy lying prone on the floor next to a sick bucket. Accompanied was the caption: ""My son after playing in the River Wye at his Year Six camp this weekend. Our children can't play in rivers anymore."" She claimed that, along with her son, 10 other children became poorly after visiting a stretch of river near the village of Hoarwirthy in Herefordshire, adding: ""Our focus should be on who pollutes the river and who allows it to happen.""

It's not the only report of sickness after swimming in the UK's waterways, according to pressure group Surfers against Sewage (SAS), who says it was alerted to more 798 incidents of illness in the past year. Among the complaints were gastroenteritis, ear, nose and throat infections plus skin rashes and urine infections. The group claims pollution ""plagues our rivers, seas and coasts, making us sick and spoiling our favourite swim spots"".

When it comes water pollution, there are three driving forces: untreated sewage released by water companies accounts for roughly 35 per cent, while the overuse of fertiliser and pesticides in agriculture causes around 40 per cent of the damage. A further 18 per cent comes from chemical and litter ""run-off"" from nearby roads and towns.

Water companies are legally allowed to discharge untreated wastewater through sewer overflows during periods of heavy rain, but clean-water campaign groups claim that the practice is being abused, or at least underreported. SAS says raw sewage was dumped into designated bathing waters a shocking 5,000 times between May and September last year - a time when parts of the UK basked in heatwaves and wild swimming boomed. 

More damning details emerged last year when a report by a parliamentary committee labelled England's rivers as a dangerous ""chemical cocktail"" of sewage, agricultural waste, and plastic. It highlighted ""wet wipe reefs in rivers"" and ""fatbergs as big as blue whales clogging up drains"" as some of the key problems. 

How clean are our rivers and lakes? 

Unpicking exactly how clean our rivers are is murky, with vociferous voices on both sides of the debate. Activists such as former punk-band frontman Feargal Sharkey claim spills from water companies have turned Britain's rivers into ""open sewers"". In a letter to Tory MPs earlier this year he wrote: ""Not one English river is classed as being in a healthy condition, none meet good chemical standards and few meet good ecological standards.""

Others argue that increased monitoring of water quality over recent years has given the misleading impression of dirtier rivers. Even the Rivers Trust, a pressure group which campaigns against sewage pollution, concedes that it's currently impossible to draw any conclusions about how spills are changing year by year. This should change by 2024 when almost all storm overflows are due to be recorded. 

Still, there's no doubt there are issues. According to the Environment Agency, only 14 per cent of English rivers are of good ecological standing. And the UK came a dismal bottom for bathing water quality in Europe in 2020 - the last year it was included in the European Environmental Agency rankings. 

Given that there are multiple drivers of pollution, it's a complex problem to solve. Even if sewage discharges are reduced, for example, agricultural and chemical contamination will likely remain an issue. The Rivers Trust is calling for the Government to take more urgent action, and lobbying for a near total ban on certain types of industrial chemicals and better monitoring of their impact. 

How can I check whether my chosen wild swimming spot is safe?

While it's relatively easy to check sea water quality at beaches up and down the country through live maps from pressure groups such as Surfers against Sewage, less extensive data is currently available for rivers and lakes as only a handful are listed as designated bathing spots by the Government.

A small number of popular inland swimming spots are documented in the Environment Agency's Swimfo website, which provides up to date (and historic) data on water quality, with the most recent samples taken within the last fortnight or so. Among the spots rated ""excellent"" in its annual rankings are the popular Frensham Great Ponds in Surrey, various parts of Lake Windermere and Hampstead Mixed Ponds (though the ladies-only pool only managed to garner a ""good"" rating). Cotswold Country Park and Beach (the UK's largest inland sandy beach with a large swimming lagoon) received the top rating, as did Colwick Country Park, near Nottingham.

The Serpentine Lake in London's Hyde Park, a highly popular year-round swimming venue with its own swimming club, has only managed a rating of ""sufficient"" for three years in a row. Environment Agency monitoring found occasional problems with faecal pollution in this water, of which birds are suspected to be the main source. 

Two locations have received a ""poor"" classification, with a warning that bathing is ""not advised"". The first is a formerly popular stretch of the River Wharfe at Cromwheel just outside of the quaint Yorkshire market town of Ilkley. It seems that its location just downstream of the town's sewage treatment works has led to its high pollution levels. Meanwhile, Wolvercote Mill Stream in Oxford has also been rated ""poor"" after a survey found high levels of E Coli and Enterococci in the water. 

For historic data, the Rivers Trust has a ""sewage map"" which details the number of spills from water companies in rivers across the country last year. Unfortunately, though this may provide a general picture of discharge frequency, it's not helpful when seeking up-to-date information for your next wild swimming trip. Only Thames Water currently releases live spill data, which can be viewed here. However, other water companies are expected to provide this data soon, including Yorkshire Water and United Utilities by the end of this year. The map also doesn't include any data for Scotland and Ireland. 

In the absence of complete information, it's worth researching your destination on social media or Google to see if any alarms have previously been raised.

Seven ways to stay safe while wild swimming

Though the live data on the state of the UK's rivers remains limited and the situation changes frequently, there are some general tips for minimising your risk of injury and illness when wild swimming.

To protect the environment and make wild swimming safer, clean-river campaigners want more transparency from water companies (including live spill data across the board), and increased government regulation of the use of harmful chemicals in everyday products. On a smaller scale, the Rivers Trust is also encouraging the public to get involved in litter picking events and fundraising.

Professor Paul Berg, Nobel laureate and pioneer of genetic engineering - obituary

Following his 1972 paper on ""˜cutting and pasting' DNA, he called for an international meeting to draw up ethical and practical guidelines

Paul Berg, who has died aged 96, was a Nobel Prize-winning scientist who first showed that it was possible to select fragments of DNA and insert them into the genetic material of a new host; but he was so worried by the implications that he rang the scientific alarm bells.

All life on Earth evolved from a common ancestor, and chemically speaking all DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the same, so it can be effectively ""cut and pasted"" together in different combinations using certain enzymes as ""molecular scissors"" and others as ""molecular glue"".

In 1972 Berg, an expert in enzymes at Stanford University, published a paper in Nature showing that DNA from the bacterium E coli, which lives in the human gut, could be combined with the DNA of a simian virus known as SV40.

This technique of creating ""recombinant DNA"" (rDNA) opened huge possibilities, ranging from finding cures for diseases and developing improved crops, to producing virulent super-pathogens, and interfering with the natural processes of reproduction by creating ""designer babies"".

In 1974 in a letter to the journal Science Berg and 10 colleagues expressed ""serious concern that some of these artificial recombinant DNA molecules could prove biologically hazardous"" and called for a scientific meeting to draw up ethical and practical guidelines.

In February 1975, more than 140 scientists from around the world gathered at Asilomar, Pacific Grove, in California, at which they hammered out a general set of principles that included limits on the types of genes used and safeguards to keep rDNA confined to laboratories. The guidelines were subsequently adopted by regulators in the US, the UK and elsewhere.

Berg's breakthrough laid the path for a biotech revolution, with the development of GM (genetically modified) crops and gene therapy and massive advances in the scientific understanding of biological processes. Early products included vaccines for types of hepatitis and human insulin; more recently, rDNA has been used in the development of monoclonal antibodies that can be used as part of covid treatment, and in coronavirus vaccines.

Berg, who never patented his work, shared the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Walter Gilbert and Frederick Sanger.

Many of the ground rules established in 1975 have been revised or set aside as scientists developed a greater understanding of genetics and Berg remained at the forefront of the developing ethical debate.

A keen proponent of using embryonic stem cells in medical research, when President George W Bush, under pressure from religious groups, restricted the use of federal funds in such research, he castigated the decision as ""un-American"", pointing out that the cells, which come from fertility clinics, would otherwise be destroyed anyway.

But he always stood by his earlier caution, and in 2018, when a Chinese scientist claimed that he had created the world's first genetically edited baby, Berg called for a moratorium on the clinical use of technologies for the editing of heritable genes.

One of three sons, Paul Berg was born on June 30 1926 in Brooklyn, New York, to Harry Berg and Sarah, nÃ©e Brodsky, impoverished Russian immigrants. His father was a furrier. Paul's studies at Pennsylvania State University were interrupted by war service as an ensign in the Navy.

After graduation in 1948 he took a doctorate from Western Reserve University, Cleveland. Then, after postdoctoral work in Denmark, he joined Arthur Kornberg at Washington University School of Medicine as an assistant professor of microbiology.

In 1959 he followed Kornberg to Stanford, where in the 1980s he led a campaign to build the Beckman Center for Molecular and Genetic Medicine, which opened in 1989 and of which he was director until 2000.

In 1947 Paul Berg married Mildred Levy, who died in 2021. A son survives him.

Paul Berg, born June 30 1926, died February 15 2023

Piglet litters becoming too big for sows to feed babies

Campaigners call for crackdown on breeding of ""˜super pigs' as ministers prepare new regulations on animal health and welfare

Intensive breeding and antibiotic use on farms has led to pigs having litters so large that they are unable to feed all their piglets, ministers have been warned as they prepare new national regulations on animal health and welfare.

Campaigners have called for a crackdown on the breeding of so-called ""super sows,"" which are capable of birthing more than 17 piglets per litter. The animals only have 14 teats meaning some piglets are deprived of nutrition and die shortly after birth.

Helen Browning, the CEO of the Soil Association, a charity that campaigns against intensive farming, said: ""They can't sustain the lactation when they've got that many piglets without the piglets starting to get shorter or the sow getting too thin.

""We shouldn't be pushing this practice to the extreme.""

The latest data from the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), a statutory body funded by farmers, show that the best performing farms in Britain birth an average of 17.03 piglets per litter - one of the highest rates in the world.

Large piglet litters not only place the animals under stress but risk fuelling antimicrobial resistance, scientists say. 

Pigs born in large numbers are forced to start weaning at an early age due to a lack of milk, which can lead to stomach infections and diarrhoea that require antibiotics.

""Early weaning isn't the only driver, but it's certainly the largest contributor to antibiotic use in the industry,"" said CÃ³ilÃ­n Nunan, a scientific adviser to the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics campaign group.

Concern over growing piglet litter sizes in the UK comes as the government consults with the farming sector over proposed amendments to the country's Veterinary Medicines Regulations, which have been hardly changed since their introduction in 2013.

The consultation, set to conclude by 31 March, will address controls on the manufacture, distribution, and administration of veterinary medicines and medicated feed in Britain.

Last month, Lord Benyon, Minister for Biosecurity, Marine and Rural Affairs, said the proposals aim to ""strengthen regulations"" and support the UK in ""continuing to be a world leader in animal health and welfare"".

Increased piglet mortality

The size of an average pig litter in the UK now stands at 15.48, up from less than 12.5 in 2010, according to AHDB data.

Kate Parkes, an RSPCA pig welfare expert, said: ""We are aware that litter sizes for pigs have been increasing in recent years.

""Reducing pig litter size should reduce pre-weaning mortality so there is a benefit to both animal welfare and the producers themselves in doing this.""

Studies have found that large litter size is associated with increased piglet mortality, low birth weight, teat competition, decreased milk consumption, and impaired gut and immune function.

As well as improving pig welfare, a reduction in piglet litter sizes and shift away from early weaning would help to further cut Britain's antibiotic use, Mr Nunan said.

The overuse of antibiotics - in both humans and animals - poses a serious threat to global health. Some researchers predict that antibiotic resistance will cause 10 million annual deaths by 2050, surpassing cancer as the leading cause of mortality worldwide.

Although the administration of antibiotics on UK farms has been halved since 2014, usage rates still remain high compared to other European countries, such as Sweden and Norway.

Mr Nunan said: ""We want the minimum weaning age to increase, to improve animal health and welfare, and to reduce antibiotic use. At the moment there is little evidence of this happening, in spite of growing restrictions on antibiotic use.""

He also raised concern over farmers' use of chemical compounds, known as ionophores, which are added to poultry and pig feed to help prevent their animals contracting infections.

The compounds, which aren't currently approved for human consumption, possess antibacterial effects and there is growing evidence that their use among animals is helping to fuel AMR.

In the UK between 2013 and 2017, despite the use of medically important antibiotics declining from 94 tonnes to 14 tonnes, the use of ionophores rose from 209 tonnes to 281 tonnes, according to research.

""There definitely should be a reconsideration of the use of ionophores to prevent disease in animals,"" said Mr Nunan. ""It's certainly something that we will be raising during the consultation with the government. More research definitely needs to be done.""

Dr Mariel Pikkemaat, of Wageningen University & Research, said the ""prevalence of ionophore resistance"" was ""a cause for concern"".

Veganism is in crisis, and the fanatics can only blame themselves

The arguments for plant-based alternatives are crumbling. So too is support for what may in future be viewed as little more than a fad

Q ""How do you tell if someone is a vegan?"" 

A: ""You don't have to, they'll tell you."" 

Maybe it's jokes like that, highlighting society's stereotypical view of vegans as arrogant virtue-signallers, that have led to a slump in demand for some plant-based alternatives to meat and dairy, as well as a slew of business failures among manufacturers of plant-based food - most recently Heather Mills's company VBites, which has just announced it is going into administration. 

Despite veganism being endorsed by a number of celebrities, such as the BBC's controversial wildlife presenter Chris Packham, it doesn't seem to have made much headway beyond those segments of the market that are either apocalyptic about climate change or fanatical about animal rights - or both. Perhaps much like Mr Packham himself. 

Then there's the argument that veganism is good for your health, which has been on an increasingly sticky wicket, deconstructed by books such as the award-winning The Great Plant Based Con by Jayne Buxton. There is also a growing backlash against ultra-processed foods, which many vegan products are. 

But Ms Mills had the gall to blame ""gaslighting"" by the meat industry for the collapse of her vegan food empire. As a member of the meat ""industry"", I take exception to that. Of course it is not really an industry at all in the UK - it is made up of family farms, in stark contrast to the public relations agencies promoting vegan diets. 

Farmers have been hounded and smeared by radical vegan activists for years. I wrote in these pages back in September about Laura Corbett, the Gourmet Goat Farmer, who was targeted by vegan ""activists"" on social media. Her business was attacked by malicious Trip Advisor reviews. 

Indeed, I would suggest that consumers have been put off by the taint of fanaticism surrounding vegan foods. Recent research has shown that omnivorous consumers are less likely to buy products if they are labelled with the V-word. While it is too early to consign veganism to the history books, I suspect when that history is written it will be seen as a fad that was rejected by the British public largely because the wild behaviour of its more extreme followers trashed the brand. 

It always seemed unlikely that, after millennia evolving on an omnivorous meat-rich diet, we would then wholly abandon it. There is only one species that has ever done that: the panda. And that has not been an unqualified success. 

If the vegans had wanted to actually persuade people to eat better, rather than hector them, they could have chosen a much less blunt message. But a more effective, nuanced approach, focused on stopping the harmful aspects of meat and dairy production, was not pursued and all livestock farmers were tarred with the same brush. This happened even after the positive environmental role of grass-based beef farmers was recognised by the authorities, as they began to be paid carbon credits for the net carbon they sequester.

We can't allow vegans to continue to ruin the debate about food. We need a real food counter-revolution.

""˜I'm a multi-millionaire - and I want to pay more tax'

The founder of Riverford Organics and member of Patriotic Millionaires UK is on a mission to shake up the country's tax system

""The millionaire who wants to pay more tax"" is how one headline described Guy Singh-Watson this week, after the founder of Riverford Organic Farmers, whose annual turnover has topped £100""‰million, invited the Prime Minister to hit those like him (with more than £10""‰million) with a new wealth tax. He also demanded that Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty join him in paying the new tax so as to raise an estimated £50""‰billion for the hard-pressed public finances.

In his scruffy T-shirt Singh-Watson, whose company delivers its boxes of seasonal and sustainable organic vegetables from courgettes to cardoons to 65,000 homes around the country every week, certainly doesn't dress like a millionaire. When we speak over Zoom he looks as though he has just walked in from working in the fields, but then the 63-year-old is, in his own words, an unrepentant ""Birkenstock-wearing hippie"".  

When I quote the headline to him, he grimaces. ""That does slightly get my hackles up, to be honest. I'd prefer to be known as the millionaire who wants all millionaires to pay more tax. I don't want it to be an act of charity, but an obligation, as all tax should be.""

He is one of a group of around 40 other wealthy figures who have given a public endorsement to the tax proposals being put forward by a group called Patriotic Millionaires UK (PMUK). Others members include Ian Gregg of the eponymous bakery chain, James Perry, founder of Cook, the frozen food company, and Dale Vince of green energy firm, Ecotricity, who was promoting the wealth tax on the BBC's Question Time this week (as well as defending his support for Just Stop Oil).  

""Patriotic Millionaires [it is based on a similarly-minded American lobbying group] is quite a controversial name, I suppose,"" concedes Singh-Watson. ""It always slightly sticks in my throat as I say it because it makes me think of Patronising Millionaires UK.

""If it makes people sit up, maybe it is not a bad time to do that. It invites a debate about what it means to be patriotic. I would say that people who go to any length to avoid paying tax are not very patriotic.""

Singh-Watson freely acknowledges that he is someone who likes to be provocative and challenging. ""Since I started Riverford up in 1986, it has been challenging the conventional ways of producing and distributing food, and of farming."" That is now being extended to embrace our tax system.

Among other proposals he and his fellow millionaires are making is levying income tax on all income, whether earned or unearned (currently the latter attracts lower rates of capital gains tax), closing tax loopholes, and removing the tax-free threshold on inheritance. ""In the long run, I don't think this country is going to run without the rich paying more of their share, related to their assets and not just their income. Otherwise society will break down.""

This is not, as some have suggested, just another case of grandstanding by a Champagne socialist. Singh-Watson lives the values he preaches.

In May, Riverford became 100 per cent owned by its 1,000 or so staff after its founder, influenced by the John Lewis partnership model, sold the remaining 23 per cent of the Riverford shares he held to them for £9.8""Šmillion. The initial 74 per cent, valued by accountants at upwards of £22""Šmillion, was sold to them in 2018 for £6""Šmillion.

Singh-Watson will take the £9.8""Šmillion payment over five years and has handed over full control to a trust on behalf of its staff, who each receive an annual profit share and participate as co-owners in the running of the business.

""I was thinking about setting up a charitable trust and putting the money raised into that to avoid paying tax,"" Singh-Watson explains, ""and it was really as a result of speaking to PMUK, that I was convinced that I should just pay my tax."" Paying more, he hopes, will enable him to ""enjoy my wealth without feeling guilty that there are people who can't afford to feed their children before they go to school"".

It is not, he is keen to make plain, that he is suggesting the very rich pay more tax as an alternative to giving money to charitable causes. They can afford to do both.

""We've been supporting the local school"" - he lives with his second wife, Geetie 53, an award-winning restaurateur, at Buckfastleigh in south Devon where he grew up - ""which was going to have to close its design and technology facility because it didn't have the funding."" And there has been money too for the [comprehensive] school in nearby Totnes that he went to, as did his five children, all now in their 20s, four from his first marriage and one with Geetie.

""It was having to sell off its playing fields because they are not adequately funded. Schools shouldn't be reliant on people like me to provide basic facilities.""

His argument isn't just a practical one - that the state needs more tax revenue to better fund all schools. He talks too and without embarrassment about morality. ""In most people's terms of morality, putting your money in an offshore trust may be legal but it is immoral.""

Any hint of a moral crusade usually prompts a backlash and in pragmatic economic terms, some economists have questioned the net effect of his proposals on a wealth tax. Putting up taxes on the very rich, they suggest, only ever causes them to redouble their efforts at tax avoidance.

""It is up to the Government and HMRC to design a system that makes that more difficult. There are things we can do to make it less easy to offshore your wealth. I'm sure a small minority [of people with more than £10""Š million] will move abroad and good riddance to you, I would say, but the majority will stay because they like what Britain has to offer, and a few of them may even feel some sort of patriotic desire to support the society that has supported them. We are not all motivated by greed and self-interest.""

Singh-Watson attributes his values to his parents, Gillian and John, tenant farmers who ran Riverford Farm from the 1950s. ""Dad was a fallen aristocrat on the way down and Mum was solidly middle class.""

Both had been involved in war - she drove an ambulance, and he was in the Army. ""They believed the fight had been to create a world fit for heroes. So, they were proud of the welfare state, the NHS and taught us the importance of positive social change.""

The youngest of five, he was working on the family farm ""as soon as I could pull on a pair of wellies"". After university and a brief, unhappy spell as a management consultant, he returned home, started growing vegetables on a small plot on the family farm, selling them to locals and delivering them in an old Citroen CV. In 1986 Riverford Organics was born.

Today Riverford works with farmers around the country who share its organic, sustainable values to fill the veg boxes. After seeing a spike in demand during lockdown - ""along with all other home-delivery companies"" - tougher times have followed as demand dropped once people were free to go out again, and now with the cost of living crisis. At between £14.75 and £26.15, Riverford's boxes are, for many, a luxury item.

""I'm not going to pretend our veg is cheap. To produce food in the right way is not cheap,"" he says.

Does it worry him that what he produces is out of the reach of people on low income? ""Of course it does, and when I sold the last tranche of Riverford I left £1""Šmillion in the business to spend on trying to find a way to get good quality food to people on lower incomes. We are not going to solve that on our own but we will pioneer some routes.""

He remains involved in the business. The shared ownership approach is working, he reports, perhaps better than at John Lewis, which is currently looking at diluting it - the result of ""bad decisions and losing their edge"" Singh-Watson diagnoses.  

The rest of the time, he is back being a farmer. His latest venture is around eco-agriculture, planting hazelnut, walnut and chestnut trees in meadows where cattle and sheep graze as a way of promoting biodiversity.

And what will he do with the money he has accumulated, given that neither Sunak nor Keir Starmer has picked up the phone to invite him to brief them on raising taxes? Will his children inherit it or will he follow the model of Body Shop founder Anita Roddick and Bill Gates and leave them to make their own way in the world?

""When does the support that most people would expect a good parent to provide become nepotism and not a good thing? I have helped two of my children to buy a house and have offered the other three when the time comes.""

Two of them, he explains, are teachers on modest incomes. ""I like what they are doing with their lives, so I support them. It is a privilege I feel uncomfortable with and they feel uncomfortable with. I'd love to live in a world where houses weren't so ridiculously expensive that teachers can't afford to buy them.""

He isn't, he insists in response to those who label him as such, an idealist. ""Capitalism can be fantastic in terms of innovation and getting flows of capital to new ideas, and to freaks on the fringes like me. But I like the Scandinavian sort, with a longer term and a social contract that means you don't rip people off.""

Why your morning coffee is facing extinction

Fifty per cent of the world's coffee-growing land could disappear by 2100 - these scientists and farmers are trying to save it

Every morning, before doing anything else, I make coffee. It's a ritual as much as a caffeine fix, with little thought given to its provenance. Yet this morning, I've got my hands on something a little different. Lighter in colour than my usual jet-black brew, it is more nuanced in flavour, with hints of grapefruit and less bitterness. It is delicious. It may also secure the future of one of the world's most popular drinks. 

In Britain, we drink about 98 million cups per day, with an estimated two billion consumed worldwide. The coffee industry sustains 210,000 jobs here, and around 100 million farmers depend on it globally. From instant coffee at a greasy spoon to a fancy oat-milk latte, coffee is big business. Yet its future is at risk. 

A recent report by Christian Aid warned that climate change could reduce the land available for growing coffee by 54 per cent by 2100, even if global temperatures are kept to internationally agreed targets. On May 17, the World Meteorological Organisation said that temperatures could breach the 1.5C above pre-industrial levels by 2027. It's not good news for coffee growers and lovers. 

According to Dr Aaron Davis, a global expert in coffee and climate change, and head of coffee research at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, coffee is one of the most researched plants when it comes to climate change, with almost 150 studies published, and the outlook seems dire. Even if commitments to reduce carbon emissions are met, a 2022 study in Nature suggests coffee production will still see a rapid decline in countries accounting for 75 per cent of the world's arabica coffee supply.  

""It's not something that's going to happen in the future, it's already happening,"" says Dr Davis. ""It's very real."" 

The world's largest producer, Brazil, and Vietnam, the second, have both experienced concerning weather patterns just this year: extreme heat and drought in Vietnam, heavy rains in Brazil. ""Last year, coffee harvests were influenced by drought in many countries, and long-term climate change may cause those drought periods to become longer, more severe and more regular,"" Dr Davis explains. In Uganda, exports fell by about 20 per cent in 2022. 

Coffee is a picky plant, requiring the right conditions to flourish. Global production focuses on just two of the 130 known species; a lack of genetic diversity makes it particularly susceptible to disease and pests. Arabica is a cool-tropical plant, comfortable in mean annual temperatures of about 19C. It is considered superior, in terms of flavour, and accounts for 56 per cent of coffee production. Robusta makes up 43 per cent, and can grow at lower elevations and higher annual mean temperatures, but is mostly reserved for instant coffee and blending. 

Coffee can only be grown in the ""bean belt"", between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, and needs the right amount of rain and heat to thrive. When that changes - as is happening in most coffee-growing areas - it can wreak havoc on harvests. The effects of pests and disease, often exacerbated by changing weather, are also a concern. Arabica is particularly susceptible to leaf rust, a fungal disease that stunts the plant's growth and yield. It destroyed most of Sri Lanka's crop in the late 19th century and hit South America hard in the early 21st century. 

""It remains a major constraint for coffee production,"" says Dr Davis, while coffee berry disease and coffee wilt disease are hampering Africa's production of arabica and robusta. To save your morning macchiato, scientists are ramping up the search for new species and varieties of coffee, ones that might be more drought or disease resistant, or be able to be grown in higher temperatures. 

One such species is Coffea stenophylla, a rare coffee from West Africa. In 2018, Davis was part of a team that rediscovered the plant in the Sierra Leonean jungle - it hadn't been seen in the wild there since 1954. A study released in 2021 posited that its tolerance of high temperatures and its superior flavour - professional tasters likened it to the best arabica - could lead to it becoming a key coffee of the future. 

Will Corby, director of coffee and social impact at Pact, a UK-based sustainability- and ethics-focused coffee importer and subscription service, agrees new species are the key to coffee's future, but sounds a word of caution: ""We don't know whether farming [them] is going to be commercially viable from a cost perspective."" 

Dr Davis is also working with colleagues and farmers in Uganda and South Sudan on another species, known as excelsa, first discovered in Central Africa at the turn of the 20th century. It never reached the mass market. According to farmers who are using it, excelsa tolerates higher temperatures and drier conditions than robusta and, for many, has a better flavour. 

""We're working with farmers and exporters to develop a market for it in Uganda,"" he explains. ""We've got something like three to four tons for export this year, but in 10 years, Uganda and South Sudan could be producing several hundred tons."" 

In Brazil, farmers are highly concerned. At Fazenda Ambiental Fortaleza (FAF), a 150-year-old coffee farm in the hills a few hours from Sao Paulo, Felipe Croce and his family have turned the farm into an open-air laboratory, where Croce experiments with new, climate-friendly methods. The trees house monkeys and toucans; at night, wolves can be heard near the farmhouse. It feels more like a nature reserve than a farm, more jungle than the neat monocultures often seen in Brazil, but FAF is behind some of the country's best coffee. 

""Coffee is at medium- to high-risk with climate change,"" Croce tells me. ""We can adapt, but this takes investment, research and development in new techniques, and we may see movements in the near future of demand surpassing supply."" He says that is ""highly likely"" 10 to 20 years from now, ""if we don't make some serious changes to how coffee is grown"". 

Croce says Brazil suffered one of its worst ever frosts in 2021, causing a momentary shortage in coffee supply and an increase in price of more than 100 per cent, year on year. Certain coffee-growing areas of Brazil are already being abandoned, according to Croce, while other regions experiencing longer periods above 30C are becoming challenging. At FAF, coffee is grown in shade, under banana trees, or even within the forest. Most Brazilian coffee is grown directly in the sun - where it reaches harvest more quickly - but growing it in shade helps lower temperatures, can provide refuge for animals, helps sequester more carbon and is coffee's natural environment. Banana trees protect it from frost, too. 

Yet changing farming methods can be expensive and risky for farmers, while growing on new land risks deforestation. FAF works with more than 300 family farms to help them grow and export their crop, with the coffee sent across the world, including to the UK. 

Disease-resistant varieties of arabica and robusta developed by genetic scientists are crucial to combating disease and climate change. At FAF, new varieties, including some developed internally, have been introduced successfully. Pact also encourages the farmers it works with to grow climate-resistant varieties.

""In the past five years, we've seen dramatic changes in the wet and dry seasons, and a massive increase in the volume of rain,"" says Corby. ""Historic varieties of coffee don't have the disease resistance you'd expect from modern varieties."" New varieties of arabica, developed with the Colombian government, have produced a higher yield and disease resistance. One, parainema, is truly delicious - it's the coffee that ended up in my cup this morning - and could help secure the future of coffee. 

""New varieties are going to be vital to the continued production of coffee over the next few decades,"" says Corby. Pact was the first roaster to import another promising new coffee, CenicafÃ© 1, and Corby is optimistic about its potential. ""I think it's going to be revolutionary worldwide,"" says Corby. ""It should be exciting for everybody, there's so much tasty coffee to come.""

How to drink coffee ethically

Buy better 

Buying coffee ethically, which provides a better income for the growers, as well as more sustainable growing practices, generally costs more. Pact's Will Corby acknowledges this can be difficult. ""Right now, there's no silver bullet for consumers,"" he says, ""with too many different types of certification."" Pact buys directly from the producers and pays above Fairtrade prices, but its coffee starts at £7.95 for a 250g bag. Corby says the company's rapid growth proves there is a thirst for ethical coffee.

Recycle pods 

In 2021, it was estimated that almost 30,000 coffee pods go to landfill each month. They can take 500 years to decompose. Buying recyclable - or, preferably, reusable - pods can go a long way to reducing waste. Some pod brands have their own recycling schemes, while reusable pods can be refilled at home and used on your machine. Look out for compostable pods, too.

Three easy ways to... eat meat the healthy way

If you're worried about the health risks of eating meat, here's how you can still get the nutritional benefits

If you belong to the quarter of the UK population actively reducing their meat consumption, a recent study from the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation might give you pause for thought. 

They concluded that meat provides important nutrients such as protein, iron, zinc and vitamin B12, which cannot be obtained as easily from plant foods. 

But if you're worried about the health risks of eating meat (red and processed meats have been associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes), here's how you can still get the nutritional benefits.

Favour white meat

A 2021 review of 22 studies found ""a robust and inverse association between white meat consumption and all-cause mortality"", which suggests white meat is healthier than red or processed meat. 

While we immediately think of chicken, turkey is slightly lower in fat and calories (100g turkey breast has 147 calories, compared with 165 for the same-sized chicken breast).

Spicy turkey meatballs

1. Place 500g turkey mince in a bowl, season well and mix. Roll into 20 x 25g balls. 

2. Brown for 10 minutes in a large pan with 1 tbsp oil on a medium heat. 

3. Remove to a plate. 

4. Add to the pan: 1 tbsp white wine vinegar, a tin of chopped tomatoes, 1 tsp lemon juice, ½ tsp cinnamon, ½ tsp chilli powder, 1 tsp dried herbs, 1 tsp honey and season. Simmer for 5 minutes, add the meatballs and simmer for 10 more minutes.

Minimise processed meats

The NHS advises we eat no more than 70g a day of red or processed meat (like ham, salami and sausages) as it increases our cancer risk - that's equivalent to just one rasher of bacon. 

These broccoli burgers use just 50g of bacon to make four burgers, so you get all that bacon-y flavour without the health downsides.

Broccoli, bacon and cheddar burgers

1. Preheat the oven to 200C/180C fan. 

2. Place a whole head of broccoli in a pan of boiling water for three minutes, immerse in cold water, pat dry and transfer to a food processor. 

3. Pulse until finely chopped and place in a bowl. 

4. Next, whizz up a slice of brown bread in the food processor to make breadcrumbs and add to the bowl. 

5. In a large frying pan, on a medium heat, fry 50g diced bacon and ½ a diced onion in 1 tsp of oil for five minutes, until softened. 

6. Add to the bowl along with 50g grated cheddar, 1 whisked egg and salt and pepper, then knead everything together. 

7. Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Divide the mixture into four and shape into burgers, place on the tray and bake for 20 minutes.

Choose high-welfare red meat

The charity Compassion in World Farming reports that higher-welfare beef, where the cows are pasture-fed and not given antibiotics or growth promoters, contains up to 50 per cent less saturated fat and up to 430 per cent more healthy omega 3 fat than factory-farmed meat. 

By also choosing a naturally lean cut of red meat, like pork tenderloin, you will be reducing your saturated fat intake yet further.

Harissa pork tenderloin

1. Preheat the oven to 200C/180C fan. 

2. Mix in a bowl 1 clove crushed garlic, 1 tbsp olive oil, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tbsp harissa, 1 tbsp honey, 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp paprika, salt and pepper. 

3. Coat a 500g pork tenderloin with the mixture, place in the oven in a roasting tin for 25 minutes. 

4. Rest under foil for 10 minutes then slice and arrange on a serving plate, with any escaped juices poured back over. Pork tenderloin can be eaten slightly pink, hence the relatively short cooking time.

The germiest place in your kitchen - according to scientists

Should we be bleaching the basil? A new study points to dangers lurking in your spice rack

If you had to choose, which part of your kitchen would you guess is the most dangerous? The knife drawer? The gas oven? 

According to a recent study, it might be somewhere far less obvious. Researchers commissioned by the US Agriculture Department Food Safety and Inspection Service recruited 371 people for a study looking at how substances can contaminate different foods in our kitchens. 

Crucially, these participants thought they were testing new recipes. In fact, they were taking part in a study of cross-contamination. According to the Food Standards Agency's latest scientific review, about 2.4 million cases of foodborne illness occur every year in the UK alone. 

Cross-contamination: a tricky issue

And, one of the American study's senior authors, Benjamin Chapman, says: ""Cross-contamination - usually pathogens from raw meat or seafood moving to surfaces or other foods through hands or utensils - is one of the most important factors in reducing the chance of foodborne illness in the home."" 

Cooking to safe temperatures and personal hygiene are major factors in spreading norovirus, hepatitis A and Shigella infections. But, he says, ""A lot of pathogens can be transferred through cross-contamination - salmonella, campylobacter, pathogenic E.coli, listeria..."" 

Fall prey to one of these nasties and ""symptoms range from relatively mild discomfort to serious, life-threatening illness in some people"", says Anthony Wilson, microbiologist at the UK's Food Standards Agency. ""Anyone can get food poisoning, but some people have a higher risk, such as pregnant women, young children, older people, and those with weak immune systems,"" he warns. 

Plus, as Chapman points out, of all the drivers of food poisoning, cross-contamination ""is a particularly tricky issue"". He says: ""Bacteria or viruses can't be physically seen, so it's really hard to figure out what might be harbouring pathogens in your kitchen."" Or, at least, it was before his study shed light on these lurgies. 

The study

Volunteer participants were asked to make a turkey burger from scratch. Unbeknown to them, their mince had been inoculated with a harmless tracer bacteria called MS2. ""It is quite common to not tell the individuals that they are part of this kind of research,"" says Donald Schaffner, the study's lead author and a professor in the department of food science at the Rutgers School of Environmental and Biological Sciences in New Jersey. Why? 

""That knowledge may have caused them to behave differently. We want them to behave normally as they would usually do in the kitchen,"" he says. Once the cooks left their kitchens, scientists swooped in, swabbing kitchen surfaces (from utensils to countertops) for traces of cross-contamination. 

The result? ""The surfaces where we observed microorganisms included: knife handle, cutting board, frying pan and electric handles, inner sink surface, dishcloth and sponge, tap handle, soap dispenser, refrigerator handle and trash bin lid,"" says Schaffner. 

No great surprises then. And there was relatively good news on this front too: ""For most surfaces, positivity did not exceed 20 per cent."" 

Festering fenugreek

There was, however, one unexpected outlier. A hotspot that surprised even the researchers. Spice jars. 

""Forty-eight per cent of the samples showed evidence of cross-contamination,"" says Schaffner. ""They also had the highest concentrations of the marker microorganism."" 

Not only were spice jars the most commonly contaminated surface in the kitchen, they also tended to be the most highly or intensely contaminated. More than your bin lid, your knife, or even your sink. Why? 

""Consumers may not necessarily think to wipe down or decontaminate spice containers after cooking because they are not typically targeted as high risk for cross-contamination in consumer messaging,"" the study concluded. We spray and wipe our chopping boards, knives and sinks diligently. But we forget the festering fenugreek. So just how risky is the spice rack? 

""If one were to handle a contaminated spice container, and then accidentally put one's finger in one's mouth, this might result in ingestion of pathogens and subsequent illness,"" says Shaffner. ""But it's hard to figure out just how damaging or dangerous to our health spice containers might be. 

""Once the microorganism has been transferred to the spice container, it slowly dies over time. But it's certainly possible that you would be able to detect the organism days or in some cases weeks later."" 

His advice? ""Every time you touch raw meat, you are likely to have pathogens on your hands. Anything you touch after touching raw meat will become contaminated with those pathogens."" Even the spice jar you reach for right in the middle of meal prep. 

So, says Shaffner: ""Wash your hands with soap and water."" 

But no need to bleach the basil just yet.

Dyson's family-owned parent company paid £1.2bn dividend

Sir James steadily increases cash payments to Weybourne Holdings

Dyson has paid out a record £1.2bn in dividends to its parent company as Sir James Dyson funds investments in farming and insurance.

Accounts filed in Singapore showed Dyson had increased its payout to Weybourne Holdings, owned by the Dyson family, from £1bn in 2021 to £1.2bn last year.

Sir James, Britain's fifth-wealthiest man with a net worth of £23bn according to the Sunday Times Rich List, has steadily increased the cash payments from Dyson to Weybourne in recent years. Dyson has paid out £4.3bn in the last five years, according to Bloomberg.

Dyson was founded in Britain but established corporate headquarters in Singapore in 2019. Sir James moved his residency back to Britain in 2021. The Dyson family is the company's ultimate shareholder.

Dyson, best known for its vacuum cleaners and hairdryers, enjoyed record sales of £6.5bn last year but pre-tax profits fell from £1.3bn to £1.1bn.

This was partly due to the closure of its Russia business as well as growing investment in staff and research and development. The company said earlier this year that a combination of higher shipping and logistics costs had cost it £120m.

Dyson, founded by Sir James in 1991, has expanded from its core vacuum cleaner business to air purifiers, lighting and last year, a set of headphones with a face covering that cleans the air its wearer breathes.

Earlier this year, the company unveiled plans to build its own batteries for the first time with a plant in Singapore that would manufacture ""next generation"" cells that would mean lighter and longer-lasting products.

It also announced a £100m software and artificial intelligence hub in Bristol.

Sir James has invested heavily in farmland and equipment across the UK, saying earlier this year he had spent £120m in equipment to help revitalise British farming with robot fruit pickers and AI-assisted sprayers. Weybourne has also set up an insurance business, Alpinia.

Accounts filed by his farming business showed revenues of £35m last year and a £3.9m profit.

Sir James has also invested in real estate, owning around £287m of UK property according to reports.

Dyson declined to comment.

How a small Oxfordshire farm became Britain's best cheesemaker

Sinodun Hill goat's cheese was triumphant at the World Cheese Awards - and it's made in two converted shipping containers

At a glitzy event streamed live around the globe, 16 international experts nibbled their way through 16 cheeses which had beaten over 4,500 others to make it to the final round - in a bid to be crowned the world's best. 

A punchy Norwegian blue won but, amid the perennial favourites like gouda, parmesan and alpine cheeses, a fresh, mild, unassuming goat's cheese shone out. Finishing 12th - impressive considering the number of entrants - Sinodun Hill, made on the banks of the Thames in Oxfordshire, was crowned the Best British Cheese at the World Cheese Awards. 

The British artisan cheese revival is a story well told. It's a tale of almost total collapse after World War II; of processed Government cheese and the disappearance of family farms; of hundreds of farmhouse Lancashire producers dropping to just one. A few small cheesemakers stubbornly held on, joined by newcomers from the 1970s. A revived industry soon became one of the world's most thriving. 

Asked to consider British farmhouse cheese, most people will think first of clothbound cheddars and crumbly Wensleydales, then of our vast array of brilliant blues.  

But, this year, Britain's star artisan cheese is none of these. It's a small truncated pyramid, creamy-white in appearance, inspired by the lactic goat's cheeses of the Loire Valley. No British cheese - or indeed French - finished above it at this year's World Cheese Awards. It finished in the top 16 for the second year running, the only cheese to feature twice in a row. ""It stole my heart and drew me back constantly,"" was one judge's assessment.

2023 was a stellar year for Britain, with 97 medals, including five super golds and 19 golds, but Sinodun Hill trumped them all. No mean feat for a cheese made near Didcot from a herd of around 200 goats, with 132 milkers. Only 10 years ago, its creators Fraser Norton and Rachel Yarrow, owners of Norton & Yarrow Cheese, had never made cheese. A decade on, they are in demand. 

Behind the scenes

On a cold, sunny, autumn day at the farm near Abingdon, I'm startled to discover that Britain's best cheese is made in a couple of converted shipping containers. I'm greeted in a tiny office by Norton - and George, the couple's 10-week-old Yorkshire terrier. Next door, three cheesemakers in a room no bigger than an average single bedroom are busy making batches of Sinodun Hill in time for Christmas, which makes up 40 per cent of their sales. Artisan is an overused word in the food world, but it's the only word to describe this dairy. 

Sinodun Hill, named for a knoll visible from the farm, is truly a world-class cheese. It is beautiful, a pearly-white rind wrinkled by the fungus Geotrichum candidum like a cartoon image of a brain. Inside is a wonderfully fudgy, moussy texture, with a bright, yoghurt-acid flavour that gives way to grassy, fruity, almost almondy notes. No two batches are exactly the same; at certain times of year you might find natural blue moulds occurring. It is elegant and alluring. 

Norton and Yarrow are not your typical award-winning cheesemakers. In 2014, Yarrow was a secondary-school English teacher, Norton a project manager. Both enjoyed their careers but had a lingering sense it wasn't their passion. On holiday in Sicily they stumbled across a copy of Women & Home magazine featuring a story on female cheesemakers, and they joked about following suit. ""On the plane home we came back to it, for some reason, and it turned from a joke to a serious conversation,"" Yarrow recalls. 

Though they liked cheese, neither was obsessed. But Yarrow wanted to be a vet when she was younger and both had ""tenuous"" farming backgrounds, explains Norton, who grew up in Ayrshire and visited his grandfather's farm in the Midlands as a child. Yarrow's father farmed in Wales in his 20s and now makes honey. ""It's not a family tradition that's been passed down,"" Norton admits.

Despite that, cheesemaking made sense. ""Who doesn't like cheese?"" says Yarrow. They started by experimenting with supermarket cow's milk in their kitchen but, by 2016, focused on goats and launched Sinodun Hill, initially produced at the nearby Nettlebed Creamery, which produces excellent cow's milk cheeses. Norton's PhD in chemistry helped. The process ""was strangely familiar, though completely new,"" he says. 

Juggling a young family with learning a new vocation wasn't plain sailing. ""We had some honest feedback in the early years,"" says Yarrow. ""What did [Neal's Yard Dairy's buyer] Bronwen Percival say? The texture of egg white? By the time we were selling it, it wasn't absolutely horrible, but the consistency wasn't brilliant. It took a long time."" 

Yet it won a silver medal at the Artisan Cheese Awards in 2016, and best new cheese at the British Cheese Awards a year later. Cheesemaking may not have been their calling, but the couple were clearly onto something. 

Wide-spread praise

Sinodun Hill stands out on a cheese counter, and indeed on a cheeseboard, because of its shape. Inspired by French cheeses like ValenÃ§ay, it is a pyramid with the top chopped off, a style said to have emerged, probably apocryphally, from Napoleon's desire to not be reminded of defeat in Egypt.

La Fromagerie, a renowned London cheesemonger, specialises in French cheeses - and yet the Marylebone site's general manager Stephen Sweet admits that Sinodun Hill is one of his all-time favourite cheeses, a presence on his Christmas cheeseboard ever since it was introduced.

""It's a great introduction to the wonders of goat's milk,"" he tells me. It tastes remarkably different to the ash-rinded ValenÃ§ay. The English cheese is bright and fresh, the French, also wonderful, is earthier and meatier, with that lingering goatiness some people dislike. Want to convince someone to eat goat's cheese? Sinodun Hill will do the trick. 

Both sell equally well at La Fromagerie. ""We have quite a large French customer base, and Sinodun Hill has a loyal following even within French communities,"" says Sweet. ""It's nice to see a British cheese get such high praise."" 

All about the goats

Farming is a notoriously difficult business, especially for newcomers. Land is prohibitively expensive, and Norton & Yarrow Cheese is a tenant of the Earth Trust, an environmental charity that owns the land. They remortgaged their house and, starting off with just two goats, through breeding and acquisitions they now have 200, mostly Anglo-Nubians with a few crosses. 

Yarrow has just started a Nuffield farming scholarship, to study ways to improve goat dairying in the UK. ""They're brilliant cheesemakers, but it's easy to overlook the fact that they're excellent farmers,"" says cheese expert Sam Wilkin. Though the milk is pasteurised, one can taste the quality of the grass and herbal leys the goats feed on in spring and summer, before returning to their barns, just yards from the dairy, in winter.   

It hasn't always been easy. The Beast from the East in 2018 almost convinced the couple to give up. Pipes froze and they had to carry 20-litre buckets of water to the dairy to make the cheese. They were tempted to return to an office job. ""And yet, [we] get up the next morning, come out and do it again. We're both very determined people, and wanted to succeed."" 

Sinodun Hill, and its triumph in the world awards this year, proves they have. British cheese is far more than potent blues and crumbly territorials. Norton and Yarrow are showing there's plenty more to offer. 

Five other artisan British goat's cheeses to try 

1. Brightwell Ash, Norton & Yarrow, Oxfordshire 

£10 for 130g, cheese-etc.co.uk; £12.20, nealsyarddairy.co.uk

In 2018 Sinodun Hill was followed by Brightwell Ash, also named for a nearby landmark. A round puck rolled in ash, it's bright and juicy with a rustic look. Unlike Sinodun Hill, which uses some milk brought in from a nearby farm, Brightwell Ash is made only from the farm's milk. It won a silver at this year's World Cheese Awards. 

2. Dorstone, Neal's Yard Creamery, Herefordshire 

£12.25 for 180g, nealsyarddairy.co.uk

Dorstone is made by legendary cheesemaker Charlie Westhead at Neal's Yard Creamery. With a similar wrinkly rind to Sinodun Hill, it's turret-shaped with an ash coating, and has a light, fluffy texture and citrussy flavour. 

3. Elrick Log, Errington Cheese, South Lanarkshire 

£9 for 190g, erringtoncheese.com; £12.95, paxtonandwhitfield.co.uk; £13.50, lafromagerie.co.uk

Errington Cheese produces some of the country's finest artisan cheeses, including the manchego-like Corra Linn and rich Lanark Blue. Elrick Log is a small, French-style log that ""has a good following, especially for people wanting something a little more complex, sophisticated, more powerful,"" says Sweet. 

4. Golden Cross, Golden Cross Cheese, East Sussex 

£7.95 for 255g, cheesepleaselewes.co.uk; £11.30, lafromagerie.co.uk

A longer log than Elrick, Golden Cross has a firm and silky texture and is fresh tasting. It's modelled loosely on the famous French Saint- Maure de Touraine, but has a bloomy rind. ""It's very light, sweet, elegant, with honey flavours,"" says Sweet. ""It's really good for cheese boards."" 

5. Perroche, Neal's Yard Creamery, Herefordshire 

£7.57 for 150g, mousetrapcheese.co.uk

Young and fresh, perroche is lemony, soft, and almost impossibly light, with a mousse-like consistency. It can be plain, or rolled in herbs including tarragon, dill or rosemary. It makes for a perfect snack on toast.

More from The Telegraph

""˜It's time for rural Britain to take back control from Westminster'

Fed up with urban-centric politics. Ian Gregory created his own political party - and wants to save the countryside from the ""˜eco-woke'

""The Tories have lost the countryside,"" says Ian Gregory. ""And how do you make a mistake like that? By taking it for granted. Countryside policy over the past 13 years has been used increasingly to win over urban voters. Eventually, enough is enough.""  

Gregory, 60, has launched Rural Reaction, a new political party dedicated to saving the British countryside from what he calls the ""eco-woke"".

For too long, he says, Westminster has kow-towed to an ideologically minded, mostly urban population when it comes to rural issues. 

Gregory is not who you might imagine when you think of the leader of a party called ""Rural Reaction"". He is not a farmer, for starters. He has spent his career operating in politics, as a journalist with the BBC and latterly as a political lobbyist.

He splits his time between a flat in St James's in London and a house in the Home Counties. Dressed in a smart shirt, jeans and black brogues, he picks me up from the station in a large white BMW with the roof down.

Betraying his experience as an occasional spin doctor, before we meet he sends over a detailed fact sheet. He says that, contrary to what one might have read in The Spectator, he is not ""a fiercely pro-shooting campaigner"". 

""I do not hunt, shoot or fish. I am merely good at spotting stupidity at 1,000 yards and use that ability to hold power to account."" He also includes an FAQ of things he thinks might be asked, including where he got the idea for Rural Reaction from. 

""Partly it was down to Lord Mandelson's comments in June about rural votes being ""˜up for grabs',"" he says. ""It was suggested to me that there should be a ""˜Brexit for the countryside' i.e. that the countryside should be self-governing. 

""In response I came up with the idea of this party as a different way to take back control from Westminster.""

He has decided to take action after more than a decade of ""catastrophic"" mismanagement by Defra and an ""extraordinary increase in coercion in British life"". Ministers, he says ""have been asleep during a massive increase in woke speech codes which dominate the public and private sectors"". 

""I'd love everything to be the moral high ground,"" he says, over fish-finger sandwiches in his local pub. ""But there is also crude electoral pressure. That is the only way for the countryside to be heard against great numbers in the city, to be willing to stare down the Tories.

""I hope that, on an issue like animal welfare, people will be humble enough to know that it's very complicated. We're not saying there is a particular answer around managing dogs, or hunting, or grouse shooting. It's saying science has to come first.""

Gregory reserves particular ire for those areas of policy where he thinks Defra has been guided by emotive, animal-rights-driven thinking. ""Anybody who is resistant to the idea of science cannot call themselves an animal-lover,"" he says.

""Michael Gove says we are a nation of animal lovers but we have this critical-theory-underpinned animal-rights philosophy, instead of the traditional animal welfare approach."" 

Take the subject of electric collars for dogs. In April, the Government tabled a motion to ban the collars from February 2024.

""The British Veterinary Association put out a statement saying the collars should be banned."" Gregory says, ""because the ""˜most effective way of training' is with positive-only methods, which is to say patting it on the back and giving it a biscuit for not having eaten that sheep over there."" 

""I wrote to the BVA to ask where their science was. They responded with bluster. That's a worry, when respect for science is not at the core of what the BVA does."" Other areas of interest are the RSPB, foxhunting, farming, shooting and horse-racing. Naturally he has a view on Chris Packham. 

""I don't have a problem with Chris Packham,"" he says. ""He's an interesting guy with a lot of opinions. I do have a problem with the BBC not seeing a conflict between him being their main countryside presenter and him being so antagonistic to pretty much every country interest."" 

If Gregory is surprised to find himself the leader of a political party, in other ways it looks like the culmination of his work to date. Gregory was born in Nottingham, the son of a railway manager father and housewife mother. The family moved around a lot during his childhood, following his father's work all around the country.

At 18 he got a temporary job working in Conservative Campaign Headquarters, delivering questions for PMQs to and from backbenchers before winning a scholarship to study PPE at Brasenose College, Oxford, ""to the surprise of everybody"".

In his first summer holiday he worked in a building yard, the second for an anglophile US Democrat Congressman, Tom Lantos, in Washington. During his second term at Oxford his father was killed aged 53 in a plane crash in Turkey. 

""That was an extraordinarily harrowing time,"" he says. ""It took many years for me to process it.""

Partly as a result, he was a late starter politically. He freelanced as a journalist during his 20s, before ending up at the BBC in his 30s, where he worked on BBC World. Then he switched to marketing and finally to political lobbying. His business Abzed, set up in 2010, has worked on tobacco products, energy policy and pet collars. 

""I've just turned 60 and I'm loving life,"" he says. He's not married, but says he has a ""˜special lady' in his life. ""The synergies from working as a journalist, working in marketing, doing bits and pieces in politics have come together in this lobbying business."" 

His initial plan was to test the waters in any upcoming by-elections, then stand candidates in 40 or seats at the General Election, opposing those Tories who he thinks have been most hostile to science, but he says that there has been so much interest that it could be ""a lot more"".

He has not begun fundraising yet, but says he has already had donors flinging five-figure sums at him, and interest from celebrities - he won't name them - who are waiting for his plans to become more concrete before they commit to this new rural cause.

At this weekend's Tory Party Conference at the convention centre in Manchester, Gregory is hosting his own Rural Reaction conference next door. ""My first aim is to make Manchester a great success, then I hope there will be an opportunity to try by-elections, then working-through tactically.

""You always hope that there is a Road to Damascus among the Number 10 policy team. Why on earth shouldn't the countryside have a permanent presence. There's a yawning market gap there. We have the boldness to go into it.""

Giorgia Meloni risks going the way of Liz Truss if she keeps defying the market

Italy's bout of August madness is in some ways worse than Britain's Trussonomics episode

Giorgia Meloni is doing a passably good imitation of a neo-Marxist Corbynista. If anybody still thought that Italy's far-right populist government cleaves to the free market, they have had a rude re-education this week.

It is hard to know which is worse: an unconstitutional and retroactive windfall tax on banks, in the middle of a credit crunch, enthusiastically applauded by the entire Italian left; or deranged price controls on airlines that defy the laws of supply and demand and smack of ""the Soviet Union in 1927"" - in the words of Ryanair boss, Eddie Wilson.

""Financial markets are now on the alert that this government is not as market-friendly as they thought,"" said Lorenzo Codogno, ex-chief economist at the Italian treasury and now at LC Macro. ""I am getting a lot of calls asking who could be next: will it be the construction sector, who knows? The damage is done,"" he said.

These antics come after a protracted debate on whether 5G mobile towers pose a genotoxic danger to human health if they exceed Italy's archaic limit of six watts per metre, long since dismissed as junk science even by the high priests of the precautionary principle in Brussels.

Italy has banned Uber. The Meloni coalition is preparing a ban on lab-grown meat, to accompany Italy's longstanding ban on banned GMO crops and animal feed. The march of biotech Luddism is driving the country's scientists and researchers to near despair.

Giorgia Meloni's immediate reflex earlier this year was to impose an effective ban on ChatGPT. The regulator alleged that OpenAI had no legal basis for collection and storage of personal data used to train its algorithms. It later rowed back partially with a compromise, but the message has stuck.

Stefano da Empoli, head of Italy's Institute for Competitiveness, said Italy was already an AI laggard: it now carries an added stigma as a country tagged as ""unfriendly towards innovation"", with cascading effects on investment and future start ups.

There is of course a complex trade-off between protecting society and letting rip on technology. But Italy's fear of change in the 21st Century seems very far removed from the irrepressible inventiveness of the Renaissance city states.

Meloni has enjoyed a long honeymoon since Fratelli d'Italia took power in October. The Italian economy has been outperforming Germany, a rare sorpasso since the launch of monetary union and the end of lira devaluations. The benign view is that Italy has achieved an ""internal devaluation"" within the euro after the gruelling austerity of the Lost Decade, and is therefore fundamentally competitive again.

Robin Brooks from the Institute of International Finance says recent strength is mostly a ""sugar rush"" fed by transfers from the EU's â‚¬800bn recovery fund, unlikely to have much lasting effect on an economy still only half-reformed.

A ""superbonus"" tax credit worth 110pc for home insulation and energy efficiency has led to a construction boom. This will help Italy defend against the next gas crisis this winter. But the scheme has been riddled with corruption and has pushed the budget deficit to 8pc of GDP. If that can't buy growth, nothing can.

The economy is coming back down to earth with a thud. Output shrank by 0.3pc in the second quarter as the lagged effect of rising interest rates finally hit. Data from the Bank of Italy shows that credit to firms have contracted precipitously over the last four months, a further reason why the latest raid on banks is so destructive.

The 40pc windfall tax announced on Monday - out of the blue, opposed by the finance minister, and based on a spurious comparison with a depressed revenue base in 2021 -set off a banking crash on the Milan bourse. The government has since retreated enough to stem the equity rout, but not enough to allay reawakened fears of Italian political risk at a treacherous moment in the global credit cycle.

""It has undermined the credibility of the government,"" said Dr Codogno.

Italian banks are profitable on a flow-basis but are underwater on holdings of Italian government bonds, though they do not have to crystallise these losses under mark-to-market rules. They have been heavily reliant on ultra-cheap loans (TLTROs) from the European Central Bank, which are now being wound down. The eurozone is in a deep industrial recession and the ECB says net loan demand has collapsed to record lows.

""This windfall tax is now going to amplify the credit crunch,"" said Professor Marcello Minenna from La Sapienza University in Rome. ""The risk spread of Italian bonds over German Bunds is stable so far but it could be a troubling Autumn. I don't understand why they are doing this.""

The bank raid was orchestrated by Lega strongman Matteo Salvini, aiming to fund a bail-out of mortgage holders with floating-rate debt.  

Lorenzo Bini-Smaghi, chairman of SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale, called it a rescue for ""speculators"" who had made a bad bet on the lure of cheaper floating rates. ""Socialising losses is an odd thing to do for a conservative government,"" he said. Whatever the government gains from the surtax will be lost many times over by the fiscal costs of lower economic growth as banks retrench.

As for the airline plan, it is a fine exhibit of market illiteracy. It imposes arbitrary price caps on internal flights from Sicily and Sardinia, ignoring warnings that airlines will not sustain routes if they cannot recoup winter losses from summer profits. It aims to suppress the digital marvel of pricing algorithms, which has slashed the cost of flying (ceteris paribus) and slashed per capita greenhouse emissions by ensuring that flights are full.

""It's ridiculous, illegal and interferes with the free market. It won't lower tariffs: it will raise them for everyone. Starting with those who live on the islands,"" said Ryanair's Mr Wilson.

""With this decree, I will be forced to reduce flights and frequencies, especially in winter. Others will too. And in a normal market, when supply goes down, prices go up. I really would like to meet the advisers who suggested this: it's obvious that they didn't even attend the first day of economics lessons,"" he said.

This bout of August madness is in some ways worse than the Truss episode in Britain last year. Liz Truss was unlucky. Her fiscal plans were ill-constructed and ill-timed but they were not anti-enterprise and not even her critics expected a moderate loosening to trigger a chain-reaction through the gilt markets, exposing liability-driven investments as a house of cards.

Giorgia Meloni has got away with her lurch towards socialism so far. Italian risk spreads remain well-behaved. But if she keeps rolling out such wild policies for a few more weeks, the international owners of capital may turn on her with the same sudden ferocity.

Why Britain could have the solution to Europe's beer crisis

Climate change is causing havoc and now the humble pint is in danger. But the solution could be at hand, with Britain leading the way

Bad news for beer lovers. Scientists have warned that climate change is leading to a decline in the quantity and quality of European hops, affecting the flavour and price of a pint. But all is not lost - and British hops may be the answer.

The study, published in nature.com and focusing on historic hop-growing areas in Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, has shown that yields are decreasing, as are the levels of alpha acids, which give beer its characteristic bitterness. Beer is typically made with only four ingredients: water, yeast, malt and hops. Making great beer involves carefully balancing the bitterness from the hops with the sweetness of the malt. 

Hotter temperatures have shifted when the pivotal ripening period occurs for the ""Noble"" hop varieties in Europe, which is why their alpha acid content is declining. Consequently, brewers have to use more hops to make up for diminished alpha acids, making their beer much more expensive. 

Noble hops were given their name as a marketing ploy in the 1970s, suggesting they are very best quality and have a good balance of the acids and aromatic oils required to deliver both bitterness and a variety of spicy, floral, earthy or herbal tones. 

More frequent and severe droughts are having an impact on overall yields, and hop levels in Europe are predicted to decline by up to a fifth by 2050. A smaller harvest creates competition for the traditional hops used to brew classic European beers such as Czech lagers and German pilsners. 

But these European varieties aren't the only options for making great beer. There's a venerable history of hop-growing in Britain, although it is in decline. Today, there are only about 50 hop farmers in England, producing less than two per cent of the total grown in Germany, and most British beer is made with imported hops. Yet homegrown hops may hold the key to preventing a crisis.

Our maritime climate provides ideal conditions, giving us plenty of rain, but as we also experience dry spells, selective breeding is being used to produce a suite of drought-tolerant hop varieties. The signs are promising. Despite minimal rain from the end of March until early September 2022, one crop of Godiva hops was able to produce a 90 per cent yield.  

""This is an opportunity for British hop growers,"" says Will Rogers, the global technical director for Charles Faram hop suppliers in Worcestershire. ""Other crops are being moved north to outrun climate change. But with hops, you can't do that. Their life cycle is controlled by daylight, not temperature. Hops grow at their best between 35 and 55 degrees latitude, which covers England perfectly.

""In Herefordshire, Worcestershire and the majority of Kent there are heavy soils. The high clay content acts like a sponge to hold on to water even in drought conditions, compared to the lighter soils of Hallertau (the German hop-growing region)."" 

Devon-based Utopian Brewing already extols the virtues of English hops, and uses only British-grown ingredients in its beers. ""We have tremendous hop varieties available to us,"" says head brewer Jeremy Swainson. ""This is an opportunity for more brewers to start experimenting with Britain's own Noble varieties, such as Fuggles and Goldings, which make fantastic lagers.

""They are amazing hops that people don't talk about enough. Fuggles is particularly good at creating a clean, rounded bitterness, which is essential for a light lager such as a helles or a pilsner.""

More from The Telegraph

After six years as a vegetarian I've started eating meat again

I gave up meat because I was jaded and fed up with it; now I'm starting to wonder if it's so bad after all

Two strokes of the steak knife and I'm in need of a time out. I haven't had to chew a mouthful with such intense concentration for more than six years.

In the intervening time there's been the occasional mild panic, usually courtesy of a veggie sausage at a hotel breakfast: ""Are you sure it's not meat?"" I demand of my amused tablemate. It's been so long that I can't recall how much mastication real muscle needs. Tackling a steak requires a sense of ritual you just don't get from forkfuls of goat's cheese and squash risotto.

The news that, according to a study published in the journal PLOS One, being vegetarian may partly be in one's genes, made me scoff. For more than 30 years I was a recalcitrant carnivore who resented being mistaken for a vegetarian, just because I was a girl with a weird name. That was until January 1, 2017; the day I gave up meat. A piece of Parma ham straight from the packet, a Christmas waif. And I was done.

The reason I gave up meat was that I was jaded and fed up with it. Triangular sandwiches of disjointed chicken: rhomboid slivers of smoked salmon between plastic sheets: rectangles of meat on cellophane trays: it all suddenly sickened me. Everyone seemed to be chomping mindlessly on meat. 

In the genes?

It's a reaction that's at odds with the new science, which found three genes linked with vegetarianism and another 31 genes that are potentially associated with the trait. The scientists believe that the driving factor for food and drink preference is not just taste, but also how an individual's body metabolises the material.

""While religious and moral considerations certainly play a major role in the motivation to adopt a vegetarian diet, our data suggests that the ability to adhere to such a diet is constrained by genetics,"" said the study author Dr Nabeel Yaseen, professor emeritus of pathology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in the US.

Has he finally found the reason why the UK has four times as many vegetarians as our French neighbours? I'd say boeuf to that - after all, weren't we once known as les rosbifs?

When it comes to eating meat, I'd say pervading culture and society prefigure our choices, rather than taste and metabolism. Most self-defining vegetarians state three reasons for avoiding meat: animal welfare, health benefits and environmental concerns. 

My own conversion was, yes, an awakening. Doing my training as a yoga teacher, for which many of my fellow students were vegetarian, as well as studying the concept of ahimsa (non-violence) made me feel that there must be a better choice out there. And so I stopped. 

Full of beans

Making the transition from chÃ¢teaubriand lover to champignon chomper was surprisingly easy. Where once I'd eaten steak at least twice a week and enjoyed easy suppers of cheap chicken livers (I really was a red-blooded carnivore), I upped my intake of pulses and vegetables and developed a fondness for more Middle Eastern-style dishes. I'd always mocked the pub bean-burger option, but now it aligned with my values. So we made friends.  

And the big surprise was that I really didn't miss meat. I remained self-conscious about thrusting my opinions on others. ""How is the steak?"" I'd inquire, politely, of friends. Like John Le Mesurier's Sergeant Wilson, I'd say: ""Would you mind awfully""¦"", when asking a host to provide a vegetarian option. As if asking for a meal composed of vegetables was a riddle for the ages. If I am completely honest, a little part of me quietly enjoyed the righteousness of it all. I disdained the so-called ""flexitarians"", having their right-on values and eating them. 

And then the vegan propaganda machine went into hyper-drive. Simple vegetarians, such as myself, all of a sudden seemed pedestrian. Unappetising highly processed vegan substitutes became the order of the day. At its extreme, friends would praise burgers made from gluten that seemed neither tasty nor particularly healthy. A colleague who had once enjoyed KFC was now on the Facon (fake-bacon) Diet; proof, perhaps, that junk is genetic. Call me contrary, but I started to wonder if eating meat was so bad after all. 

In my day job I was fortunate enough to meet people who cared about nature and animals, but also were farmers. On a day spent racketing up hilly fields in a battered Land Rover with Rosemary Young, author of The Secret Life of Cows, she admitted she'd only ever eat her own animals. I met farmers like John Lewis Stempel who talked about how his grandfather would cry when sending his animals to the abattoir. 

The world is full of muddle and contradictions. There is suffering wherever you look in the food chain, whether you are a red-blooded carnivore or a bean-loving vegan. And so slowly the electric fences I had erected around meat and fish started to come down. 

Gone fishing

First came oily fish, concerned that by avoiding it I may have been storing up dementia for the future; lacking the omega-3 DHA required for maintenance of normal brain function in adults. While some of the benefits have been called overhyped - fish-loving Finland has high levels of dementia, possibly due to mercury levels in fish stocks - but I felt safe placing fish that was low on the food chain, tins of sardines and mackerel, into my shopping basket. 

My partner suffered a tendon injury that only abated once we started to eat fish. And so the tide slowly turned. Yes, I racked myself with middle-class guilt about fish stocks, but inviting us for dinner became more simple for my mother-in-law. 

Meat, though - the two- and four-legged land-roving kind - was not something I missed. I'd grown to love chargrilled broccoli, whole roast cauliflower and juicy aubergines; vegetables that perform when given centre stage. 

I never felt the ineluctable tractor-beam of a meat meal deep down in my DNA. Although a vegan friend confessed he gets his occasional fix from culled wild venison (a meat so unpopular that he feels he's doing nature a favour). Maybe the scientists are half-right?

What did change for me was moving to the countryside in the pandemic. I watched my neighbour JosÃ© have loving shouting matches with her stubborn ewes. I learnt how, during lambing, she would bring cold lambs back to life in the warming oven of her Aga. I saw how strong the will to shepherd can be. How human it is. 

At a village barbecue, while my peers tucked into local sausages (from a village farmer) and I ate incinerated veggie sausages and burgers, I realised the absurdity.  

Meanwhile, no animal suffered as much from poor PR as the cow. I found myself writing articles in their defence; irritated at how UK farming is lumped together with its hellish North and South American counterparts. 

Meeting UK farmers intent on restoring landscapes and soil health through mob grazing, such as Abby Allen at Piper's Farm in Devon, showed me that, unless you support those trying to make a difference, we risk being left with no other model or choice than the intensive, soy-fed one. Of course it is a huge privilege to be able to eat higher-welfare, grass-fed, ethically sourced meat. The ""less but better"" argument can sound very Marie Antoinette. 

Human health-wise, the case for meat is complex. High-nitrate meats have been linked to colorectal cancer; recent research published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition finds a correlation between red meat consumption and the onset of Type 2 diabetes in later life.

On the flip-side, grass-fed beef is rich in omega-3s. Regular consumption of small quantities of meat is widely believed to be good for overall health. People who live in the so-called ""Blue Zones"", where the human healthy lifespan is the longest, eat small amounts of meat. Tim Spector, the dietary guru du jour, has reduced his meat consumption to some local, organic grass-fed red meat or a roast chicken as an occasional treat once or twice a month.

Selfishly, I wondered what I was missing out on, health-wise. And so I found myself tucking in with friends at the Tytherleigh Arms on the Devon/Somerset border. Their meat is sourced from Bonners butchers in Ilminster, and is in turn taken from grass-fed local herds. 

Few are doing it better. I know because I've tried others since. A steak at a very fine establishment in Cornwall this summer was a distinct disappointment, and on the whole I feel let down by what meat-eaters are offered on a regular basis.

Because of this I haven't found myself embracing meat in the way that I thought I would. My digestion and my tastebuds seem to have adapted to a vegetarian diet. This means that I sit at life's table somewhere between the meat-eaters and the vegans as they argue the benefits of their favoured diets. 

I can't help but think that a great deal of this debate is really about identity politics. Meat eaters love to taunt vegans, and the latter like to look down on the former as narrow-minded bigots. If the science is indeed correct, perhaps we can call a truce?

In the meantime, my tip for both sides would be the following. Meat-eaters, next time you think: ""it's not a meal without meat,"" check whether that's really true, or if you're just not very good at cooking vegetables. 

And vegans and plant-based people, before you chew people's ears off - metaphorically, of course - ask whether a diet for which you need the knowledge of a dietitian to get your iron, zinc, vitamin B12 and fatty acids is really achievable?

In an ideal world, I believe now that we should be pursuing a culture of meat-eating that respects animals and our health, taking only as much, as a population and as individuals, as we truly need. 

One thing is for certain, you won't catch me tucking into a grey-looking factory-farmed chicken sandwich from a supermarket any time soon.

The healthiest way to eat salmon, the ""˜chicken of the sea'

If this mass-market fish is no longer a luxury but part of a powerful global industry, how should we be buying and eating it?

It used to be a luxury saved for special occasions. Today, however, salmon is a mass-market fish that many people eat several times a week. Mild in flavour, full of omega-3, with a low carbon footprint, and on every supermarket shelf, when - and how - did it become the chicken of the sea?

The answer seems to be in the plummeting of wild fish stocks. Farmed salmon offered a perfect solution, and the industry expanded accordingly (Waitrose's biggest selling fish lines are all salmon).

Demand is not limited to our shores, either; Scottish salmon is one of the UK's top three food exports, with sales reaching nearly £705 million in 2022, supporting thousands of Scottish jobs, and the simple salmon has become part of the economic argument for Scottish independence. Scottish sea-loch farms and the growing number of land-based tanks have become a source of tense debate between sustainability and animal welfare campaigners, and the salmon industry.  

Last month, the charity Animal Equality demanded an emergency summit with Scottish ministers after 16.5 million salmon died prematurely in farm pens in 2022. While campaigners blamed poor welfare standards, claiming overcrowding had allowed lice and disease to spread, industry chiefs have cited unprecedented swarms of parasitic micro-jellyfish thought to be linked to climate change.

Meanwhile, in March 2021, underwater filming as part of an investigation by the campaign group Compassion in World Farming depicted a gory scene: ""Quite a lot of fish had damage to their scales, eyes missing, there were sea lice and chunks of their flesh missing,"" says Dr Natasha Boyland, the group's fish policy and research manager.

Supply and demand

It's an image far removed from the wholesome superfood one that we typically associate with salmon. So, does the industry need to rein in its expansion, and do consumers need to look for more sustainable alternatives?

The issue is one of volume, says Jessica Sinclair Taylor from campaign group Feedback. 

""I think the industry will blame consumer demand, but they've created a situation where they need to farm at a very high volume to fulfil that demand. It's causing many problems, from overdemand for the feed ingredients through to sea lice, disease outbreaks and high mortality.

""The salmon industry has higher tolerances of mortality than for chicken and their standard rate is about 10 to 15 per cent. If that number of cows died before adulthood, it would be a scandal.""

But Dr Daniel Merrifield, associate professor of fish health and nutrition at Plymouth University, worries the data is being misinterpreted: ""Salmon is a different organism, with a different life cycle. It produces thousands of eggs, and in the wild, a fraction of those will survive to majority. So you can't really compare two biologically distinct animals and expect the same outcomes.""

Wild fish capture has stayed static since the 1980s, but demand for fish has increased, which is why farming salmon became the answer. 

""The result was heavy investment in the industry and a vision to turn salmon into the chicken of the sea,"" says Dr David Willer, Henslow research fellow in zoology at the University of Cambridge. ""Our wild fish stocks are in a catastrophic situation due to overfishing. Things we really shouldn't be eating are wild tuna, cod and haddock, because of sustainability and our health.""

As a top predator, tuna suffers from heavy-metal accumulation as mercury goes up in the food chain. Wild fish also tend to be more exposed to microplastics in the sea, so, contrary to popular belief, Dr Willer says you're better off choosing farmed fish.

The Marine Conservation Society has just updated its Good Fish Guide, a traffic-light system based on reports of fish stocks. This year, north-east Atlantic mackerel moved from the green to amber, meaning it's not sustainable.

""It's a fair guide, but it focuses mostly on sustainability of individual species and not around the efficiency of the food chain,"" says Dr Willer.

What should be on the menu?

Dr Willer's research has shown that as consumers we should be buying low-trophic wild fish, such as sardines, herring and anchovies, in preference to larger wild fish and farmed fish. He also encourages eating bivalves, such as mussels, clams and oysters, ""which are incredibly sustainable but their popularity is quite low"".

At the moment, too many of those low-trophic fish are feeding the salmon industry (salmon eat other fish as a source of omega-3 fatty acids to thrive), and in March 2022, Dr Willer led a report that found farmed Scottish salmon consumed more wild fish, such as anchovies and sardines, than it produced as salmon.

Increasing human consumption of these small fish species could potentially improve the efficiency, and therefore sustainability, of food production and Dr Willer uses the analogy of a shopping basket to help consumers. 

""In your basket you could have mussels, clams and oysters, which you can eat any amount of,"" he says. ""You've also got low-trophic wild fish - sardines, sprats and herring - which you can eat in reasonably good quantities. In that, you've also got farmed salmon as a good option.""

Welfare is also an important issue for many consumers. Many already prioritise high-welfare meat over cheap chicken, for instance. While sea lice pose no threat to human health (affected salmon don't make it to the shelves), the thought that our food is farmed in such conditions is surely worrying?

Here, pressure groups play an important role, keeping the spotlight on an industry that has exploded in the past 30 years, and pushing for best practice. While consumers can pay for better cuts of salmon, the farming itself is fairly standardised.

In terms of best practice, Dr Willer says Scotland is best, followed by Norway. ""Just be a bit more careful with the Chilean farmed salmon,"" he says, which isn't farmed to the same standards. Antibiotic use is also lower than it was in Scotland, but Dr Willer says it could be improved further by polyculturing mussels around salmon farms.

The salmon industry enjoys its cosy image of pristine Scottish waters, says Sinclair Taylor, ""but in reality, it's a hugely powerful global industry"". 

A lot of fish meal comes from West Africa, ""where there's a lot of food insecurity"", she adds. Fish meal is a commercial product made from whole wild-caught fish, by-catch and fish by-products to feed farm animals.

In terms of pollution, she adds: ""With salmon farming, everything that goes into the cage - feed, faeces, medication - goes into the sea. It's like an open sewer and they're relying on the fact there's a lot of sea to absorb it, but the seabed underneath the salmon farms gets very choked up and studies show it is damaging the environment for other species.""

When it comes to knowing how to eat fish, armed with Dr Willer's shopping basket analogy, we at least have a chance. ""If you're consuming salmon every day, you're doing the wrong thing. If you're consuming mussels every day, you're doing fine,"" he says.

""There are some fish you can eat sustainably every day and some you shouldn't,"" he says. Larger wild fish, such as monkfish, sea bream, hake and sole, he would place after farmed salmon in the shopping basket, but before tuna and cod.

""In reality, they are a wild fish species and regardless of what the rating is by the Good Fish Guide, there aren't that many of them left.""

Why do we keep building homes on flood plains?

Potential buyers are left almost entirely in the dark about whether their new home will be at risk of flooding or not

When plans were announced for a huge new supermarket in the Lincolnshire village of Washingborough, there were plenty of local objections.

Residents were concerned about the impact on the landscape, the traffic and local businesses. There was less anxiety about the fact the 10,000 square foot Sainsbury's would be built on land at high risk of flooding. 

The plot, bordering the river Witham, has been left underwater this week in the wake of Storm Babet, which has killed seven people and left parts of the country metres under water. 

National planning guidelines say that building on flood plains ""should be avoided"" because of the risk to the developments and of exacerbating flooding elsewhere in the area. 

But since 2013, more than 10 per cent of all new homes in England have been built on land at highest risk of flooding. That risk will only become more acute as climate change brings wetter weather and more intense storms. 

Already there are 5.2 million homes and businesses in England at risk of flooding; the Environment Agency (EA) says this could increase by 50 per cent by 2070. But if we know the threat, why do we keep building on flood plains?

Flood plains are vital stores for rising tides of water during storms, ensuring communities elsewhere are not deluged. ""If you're removing the flood plains, then you're increasing the potential risk, because the flood plains are the areas where water goes to run off and drain,"" says Elizabeth Bundred Woodward, the planning and policy lead at countryside charity CPRE (Campaign to Protect Rural England). ""If there are houses on them, then the water is going to be draining into the homes."" 

More than 200,000 hectares of England's grade 1 agricultural land is in an area at highest risk of flooding, and the CPRE is particularly concerned about the impact if fields are deluged by water displaced from new developments. 

The EA holds maps showing areas of flood risk, and advises councils on whether any development should go ahead, but does not have any powers of enforcement. Between 2016 and 2021, more than 2,000 homes were granted planning permission against EA advice. 

""Advice from the Environment Agency around development in areas of flood risk has been ignored in some places because the priority for housing is such that it takes precedence,"" says Woodward. Councils are under pressure to deliver on Government targets to build 300,000 new homes a year, and are given grants for every new house that goes up in their area. 

But even when EA advice is heeded it may be insufficient, as its flood mapping does not include long-term risk from climate change, which is expected to bring twice as much flooding by 2070, compared to a 1990 baseline. 

A recent study from the University of Bristol suggested that the costs of flooding to homes and businesses could rise around 25 per cent with warming of 1.8C. 

The EA also does not assess the risk from surface flooding, which results from flash floods and is affected by local drainage and hard infrastructure, such as car parks and paved driveways. Surface flooding is expected to be a growing issue, and is itself exacerbated by new developments. 

A lack of reliable information makes it more difficult for local authorities to make informed decisions about whether a development is safe to build. ""Part of this is also needing adequate skills and resources in local planning authorities to be able to understand, assess and deal with this,"" says Woodward. 

North Kesteven District Council, which was responsible for approving the Sainsbury's in Washingborough, says it had been satisfied by the company's mitigations for the development, which include plans to pump water to a drain offsite.

Whether we can meet our housebuilding targets without building on flood plains is unclear. 

There is no national plan delineating where would be safe to build for the future, nor are there detailed maps on risk that include all sources of flooding, despite promises from the Government.

And because flood-threat information is patchy and slow to be updated, houses could be built at a time when they are considered to be at low risk, only for them to become high risk by the time they are finished. 

Of course, there are some places where building on a flood plain may appear to be unavoidable. 

""Places like London and Hull are in areas that have flood risk, but we can't just not build there,"" says Philip Box, policy adviser at UK Green Building Council. ""But there would have to be strong resilience measures and mitigation measures. Without that, we're just building houses that will flood or are uninsurable."" 

The London Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham has pushed through the highest number of developments despite EA objections over flood risk. Developers are expected to include mitigation measures when they get the green light to build on flood plains, which could include not building dwellings at ground floor, or raising all sockets in the home. But there is effectively no enforcement of this by cash-strapped councils, according to a recent report from think tank Policy Connect. 

And unlike in Scotland, which sets out clearly what developers must include in their plans to cut the risk of flooding, there are no standards for mitigation measures in England. 

Mitigation measures can only go so far, however. 

""There's quite a lively debate at the moment about what constitutes flood resilience and flood resistance,"" says Box. ""Venice, for example, is flood resistant and basically exists above water. But is that feasible in the UK?""

Meanwhile, potential buyers are left almost entirely in the dark about whether their new home will be at risk of flooding or not. ""There is no information pack for a new homeowner or certification scheme for flood resilience,"" says Box. ""Most new homeowners don't know that they're in an area of high risk until they can't get insurance or the property floods."" 

As many as 70,000 new homes could become uninsurable because they have been built on sites at risk of flooding, according to a 2020 report from Conservative think tank Bright Blue.

The Government has promised to make so-called sustainable urban drainage systems (SuDS) mandatory on all new developments, which could lessen the impact of flooding everywhere.

The requirements, which are already standard in Scotland and Wales, could mean the end of tarmac driveways, and require new homes to include ponds or swales to soak up rainwater. But they are facing calls to tighten up on planning rules that would put a stop to the most at-risk homes being built in the first place. 

""Government has rightly moved to prevent new development which can't be protected from a one-in-200-years coastal flood event, but we think the same bar should be introduced for areas at risk from rivers,"" says Prof Jim Hall from the National Infrastructure Commission. 

""Householders don't care about the water source when it comes to keeping their property safe from the devastating impact of floods.""

Cormac McCarthy: Pulitzer Prize-winning US author dies aged 89

Writer known for novels including The Road and No Country For Old Men dies at home from natural causes

Pulitzer Prize-winning author Cormac McCarthy, known for his gritty novels, has died aged 89.

The Road and No Country for Old Men writer died on Tuesday at home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, his publisher said.

McCarthy won major literary awards and gained international acclaim for a dozen novels over his nearly six-decade long career.

Considered a demanding but honest writer, his clinical descriptions of inner torment and the backwoods of America won him a fiercely loyal following.

Born to a lawyer father, McCarthy's family moved to Tennessee when he was four years old.

His given name was Charles, but he changed it to Cormac, after an Irish king, as he opted not to finish university and instead focus on writing.

In 2008, an adaptation of his novel No Country for Old Men by directors Joel and Ethan Coen won four Oscars, including one for Spanish actor Javier Bardem.

A year earlier, McCarthy was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for The Road, the story of a father and son making their way across a post-apocalyptic landscape.

McCarthy wrote his first novel, The Orchard Keeper, while working at a car parts shop in Chicago in the 1960s.

The raw and violent book is an ode to the savage natural environment of the mountains of Tennessee, the southern US state where McCarthy grew up.

Mr McCarthy's focus on the dark contours of humanity remained the through line of his work, gaining him an ardent fan base and critical success.

The acclaimed author received multiple writing fellowships, including one from the Rockefeller Foundation.

In 1968, he published Outer Dark, the story of the fallout from an incestuous relationship.

His next book, Child of God, published in 1973, is about a man who heads into the Appalachian mountains to live apart from society. It contains descriptions of murder and necrophilia.

In 1981, Mr McCarthy received one of the MacArthur Foundation's so-called genius grants, and he spent the next part of his life living in El Paso, Texas, on the border with Mexico - a time that had a profound impact on his work.

Banking fears reignited on Wall Street as HSBC chief claims crisis is over

Key moments

Chosen by us to get you up to speed at a glance

Fears of a US banking crisis were reignited on Tuesday after shares in two regional lenders plummeted following the failure of First Republic.

PacWest, a Californian lender, saw trading in its shares suspended after the stock plunged as much as 39pc, while Arizona's Western Alliance fell by more than a fifth.

The steep drops stoked concerns about a crisis of confidence in the US banking system and led to calls for the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates.

Ten Congressmen on Tuesday wrote to Jerome Powell, chairman of the US central bank, urging him to pause interest rate hikes at the Fed's meeting later this week to ""avoid engineering a recession that destroys jobs and crushes small businesses''.

HSBC's chief executive Noel Quinn played down concerns about the health of the global banking system after JP Morgan was forced to step in to rescue California's First Republic, the third US lender to fail in two months.

He said: ""We're pleased that there was a resolution on First Republic at the weekend so that that situation has been resolved.

""We do not believe there is a global banking crisis on the horizon. We think there are some challenges that have been evidenced in some of the regional banks in the US, but we do not believe that's systemic in the US, or across all banks.""

Intense focus on PacWest and Western Alliance came after regulators seized beleaguered regional bank First Republic over the weekend and sold it to Wall Street giant JP Morgan. It was the second largest banking failure in the US since Washington Mutual in 2008.

Both PacWest and Western Alliance have faced scrutiny owing to their similarities with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which collapsed in March, and First Republic. All have a high proportion of uninsured deposits.

PacWest, which is regarded as one of the weakest of the mid-sized regional banks, struggled following the collapse of SVB. Deposits at the Beverly Hills-headquartered bank fell by more than $5bn to $28.2bn (£22.6bn) during the first three months of the year.

Last week it said deposits had stabilised following a flurry of withdrawals.

Mr Quinn's reassurances about the health of the global banking system came as HSBC reported a tripling in profit thanks to rising interest rates.

The FTSE 100 bank reported pre-tax profits of $12.9bn for the first three months of the year, up from $4.1bn during the same period last year.

HSBC's net interest margin - the gap between what the bank pays savers and what it charges borrowers - jumped 0.5 percentage points to 1.69pc.

MPs have accused retail banks of taking advantage of soaring interest rates to bolster their own profits at the expense of customers.

Harriett Baldwin, chairman of the Treasury Committee, said banks were ""relying on inertia by their most loyal customers to drive higher profits.""

She said: ""As a Committee, we will continue to pay close attention to the banks' results and we will continue to press for further action in this area.""

Last month, the City watchdog challenged bank bosses who were being miserly with their savings rate increases and warned of ""onerous interventions"" if they continued to fail to pass on rate rises to savers.

Some instant access savings accounts pay as little as 0.7pc interest. HSBC's basic easy access account pays a standard rate of 1.3pc annually.

HSBC booked a provisional $1.5bn profit from its government-engineered rescue of SVB UK, the bank said on Tuesday. Mr Quinn said the bank plans to expand the SVB unit in Hong Kong, elsewhere in Asia and potentially in Israel, adding that there were ""no nasty surprises"" hidden with the bank that it bought for £1.

Mr Quinn and his colleagues are preparing to face activist shareholders at the bank's annual meeting in Birmingham on Friday, with its largest investor calling for the lender to spin off its Asian business from the rest of its operations.

Superdry turns to investors to raise an additional £12m

Fashion chain Superdry has announced plans to issue nearly 16,000 new shares to raise around £12m.

Raising additional cash from investors is hoped to balance the balance sheet as Superdry attempts to turnaround its business amid weakened consumer demand.

The new shares will represent around 19pc of the total value of shares Superdry has already issued.

Superdry's chief executive and founder, Julian Dunkerton, has agreed to underwrite a material portion of shares. 

Mr Dunkerton's personal investment reflects ""confidence in the long-term prospects of the business"", the company said. 

Superdry is in the process of simplifying its business model, which includes savings of £35m.

It also plans to dispose of its intellectual property assets across the Asia Pacific for £34m.

Ocado shareholders rebel against chief executive's £2m pay package

Ocado shareholders have staged a rebellion against chief executive Tim Steiner's near £2m pay package as the online retailer faces mounting losses.

Mr Steiner received a £755,000 salary last year and an annual bonus of £1.19m, alongside other benefits. 

Lucrative pay deals were also handed to other members of Ocado's executive board. Chief financial officer Stephen Daintith received a £1.39m package last year, while five directors were paid almost £7m between them.

More than 30pc of shareholders voted against the remuneration package at Ocado's annual general meeting on Tuesday, although the deal was passed after receiving the necessary majority of votes.

Ocado said the vote against its pay policy was related to its annual bonuses for the year and its separate value creation plan - a five-year incentive scheme that pays up to £100m in bonuses if share price targets are reached.

Under the scheme, Mr Steiner could receive an additional £20m per year.

According to Ocado, none of its directors received a payout under the value creation plan for the year, although they backed its continuation despite shareholder opposition.

Ocado said: ""The board continues to believe that the implementation of the current directors' remuneration policy, which was approved at the 2022 annual general meeting, offers the best way to incentivise management and drive exceptional and sustainable long-term growth of the group while also rewarding short-term operational and strategic decisions.""

The value creation plan was opposed by a third of shareholders when its extension was approved during last year's annual general meeting.

Ocado previously faced backlash from investors after it handed Mr Steiner a £54m bonus for 2019.

The latest rebellion of shareholders comes after Ocado reported its first ever annual decline in grocery sales as rising living costs has forced shoppers to place fewer items in their baskets.

Ocado Retail, a joint venture between Ocado and Marks & Spencer, recorded a 3.8pc drop in revenue to £2.2bn in 2022.

Ocado also recorded pre-tax losses of £501m for 2022, as inflationary pressures weighed down on the company's profitability. Its share price has fallen nearly 23pc this year.

Last week, Ocado announced plans to close its warehouse in Hatfield, Herts, later this year, putting up to 2,300 jobs at risk.

The online grocer's orders will instead be fulfilled by automated warehouses which can pick more than 200 units per hour, compared to Hatfield which picks around 150 units an hour.

The move comes as Ocado reevaluates its space requirements across the UK, having suspended plans to launch new sites in 2024 and 2025.

It has enough capacity to fulfil 700,000 orders a week in Britain, but currently processes around 400,000 orders per week.

Thomson Reuters boosts profit amid AI push

Thomson Reuters has reported higher-than-expected sales and operating profit in the first quarter, as it plans a deeper investment in artificial intelligence.

The news and information company reported adjusted earnings of 82 cents per share, beating analyst forecasts for 80 cents.

Total revenue rose 4pc in the quarter to $1.738bn (£1.39bn), beating expectations, according to estimates from Refinitiv.

Thomson Reuters, which owns the Westlaw legal database, Reuters news agency and the Checkpoint tax and accounting service, said organic revenue was up 7pc its three main segments: legal professionals, corporates, plus tax and accounting professionals.

""While we acknowledge elevated macroeconomic uncertainty, our underlying business is resilient,"" said chief executive Steve Hasker.

Thomson Reuters plans to spend some $100 million a year to invest in artificial intelligence, Hasker said. It will start seeing generative AI incorporated into flagship products in the second half of this year.

Wall Street titan Carl Icahn targeted by short seller

Carl Icahn, one of Wall Street's best-known activist investors, has become the target of a short-seller which has accused the billionaire of inflating the value of his empire.

Chief business correspondent Oliver Gill has more:

Hindenburg Research accused the hedge fund manager of operating a ""ponzi-like economic structure"" through his $15bn fund, Icahn Enterprises, and claimed its value had been inflated by at least 75pc.

The short-seller added: ""We think Icahn, a legend of Wall Street, has made a classic mistake of taking on too much leverage in the face of sustained losses: a combination that rarely ends well.""

Icahn Enterprises' shares, listed on the Nasdaq, fell as much as 24pc following the publication of the Hindenburg report.

It is the third high-profile company to have been targeted by Hindenburg this year. In January the short-seller launched a searing attack on Indian billionaire Gautam Adani's business empire, accusing him of corporate fraud. The company has denied the allegations.

Last month the short-seller took aim at Block, the US crypto payments company run by Twitter's co-founder and former chief executive Jack Dorsey.  

In its latest attack on Icahn Enterprises, Hindenburg raised questions over the company's dividend and its recent financing...

Dow Jones sheds over 500 points as banks tumble again

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen by over 560 points or 1.65pc to 33,488.42 as shares in beleaguered banks tumble again.

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has fallen 1.66pc to 4,098.59 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is trading 1.45pc lower at 12,035.95.

Some of the sharpest drops came from smaller and mid-sized banks, which have been under heavy scrutiny as the banking system shows cracks under the weight of much higher interest rates. 

The Dow Jones US Banks Index is currently down 3.75pc, while the S&P 500 Banks Industry Group Index is 3.55pc lower. 

PacWest and Western Alliance have resumed trading, but have yet to reverse the steep losses suffered earlier today. 

FTSE 100 closes in the red

The FTSE 100 has ended in the red, closing down 1.24pc at 7,773.03.

The blue-chip index was weighed down by education publisher Pearson (share price down 15.31pc) after a major US rival warned that its finances were being hit by the popularity of ChatGPT.

The commodity-heavy index was also dragged down by oil and gas majors - including Shell (down 4.37pc) and BP (down 4.05pc).

Despite BP reporting higher than expected quarterly profits, shares in the oil major sank after it revealed plans to reduce its share buyback programme.

The mid-cap FTSE 250 index ended 0.57pc lower at 19,314.23.

Thousands of IBM staff at risk from AI, boss warns

Artificial intelligence will replace thousands of office workers at IBM within five years, the IT giant's chief executive has predicted.

Technology editor James Titcomb has the story:

Arvind Krishna said IBM would suspend or slow down hiring in back office areas such as human resources as many tasks are replaced by automation.

Around 26,000 people currently have roles in these positions at IBM, which employed around 288,000 staff at the end of last year.

""I could easily see 30pc of that getting replaced by AI and automation over a five-year period,"" Mr Krishna told Bloomberg. This would amount to around 7,800 staff. IBM said much of this reduction would come through attrition, rather than widespread layoffs.

Mr Krishna's prediction is among the first signs that a new wave of artificial intelligence programs are disrupting the job market, especially among white collar workers. 

His forecast comes as many high-tech companies have cut jobs and introduced hiring freezes this year in an attempt to reassure investors...

PacWest and Western Alliance halt trading as share prices sink

Shares in two regional US banks have been paused amid fresh concerns about the health of the financial sector in the wake of the rescue of First Republic.

PacWest Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp halted trading in their equities today after suffering share price falls of 24pc and 20pc respectively.

The volatility led to a halt in trading with the KBW Regional Banking Index sinking as much as 4.2pc in the US, while the KBW Bank Index was down 3.7pc.

It comes a day after a deal was reached to sell First Republic Bank to JP Morgan after US regulator the FDIC took control of the San Francisco-based lender.

Its share price had collapsed by 97pc this year following the crisis of confidence triggered by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March. 

It revealed last week its deposits had plunged by $100bn in the first quarter.

Federal Reserve begins talks that could end series of interest rate rises

The US Federal Reserve has kicked off a two-day meeting today to decide whether to raise its benchmark lending rate for a 10th - and possibly final - time to tackle rising prices.

The Fed has been on an aggressive campaign of interest-rate increase since March last year, rapidly raising rates to help target high inflation, which remains above its long-term target of two percent.

With the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) widely expected to raise its base rate a quarter-point on Wednesday, analysts will be looking for any ""revisions to the forward guidance in its statement,"" Goldman Sachs' chief US economist David Mericle wrote in a recent note to clients.

He said: ""We expect the Committee to signal that it anticipates pausing in June but retains a hawkish bias, stopping earlier than it initially envisioned because bank stress is likely to cause a tightening of credit.""

Futures traders also see a more than 95pc chance that the Fed will raise its benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points when it announces its decision tomorrow, according to CME Group.

Such a move would bring the interest rate to between 5 and 5.25pc - its highest level since before the global financial crisis.

Greene King sales surge after Covid but pub company warns of 'tough' trading ahead

Pub and brewing giant Greene King has said its expects the ""tough"" trading backdrop to continue for the rest of 2023 but hailed a leap in sales for the past year.

The company, which runs more than 2,000 sites across the UK, reported that revenues jumped by 62.2pc to £2.2bn for 2022.

It said trade returned to pre-pandemic levels after the easing of Covid-19 restrictions.

Demand was boosted by events such as the Platinum Jubilee weekend, women's football Euros and men's football World Cup.

However, customer confidence was ""depressed"" throughout the year as a result of the higher cost of living.

Greene King, which is owned by CKA group, the business empire of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, also revealed a jump in profits for the year.

Operating profits bounced to £192.6m compared with £18.6m in 2021.

Apple fights mass legal action accusing it of 'throttling' iPhone batteries

Apple has urged a tribunal to block a £1.6bn mass legal action accusing it of hiding defective batteries in millions of iPhones by ""throttling"" them with software updates.

The tech giant is facing the case brought by consumer champion Justin Gutmann on behalf of iPhone users in the UK.

Mr Gutmann's lawyers argued in court filings that Apple concealed issues with batteries in certain phone models and ""surreptitiously"" installed a power management tool which limited performance.

Apple said in written arguments that the lawsuit is ""baseless"" and strongly denies its iPhones' batteries were defective, apart from in a small number of iPhone 6s models for which it offered free battery replacements.

The company also says its power management update - introduced in 2017 to manage demands on older batteries or with a low level of charge - only reduced an iPhone 6's performance by an average of 10pc.

Mr Gutmann asked London's Competition Appeal Tribunal to certify the case and allow it to proceed towards a trial.

Wall Street falls ahead of US interest rate decision

US markets edged lower after the opening bell as investors braced for the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision and awaited developments from Washington on the debt limit showdown.

The Fed's two-day policy meeting kicks off later, in which it is expected to raise rates by a quarter percentage point and potentially signal a willingness to hold off on further increases. 

Focus is also on policymakers in Washington after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government might run out of money to pay its bills as early as June.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.5pc after the opening bell to 33,896.74 while the broad-based S&P 500 dropped 0.4pc to 4,152.55.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was down 0.2pc to 12,199.20.

Health unions vote to accept pay offer

Health unions representing the majority of NHS workers have recommended that the revised pay offer made by the Government should be implemented.

In a joint statement, members of the NHS Staff Council said that the unions agreed to the deal for staff on the Agenda for Change contract, which includes all NHS workers apart from doctors, dentists and senior managers.

The 14 unions representing staff on the contract have balloted hundreds of thousands members over the last few weeks.

Unison, GMB, the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists and the Royal College of Midwives were among those who voted to accept the offer while Royal College of Nursing and Unite voted against it.

Pearson shares plummet as US rival warns of hit from AI

Shares in London-listed education publisher Pearson have plummeted as a major US rival warned that its finances were being hit by the popularity of ChatGPT.

California-based Chegg said on Monday that the AI software was having an impact on how many students were signing up to its services.

The hit has been so pronounced that the company withdrew its guidance for the full year and warned that second-quarter revenue will be significantly lower than what Wall Street analysts expected.

Chegg's share price dropped by more than 40pc as a result in pre-market trading in the US - and its woes knocked Pearson, a major rival, whose shares were trading down nearly 10pc in London.

Chegg chief executive Dan Rosensweig said there had been a ""significant spike"" in student interest in ChatGPT since March which is ""having an impact on our new customer growth rate"".

Uber drives forward as customers keep spending on rides and takeaway

Uber reported earnings that beat analysts' estimates, showing that consumers continue to spend more on rides and food takeout despite an uncertain economic outlook and rising prices.

Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation reached $761m (£610m) in the first quarter, beating the $678.6m analysts were predicting.

Chief financial officer Nelson Chai said: ""We delivered record profitability and free cash flow in Q1, and we are poised to expand profitability again in Q2.""

Shares jumped more than 3pc in premarket trading.

The results signal that the San Francisco-based company is weathering a shaky economy better than expected, even as spending in retail and other areas suffers. 

It has also been outshining rival Lyft, which is overhauling operations in the face of sluggish demand and weak profits. Lyft is set to report its results later this week.

The Kremlin has said that the window to extend the Black Sea grain deal is shrinking ahead of talks designed to give a lifeline to the UN-brokered agreement aimed at staving off world hunger.

Russia has repeatedly indicated it is prepared to walk away from the deal on May 18 if the demands of Vladimir Putin's regime to ease restrictions on its own agricultural exports are not addressed.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that talks between the parties were continuing, but without any results, adding that part of the deal concerning Russia's interests was not being implemented.

Mr Peskov said: ""Russia's position is well known - the deal was extended for two months.

""The terms of the deal that concern Russia's agricultural sector are not being fulfilled.""

The deal, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey last July, allows grain trapped by Russia's invasion to be safely exported from Ukraine's Black Sea ports.

Mr Peskov said he was not able to say in what format, time and place negotiations would continue, after a Ukrainian source told Reuters that the parties to the deal would meet on Wednesday.

Among other requests, Moscow says it wants its state-run agriculture bank, Rosselkhozbank, to be reconnected to the SWIFT international financial messaging system, and for the Togliatti-Odessa ammonia pipeline to be restarted.

The West says its sanctions do not explicitly target Russia's agricultural sector, but Moscow says its agricultural exports have been hit by restrictions on its banks as well as other sanctions on logistics and insurance.

BBC journalists halt strikes over local radio cuts

Strike action planned by BBC journalists over cuts to local radio has been paused, following talks brokered by the arbitration service Acas.

Members of the National Union of Journalists in local radio, local TV and online were due to stage a 24-hour walkout on Friday to coincide with the results of the local elections.

The union said journalists have now been sent a consultative ballot on whether they are willing to accept a revised proposal from BBC management and end the dispute, or to reject it and continue with strike action and the work-to-rule.

A work-to-rule which started last month and is due to continue until May 9 is paused and the planned strike on Friday is postponed.

The union said if the proposals are rejected, the work-to-rule will recommence from May 10.

Covid jab still boosting Pfizer

Pfizer's first-quarter profit and revenue outpaced analysts' expectations as demand for its for pandemic products persisted even amid waning infections.

Adjusted first-quarter earnings were $1.23 a share, exceeding analysts' expectation of 97 cents. 

Revenue of $18.3bn (£14.7bn) also beat Wall Street expectations. The company left untouched its full year earnings guidance at $3.25 to $3.45 a share, and revenue at $67bn to $71bn.

Pfizer has struggled with a steep drop off in demand for its Covid products that has made its stock among the worst-performing in big pharma this year. 

The New York-based drugmaker announced the $43bn planned acquisition of cancer-drug biotech Seagen earlier this year, giving investors more assurance that it is seeking new avenues for growth. 

Pfizer's Covid vaccine Comirnaty and Paxlovid antiviral transformed the company, contributing more than half its $100bn in sales last year. 

But in the first quarter, revenue for the jab fell 77pc to $3.1bn, although this was more than the $2.6bn analysts expected. Paxlovid saw quarterly purchases at $4.1bn, beating estimates for $2.7bn.

Wall Street expected to fall at opening bell

US stock markets are on track to edge lower as a surprise interest rate increase by Australia's central bank ahead of a much-awaited policy meeting by the Federal Reserve spooked investors.

The US central bank is expected to deliver a 25 basis-point interest rate increase on Wednesday and then hold rates steady for the rest of 2023, according to economists in a Reuters poll.

Worries about an economic downturn and concerns about stress in the banking sector have fuelled expectations of rate cuts in the latter half of the year. 

However, with inflation running well over the central bank's 2pc target and a labour market remaining strong, the chances of rate cuts seem less likely.

Focus also remains on earnings from major companies with Pfizer, Uber, Cummins and Marriott International scheduled today.

Analysts expect first-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies to fall 1.9pc from a year earlier following better-than-expected reports from some technology and growth giants, compared with a 5.1pc fall expected at the start of April, according to Refinitiv data.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 are expected to fall 0.2pc at the opening bell, while futures on the Nasdaq 100 were flat.

Tinder owner swipes left on Russia as it announces exit

Tinder owner Match Group has said it will quit Russia by June 30, citing the need to protect human rights, joining many Western companies to leave since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine last year.

In an annual impact report published this week, Match said:

We are committed to protecting human rights. 

Our brands are taking steps to restrict access to their services in Russia and will complete their withdrawal from the Russian market by June 30, 2023.

Many digital services providers with few staff in Russia, such as Spotify and Netflix, pulled out shortly after Moscow began its military campaign in Ukraine in February 2022.

Match, whose brands include dating applications such as Tinder, Hinge and PlentyOfFish, has made few public statements about its Russian operations, but flagged negative impacts on its European business in March 2022.

Australian dollar surges after surprise rate decision

The pound's fall today comes after the Reserve Bank of Australia delivered a surprise increase in interest rates - and with traders' attention turned elsewhere.

Against the Australian dollar, sterling dropped as much as 0.6pc after the RBA stunned markets with a quarter-point rate rise overnight and said it may have to raise again as inflation is still far too high.

With the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank meeting this week to discuss policy, activity in sterling could be fairly muted, analysts said.

ING strategist Chris Turner said: 

It looks like sterling will take a back seat to events in the US and eurozone this week. 

The market has settled on pricing a 25 basis point Bank of England hike to 4.5pc on May 11 - with which we agree.

The market also prices the Bank Rate close to the 4.9pc area by November, a view with which we disagree.

Sterling is vying with the Swiss franc for the title of best-performing major currency against the dollar this year - both show a gain of about 3pc. 

Pound slides against the dollar

The pound has fallen against the dollar even as the US Treasury Department said it could run out of the cash it needs to pay its bills by early June.

The mood in the market was fraught as Joe Biden summoned the four top congressional leaders to the White House next week after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the US might run out of money to cover obligations as soon as June 1.

The US Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by a quarter of a point on Wednesday, with the European Central Bank announcing their next decisions on Thursday. The Bank of England's next decision will be announced on May 11.

However, money markets suggest this will be the final US rate increase given the anxiety around the tug-of-war over the government's debt limit, as well as the stability banking sector after the rescue of First Republic by JP Morgan on Monday.

The pound has fallen 0.2pc against the dollar but remains well over $1.24. Sterling is down 0.1pc against the euro, which is worth less than 88p.

Eurozone bond yields rise

Eurozone government bond yields have risen, playing catch-up with US Treasuries as markets reopened after a holiday.

Bonds were unchanged after data showed that eurozone inflation ticked up to 7pc in April, from 6.9pc in March. 

Yields climbed sharply early in the session but slipped back when eurozone bank lending data showed an exceptionally large drop in credit demand in the first quarter. 

The figures came a day after JPMorgan took over ailing US lender First Republic, in the latest sign of the pressures on the banking system.

Germany's 10-year yield, the benchmark for the bloc, was up five basis points at 2.368pc, having risen more than 10 basis points early in the session. Yields move inversely to prices.

Eurozone core inflation 'difficult to contain'

Policymakers at the ECB deciding the next move for interest rates will be most concerned about core inflation, which strips out volatile items like food and drink, according to Capital Economics.

Chief Europe economist Andrew Kenningham said:

They may be relieved that it edged down from 5.7pc to 5.6pc, its first fall since June last year, but the detail is not particularly encouraging.

The fall in core inflation was due to lower core goods inflation, which dropped from 6.6pc to 6.2pc. 

This component was always likely to come down due to the improvement in global supply chains. But services inflation, which is of more concern, edged up from 5.1pc to 5.2pc. 

With the labour market still remarkably tight and demand for labour having increased further in April, policymakers will worry that services inflation will be difficult to contain.

In sum, these numbers do not decisively tip the balance ahead of Thursday's ECB decision. 

Our hunch is that the Bank will pull a hawkish surprise by going for a 50 basis point rather than 25 basis point hike, and we think sticky services inflation and the tight labour market will ultimately persuade them to raise rates to 4pc before ending the tightening cycle.

Superdry in talks with investors over equity raise

Retailer Superdry has said it is holding ""positive"" talks with investors over an equity raise of up to 20pc as it looks to shore up its balance sheet in the face of tough trading.

The chain said founder and chief executive Julian Dunkerton plans to ""significantly"" take part in the equity raise and offer a ""material underwriting commitment"".

It comes after it was reported at the end of last week that it was in advanced talks over a £15m share sale to bolster its finances.

The move marks its latest efforts to raise cash after it last month unveiled a deal to sell its intellectual property assets in Asia-Pacific to raise £34m.

Superdry is also slashing costs, recently announcing aims to save more than £35m, amid sales woes.

Earlier this month, it warned over profits for the second time this year after it admitted sales in February and March were disappointing.

Surging food and tobacco prices drive surprise rise in eurozone inflation

Inflation inched higher across the eurozone last month amid high food prices, raising pressure on the ECB to raise interest rates later this week.

Consumer prices in the 20 countries using the euro jumped 7pc in April from a year earlier, just up from the annual rate of 6.9pc in March, the European Union's statistics agency Eurostat said.

Food, alcohol and tobacco prices eased a little, with annual price growth slowing to 13.6pc from March's 15.5pc.

Energy prices rose by a more modest 2.5pc but this was falling back from a rate of 37.5pc in the same month last year in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel, slowed slightly but was still high at 5.6pc, underlining the expectation that the ECB will press ahead with an increase in interest rates this week.

Analysts say the ECB's meeting Thursday in Frankfurt could end in an increase of a quarter- or a half-percentage point. 

While the slight fall in food inflation is good news, economists say those are partly statistical quirks, due the fact that lower figures from before the current outbreak of inflation have aged out of the annual comparison, a so-called base effect.

Britain's manufacturers 'remain stoically optimistic'

After Britain's manufacturing sector contracted in April, Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said:

The UK manufacturing sector remained in the doldrums at the start of the second quarter. Output and new orders contracted, as manufacturers felt the impacts of client uncertainty, destocking and tightening cost controls. 

There was no escape from the subdued mood of the market, with both domestic and export customers remaining reticent to commit to new contracts.

There was better news on supply chains, as supplier lead times have now shortened in each of the past three months, providing welcome news in terms of improved resource availability and helping drive down raw material price pressures.

Better-running supply chains have helped manufacturers reduce backlogs of orders, accumulated in prior months amid component shortages. 

But the concern is that these backlogs are being depleted, leaving firms with less work in hand. 

There may be some light on the horizon, as manufacturers remain stoically optimistic about the outlook for the year ahead. 

Over 60pc of firms expect to expand production over the next 12 months. But demand will need to pick up in the months ahead to warrant any increase in production, and with the UK seeing stubbornly high domestic inflation coupled with a worsening export trend, risks seem skewed to the downside.

Manufacturing sector shrinks as clients reluctant to commit to new orders

The UK's manufacturing sector contracted in April as customers reduced stock and cut costs, according to an influential survey.

The S&P Global/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI fell to a three-month low of 47.8 in April, down slightly from the 47.9 scored in March.

However, it came in above the previous estimate of 46.6 for the latest month. Any score below 50 is considered a contraction for the sector.

The downturn in the #UK manufacturing sector continued in April (#PMI at 47.8; Mar: 47.9) amid sustained contractions in output and new orders. But there is a silver lining in the fact that supply and inflationary pressures eased on the month. Read more: https://t.co/TtSS4TDrnu pic.twitter.com/iub3OFVTXC

Eurozone banks curb lending more than expected

Banks in the eurozone curbed lending more than anticipated after borrowing costs jumped and turmoil gripped the financial sector, reinforcing calls for the European Central Bank to slow the pace of its interest-rate increases.

Credit standards ""tightened further substantially"" in the first quarter, according to the ECB's Bank Lending Survey, published today. 

It said: ""The tightening for loans to firms and for house purchase was stronger than banks had expected in the previous quarter and points to a persistent weakening of loan dynamics.""

The decline in net demand from firms was more than foreseen by banks in the previous three months, and the most since the global financial crisis, it said.

The poll is the first to offer concrete indications of the knock-on effects of Silicon Valley Bank's demise and Credit Suisse's takeover by UBS in March.

ECB officials had suggested that evidence of a tightening in financial conditions from the banking stress could persuade them to raise rates by a smaller amount at their next decision on Thursday, when the Governing Council is expected to choose between a quarter- or a half-point move.

While banks expect a more moderate tightening going forward, demand for loans ""decreased strongly"" in Q1, with the main drags coming from higher interest rates and weaker investment prospects. pic.twitter.com/KeL6FwoZpg

BP 'yet to feel full impact of loss of Russian assets'

After BP posted quarterly profits of £4bn, Roberto Rivero, market analyst at Admirals, said:

Considering oil and gas prices traded at much lower levels in Q1 than they did the previous year, it is unsurprising to see underlying profit fall year on year. 

The profits of BP and other oil and gas majors were given a boost in the first quarter of 2022 as energy prices spiralled in response to the war in Ukraine.

Despite receiving support recently from Opec+ production cuts, the outlook for oil prices remains somewhat unclear. 

Continuing uncertainty surrounding the global economy, exacerbated by recent turbulence in the banking industry, could see energy prices continue the downward trajectory which started in the middle of last year. Naturally, lower oil and gas prices will result in less money for BP, which could see earnings return to more normal levels after a period of outsized profits. 

If this is the case, BP may start to feel the loss of its Rosneft shareholding more acutely, which it exited last year amidst an exodus of Western businesses from Russia.

More than a year after BP's exit from Rosneft, we have arguably not yet seen the full impact of the loss of its Russian assets, which accounted for around 12pc of profit in 2021. 

This loss in earnings has been well-masked by exceptionally high oil and gas prices, but if energy prices continue to retreat, the loss of Rosneft may begin to bite.

Oil inches up as First Republic rescue calms markets

Oil has inched up after a day of losses fuelled by concerns over China's economic outlook and caution in financial markets before JP Morgan's rescue of First Republic Bank.

Brent crude, the international benchmark, crept up 0.3pc towards $80 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate has risen 0.2pc above $75 a barrel after dropping 1.5pc on Monday. 

China's recovery remains patchy with recent data pointing to a contraction in manufacturing. 

Still, tourism and travel activity soared on the first day of the country's five-day Labor Day holiday, possibly signalling increased demand for fuels in the world's largest crude importer.

In the US, JPMorgan agreed to acquire First Republic, the latest lender to fail. 

While the deal could help to stabilise the financial system, there are still concerns over the fate of other weak banks in the country.

Oil has shed more than 5pc this year despite a move by the Opec+ cartel to cut supply from this week. 

Losses have been spurred by a darkening economic outlook, with central banks including the Federal Reserve continuing to raise rates.

FTSE 100 inches higher amid HSBC profits

The FTSE 100 has edged higher, boosted by a jump in shares of HSBC after the lender's quarterly profit tripled, though overall gains were limited by weakness in energy stocks.

The internationally-focused FTSE 100 rose 0.2pc, while the domestically-focused FTSE 250 was up 0.6pc.

HSBC has advanced 4.6pc to the top of the FTSE 100 after its first-quarter profit topped expectations as rising interest rates worldwide boosted income and helped it pay its first quarterly dividend since 2019.

BP has fallen 4.8pc after the oil major pared back its share buyback programme. The company, however, made a $5bn (£4bn) profit in the first quarter of 2023, up from the previous three months due to strong oil and gas trading.

Superdry earlier fell 2.7pc but is now 2.1pc higher after the struggling fashion brand said it is in ""positive"" talks with investors regarding an equity raise of up to 20pc.

Windfall tax would pay for council tax freeze, says Starmer

Labour would use the profits made by BP and other fossil fuel companies to freeze council tax, Sir Keir Starmer has said.

The oil giant's profit was more than half a billion pounds more than expected in the first three months of the year as the business continued to benefit from elevated energy prices.

Speaking on BBC Breakfast, the Labour ;eader said that ""of course we want BP and others to make profits so they can invest"", but that these profits are ""over and above"" what BP expected and should contribute to a ""proper windfall tax"". He said:

What we say in the Labour Party is use that money, have a proper windfall tax that's effective and use that money directly to freeze council tax.

The government has loopholes in the windfall tax they've put in place, so they aren't using their money effectively.

Sir Keir said that the number one issue ahead of Thursday's local elections is the cost of living crisis.

Transaction levels 'stable' say estate agents

Nationwide Building Society suggested its latest figures showing house prices rose 0.5pc in April could be ""tentative signs of a recovery"".

Nathan Emerson, chief executive of estate agents' body Propertymark, said: 

Our member agents are reporting transaction levels year on year to be stable as a stream of new properties enter the market with serious buyers still keen to move.

Sellers are still in a strong position to sell; however, they can no longer test the market at higher prices and align with those achieved last year. Instead, they will need to reduce or be open to offers for a more realistic and efficient sale.

Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at estate agent Knight Frank, said: ""The reverberations from the mini-budget that shook the UK property market are fading.

""Price declines are bottoming out and many buyers have accepted the new normal for mortgage rates as stability returns to the lending market.""

Markets open higher in UK

Markets in London have shrugged off any concerns about the banking sector following the rescue of First Republic Bank in the US by JP Morgan.

The FTSE 100 has opened 0.5pc higher at 7,873.97 while the midcap FTSE 250 has begun the day 0.2pc higher at 19,469.25.

'Sellers are being much more realistic on price,' says estate agent

After the latest Nationwide house price data, Nick Harris, co-founder at Wokingham-based Quarters Residential Estate Agents, said: 

The rise in house prices in April shows that there's more life in the property market than many think. 

House prices are still down on an annual basis but demand has been steadily increasing in the first four months of the year and this may be the beginning of the bounce back from the turbulence caused by the mini-Budget. 

While some discretionary buyers continue to sit tight, serious buyers remain very active. 

Sellers are being much more realistic on price, and are typically also buyers so they appreciate a more balanced property market. 

The property market armageddon some predicted is simply unlikely to materialise.

Data aligning on housing market

Nationwide's latest figures chime with readings from other surveys indicating signs of strength in the housing market.

Halifax has reported that prices based on its loan book have been rising for three months, reversing some of the decline it showed at the end of 2022. 

Property surveyors for the first time in a year are anticipating sales will increase, and their outlook for prices is at the strongest it has been since September, according to the Royal Institution for Chartered Surveyors.

Investors anticipate the Bank of England's tightening cycle has further to run, which may weigh on property prices in the months ahead. 

Money markets are fully pricing in another quarter-point increase in the base rate to 4.5pc on May 11 and a peak of almost 5pc in September.

Housing supply 'is slowly improving'

Following the Nationwide data showing house prices are growing again from month to month, Jonathan Hopper, chief executive of the property buying agency Garrington Property Finders, said:

Settling mortgage rates haven't yet reversed the correction in property prices, but they have returned some much-needed calm and pragmatism to the market.

With average prices still falling in many areas, this is unquestionably a buyer's market. 

Proceedable buyers who have their finances in place invariably hold a strong hand, with sellers fighting for their attention and often agreeing to a significant discount just to get a deal done.

While all buyers remain price sensitive, the more pragmatic are taking an increasingly long-term view in their plans rather than agonising over how prices might change over the next month or two. 

Sales volumes are low and there was no spring bounce this year, but supply is slowly improving - helped by the many buy-to-let landlords selling off investment properties which no longer break even following the surge in interest rates.

Nevertheless, things are far from back to normal. With inflation still in double digits, the Bank of England may increase interest rates again later this month - and this would push affordability further out of reach for more first-time buyers.

BP profits hit nearly $5bn in three months

Oil giant BP has significantly beaten expectations by reaching a profit of close to $5bn in the first three months of the year, the group revealed on Tuesday.

Bosses said BP had made an underlying replacement cost profit - the measure that analysts most closely track - of $4.96bn (£4bn).

The result was a reduction from the $6.2bn (£5bn) that BP had made in the same quarter last year, but well ahead of the $4.3bn (£3.4bn) that analysts had expected it to make.

House prices grow for the first time in eight months

House prices grew in April after seven straight months of falls amid signs that mortgage applications are picking up, according to Nationwide.

Prices rose by 0.5pc compared to the previous month, the lender said, with the annual rate of price declines also slowing to 2.7pc from a fall of 3.1pc in March.

The average house price stood at £260,441 in April, according to the building society. Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner said: 

Recent Bank of England data suggests that housing market activity remained subdued in the opening months of 2023, with the number of mortgages approved for house purchase in February nearly 40pc below the level prevailing a year ago, and around a third lower than pre-pandemic levels. 

However, in recent months industry data on mortgage applications point to signs of a pickup.

This also chimes with the recent shifts in consumer sentiment. 

While confidence remains subdued by historic standards, people's views of their own financial position over the next twelve months, and general economic conditions in the year ahead, have both improved markedly in recent months. 

If inflation falls sharply in the second half of the year, as most analysts expect, this would likely further bolster sentiment, especially if labour market conditions remain strong.

HSBC gets £1.2bn boost from Silicon Valley Bank rescue

HSBC's takeover of Silicon Valley Bank for £1 in March amid concerns of a fresh global banking crisis gave the bank a $1.5bn (£1.2bn) boost to its balance sheet in the first three months of the year.

HSBC's pre-tax profits soared by more than $4bn (£3.2bn) in the first quarter and revenue shot up by 64pc to $20.2bn (£16.2bn) compared to the same period 12 months ago, with the company crediting the rise to higher net interest income due to rate rises across the globe.

The increase has seen the banking group announce its first dividend of 10 cents per share since before the pandemic in 2019, as well as a share buy-back of up to $2bn (£1.6bn).

This was as its pre-tax profits rose from $8.7bn (£7bn) to $12.9bn (£10.3bn) from a year ago as operating expenses fell by 7pc to $7.6bn dollars, primarily due to lower restructuring and related costs following the group's cost-saving programme at the end of 2022.

Its results also included a provisional gain of £1.2bn on the Silicon Valley Bank deal, which was brokered by the Bank of England and the Government within days of the collapse of the bank in the US.

The figures come a day after it emerged First Republic Bank will be sold to JP Morgan after becoming the third major US lender to fall in two months.

The Californian lender was seized by regulators on Monday morning amid concerns about its financial health following a plunge in deposits and its share price.

HSBC group chief executive Noel Quinn said: ""We remain focused on continuing to improve our performance and maintaining tight cost discipline, but we also saw an opportunity to invest in SVB UK to accelerate our growth plans.""

HSBC said in its first quarter results that it expects net interest income of at least $34bn (£27.2bn) in 2023 after its profits were boosted by the surge in global interest rates.

Its statement said: ""While the interest rate outlook remains positive, we expect continued pressure from increased migration to term deposits as interest rates rise.""

Mr Quinn added: 

Our strong first quarter performance provides further evidence that our strategy is working.

Our profits were spread across out major geographies and all three global business performed well as we continued to meet our customers' needs through our internationally connected franchises.

With the good momentum we have in our business, we expect to have substantial future distribution capacity for dividends and share buy-backs.

Good morning

HSBC's pre-tax profits soared by more than $4bn (£3.2bn) in the first three months of the year as it was given a $1.5bn (£1.2bn) boost from its acquisition of Silicon Valley Bank's UK arm in March for £1.

The deal helped the bank's pre-tax profits soar by more than $4bn (£3.2bn) as it announced its first dividend of 10 cents per share since before the pandemic in 2019, as well as a share buy-back of up to $2bn (£1.6bn).

Its results come a day after it emerged First Republic Bank will be sold to JP Morgan after becoming the third major US lender to fall in two months.

What happened overnight 

Markets were positioned for Australia's central bank to stay on hold and a 25 basis point hike sent the Aussie dollar up about 0.8pc to its highest in a week at $0.6692.

Three-year Aussie government bond yields also jumped, while Australian stocks slipped 0.7pc.

Elsewhere there were jitters at short tenors in the US Treasury market as the government's borrowing ceiling looms, and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat.

Mainland China markets were closed. Japan's Nikkei hit a 16-month high, before backing off slightly, with the bank sector a drag.

Wall Street stocks ended slightly lower on Monday after JPMorgan Chase acquired the embattled First Republic Bank, as markets traded cautiously ahead of a Federal Reserve decision.

The S&P 500 fell less than 0.1pc to 4,167.87. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.1pc to 34,051.70. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.1pc to 12,212.60.

Treasury yields rose amid firming expectations for the Federal Reserve to raise rates again later this week. The yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced 13 basis points to 3.55pc.

Amateur detectorist's coin find reveals unknown British king Esunertos

Esunertos's name added to historical record after coinage bearing his name is found in Hampshire field

A new name has been added to the list of British monarchs after experts examined a coin found in a Hampshire field by an amateur detectorist.

Dating from around 50BC and smaller than a fingernail, the gold coin is stamped with the name Esunertos, a previously unrecorded Iron Age ruler. It sold at auction for more than £20,000.

The find, by hobbyist Lewis Fudge, has been described by experts as ""one of the outstanding discoveries of recent decades"".

The coin was dug up from a farmer's field in March by Mr Fudge, a construction worker, after he obtained permission to detect.

He said: ""I am over the moon, if it were not for people in the auction room I would have jumped around.

""The collectors I spoke to are gobsmacked. I'm so glad I did not take them up on their private offers before the auction.

""To think my find has generated its own Wikipedia page is incredible.""

The coin dates to the very beginnings of written language appearing in the British Isles.

It was expected to fetch around £4,000 but bidding at auctioneers Spink pushed the price up to £20,400, including premium, beating the world record for a similar type of coin, a ""Medusa"" quarter stater that sold for £10,800.

It was struck sometime between 50BC and 30BC, shortly after Julius Caesar's first raid on Britain in 55BC. Caesar arrived with a small force off the coast of Kent but was forced to turn back after struggling to land and rough seas wrecking their boats.

Leading Iron Age experts who studied the coin deduced it had been struck by a pre-eminent male figure dubbed Iisvnirtos, an alternative spelling of Esunertos that translates from the Celtic language spoken at the time as Mighty as the God Esos. One theory is that he ruled as king from nearby Danebury Hill fort.

Dr John Sills, of the Celtic Coin Index at the Ashmolean Museum, said: ""It is one of the outstanding discoveries of recent decades in Celtic numismatics.""

Gregory Edmund, Iron Age coin specialist at auctioneers Spink, who led the team of experts that recorded the find, added: ""This fabulous piece of prehistoric artwork completes the mental image we have when we think of Iron Age Britain - the war horse and chariot.

""But it also surprises us with the appearance of classical languages like Latin.

""This is the reason I come to work; to document the discoveries of national importance and share that knowledge directly with museums and amongst academics, collectors and the public at large.""

Mr Edmund continued: ""On a personal note, this find is particularly vindicating for me.

""I focused my university degree on the Roman invasion of Britain through the lens of Britain's first coinage.

""To now add a critically important contemporary witness to those seismic events in the birth of our island's story is electrifying.

""Despite the coin's diminutive size, the name of its conceiver - Esunertos - now truly echoes down the ages.

""Esunertos was once forgotten, but now his name looms large in the historic record.""

River Wye ecological status downgraded as sewage turns water into ""˜pea soup'

Waterway's health is reclassified to unfavourable by Natural England as it faces a decline in key species

The River Wye's official ecological status has been downgraded after it was turned into a ""pea soup"" by sewage and chicken farming pollution.

Natural England has reclassified the river's health as unfavourable and declining, indicating that it has deteriorated since the last assessment in 2010.

The river has experienced declines in key species such as the Atlantic salmon and white-clawed crayfish, partly blamed on nutrient pollution from intensive chicken units, livestock farming and sewage.

It comes more than a year after The Telegraph reported that citizen scientists were witnessing a ""slow death"" of the Wye, as it launched its Clean Rivers campaign.

Algal blooms from excess phosphorus pollution have effectively suffocated the river, turning it into a ""pea soup"", according to the Wildlife Trusts, which said it was deeply concerned about the deterioration of the Wye.

""˜Shocking failure by agencies'

The 155-mile river begins in Wales and runs along the border with England to the Severn Estuary.

The charity urged the English and Welsh Governments to immediately halt new or extended chicken farms along the river to tackle phosphorus pollution.

There are an estimated 24 million chickens in the area, most of them free ranging, whose manure contaminates the water with phosphorus when it runs off the soil.

""This new admission represents a shocking failure by the agencies and authorities in Wales and England that are supposed to protect this once beautiful river,"" said Joan Edwards, director of public affairs at The Wildlife Trusts.

""Wider research shows that farm pollution is the main cause of its decline - that's why the authorities must enforce the law wherever the causes of pollution are clear.

""It's time to prevent more chicken sheds from being built and ensure that all farmers are rewarded for nature-friendly, cleaner food production methods.""

Roundtable with farmers and green groups

The river is regularly assessed by the Government advisory body because it is within a site of special scientific interest.

It was classified as unfavourable but recovering following its last assessment in 2010, meaning that the situation should have improved as a result of procedures in place at that time.

The Environment Secretary held a roundtable with farmers, green groups and the Welsh Government in Hereford on Tuesday to discuss the crisis on the river. Therese Coffey said it was ""vital that we turn the tide on its decline"".

""We do all need to work together at a greater pace and with purpose to actively support our farmers and food producers to produce food sustainably and reduce pollution,"" she said.

The Government said it was providing funding for farmers to invest in their slurry storage, as well as providing advice on ways they can reduce water and air pollution.

Deterioration ""˜worrying'

""Any deterioration of river health is worrying for all of us who share a love for our wonderful rivers,"" said Emma Johnson, area manager for the West Midlands, Natural England.

""This updated assessment however does not indicate a sudden decline in the health of the Wye and Lugg; rather, it reflects the results of changing agricultural and industrial practices, climate change, urbanisation and a growing population over recent decades.

""Reducing the pressures on the rivers in the Wye catchment will require patience, commitment and collaboration across Government, regulators and the local community.""

Jamie Audsley, chief executive of Herefordshire Wildlife Trust, said: ""Current approaches have failed to keep the River Wye in a healthy condition.

""What we now need to see is a cross-government plan to bring the Wye back into a favourable condition.

""The Wye should be a river where salmon and otters thrive and people can safely swim.

""The plan will need to involve governments, regulators, farm businesses and others, and ensure a consistent approach across England and Wales.""

Russia and Saudi Arabia cut oil supplies in effort to bolster prices

Key moments

Chosen by us to get you up to speed at a glance

Oil prices have pushed higher as Saudi Arabia and Russia announced twin moves to cut supplies.

Riyadh is already slashing an additional 1m barrels a day of output, and will now continue that reduction into August.

Shortly afterwards, Russia said it will reduce its crude exports by half a million barrels per day next month.

The interventions mark efforts by major oil producers to keep prices propped up after months of declines. So far this year benchmark Brent crude is down around 11pc, fuelled by China's stuttering recovery and fears of a recession in the US.

Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate both rose following the moves by the two biggest members of the OPEC+ producer cartel.

European power prices hit record low

Power prices in Europe have dropped below zero to record-low levels over the weekend, as a surge in solar generation pushed supply above demand. 

Power grids from Britain to France and Denmark are being swamped by cheap supplies due to the growing number of solar panes across the region.

Negative prices are common in the summer, during public holidays or if it is particularly windy. However solar panels are now causing the same surge. 

Andreas Gandolfo, analyst at BloombergNEF, said: ""We've seen a boom in solar around central Europe, which plays a big role when it comes to how power prices evolve.

""Expect to see more and more of these negative prices. This will happen for the entire month and August.""

City AM put up for sale as freesheet struggles with Covid legacy

The owners of City AM have put the daily freesheet up for sale after a failed attempt to attract investment as it continues to reel from the impact of the Covid pandemic.

Bosses at the London financial paper have been in discussions over a potential investment by two foreign consortia in exchange for a minority stake in the business for a number of months.

They have now hired FRP Advisory to explore a sale, with executives said to be open to all offers.

Senior business reporter James Warrington has the story:

City AM was a major victim of pandemic lockdowns and the shift to home working, which led to a slump in the number of commuters picking copies up. It moved to an online-only model in March 2020 and remained out of print for 18 months.

The title ceased printing on Fridays in January, blaming a dearth of bankers commuting into the Square Mile.

City AM currently reaches around 68,000 readers per day, according to the latest figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulation, a reduction of more than 10,000 from pre-pandemic numbers. Its website attracts between 1.8 million and 2 million unique visitors per month.

Lawson Muncaster, managing director of City AM, said: ""As London continues to bounce back from the pandemic, the time has come to think about the next chapter of City AM's story.

""As a local paper at the heart of the financial universe, the brand is perfectly positioned to expand into new areas and develop new revenue streams that take advantage of the new media landscape.""

British manufacturing costs fall at steepest rate since 2016

Britain's manufacturers reported a steep fall in the cost of their costs last month in a sign rampant inflation may soon ease.

Input costs, including raw materials and energy, plunged at the steepest rate since 2016, according to the purchasing managers' index (PMI) survey by S&P Global.

Some of this appears to be reaching factories' customers, with a modest dip in output prices for the first time in eight years.

Thomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK, said this should herald a sharp fall in inflation, helping hard-pressed families' finances.

""Goods inflation looks set to fall from 9.7pc in May to almost zero by the middle of 2024 as recent sharp falls in commodity prices continue to feed through into lower input prices,"" he said.

""Lower inflation, combined with a tight labour market, will mean that households' real earning should start to rise again in the second half of this year. However, much of this increase in real incomes will be offset by the surge in interest rates. As such, we expect the economy to continue to stagnate for another year.""

Pakistani stocks surge after IMF loan granted

Pakistani stocks have seen their biggest single-day jump in 15 years after the country secured a last minute loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 

The country was on Friday granted a $3 billion package to help its economy, which has been on the brink of default, by the IMF.

Stocks gained 5.9% on the first trading session since the loan was secured.

Pakistan's prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, said investors' confidence was ""sharply reviving"" as a result of the agreement to the agreement.

UN chief calls for shipping industry to reduce emissions

The head of the United Nations has urged maritime nations to set a course for the shipping industry to reduce its climate-harming emissions to net zero by 2050 at the latest.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, urged delegates a meeting of the International Maritime Organization in London to agree a new greenhouse gas strategy for shipping that includes ""ambitious science-based targets starting in 2030 - both on absolute emissions reductions and the use of clean fuels.""

The IMO's current target is for the shipping industry to cut its emissions by at least half from 2008 to 2050.

MPs: Supermarkets' fuel price behaviour 'unacceptable'

Now MPs on the Business and Trade Committee have waded into the row over fuel prices. Here's Darren Jones, chair of the committee:

Only last week supermarket bosses told us they were not putting up petrol prices unfairly, and that they were cooperating with the competition authority.

 But this week, it's been confirmed that competition isn't keeping down prices in line with wholesale costs and that Asda, in particular, didn't cooperate with the investigation.

 That is unacceptable and action must be taken.

Inflation won't automatically fall, says new BoE rate-setter

The Bank of England's incoming rate setter Megan Greene has warned against complacency in the fight against inflation.

""It would be a mistake for central bankers to take comfort in the notion that inflation and rates will automatically go back to the low levels we saw before the pandemic,"" she wrote in an article in the Financial Times. ""This is their challenge for the future.""

The comments suggest Greene is willing to back further interest-rates increases when she joins the Monetary Policy Committee on July 5. 

Greene is replacing Silvana Tenreyro, one of the most dovish members of the nine-member panel. 

Tesla helps pull Wall Street higher

The Nasdaq has opened higher this afternoon, setting the tech-heavy index on course to extend its rally into the second half of the year as Tesla jumped on record second-quarter vehicle deliveries.

Tesla jumped more than 6pc as market opened, pulling the Nasdaq into the green.

The benchmark S&P 500 opened marginally higher, while the Dow Jones was down 0.1pc.

Sellers slash asking prices as mortgage crisis hits the housing market

ICYMI - Property sellers are being forced to slash their asking prices in droves as the housing market struggles under the weight of surging borrowing costs.

Melissa Lawford reports:

A third of all homes for sale in the fourth week of June were listed with discounts on their asking prices - up from 18pc in the same week a year earlier and even higher than during the Covid crisis, according to property website Rightmove.

It came as separate data revealed that retail insolvencies had surged almost 60pc to the highest level for a decade as rising borrowing costs inflict a toll on the struggling high street.

The jump in house price cuts corresponds directly with a doubling of mortgage rates, with the average two-year fix rising from 3.25pc in June 2022 to 6.39pc on Friday, according to Moneyfacts.

This means that the monthly cost of a typical £200,000 loan has risen by £362 in the past year. Over the course of a two-year fix, this total extra cost amounts to nearly £9,000.

Thames Water bonds edge higher as fears subside

Bonds of Thames Water have climbed higher today as investors bet a sell-off driven by fears the utility giant would be nationalised have gone too far.

Notes issued by Thames Water's holding company unit that are due to mature in three years gained about 7p on the pound to 62, according Bloomberg data. 

Meanwhile, debt due in 2027 that was sold by the operating company rose 0.6p to around 91 per pound.

The rebound comes as traders try to gauge the potential losses involved in holding the riskiest portions of the company's debt. 

The bonds tumbled last week as concern mounted over the company's heavy debt pile after it was revealed that Thames Water is in talks with government officials over contingency plans, including a temporary nationalisation.

Unilever named war sponsor by Ukrainian government

Unilever, the food giant that prides itself on its ""social purpose"", has been named ""an international sponsor of war"" by the Ukrainian government.

Hannah Boland has the story:

The company, which owns Marmite, Hellmann's mayonnaise and Dove, was accused by Ukrainian veterans of ""contributing hundreds of millions in tax revenues to a state which is killing civilians"".

The consumer goods giant said last year it would review its operations in Russia in the wake of the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. However, the company - known for taking ethical stances - has continued to sell food and hygiene products in the country, with executives from the company saying earlier this year that ""exiting is not straightforward"". 

It came as Unilever's new chief executive Hein Schumacher began his first day in the post.

Nasdaq futures rise after record Tesla deliveries

The Nasdaq looks set to open higher this afternoon, fuelled by gains for Tesla after it announced a record quarter for electric vehicle deliveries.

Tesla rose 6.6pc in pre-market trading after its quarterly deliveries surged to a record high thanks to price cuts.

That helped drive a 0.2pc rise on the tech-heavy Nasdaq before markets opened. Futures tracking the benchmark S&P 500 were flat, while the Dow Jones slipped 0.1pc.

Supermarkets accused of driving up petrol prices by 6p a litre

Here's more on the bombshell CMA decision out today from my colleague Hannah Boland:

Petrol prices are 6p higher than they should be because of weakening competition between supermarkets after they took on heavy debts and buyouts, the monopolies watchdog has said.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) fined Asda £60,000 after claiming it had been lowering prices at the pump at a slower pace than the fall in wholesale prices.

The 6p increase more than completely offsets a 5p cut to fuel duty introduced by the Treasury in 2022, which is costing taxpayers £2.4bn a year.

In its report, the CMA said drivers buying petrol and diesel at supermarkets in 2022 paid around 6p per litre more than they would have done otherwise, because of the Big Four supermarkets increasing their profit margins.

Sarah Cardell, chief executive of the CMA, said: ""Competition at the pump is not working as well as it should be and something needs to change swiftly to address this.""

Vietnam bans Barbie film over disputed China map

Vietnam has reportedly banned the film Barbie from domestic distribution due to a scene that shows a map of the disputed South China Sea.

The film contains an ""illegal image"" of China's disputed nine-dash line, according to local media reports.

The pink-soaked picture, which stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, was expected to air in Vietnamese cinemas from July 21.

Vietnam last year banned Tom Holland blockbuster Uncharted for the same reason.

China claims more than 80pc of the South China Sea and backs up its claim with a 1947 map that shows vague dashes - the nine-dash line - looping down to a point about 1,100 miles south of its Hainan island. 

Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan claim parts of the same maritime area, and have sparred with China over which claims are valid.

AA: CMA action is better late than never

The AA has welcomed the CMA's decision in a lengthy statement. Here's some of it from Luke Bosdet, the AA's spokesman on pump prices:

The AA noted this behaviour as far back as 2005 when, following Hurricane Katrina in the August, pump prices shot up 5p a litre in matter of days but a 4p drop in wholesale costs soon after took more than two months to be reflected at the pump.

Sadly, it has taken more than 15 years for a government and competition watchdog to recognise this and do something about it. However, action that is better late than never is greatly appreciated by motorists across the UK.

The CMA's recognition of the major pump price differences between communities is hugely significant. Once again, concerns were raised more than a decade ago when MPs complained of pump prices in their towns being 3p higher than in towns just up the road. 

That 3p difference became a 5p and then an 8p gap, and then a more than 10p-a-litre chasm opened up between many communities since the pandemic, with supermarkets obviously coming into the firing line. 

However, there was nothing to stop non-supermarket fuel stations seizing the opportunity to undercut those supermarkets, but the majority chose to play along - except for the occasional standout mavericks.

Since the pandemic, this has become not just apparent but blindingly obvious - exemplified by supermarkets over the past year charging way more for fuel than many small independents. 

The price difference of sometimes 10p or more for the same supermarket fuel but in a neighbouring town was so blatant that it has to be asked how the supermarkets ever expected to get away with it.

Asda fined as CMA blames supermarkets for higher fuel prices

The competition watchdog has blamed weaker competition between supermarkets for a surge in fuel prices since 2019.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said increased supermarket fuel margins meant drivers have paid an extra 6p per litre, partly because Asda took a decision to try and achieve higher margins from its petrol forecourts.

The regulator said a new fuel finder scheme would help drivers find the cheapest fuel in their area, adding that it would set up a monitoring body to try to strengthen competition.

It also fined Asda £60,000 for failing to provide relevant information in a timely manner during the year-long investigation.

The CMA added: ""There is no evidence to suggest that there has been cartel behaviour taking place and the CMA has no plans to open an enforcement case."" 

Russia to cut oil exports by 500,000 barrels per day

Russia will cut oil exports by half a million barrels per day in August as Vladimir Putin tries to push up global oil prices.

Alexander Novak, Russia's deputy prime minister, said: ""Within the efforts to ensure the oil market remains balanced, Russia will voluntarily reduce its oil supply in the month of August by 500,000 barrels per day by cutting its exports by that quantity to global markets.""

Russia, whose exports have stayed strong despite Western sanctions, has already pledged to reduce its output by 500,000bpd to 9.5m bpd from March until the end of the year.

Russia is the world's second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia, which will extend its voluntary oil output cut of 1m bpd for another month to include August, the state news agency SPA said this morning.

Benchmark Brent crude was up 89 cents to $76.30 a barrel after gaining 0.8pc on Friday. 

Bank of England says people of any gender identity can be pregnant

The Bank of England has said that people of any gender identity can be treated as pregnant as it pledged to dedicate a floor of its office to offering gender-neutral lavatories, writes Simon Foy.

The embattled central bank introduced a new ""family leave"" policy in June 2021 that included the gender-neutral term ""birthing parent"", according to its 2022 submission to the charity Stonewall, which campaigns for gay, lesbian and transgender rights.

Officials said that this meant ""the parent who is/was pregnant with the child but includes persons of any and all gender identities"".

The application added that Threadneedle Street's parental bereavement leave policy ""talks about parents without specifying gender"", The Times reported.

The views, expressed in its 2022 submission to be included in Stonewall's list of the 100 top employers which was first reported by The Times, also included a pledge to ensure the seventh floor of its London headquarters offered only gender-neutral lavatories.

Goldman Sachs in talks to ditch Apple partnership

Goldman Sachs is said to be considering exiting its partnership with Apple in a move that would end the relationship that helped vault the iPhone maker into the financial world.

The bank is in talks with American Express to take over the Apple credit card and other services that the companies offer together, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Apple, which would need to approve the transfer, is said to be aware of the talks, with have been going on for months.

Apple's push into the world of finance forms part of a broader push to generate more revenue from services. The tech giant made about 20pc of its sales from that category last year, up from less than 10pc a decade ago.

UK banks accused of 'blatant profiteering'

In the middle of a cost of living crisis, the high street banks are squeezing higher profits from their loyal savings customers. 

This blatant profiteering has been shocking, and it's clear to me this behaviour is miles away from the incoming requirement for firms to treat their customers fairly and with respect.

Germany plans â‚¬16.6bn in new borrowing

Germany's finance minister Christian Lindner is planning net new debt of â‚¬16.6bn (£14.3bn) in 2024, including record spending on defence.

The financial plan until 2027 shows new borrowing eventually falling to â‚¬15bn, Reuters reports. Finance ministry sources estimate there is still a gap of â‚¬14.4bn in the midterm budget plan.

Germany plans to comply with NATO's 2pc of GDP target for military spending in 2024, with â‚¬51.8bn budgeted for defence and â‚¬19.2bn in extrabudgetary funds for the armed forces.

Pound beats rest of G10 even as economic unease grows

The pound notched up the best performance of the G10 in the second quarter as the Bank of England kept raising interest rates to battle inflation.

Sterling gained almost 3pc against the dollar over the three-month period, its third straight quarterly rise in the longest run since the middle of 2021.

Against the yen, the worst performer in the second quarter, the pound scored its biggest advance in more than a decade, climbing 12pc as the Bank of Japan kept its monetary policy ultra loose.

The pound has been boosted by surging bond yields - a reflection of investors' expectations that the Bank of England will keep raising rates.

Policymakers surprised the market in June by accelerating its pace of hikes with a half-point increase to 5pc to fight inflation that has exceeded forecasts for four consecutive months. 

But the move has raised concerns about economic headwinds as households and businesses come under ever greater pressure.

UK factory downturn deepens despite lower costs

The pace of decline in Britain's manufacturing sector deepened in June and optimism faded despite weakening cost pressures.

The S&P Global/CIPS manufacturing PMI fell to 46.5 from 47.1 in May - its lowest reading this year and one of the weakest since the 2008-09 financial crisis, though it was revised up from an earlier flash reading of 46.2.

It marked an 11th consecutive month below the 50 threshold for growth, with business surveys and official data pointing to the services sector as the main source of growth in Britain's economy.

This came despite costs paid by factories for materials and energy falling by the most since February 2016, while prices charged by manufacturers dropped for the first time since April 2016.

Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: ""Producers are being hit by weak domestic and export market conditions with clients showing a greater reluctance to commit to spending due to market uncertainty, increased competition and elevated costs.""

Tesla deliveries hit record high after price cuts

Tesla delivered a record 466,140 cars worldwide in the second quarter, topping Wall Street estimates.

The figures underscore the impact of boss Elon Musk's efforts to chase volume by cutting prices. Analysts had expected Tesla to deliver 448,350 vehicles.

The deliveries are up 83pc from a year ago and mark the electric vehicle maker's strongest quarter ever. Tesla also managed to trim the gap between production and deliveries - a figure closely watched by analysts - to 13,560 units in the second quarter.

Price cuts are only one of a number of options available to Tesla, which sells directly to consumers. It has also introduced perks, such as three months of free fast-charging in the US for cars delivered before June 30, to entice buyers.

JD Sports targets Middle East with franchise deal

JD Sports is to launch dozens of stores in the Middle East in the sportswear brand's first franchise deal.

The Bury-based retailer told shareholders it will expand into the region through a new partnership with Dubai-based company GMG.

It will open around 50 stores under the JD brand over the next five years, focusing on locations in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Egypt.

The move is part of plans by JD Sports to open between 200 and 300 new stores each year over the next five years.

Regis Schultz, chief executive of JD, said:

Through my own career, I have seen first-hand the massive untapped potential for retailers in the Middle East, and I am certain that GMG - with their expansive retail expertise and a local understanding of the customer - are the best partners for us in the region.

We are excited by the opportunity to explore franchise partnerships as an avenue for further store growth in underpenetrated markets, leveraging the global growth phenomenon of athleisure while bringing our proven proposition to more customers worldwide.

Barclays looks to cut ties with Odey hedge fund

Barclays is said to be the latest banking trying to cut ties with Odey Asset Management following sexual misconduct allegations against the hedge fund's founder.

The lender, which acts as the hedge fund's corporate bank, is following JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in moving to end its relationship with the investment firm, the Financial Times reports.

OAM is battling to contain the fallout after the FT published a series of allegations of sexual harassment or misconduct against Crispin Odey. He denies the claims.

OAM has already parted ways with Mr Odey and announced plans to rebrand the partnership, which will see his name removed from the company.

But the business is still battling to stay afloat. Last week it announced a restructuring of one of its oldest funds and revealed that one of its star fund managers is in talks to move his portfolio to a rival.

How Russia's shrinking workforce is wrecking its economy

Vladimir Putin's problems are mounting. The Russian President is still reeling from this month's mutiny by mercenary group Wagner.

The Kremlin is burning through its rainy day fund to bankroll its invasion of Ukraine, and the country has been forced to sell oil at a discount to the likes of India and China.

But another problem is emerging as one of the biggest threats facing the Russian economy. After mass conscription - and an exodus of talented Russians fearful of the war's impact - there simply aren't enough workers to fill the jobs available.

European gas prices rises with heatwave forecast

European natural gas prices are up this morning with a heatwave forecast for parts of the continent later this year.

Benchmark prices rose as much as 7.3pc to the highest level in almost two weeks.

Gas posted its biggest monthly increase in a year in June, with outages in Norway and hot weather in parts of the continent outweighing fuller-than-normal inventories.

It's another reminder that the energy crisis is far from over after the IEA warned families should prepare for another big jump in bills this winter.

Benchmark Dutch gas prices rose 4.3pc this morning, while the UK equivalent was up 5.3pc.

FTSE risers and fallers

The FTSE 100 is in the green this morning as higher metal prices helped to boost mining stocks.

The blue-chip index was up 0.2pc in early trading, while the domestically-focused FTSE 250 gained 0.3pc.

Industrial miners gained 1.3pc as prices of base metals rose, driven by improved sentiment about China's economy.

China-exposed banks HSBC and Standard Chartered rose 0.5pc and 1.2pc respectively, while insurer Prudential was up 0.9pc as hopes of more policy support grew after another weak data point and commentary from Chinese officials.

AstraZeneca was among the biggest fallers, losing 4pc despite positive test results for its cancer drug.

IG Group boss steps down for medical leave

The boss of online trading firm IG Group is temporarily stepping down to take medical leave.

June Felix, who took over as chief executive in 2018, told shareholders this morning that she will be away for a ""short period"".

Chief financial officer Charlie Rozes will become acting chief executive and take over Ms Felix's day-to-day responsibilities at the FTSE 250 company.

He will also continue in his current role to provide continuity and so the firm can operate its current strategy.

Oil prices steady after record losing run

Oil was little changed this morning with traders focus on demand challenges and a complex supply outlook heading into the second half of the year.

Brent crude held above $75 a barrel after capping off a run of four quarterly losses last week - the worst run for the global benchmark for more than three decades.

So far this year, prices have dropped around 12pc amid a faltering Chinese recovery, fears of a recession in the US and robust supplies from Russia and Iran.

Tesco names Gerry Murphy as new chairman

Tesco has confirmed Gerry Murphy as its new chairman to replace John Allan, who has stepped down amid allegations of misconduct.

The supermarket giant said Mr Murphy, who will take up the role at the beginning of September, has extensive experience in both executive and non-executive roles.

He is currently chairman of Burberry Group and Tate & Lyle, though he will step down from the latter role. He previously served as chief executive of B&Q owner Kingfisher.

Byron Grote, Tesco's interim chairman, said:

The Board conducted an extensive search for a new chair and we are delighted that Gerry is joining the board and taking on the chair role. 

He was the unanimous choice of the board and will bring to our board a record of strong and effective boardroom leadership and a deep understanding of retail and consumer-focused businesses and corporate governance.

FTSE 100 opens higher

The FTSE 100 has started the week - and the second half of the year - on the front foot this morning.

The blue-chip index opened a touch higher at 7,535 points.

New AstraZeneca cancer drug shows potential

A cancer medication made by AstraZeneca showed a significant improvement on standard chemotherapy following a high-level study.

The British pharmaceutical giant said the drug helped patients with the most common form of lung cancer live longer without worsening compared to standard chemotherapy.

AstraZeneca didn't say how much longer patients lived overall and the trial is continuing because the data isn't fully mature yet. 

But the results are a positive sign for AstraZeneca, which paid as much as $6bn for the right to develop the medicine with Daiichi Sankyo as part of a bet to revive growth a decade ago by building a pipeline of oncology drugs.

Australian firm sues Twitter for not paying bills

An Australian project management firm has filed a lawsuit against Twitter seeking payments of around AU$1m (£524,000) over alleged non-payment of bills.

Sydney-based Facilitate Corporation filed the suit in a US court claiming breach of contract over the social media company's failure to pay its invoices for work done in four countries.

It is the latest lawsuit alleging non-payment of bills and rent by Twitter since Elon Musk bought the platform for $44bn last year.

Facilitate said that in 2022 and into early 2023, it installed sensors in Twitter's offices in London and Dublin, completed an office fit-out in Singapore, and cleared an office in Sydney.

For those works, Twitter owed the company about £203,000, $546,600 and A$61,300 respectively.

Apple forced to cut Vision Pro production targets

Apple has been forced to cut production targets for its upcoming mixed reality headset in a major setback to the tech giant's push into AI.

Apple unveiled the $3,500 Vision Pro earlier this month but said it would not go on sale until early next year.

But the company has now been forced to scale back its production targets while plans for a more affordable model have been pushed back, the Financial Times reports.

According to the report, Apple and Chinese manufacturer Luxshare are preparing to make fewer than 400,000 headsets next year, well below internal targets of 1m sales in the first 12 months.

The setback comes after Apple's valuation surged above $3 trillion at the end of last week - the only company to ever reach that milestone.

Shahzada Dawood: One of Pakistan's richest men trapped on board with 19-year-old son

The pair who live in Surrey are among the five people aboard the missing submersible

Shahzada Dawood, who is on board the missing Titanic submersible alongside his 19-year-old son, Suleman, is one of Pakistan's wealthiest businessmen.

Mr Dawood, who is a global board member for the charity The Prince's Trust, was educated in both the US and Britain. He was born in Pakistan and moved to the UK to study law at the University of Buckingham. He then went on to study a Master's in textile marketing in 2000 at Philadelphia University.

He currently lives near Surbiton with his son, wife Christine and daughter Alina, and he serves as vice chairman of Engro Corporation, a Karachi-based energy conglomerate that is one of the largest in Pakistan. Both he and his son are British citizens.

Will Straw, chief executive of The Prince's Trust said: ""Prince's Trust International has a longstanding relationship with Shahzada Dawood and his family. We are shocked by this awful news, praying for a rescue and sending our thoughts to his family during this deeply challenging time.""

During the pandemic, Mr Dawood's father, Hussain Dawood, who is also one of Pakistan's wealthiest men, issued the equivalent of nearly £3 million to contribute to the fight against Covid-19.

In 2020, Shahzada Dawood also represented Engro and the Dawood Hercules Corporation - a chemical company founded by his grandfather, Ahmed Dawood, where he is also vice chairman - at the United Nations, speaking about the role of technology in agriculture.

Mr Dawood and his German-born wife, Christine, are keen nature and animal lovers, and photographs on social media show the couple enjoying walking holidays in Scotland.

In 2020, Mr Dawood joined the board of the California-based Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute.

His son, Suleman, is a keen reader of science fiction and volleyball player, according to a statement released by the Dawood family. The 19 year-old also enjoys solving Rubix cubes, it said.

International school

The Dawood children attended the American ACS International School Cobham and the school has released a statement expressing concern over their former student's disappearance.

A neighbour described the family as the ""nicest"" people, adding that Christine Dawood, who works as a life coach, is passionate about gardening.

Ellen Maby, 43, told The Telegraph that she had messaged the family this morning but had had no response. She described them as a lovely family and said that wife Christine ""is very into her gardening, it puts ours to shame"", adding that the family are ""transient"" and often travelling away from home.

""They're the nicest, nicest neighbours to have, they are really sweet and kind,"" she told The Telegraph.

""She has the most amazing garden - she's just the nicest person. When my mum was really ill last year she was sending flowers, she always said come round whenever you want,"" she said. ""Christine came to my 40th. They are so nice.""

On social media, a cousin T U Darwood said: ""Please pray for my cousin Shahzada and his son Sulaiman - 70 hours of oxygen left in the submarine and they are still trying to locate the vessel which went missing.""

The Engro corporation has released a statement of prayer for the ""swift and safe return"" of both Shahzada and his son.

The perfect two-week holiday in Peru

The launch of a new direct flight between London and Lima by Latam, South America's largest carrier, significantly reduces ­travelling time to one of the world's most captivating destinations. Board the 10.30pm departure at Heathrow and you'll touch down in the Peruvian ­capital at 6.30 the following morning, perfect for a lazy first day enjoying art museums and architecture in the smart residential suburbs of ­Miraflores and Barranco.

Lima was the capital of Spain's American empire and Peru, formerly the heartland of the Inca, was its power base. Today, the country is the region's most enthralling combination of old and new, indigenous and European, human and natural, cultural highlights and geographical wonders.

The talking point for first-time visitors is still Machu Picchu, and the surrounding Sacred Valley and Cuzco come in as close seconds. Another top-class experience for many tourists is Lima's gastronomy. Firmly established as one of the globe's most compelling fusion cuisines, Peruvian food takes ideas and ingredients from the Andes, Amazon and Pacific coast, as well as from Spanish traditions, and Chinese and Japanese immigrants. 

What is arguably over-marketed in Peru is far less than what is undersold. The country's Amazon region spans the country and is accessible at three different entry points: Iquitos is the classic port city, ideal for a Fitzcarraldo-style river voyage; Tambopata's teeming wildlife is best seen on day trips from riverside lodges; Chachapoyas is the least-explored region, and boasts the dramatic 6th-century citadel of KuÃ©lap.

This itinerary highlights the best way to enjoy some of the classic sites on a reasonable budget; but Peru rewards multiple trips and has lots of great mid-price accommodation. Whatever you opt for, prepare to be surprised; South America's complex history and societies seem to be distilled in Peru, and some of the world's friendliest folk will be on hand to show it off. Get in a round of pisco sours and you'll soon tap into your own spirit of discovery.

The imperial Spanish capital

Check in at the Hotel B, a luxurious boutique property set in a former aristos' mansion on a lovely boulevard in the Barranco neighbourhood (hotelb.pe).

Gently work off your jetlag with a stroll around the district. Barranco and neighbouring Miraflores are well-to-do residential neighbourhoods, though the former is slightly more bohemian. There are plenty of cafÃ©s and bars, including vegan and organic snack places offering healthy brunches. Quinoa is the best-known superfood; but make sure you try amaranth too, called kiwicha in native Quechua.

Within walking distance is the MAC contemporary art museum, showcasing 20th and 21st-century Peruvian and international artists. Also nearby is the Museo Pedro de Osma, an outstanding collection of antique furniture, silverwork and art from colonial and later periods inside a beautiful beaux-arts mansion; the gardens are also exquisite.

Eat at the hotel this evening; the Hotel B has dining in the bar, restaurant, patio and rooftop eatery, serving everything from pizzas to New Peruvian fare made using indigenous foodstuffs such as ancestral purple corn and Amazonian camu camu berry.

Ancient artefacts and new cuisines

Walk or take a cab to the Huaca Pucllana, a huge adobe and clay pyramid that was the ceremonial and political base of the Lima Culture, which developed along the coast between the 3rd and 8th centuries. The site was heavily looted, but in 2010 four Wari mummies were found, indicating the presence of later indigenous communities in the same locality. It has a great on-site restaurant, serving specialities including chupe de camarones (shrimp soup).

Next, visit the Museo Larco, a private museum specialising in pre-Columbian artefacts, including an important collection of erotic art.

For dinner, get yourself a booking at Central, a 15-minute walk from your hotel, where husband and wife chefs Virgilio MartÃ­nez and PÃ­a LeÃ³n and their talented team turn out experimental tasting menus. Reserve well in advance and, if you're not able to, talk to the concierge for last-minute cancellations. As a back-up, taverna-style Isolina, famous for its comfort food, is equally close to Hotel B and a lively alternative. 

Colonial HQ

Hop in a cab or your guide's vehicle for the 20-30-minute drive to the downtown area. Like most historic centres in South America, Lima's is an enthralling mess of grand churches, crumbling mansions, pockets of renovation and snarling jams of unfiltered traffic. But it is a Unesco-listed area, and it's well worth spending an hour walking without a plan, noting the famous box balconies, ornate faÃ§ades, atmospheric hallways and Spanish-style patios. 

Step inside the cathedral, the Hotel Maury (where it's claimed the pisco sour was invented) and the Casa de Aliaga, allegedly the oldest house in the city - sited on a plot of land given by Francisco Pizarro to JerÃ³nimo de Aliaga, and still occupied by the same family 17 generations on. Entrance is $30 (£25), exclusively with a guide.

Dine at Maido in Miraflores this evening. This superb Peruvian Nikkei restaurant, helmed by Mitsuharu Tsumura, is marine-focused, featuring dishes such as octopus in olives, deep-fried rockfish and crab with tapioca.

Navel of the world

Check in early for the 70-minute morning flight to Cuzco. It's a short taxi from the airport into the Inca's ""navel of the world"" - one of the most beguiling cities in South America.

Stay at Inkaterra La Casona, a converted colonial-era mansion in the San Blas district (inkaterra.com). As you're now at more than 11,000ft (3,353m) above sea level, let your body acclimatise and drink lots of water. 

The hotel is beside the Museum of Colonial Art; it's less than five minutes walk to the cathedral and the Plaza de Armas, site of three of the city's most important churches. It's worth employing a guide to help you explore the Inca temple known as the Coricancha, upon which the church of Santo Domingo was constructed, and to navigate the Inca walls and main churches. 

The same applies to the site of Sacsayhuaman, two miles north of Cuzco and, in its way, as impressive as Machu Picchu. Massive stones, some over 30ft tall, were used to build walled terraces, ritual spaces and fortifications. 

Have an evening meal at Chicha, a fusion restaurant owned by GastÃ³n Acurio, arguably Peru's most lauded chef. 

Into the Sacred Valley of the Inca

The Valley of the RÃ­o Urubamba, a headwater of the Amazon, is known as the Sacred Valley along the section linking Machu Picchu to Pisac. While the Inca religion once prospered here, the name is really a tourist-board moniker. 

Check in at Sol y Luna in the town of Urubamba (hotelsolyluna.com), a Relais & Chateaux resort is set in lush gardens, with two excellent restaurants, a large spa, pool and stables. 

Today's a good day to see the impressive mountainside archaeological site of Pisac, built by the Inca emperor Pachacuti some time after 1440. 

Marvels of Machu Picchu

Book a takeaway breakfast and catch the early morning PeruRail Vistadome train (6.50am) from Urubamba station. The train makes a short stop at Ollantaytambo before arriving at Machu Picchu Pueblo station in the town of Aguas Calientes at 9.25am.

Take the shuttle bus up to Machu Picchu and allow three hours for a tour of the main structures: the central plaza, Inti Watana (hitching post of the sun), Inti Punku (sun gate), the house of the High Priest, hut of the Caretaker of the Funerary Rock, Inca Drawbridge and the terraces, with their friendly llamas.

Machu Picchu has been surveyed, studied and dug up more than any other Inca site, yet it remains mysterious. The saddle in the mountain where it sits was evidently selected because it was close to the gods and also very defensible. Its functions were partly residential and partly religious. But we are still guessing about its cosmic positioning and its academic importance to the Incas. This, and the swirling clouds, flashes of sun on ancient stone, and sheer audacity of the construction, make it a genuine world wonder.

Overnight in the five-star Belmond Sanctuary Lodge, the only hotel that abuts the ruins (belmond.com).

Inca landmarks

If you need one last look around Machu Picchu, this itinerary allows for it. Alternatively, go down to Aguas Calientes to see the local museum (Museo de Sitio Manuel ChÃ¡vez BallÃ³n). It'll provide some useful context for three more Inca-themed stops this morning. Take a late-morning train to Ollantaytambo, and gawp at the Inca temple and fortress. The ruins are considered the best preserved examples of city planning.

The next stop is Maras, a salt mine with a patchwork of hundreds of salt pans that look rather surreal in the mountainous setting; and finally, go to Moray, an agricultural complex that features staggered, circular terraces probably used by agri-scientists of the time to study the effects of climate and terrain. Enjoy lunch at Moray's on-site gourmet restaurant Mil, with dishes inspired by eight ecosystems. 

On the drive down to Cuzco, break the journey at Chinchero, an Andean village with Inca ruins, colonial church and great views of the mountains.

Check in to the Belmond Monasterio, which was a seminary in the 16th century (belmond.com). The arcades are hung with Cuzco school oil paintings and the patios are as romantic as any Venice piazza. If you fancy a walk, there are plenty of dining options in the city. Cicciolina is a beautiful restaurant with a tapas menu that artfully mixes Peruvian ingredients with Italian staples and touches of Asia.

High-plain express train

Drive to Cuzco's Wanchaq railway station for the Belmond Andean Explorer to Puno on Lake Titicaca. The Pullman-style train has stylish cabins in carefully restored carriages, and elegant dining cars. The 12-hour journey crosses the Altiplano, the high-altitude plain that stretches from here to the Atacama desert and northern Argentina. It's flat, vast and barren-looking, but never boring. Since pre-Inca times, indigenous farmers have successfully developed agriculture on the plain and there are villages dotted in the most remote corners. The journey takes in the impressive La Raya mountain range, arriving late in Puno, where you spend the night on board. 

Lakeside luxury

After breakfast, transfer to Titilaka, a luxurious resort just half an hour from Puno at a much quieter lakeside location (titilaka.pe). After check in, cross the lake on a private excursion to see the Uros floating islands, constructed using junco reeds, and the island of Taquile - famed for its textile weavers. 

The hotel restaurant, overseen by Peruvian chef MarÃ­a FÃ© GarcÃ­a, is the best on the lake. Try the trout dishes - the fish is farmed on Titicaca, or the delicious anticuchos (kebabs). 

Amazon river cruise

Transfer to Juliaca airport for the flight to Lima and on to Iquitos, a steamily hot tropical city, not connected by road to the rest of Peru. 

Get a beer or a fruit juice on the Plaza de Armas, the main square. Check out the Casa de Fierro (Iron House) on the south-east corner, designed by Gustave Eiffel, prefabricated in Belgium and shipped here on the river you're about to explore. 

The four-night trip to the Pacaya Samiria national reserve in northern Peru has to be one of the most memorable river cruises on the planet. The Delfin III has space for just 44 guests, so it's always quiet enough on deck to soak up the jungle views (delfinamazoncruises.com). The embarkation port, Nauta, is only 60 miles south of Iquitos, but once the ship pulls away you're plunged into the magical, mysterious world of the upper Amazon. The mouth, at BelÃ©m in Brazil, is 1,864 miles away, 18 days' voyaging by modern ship, though it took the conquistador Francisco de Orellana six months to cover the distance in a brigantine.

Your ship has beautifully appointed suites with floor-to-ceiling windows and the onboard cuisine is world class. But the reason you have come all this way is to see the MaraÃ±on and Ucayali rivers that feed the Amazon. A canopy walk on day one and a trail walk the following day allow you to see the forest up close, and there are optional excursions including kayaking in creeks, swimming with pink river dolphins, fishing for piranhas at sunset, birdwatching and visits to local communities and to a river mammal rehab centre.

The Pacaya Samiria national reserve is, at five million acres, Peru's second largest and the world's largest protected flooded forest. It's a biodiversity hotspot, with large numbers of fish, reptiles, amphibians, birds and mammals. Signature species include the Amazonian manatee, red-faced spider monkey, South American tapir, puma and jaguar, giant otter, coati and capybara. Standout birds, of the 449 recorded, include the blue-and-yellow macaw, hoatzin, collared hawk, chestnut-eared aracari, cocoi heron, jabiru stork and horned screamer.

Homeward bound

Fly home via Lima and London.

When to go

Lima is only 12 degrees south of the equator. It's never cold, though the coastal fog (called garÃºa) can make it cool and murky. The Amazon region is always balmy. Generally, the austral winter (May-September) is the driest season and a great time to visit Cuzco and Machu Picchu. The summer (December-March) is warmer but heavy showers are likely. The Amazon's high-water season is from November to May and the level drops from June to October. Both have advantages. The higher flood-level is picturesque inside the forest edges, but more species are usually observable when the level falls and there is competition for water.

European heatwave pushes cold weather UK's way

Same weather system sending temperatures soaring creating colder conditions and gusty winds in Britain, says Met Office

The extreme heatwave in Europe is causing colder temperatures and stormy weather in the UK, the Met Office has said.

Severe weather warnings were issued over high winds across Wales and south west England for Friday, and strong gusts across southern, central and eastern England on Saturday.

Meanwhile, temperatures across Europe have risen above 40C, causing the death of a man in Italy and warnings of wildfires and threats to agriculture.

However, the same weather system is creating colder temperatures and gusty winds in the UK, according to the Met Office.

The heatwave, named Cerebus, has been triggered by a southern shift of the jet stream that has pushed high pressure across Europe. As a result, low pressure systems have been directed towards the UK.

The weekend is expected to bring blustery conditions, showers and a risk of some thunder, continuing into next week.

New research has found that the UK will see a large increase in days with uncomfortably hot temperatures if the world passes internationally agreed thresholds of global warming.

A 2C rise in global temperatures will lead to Britain having one of the biggest increases in uncomfortably hot days, defined as those needing air conditioning or extra ventilation, anywhere in the world, according to researchers at Oxford University.

Global warming is expected to surpass 1.5C, a globally agreed target limit, possibly as early as 2030. It will continue to 2C, hitting 2.7C by 2100, based on current emissions and net zero plans.

Uncomfortably hot days have an average temperature across 24 hours of 18C, which could include peaks of much higher temperatures in the day with lower temperatures at night. 

Researchers also took into heat exposure account, meaning countries that are poorly prepared for hot weather will be worse hit.

Only Norway and Switzerland will have a similar spike in the percentage of very hot days between 1.5C and 2C of warming, and all three countries are ""dangerously unprepared"" to cope, the study's authors said.

Africa will have the highest increase of uncomfortably hot days in absolute terms, but researchers noticed a surprising relative increase in countries in Europe and the northern hemisphere.

""In the northern hemisphere and Europe, buildings are made to keep heat in, so we are at risk when temperatures rise,"" Nicole Miranda, lead author of the research, said.

The UK currently reaches the threshold around 36 times a year, but that will increase to 69 at 1.5C of warming, and 89 at 2C, researchers said.

""Right now, for example, sustainable cooling barely has a mention in the UK's net zero strategy,"" said Dr Radhika Khosla, a co-author of the study.

""Without adequate interventions to promote sustainable cooling we are likely to see a sharp increase in the use of energy guzzling systems like air conditioning, which could further increase emissions and lock us into a vicious cycle of burning fossil fuels to make us feel cooler while making the world outside hotter.""

Last month the UK was forced to switch on backup coal power generation as a heatwave prompted a spike in air conditioning.

Is this how the apocalypse will look?

Three new ""˜cli-fi' novels imagine islands at the end of the world - and life there proves a heady blend of terrifying and hopeful

It's unsurprising that islands have become a central feature of ""climate fiction"" - a speculative, often dystopian genre grounded in real-life events and ominous projections. Adverse weather conditions and habitat loss are wreaking havoc on isolated ecosystems around the world. Take Tuvalu announcing its plans to become the world's first ""digital nation"" - replicating itself in the metaverse - or the other 52 small islands that, according to the UN, are threatened by at least a metre of sea-level rise by 2050.

Mother Sea (â˜…â˜…â˜… Fairlight), by Lorraine Wilson, presents one such endangered land. Out in the Indian Ocean, an island community is on the verge of extinction: not just literally, with mounting infertility and decimated crops, but metaphorically, with climatologists, researchers and doctors arriving from elsewhere to unsettle ancient theologies. 

We follow Sisi de Mathilde, an islander who spends her days monitoring soil samples and mourning several losses: her first true love; her recently deceased husband; and her own agency, given that she's now pregnant and has another body to care for. Sisi is torn between indigenous and Western knowledge-systems, between personal desires and communal responsibilities. She's also held accountable for her liaisons with the outsiders, for forgetting the ""old ways"" and breaking the ""fadys"" - or sacred rules - that bind all beings, damaging ""Brother Island"" and enraging ""Mother Sea"".

Wilson's prose moves at a relaxed pace - sticky, sweet and abundant - despite rapidly escalating divisions in the community, and the mounting threats from disease, sterility and insidious prospectors. The steady flow is matched by long, dramatic confrontations and reconciliations set against thrashing oceans, while drawn-out metaphors - ""without a future, what was a nation, an island, a village, a person, if not only a collection of endings?"" - move us towards a climax that's only quietly gratifying.

By contrast, Justin Cronin's The Ferryman (â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… Orion) charts the lives of two groups: the achingly affluent citizens of the island Prospera, who have access to regeneration technologies, and the exploited service staff from the adjoining island Annex, who are still privy to sickness, birth, death and squalid living-quarters. We're introduced to Proctor Bennett as he carries out his daily managerial role, escorting Prosperan residents to Nursery island for their next ""iteration"": memories wiped, bodies restored to adolescence.

After 12 years as a tragic widower, Proctor's own father faces reiteration - but, close to the ferry, panic sets in, and he warns Proctor that he is not himself, uttering the clue ""Orianos"", before being silenced by watchmen. What follows is an interstellar epic, revealing worlds within worlds, a tesseract of plot twists stretching from balmy shores and ordered districts to the depths of deep space. There are conspiracies and warring classes, while reflective surfaces and celestial images shine from the page, pointing us none-too-discreetly to clues in the sky (""glass exploding around us into a thousand twinkling chips""). References to Descartes, Picasso and Plato are peppered into quippy remarks and investigative conversations.

All this to say that The Ferryman is taut, sometimes uncomfortably so. No word - and there are many in Cronin's sprawling volume - is placed lightly, and every beat gestures to a grand design, right down to the character names and their glaring etymologies: Proctor, from the Latin for ""steward""; his wife, for reasons that will become apparent, Elise, or ""God's promise"". This could, of course, be part of the gambit: a world where the dualisms are a little too pronounced; the archetypes a little too obvious; the creation eerily air-tight.

Whether Violent or Natural by Natasha Calder (â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… Bloomsbury) is no less neatly packaged, but much more incisive. In this intelligent debut, we follow the twenty-something Kit and her forty-something protector, Crevan, as they roam free on a nameless island, living within the keep of a well-stocked castle, prepped years before by survivalists in an age of antibiotic resistance. 

The plot is understated - the mysterious benefactors are revealed to be none other than Kit's late parents, biomedical experts who tried to save the world from a deadly virus - but clearly well-researched, dabbling in the politics of conservation. Throughout, the prose is intoxicating - dark, heady, lyrical - and Kit's narration wonderfully facetious as she and Crevan slide between states of symbiosis and parasitism: ""I would crawl into his ear if I could, from my way through into the soft parts of his brain, take a look around, do what I can to banish the ill and enliven the lovely.""

All three of these novels work on their own terms, sharing many a familiar and uncanny ""cli-fi"" trope. But Whether Violent or Natural is the most convincing, if not refreshing. Unforgiving, untameable and undergoing a slow process of rewilding, Calder's island isn't merely a remote utopia, but a place of complex biotic interactions. The ending, too, fits the narrative of a traumatised world, an ecosystem in repair. As a new protector arrives on the island, the ecological niche is filled, and balance is restored - for better, or for worse.

Margaret Runcie, horsewoman who produced a long succession of champion ponies - obituary

As well as being a renowned breeder famed for her work ethic, she was a highly respected judge

Margaret Runcie, who has died aged 97, was an influential figure in the equestrian world, as a successful breeder of top-class Highland and Welsh Mountain ponies, and as a respected judge; the Rosslyn Stud near Edinburgh, which she founded in 1958, produced scores of champion riding ponies over the next four decades.

She won every major honour, including a record 18 championships at her ""local"" Royal Highland Show, and she campaigned vigorously to raise standards in breeding, pony welfare and show ring organisation.

Margaret Mary Power was born on October 19 1925 into a comfortable middle-class home at Hatfield, Hertfordshire, the second of five outdoorsy children. Her father Frank was a prosperous grain merchant and the family had a nanny, nursery maid and a trap, pulled by a donkey called Buddy.

Aged three, Margaret, a doll-like child so tiny she was nicknamed Midge, began riding Buddy, as a Shetland would have been too wide. After a crashing fall from the donkey, Margaret was given riding lessons at her mother's insistence and joined the local Enfield Chace Pony Club, where she later competed in showing, show jumping and cross-country events.

There, Margaret met the inspirational instructor Joan Middleton, universally known as ""Miss Midd"". Margaret was deeply influenced by Miss Midd's strict but fair attitude to equine management and training, and later showed the same dedication in her own career.

""We were a competitive little lot, but in the right way,"" she recalled, ""as Miss Midd would never stand for any bad sportsmanship.""

A bright, athletic girl, Margaret boarded at Effingham House in Bexhill, Sussex, a girls' private school with just 52 pupils. The genteel social accomplishments were considered at least as important as academic pursuits, and with 13 tennis courts, every girl could play tennis at once.

The school was evacuated to mid-Wales at the outbreak of war and Margaret Runcie left in 1941, having passed her School Certificate. With the male Enfield Chace hunt servants mostly away on active service, she and Miss Midd kept the Hunt going, whipping in and exercising the hounds every morning.

In 1943 Margaret Runcie joined the WRENS and trained as a radio and radar mechanic in Warrington and London, where she would watch planes flying at night along the Thames past Battersea Power Station, lit up by anti-aircraft searchlights.

In June 1944 she was posted as a radio mechanic to HMS Jackdaw, the Fleet Air Arm base at Crail, Fife, on the far eastern tip of Scotland, where she changed and recharged the batteries of planes returning from sorties across the North Sea and repaired broken valve radios.

The work involved riding a wobbly bike in pitch darkness across the airfield clutching a heavy battery, with leaking acid dripping down her uniform. She was assigned first to 786 Squadron, which flew Barracuda torpedo bombers, then to 785 Squadron, which used Avenger bombers.

After being demobbed in 1946 she qualified as an aviation mechanic but was firmly told these jobs were reserved for ex-servicemen. Eager for an outdoor career, she studied Dairy Animal Science at Reading University, also coxing the women's rowing eight and playing first string at squash. She then joined the National Agricultural Advisory Service in Leicestershire as a milk tester, mainly in the Belvoir Valley, where she resumed her hunting and showing activities.

In 1953 she won a scholarship to take a Masters at Cornell University in the US and became one of the first women to study agriculture there. Her research on modern milk transportation paid off: within a decade 90 per cent of farms in the UK and US had switched from using small, old-fashioned churns, with milk often going off in the sun, to having their milk collected by chilled bulk tankers.

During her studies she met the Scots agriculturalist Ken Runcie and the couple married in 1956, settling at Langhill, a research farm at Roslin, near Edinburgh, which Ken managed for Edinburgh University.

In 1958, pregnant with her first son, Margaret Runcie switched from riding in horse classes to breeding and showing ponies. She bought Elizabeth Arden, a favourite riding pony from England, over the phone, convinced that her conformation and temperament would make her an ideal foundation mare for the fledgling Rosslyn Stud.

This proved an inspired purchase: the pony won the Supreme Championship at the 1960 Royal Highland Show, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh presenting the trophy.

Margaret Runcie became a regular at pony auctions in Hay-on-Wye and in mid-Wales, buying newly weaned foals off the Welsh hills. She relished jousting with the rugged Welsh-speaking hill farmers to secure a promising prospect. If a handsome youngster had already been snapped up, the traditional phrase ""Will you take profit?"" usually sealed the deal. She invariably arrived home in the small hours with a horsebox full of hairy Welsh foals to join the herd in a nearby glen for the next two years.

As the successes multiplied, the stud moved to Garvald Grange, a 35-acre farm east of Edinburgh in 1967. Margaret Runcie was renowned for her ability to analyse the strengths of her stock, breeding in improvements using specific stallions. She demanded clean lines, fine limbs, a good shoulder and gentle temperament befitting a child's pony.

Two of Elizabeth Arden's top progeny, Rosslyn Personality and Rosslyn Sweet Talk, bred excellent foals every spring until their late 20s. Margaret Runcie carefully trained nearly all her youngstock at home, to be sold for riding and showing.

Arguably the best pony she ever bred, the bay mare Rosslyn Sweet Repose, was never beaten in a show class. She won consecutive Highland Championships from 1994 to 1997, taking the coveted Queen's Cup in 1996 and winning the Supreme In-Hand Championship at the Horse of the Year Show in 2001.

Famed for her work ethic, thrift and attention to detail, Margaret Runcie had no time for ""fashionable fripperies"", making her ponies' rugs from old satin curtains and army blankets with a jute rug on top. She also refused to replace her ancient, slow lorry with something smarter, insisting: ""It's not the lorry that matters but what comes out of it.""

With her unerring eye for horseflesh and sense of fair play she became a popular judge, and thanks to her slight stature she could ride the ponies in native breed classes. In 1961 she and two friends set up the Scottish Committee of the National Pony Society (NPS). Her innovations included an annual stallion parade to encourage owners to use better-quality animals and a Scotland-wide dried milk and colostrum scheme for orphan foals.

Having served as president of the NPS during its centenary year, 1993, and for an unprecedented second term, she was awarded its Medal of Honour. She also received the Royal Highland Agricultural Society's Sir William Young Award for her contribution to Scottish livestock breeding, the first equestrian personality and first woman so honoured.

In 1997 she retired from showing but remained closely involved with the breeding world well into her 90s, as a judge and adviser valued for her generosity and depth of experience.

Margaret Runcie's husband, who was appointed OBE for services to agriculture, died in 2011. She is survived by her two sons.

Margaret Runcie, born October 19 1925, died December 23 2022

Pennies off traditional Christmas pudding as ""˜exotic' desserts turn up heat

Supermarkets cut cost of festive dish as shoppers turn to 'weird and wonderful' sweets such as chocolate bombs and caramel cakes

Fans of Christmas pudding are likely to be the only winners of the festive food shop this year, as supermarkets cut the price of the staple dish to help it compete with more ""exotic"" yuletide desserts.

Christmas pudding, a combination of dried fruit and suet matured over many months and traditionally served with flaming brandy, has fallen out of favour in recent years as customers turn to ""weird and wonderful"" sweets such as gingerbread trifles and alternative Christmas cakes.

But despite soaring food prices across the board, Christmas pudding is an average 1 per cent cheaper than last year as retailers fight to keep it on the dinner table.

Clare Bailey, a food expert from Retail Champion, said: ""Traditional Christmas pudding is under pressure from exotic, weird and wonderful things like chocolate bombs and profiterole snowman towers... It's fallen out of favour.""

Rival festive desserts include gingerbread and berry trifle and mandarin pandoro trifle, which are both available at Aldi, Waitrose's Deer-licious Sticky Toffee Pudding, and Marks and Spencer's offering of Christmas caramel cake.

She added: ""Poor old Christmas pudding is fighting for its position and retailers may be investing in keeping the price low, even if they make less money on it in order to keep it on shelves because traditionalists would expect it there.""

Supermarkets are trying to stem the declining appetite for Christmas pudding by keeping a lid on its price, even if it eats into their profit margins, she said.

The news will be welcome to actor Richard E Grant, a self-confessed ""Christmasaholic"" who previously revealed that he eats at least one festive pudding a month.

The long shelf-life of its ingredients - a pudding can keep for up to a year - means that existing supermarket stock was likely to have been manufactured and purchased before food prices soared. Food inflation is currently at 10.1 per cent.

""If retailers had purchased these items in advance, they could maintain the historical price,"" Ms Bailey said. ""And the whole point is that they last for ages and their sell-by date could be years away so they have a long shelf life.""

Ms Bailey said if they were manufactured recently the costs for doing so would have surged so the retailers may be trying to stimulate demand by keeping prices low.

It comes as Good Housekeeping revealed the cost of Christmas dinner has increased 50 per cent in the past decade.

The magazine's annual Cost of Christmas Dinner Survey revealed that feeding eight people will cost £33, 13 per cent more than last year. The rise is almost triple the rate of inflation, which currently stands at 4.7 per cent.

Using the cheapest possible prices for a basket of 11 Christmas dinner items, covering everything from turkey to mince pies, the festive food survey found that it will cost £33.08 to feed eight people, with the price per head working out at £4.14. 

The equivalent in 2022 would have cost £29.36 (£3.67 per head). The survey included prices from Aldi, Morrisons, Iceland, ASDA, M&S, Co-op, Sainsbury's and Tesco.

Vegetables cost 158 per cent more than last year, the largest increase across all food products, owing to higher production costs and poor weather affecting crops.

While Christmas pudding may be cheaper this year, the cost of Christmas cake is up by 10 per cent and mince pies 15 per cent, though the average price of brandy butter and cranberry sauce has remained the same.

Emilie Martin, Good Housekeeping consumer affairs director, said: ""There's some comfort in the fact that the items in our basket that typically cost the most - turkey, Christmas cake and Christmas pudding - have seen more modest price increases this Christmas or, in the case of Christmas pudding, are actually a few pennies cheaper this year.""

Richard Caines, principal analyst of UK food and drink research at Mintel, said: ""The increase in the price of a Christmas dinner reflects on-going high food inflation in 2023, which still stood at 10 per cent in October.

""Despite the rising cost of Christmas dinner, shoppers are still likely to splash out, especially if they have guests visiting. 

""Our research shows seven in 10 hosts say that at-home social gatherings encourage them to buy more premium food and drink than they usually do, so while people may be cutting back the rest of the year they are far less likely to do so for their Christmas dinner.""

How a trip to India taught me mums are always right

When Hazel Plush and her parents finally toured the Subcontinent together, a maternal focus on the importance of home comforts saved the day

""Hazel, avert your eyes,"" muttered Dad, fixing his own gaze firmly on the floor. All around us, etched into the temple's stone walls, scenes from the Kama Sutra loomed large: mini figurines with mighty appendages, buxom concubines spread-eagled in stone. Phalluses as far as the eye could see. ""I wonder what's in the gift shop,"" I joked weakly, our step quickening as we caught sight of Mum - she, too, looking rather red-faced. Konark Sun Temple: a majestic 13th-century Hindu shrine, one of India's greatest Unesco-listed treasures""¦ and an X-rated sex sanctum, too. Who knew?

This was never going to be a normal family holiday. For starters, it was our first far-flung jaunt since the seaside trips of my childhood. While I have made a career out of travelling the world, my parents have been largely content to stick to Spain - with one exception. They hankered for India, but it was always too big, too tricky and too expensive to justify.

Last year, however, fate served a deafening call to take the damn trip. As my dad braved two open-heart operations, India became a talisman: if we could get through the worry, the pain, then we would go there together. Treat ourselves. Even booking the tour was a triumph.

""I'm taking a travel kettle,"" Mum had announced at home. ""And tea, mugs, powdered milk""‰""¦"" I scoffed. A kettle? ""In case we don't have one in the hotels,"" she explained. ""I'll pack foot cream, biscuits, Dettol wipes, Carex soap""¦"" I rolled my eyes, already reverting to teenage truculence. Not a good start. But really, an adventure holiday is no place for foot cream.

Our destination was the tribal heartlands of Odisha (formerly Orissa), an unfrequented area on India's north-east coast. Until a few years ago, much of the state was gripped by insurgents and off-limits to visitors; its mountains, home to some of the country's oldest indigenous tribes, were cut off from the world. But now, Odisha is inching open to visitors. ""I want to see authentic India,"" Dad had said, flicking through the itinerary with gusto. ""Not some tourist honeypot. I want to see real people, real life.""

""Is this real enough for you?"" I teased as we were swept up by the jostling, jubilant pilgrims at Puri's Jagannath Temple - dodging sauntering bullocks, screeching motorbikes, and huge vats of bubbling dhal sold by vendors. ""No, not yet!"" he shouted above the din, grinning. It was a joke we carried with us, through the markets and tribal mela (festival) of Bhubaneswar; the deafening Hare Krishna drumming parade that enveloped us in Dhauli; and the village wedding party that stopped our tour bus and insisted we get out and dance.

Mum and I, meanwhile, took our mother-daughter shopping trips on tour - strolling arm-in-arm through markets, snapping up sarees and trinkets. We watched as artisans spun silk threads into feather-light scarves, and met basket-weavers, lantern-makers and metalworkers - our suitcases straining as we spent our way south.

Our excellent guide, Satish Dhar, smoothed the way at every turn: translator, fixer, historian and master storyteller, his glossy moustache dancing as he spoke. ""I respect you travelling together,"" Satish said one evening; ""family is important in India, but I rarely see whole families from Britain. Yours, I think, is a tight bond.""

So what of the kettle? I'm afraid to say I caved in quickly on that one. Mum was right (aren't they always?): as we left the cities behind, the hotels became simpler - and the humble in-room tea sets disappeared. But not for us! Every evening, we put our feet up with PG Tips - a little luxury that I, hypocrite daughter, was all-too happy to enjoy.

I also watched, delighted, as Mum's preoccupation with Delhi belly and Dettol fizzled out. Soon, both parents were ordering hot curries and sipping creamy lassi (""hair of the dog,"" quipped Dad). My stomach, meanwhile, became somewhat over-spiced; but Mum came to the rescue again, wielding her inexhaustible first-aid stash. The foot cream, however, remained unused.

Travelling up into those tribal mountains, we left the coast's coconut palms and banana trees far behind. Our minibus passed fields of leggy sunflowers and cotton bushes, their little white pom-poms jigging in the cool breeze. On steep inclines, as the bus wheezed its way upwards, I counted rows of plump pumpkins and cauliflowers - overlooked by lonely scarecrows, their heads fashioned from up-turned clay pots. Beside me, Mum tittered at Woman's Hour podcasts, while Dad click-click-clicked his way through untold memory cards.

One morning, the bus pulled up on an empty, dusty track. ""This village belongs to the Kutia Kondh tribe,"" said Satish. We peered out at huts made from red earth and bamboo: beside each one lay a large heap of turmeric roots, the local cash-crop. There was nobody in sight. ""The local people are quite shy,"" Satish explained as we stretched our legs. ""But there is somebody I would like you to meet.""

When she saw us, Joginder squealed, then dashed back inside her house. Moments later, she emerged with her husband in tow, giggling nervously as she tugged at his arm. They grinned at the visitors in their yard, unsure what to do next. Joginder had clear brown eyes, and wispy silver hair swept up in a bun, but it was her face tattoos that we all noticed first. The dark lines stretched across her cheeks, her chin, her forehead: though the marks had faded with age, they were still ruler-straight.

""Those tattoos were done when she was just a child,"" Satish explained. ""All the tribe's girls had them. It was to make them unattractive to colonialists, so that they wouldn't be abducted.""

Joginder sidled up to Mum, studying her quietly. ""They don't know how old they are, or how long they have been married,"" translated Satish, ""but they have many grown-up children."" Mum pointed to me, then made a cradle with her arms: ""This is my baby,"" she said proudly. I rolled my eyes, laughing this time, and Joginder's giggles returned.

Many of Odisha's tribal villages remain closed to tourists, so we visited the communities' markets instead, mingling with the tattooed turmeric farmers of the Kutia Kondh and the matriarchs of the Dongria Kondh. The latter arrived in battered pick-up trucks, their hair pinned with sharp hunting knives, and their bare torsos covered with long beaded necklaces. Ready to barter, they piled their heads with pineapples and tamarind pods.

Higher up in the hills, the Bonda tribe is ruled entirely by women: zealous traders and fearless hunters, who sport buzz cuts and gold-studded nostrils. At their market, we watched as they quarrelled over the price of liquor, before tipping it into ""wine pipes"" - to be swigged as they perused the vegetable stalls. A handful of men snoozed in the shade: unable, perhaps, to hold their hooch. The women largely ignored us, swooshing past in their cobalt cloaks and glittering bangles. ""They are the bosses,"" explained Satish. ""When they marry, their husband's family has to pay a dowry: that's how they get all that gold jewellery.""

That afternoon, we hiked to the top of a waterfall - a huge, roiling cascade that thundered over the cliffside. Sweat-soaked, spray-soaked, we three peered from the edge, whooping and laughing into oblivion. The heart operation, those intensive care visits: were they really just one year ago?

I was so caught up in my thoughts, I didn't notice the wonky path as we walked back - but I certainly felt the sharp twist of my foot. Ankle burning, I hobbled to the bus, while Mum looted her handbag for bandages. There I was, a mid-thirties woman of the world, being patched up by my wonderful mother. I blinked back the tears. ""Ibuprofen and elevation,"" she prescribed with a wry smile. ""And perhaps a bit of that foot cream?"" For once, I didn't disagree.

Lab-grown meat up to 25 times more costly for environment than beef

Processing alternative proteins has a large impact on global warming, study finds

Meat grown in a lab could be 25 times more costly for the environment than beef, a study has found.

""ŒCultivated meat is grown using animal cells, eliminating the need for rearing and slaughtering animals.

""ŒIts backers, including the Government, say it could also reduce the emissions from meat production, particularly methane from livestock, which accounts for around six per cent of global emissions.

""ŒBut a new study suggests that the process is so energy intensive that the global warming impact could be between four and 25 times higher than beef, typically the most polluting meat.

""ŒThe study, led by researchers at the University of California, looked at the production emissions of the substances used to grow the animal cells, which include vital nutrients, salt and sugars.

Problems with contamination

""Œ""Our goal was to track back each ingredient or component all the way to its cradle,"" study co-author Derrick Risner said.

""ŒThe elements must also be purified to avoid contamination that would affect the ability of cells to grow, another energy-intensive process.

""Œ""If you get any contamination, you could just ruin your batch basically,"" Mr Risner said. ""They're notoriously finicky to work with.""

""ŒThe Government has said it wants the UK to be at the front of the alternative proteins sector, and is providing £12 million in backing for a project at the University of Bath to develop the technology.

""ŒBut it has been accused of relying too heavily on alternative proteins as a solution to food emissions, which experts say must include a reduction in meat consumption.

Innovations needed to improve efficiency

""ŒThe research from the University of California has not yet been peer-reviewed, but comes after other studies have suggested that the emissions from cultivated meat could be higher than those from traditional beef.

""ŒA study from the University of Oxford in 2019 found the climate benefit of cultivated meat would require innovations that improve the efficiency of the process.

""ŒThe cultivated meat industry argues that it can eliminate many of the energy-intensive processes, which also make production economically unviable at scale.

""ŒThis includes using food-grade, rather than pharmaceutical-grade, purified inputs.

""ŒA recent life-cycle assessment from the Good Food Institute, an alternative protein research body, found lab meat could ultimately have a lower carbon footprint than beef.

""ŒBut Raymond Pierrehumbert, a physics professor at the University of Oxford who co-authored the 2019 study, said there had been no recent developments in the cultivated meat industry to change its original conclusions.

John Lynch, a biology researcher who co-authored the 2019 University of Oxford study, said: ""I feel that it is unlikely that cultured meat would be scaled up in a way that would not overcome at least some of these technical hurdles, but the paper might offer a useful reminder that until we do have a better idea of what real, large-scale cultured meat production looks like, we can't reliably predict the environmental impacts.""

""˜Give raw milk a chance' says Tom Parker Bowles

The Queen's son claims raw dairy has been ""˜unfairly demonised' despite its supposed health benefits and its ""˜lusciously creamy' taste

People should give raw milk a chance for a taste bud experience ""they'll never forget"", the Queen's son has said.

Tom Parker Bowles, a food writer, said unpasteurised milk provided the ""most lusciously creamy mouthful of pure dairy delight"" in contrast to its ""drab"" counterpart.

He claimed raw dairy had been unfairly demonised despite its supposed health benefits and being produced to ""some of the highest dairy standards of the world"".

Writing in Country Life magazine, he said: ""You never forget your first sip""¦ fresh from the cow, simply filtered, cooled and bottled.

""No pasteurisation, homogenisation or standardisation, meaning it still contains the full complement of vitamins, minerals and natural digestive enzymes.

""As well as providing the most lusciously creamy mouthful of pure dairy delight, rich sweet and voluptuously full bodied.

""If the average supermarket pint is Dorothy in Kansas, all drab and monochrome, then raw milk is the moment she steps into Oz and the screen erupts into dazzling Technicolour.""

Raw milk must be labelled with health warnings and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) states it may contain bacteria that causes food poisoning. It advises against its consumption by those aged over 65, young children, and pregnant women.

In England and Wales it can only be sold at registered milk production farms, registered farmers markets, online, or through distributors who sell from their vehicle. It has been illegal to sell unpasteurised milk in Scotland since 1983, which Mr Parker Bowles said was ""unfathomable"".

Food Standards Scotland said raw milk has historically been linked to outbreaks of food poisoning, including salmonella and E.coli. The regulator believes there are 12 deaths that can potentially be traced back to it.

Mr Parker Bowles, whose books include Full English, argued that unpasteurised milk had been the victim of ""scare stories"" and said its supporters ""claim it can lower cholesterol, fight infection and offer an incredible source of protein, as well as help with eczema, asthma and many allergies"".

""I've spoken to many people who swear by its beneficial properties, but the problem is that there has been no serious research into its empirical benefits,"" he said, though claims about its nutritional content have been disputed by regulators.

He added that producers believe that raw milk has been ""bedevilled"" by the pasteurising industry which has painted it as a ""dangerous food"".

""Prejudice against raw milk goes back many years, a mixture of scare stories, misinformation and, once upon a time, some very legitimate fears, too,"" he said.

Traces of the bacteria campylobacter

In 2016, 65 cases of food poisoning were linked to a vending machine dispensing raw milk on a farm in Cumbria after health officials discovered traces of the bacteria campylobacter.

Mr Parker Bowles added that he had himself been ambivalent about the dairy product until he tried it from a vending machine in Selfridges in 2011.

It came as a ""revelation"", he said, after drinking the product from farmer Stephen Hook.

At the time, the FSA said it would prosecute the department store over the sale of the milk, but the case was dropped two years later after Selfridges assured the watchdog it would not sell it again and Mr Hook agreed not to sell the milk outside of farm premises.

Urging ""give raw milk a chance"", Mr Parker Bowles said: ""Not only are you supporting a dairy industry already on its knees, but you're giving those taste buds an experience they'll never forget.

""The fact that it may have other benefits simply makes raw milk taste all the more sweet.""

What the proposed ban on peat means for gardeners

A controversial subject in the gardening world, we look at the ban as a report is released by the House of Lords

Bunny Guinness

The use of peat in horticulture seems to be one of those confusing subjects that few people know enough about to make a decision on whether it's OK to use it, or it's wrecking the planet. Social media has gone into overdrive with this debate, with some of the major charities going heavily into anti-peat mode. Monty Don has even written in his latest book the totally incorrect statement that peat is ""illegal"". 

The horticultural industry has been trying to argue a case for peat, but few gardening ""names"" are willing to come to its aid and risk getting chewed up on social media. 

A report released today on the future of horticulture by the House of Lords states: ""The future of horticulture looks bleak without urgent steps to safeguard its future."" This gloomy outlook comes about in part because of the proposed peat ban. I spoke to Baroness Fookes, an avid gardener and joint chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Gardening and Horticulture Group, who told me that the report says that ""the Government must make a major assessment of the possible unintended consequences that might come about before a total ban on peat is introduced, even if that means the Government not sticking to its proposed date for such a ban.""

The second pertinent point the report makes is that ""the Government must provide suitable funding for research into substitutes for peat of sufficient quality and quantity to satisfy the needs of those professional growers who find it difficult to make a living without the use of peat.""

Hopefully, if these two steps are taken, this massive muddle will be sorted. 

We all think peat should eventually be replaced, but the dominant view in the commercial sector is that the ban should come when we have a material that behaves as well as peat. The number of disillusioned gardeners who have tried these peat-free alternatives with dismal results that complain to me and other Gardeners' Question Time panellists is concerning.

Pippa Greenwood, the pest and disease expert, said she had huge amounts of blight and grey mould on her tomatoes as a result of increased humidity with non-peat-based composts. Highly professional commercial growers report massive losses compared with plants grown in peat. 

The title of a report by the horticultural sector committee released today - Sowing the Seeds: A blooming English horticultural sector - is ironic, laughable even, in that if the ban goes through as scheduled (2024 for retail; 2026 for professionals; a complete ban in 2030), it states that there could be more than a 46 per cent loss in plant sales and a loss of more than 12,000 jobs. 

In addition, if the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) does not ban imports of plants in peat-based composts, our market will be flooded with better, cheaper, peat-grown plants from our neighbours across the Channel. They expect to double the use of peat by 2050. 

The biggest misunderstanding seems to be that people just don't realise the tiny volume of peat the horticulture sector uses, compared with other uses. The area of peatland in the UK is almost 3 million hectares, of which only 0.053 per cent is used for extraction of peat for UK horticulture. A whopping 80 per cent of all UK bogs are degraded already because of their historical land uses, mostly agriculture and forestry. 

Drained UK peatland contributes 5 per cent of UK greenhouse gas emissions, but only 0.6 per cent of this comes from peat extraction sites and the peat that is extracted. If these huge areas were rewetted (with costs paid by a 1p per litre surcharge on peat compost), this would enable their restoration in the shortest time. It would also do far more for the planet than stopping the 0.05 per cent of peatlands being used to extract peat for horticulture. The alternatives have carbon footprints higher or the same as peat, while some cause greater environmental damage and their availability and price are influenced by international competition for other uses, including energy generation.

The basic problem is the timescale of the ban. Prof Peter Dobson, a keen gardener and scientist/engineer who delivers lectures on environmental technology and is a retired academic of Oxford University, says: ""The timescale for a new product to go through the development stages to full acceptance is typically 20 years. The government has not taken this into account and its support for research into alternatives in industry and academia has been lamentable and shows some ignorance and lack of caring."" 

What is needed is a proper scientific assessment, fully quantified - a view echoed by many reading the report. Importing coir (coconut fibre) and other materials from far away is economic and ecological madness; virtue signalling at its worst. The coir imported from South East Asia has a high salt content and has to be thoroughly washed using fresh water, a scarce resource in countries where it originates. 

Additionally, master gardener Robert Pavlis tells me, workers in coir factories typically work six days a week in an unhealthy, dusty environment. Traditionally it is used to mulch the coconut trees there, but now, with increased demand, it's coming here and denuding soils there. 

None of the substitutes (including bark and green waste) hold water as well as peat, so they need more water and fertiliser, which means we are adding yet more nitrogen to our rivers. What this whole peat fiasco has done is to expose the lack of support and understanding for horticulture and soil science in general. Defra has not been doing its job and organisations such as the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), National Trust and Bug Life have simply ""gone with the flow"" of virtue signalling. Furthermore, the peat in horticulture is used as a medium to grow plants that trap CO2, so the effect is positive. If it was left in the ground it would not trap more CO2. 

My worry is that gardeners will stop growing plants if they fork out for expensive treasures that succumb to increased disease or cannot get established and wither and die. The more people that enjoy their garden and garden successfully can only benefit the planet. Surely, those who do not make their livelihood from growing plants can accept a delay and help our all-important horticultural sector survive.

There's a lot of confusion around the future of peat, the staple growing medium in horticulture for more than half a century.

Peat is currently legal to buy and use in the UK and the Government does not propose banning sales of bagged peat-based growing media until the end of 2024. Professional growers have until the end of 2026 to use it, and there are exemptions for mushrooms and ""plugs"", starter plants grown in less than 150ml of peat.  

Where Monty Don may have a point is that he says using peat is ""eco-vandalism"". Excavated peat bogs, which take many thousands of years to develop, release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, causing global warming; though there are some scientists who argue against this.

Horticulture is a small user of peat, and the Government sees gardeners as a soft target. But it is inevitable, after 30 years of campaigns, that peat will be banned sooner rather than later. The horticulture industry has been trying to kick the issue into the long grass for that long, holding out against arguments based on habitats, wildlife, flood risk and now carbon.

Peat's biggest advocate, the gardening writer Peter Seabrook, died aged 86 in January 2022, and any campaigns to keep peat for horticulture have since lost momentum.

Gardeners will have to manage without. Using bark, coir, green waste, biodigestate or woodchip compost is already the norm for many, as garden centres have drastically cut the peat-based composts they sell. Peat by volume in growing media has halved since 2020 and just 17 per cent of amateur growing media is peat-based. However, this could rise, temporarily.

Peat firms will be selling off their stocks in 2024 and diehards will be stocking up, or they could even club together to buy professional peat-based compost until the end of 2026. B&Q, Britain's biggest seller of compost, has already stopped selling peat as have many supermarkets. The Government's carrot-and-stick approach has started to work.

But most gardening newbies using whatever is on offer will blame themselves if their crops fail. Non-peat materials retain water and nutrients less well than peat, which has been No 1 for gardeners for so long for a reason: it is cheap and reliable. The move to peat-free has led to a £2 rise per bag. Bargain multipurpose compost will be a thing of the past. TV gardeners say make your own, but that is not practical or achievable for many average gardeners.

It's the professionals that need help from the Government, with cash to develop alternatives, quality standards and more exemptions, for instance for ericaceous plants, which like a peaty soil. Peat-free kite marks are important because we might see a rush of composts entering the market made from any old rubbish. 

UK growers also need the Government to ensure there will be a level playing field with the Continent, where peat use is less of an issue than in the UK. Dutch growers could undercut Brits with cheaper, undetectable peat-grown plants masquerading as peat-free. Or some Dutch growers might give up on our market, leading to plant shortages. There is an import substitution opportunity for peat-free UK growers. But there are just 73, mainly small, UK peat-free nurseries, according to the RHS. As with so much Defra policy, there is no real plan on how any of this will work.

And Scotland and Northern Ireland might have different rules. But Ireland, once a big supplier to the UK of peat, has successfully stopped harvesting commercially. 

This March, Defra moved the goalposts from a 2030 ban to 2026, relayed via a blog on its website. Previous policy statements were broadcast on the RHS podcast rather than official channels.

This epitomises a bigger issue. Defra listens to charities and pressure groups rather than horticultural ""doers"" who actually grow plants, which themselves have obvious green benefits. The fear is that if fewer plants are grown, there will be a net loss to the environment.

The green revolution is fuelling environmental destruction

Net zero warning as the staggering true cost of going green is revealed

Roughly 80 miles off the coast of Yorkshire, the new generation of offshore wind turbines being built at Dogger Bank will be taller than some skyscrapers.

Along with masses of solar panels and electric cars, these feats of human engineering will become the backbone of a new, green economy that will emerge as we abandon fossil fuels.

Yet as we embrace net zero carbon emissions in the name of saving the planet, growing tensions are emerging over what must be done to achieve this goal.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the World Bank, the switch to ""cleaner"" renewable energy sources is going to require an unprecedented surge in the extraction of precious minerals from the earth.

Whether it is lithium and cobalt needed for batteries, or rare earth elements used for magnets that power wind turbines and electric car motors, we simply can't make the green technologies we need without them.

Yet campaigners and researchers warn that the mines producing these minerals raise troubling environmental questions of their own, with the worst examples ravaging landscapes, polluting water supplies and desolating crops. The industry also poses geopolitical challenges for Britain and its allies, with China currently dominating the supply chains.

It means that without drastic improvements to global standards and greater engagement by the West, the switch to clean power risks becoming very dirty indeed.

Henry Sanderson, a business journalist and author of Volt Rush, a book that examines the complicated issues surrounding transition minerals, believes that overcoming these contradictions is one of the biggest challenges facing businesses and policymakers.  

""Mining has an impact. And often local communities don't want it,"" he says. ""So how do you reconcile those facts with the fact we need mining for clean energy technologies?

""It is a hard question to answer. But we are seeing a lot of these trade-offs come up now.

""And if we don't want other countries to control the green transition, we need to grapple with and grasp these issues.""

'Explosion' of mining

The sheer quantity of minerals and metals needed for the green revolution - which entails the widespread electrification of transport and energy production - is staggering.

Minerals such as lithium, cobalt and nickel will go into batteries that store electricity and power billions of electric cars. Copper will be required for new power lines needed everywhere. Rare earth metals will be used to make magnets that are vital for the spinning parts in wind turbines and electric motors.

What's more, they will be needed in much bigger quantities than ever before. Whereas a conventional car uses about 34kg of minerals, an electric car requires 207kg, or six times as much, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Meanwhile, a typical offshore wind turbine requires 13 times more minerals than a gas-fired power plant for each megawatt of capacity.

The IEA predicts this will cause demand for critical minerals to soar to 42.3m tonnes per year by 2050 - up from around 7m tonnes in 2020.

Per Kalvig, an expert at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, says this will require an ""explosion"" of mining in the coming years.

""They're necessary for wind turbines, for electric vehicles. Europe needs these minerals, and it doesn't want to continue relying on China to produce them"", he explains.  

It is prompting difficult questions for the EU, which believes it will need five times as much rare earth minerals by 2030, a meteoric rise that will require a correspondingly rapid increase in extraction.

Whether the practice of actually mining the materials will be permitted within the bloc is another matter, however.

MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, the European Commission vice president, has said there are 11 potentially viable lithium projects in Europe and that if they all become operational they could meet nearly two-fifths of EU demand by 2030. They include sites in Finland, Spain, Portugal, Serbia, the Czech Republic and Austria.

But in Portugal, for example, where large lithium resources exist, there has been persistent opposition from local communities against new mining schemes.

British company Savannah is among those trying to open a project in the northern region of Barroso by 2025 with EU funding. It plans to produce about 5,000 tons of lithium a year.

But despite the company's protestations that it has been ""specifically designed to minimise its impact on the natural environment and local communities wherever possible"" - such as new ways of storing waste and recycling 85pc of its water - it has struggled to persuade naysayers.

In Sweden too, where Europe's biggest ever discovery of rare earth oxides was recently made, progress is proving tricky.

Miner LKAB wants to start producing but needs to secure a string of permits. Meanwhile, a court battle is ongoing over the revocation of a licence in 2016, amid concerns that operations in Norra Karr, in the south of Sweden, were polluting local water supplies.

Given the strength of feeling in communities, Kalvig is doubtful there is the political will in Europe to push through many domestic mining schemes.

""Generally, we experience public resistance against mining projects,"" he adds.

But if Europe is unwilling to extract minerals itself for the green transition, it will simply need to import them from somewhere else - and typically, that means Africa and Asia.

A handful of countries currently produce more than three quarters of the world's supply of critical minerals and rare earth metals - with China chief among them.

The Democratic Republic of Congo was responsible for 70pc of global cobalt production in 2019, for example, while China produced 60pc of the rare earth metals.

Crucially, China dominates refining, with its plants processing 90pc of rare earth metals, between 50pc and 70pc of lithium and cobalt and 35pc of nickel. With the help of generous state subsidies, Chinese companies have spent years snapping up mines in other countries too, from Australia to Chile, the DRC and Indonesia, to further entrench their positions.

It means the question of how far governments are willing to go is not only domestic in nature but geopolitical as well. This is why some are examining the potential of mineral extraction from the sea bed - despite loud protestations from environmental groups.

While China has raced ahead producing critical minerals since the 1980s, the country also presents a cautionary tale of environmental destruction as well.

Lax oversight and poor standards have blighted landscapes and cost rural residents their lives, saddling provincial governments with massive cleanup operations in recent years.

Some of the most visible damage has been in Inner Mongolia, where local media described fields of wheat and corn ""carpeted in black dust"", brown-coloured rivers and unusually high numbers of deaths in what became known as ""cancer villages"" near the mines.

Every year, millions of tonnes of toxic waste was discharged into a 10km wide lake not far from the Yellow River - leading to fears it could poison a source of drinking water used by 150m people.

But worryingly, as Beijing now cracks down on mineral mining at home, it is exporting these same toxic practices elsewhere.

Mining wastelands

In neighbouring Myanmar, parts of the mountainous area known as Kachin already resemble the ravaged wastelands in China.

There, violent militias - with the blessing of the military junta that usurped Aung San Suu Kyi's government in 2021 - have set up a string of illegal rare earth mines, pock-marking the landscape with bright blue chemical pools, an investigation by the charity Global Witness found.

In a crude and ecologically devastating process, they remove vegetation, drill holes into mountains and inject an acidic solution to effectively liquidate the earth. This is then drained into chemical pools where the liquid evaporates, leaving behind the minerals.

Once the process is finished, the site is abandoned and the militias simply move on, starting all over again in a new location.

Just a few years ago, there were only a handful of these mines. But since then, satellite imagery has revealed hundreds of them - with nearly 3,000 pools recorded across an area the size of Singapore as recently as five months ago.

The militia operations are being bankrolled by Chinese businesses, Global Witness claims, and have quickly turned Myanmar into one of the biggest rare earth minerals producers globally.

The price for local people has been poisoned water, chemically-blighted crops and a growing threat of landslides, with experts concerned that the mountains could collapse.

""We found that most of them [companies] are going to China for the production of magnets in green energy technologies, like wind turbines and electric vehicles,"" says Hanna Hindstrom, a senior campaigner at Global Witness.

""Of course, it's a great irony. Because although these technologies are essential to the green energy transition, we are fuelling demand for mining that is causing environmental destruction.

""What we're seeing in Myanmar is probably the most egregious example of how it could be done, because there's no environmental regulation, no enforcement, nothing - and no cleanup afterwards.

""It is an inherently dirty business.""

Even in places where mining is done legally, the industry's reputation is chequered.

Glencore, the FTSE 100 miner, was ordered by a High Court judge to pay £280m in fines and costs in November after pleading guilty to a sprawling bribery scheme in Nigeria, Cameroon, the Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea and South Sudan.

Meanwhile, BHP, the world's largest mining company, is battling the biggest group claim in British legal history after the collapse of a dam in southeastern Brazil spewed toxic mud and water over the landscape and residents.

Industry figures say that efforts are constantly under way to improve standards and make modern mining more efficient - but there remain inescapable drawbacks.

The process involves digging up large amounts of earth - which may only be 1pc lithium, cobalt or another kind of metal - crushing it into fine sand, then using chemicals to extract the target minerals.

Anything left over at the end is waste, known as ""tailings"" in trade jargon. This can be a mix of earth, chemicals, minerals and water - and can often be toxic or even radioactive.

What mining companies do with this sludge varies around the world. Some still dump tailings into the nearest water source - as has been done in China and Indonesia - but more standard practice today is to create tailing dams.

However, research has found that one in 100 tailing dams fail, largely due to poor maintenance and monitoring. The comparable figure for water dams is one in 10,000.

Gawen Jenkin, a geology professor at Leicester University, describes tailing dam failures as ""appalling"" and warns that they have ""catastrophic"" consequences for the environment and communities.

""We simply have to do better, if we are going to produce these metals at this scale,"" he says.

Beyond environmental issues, mining can also take a terrible toll on workers. In the DRC, tens of thousands of children are pressed into working in dangerous, small mines, while research published in medical journal The Lancet has found that labourers working in the African ""copperbelt"" were at higher risk of having children with birth defects.

At the same time, the degree to which communities truly benefit is up for debate. Big mining projects do indisputably bring jobs, wages and development.

But Gavin Hilson, a professor at Surrey University, says smaller local operations - known as ""artisanal miners"" - are often muscled out by big multinational corporations in developing countries where state corruption is rife and officials tend to prefer quick wins.

""You just can't have a conversation with these governments about how if we formalise small scale mining and support them, down the road you'll be in a position to tax them. They don't want to hear that,"" he says, citing years of field research.

""They want to see the large mining companies come in and set up shop, because then they get revenue from permit fees, from royalties, as well as from exploration companies whose work facilitates or leads to that mine being opened.

""All of that provides instantaneous revenue that can also be renewed.""

The London Mining Network, which monitors Glencore, Rio Tinto, Anglo-American and other miners listed on the London Stock Exchange, argues that the coming ""wave of green extractivism"" risks ""reproducing the same dynamics and practices that caused the climate crisis in the first place"".

""Mining projects increase the threat that an unstable climate already poses,"" a report by the group says.

Treasure in the desert

The arid plains of west Texas seem like the furthest place in the world from an ocean.

And yet this lunar-like landscape was once at the bottom of the sea, a huge glittering mass that stretched from the New Mexico border to the southern tip of the state forming what is now called the Permian Basin.

The fossilised remains of the organisms that inhabited this ocean 250 million years ago - now forming oil and gas reserves - have already brought vast wealth to this part of Texas. Nearly one in 10 barrels of oil produced globally come from the Permian field alone.

But Anthony Marchese, chairman of Texas Mineral Resources, thinks the landscape could hold yet more treasure still. His company hopes to develop one of North America's largest rare earth mineral mines at Round Top mountain, 85 miles east of El Paso.

Marchese believes there is a huge and growing gap in US supply chains for rare earth minerals mined on domestic soil.

His scheme is one of several cropping up across the West, as American and European companies turn their hands once again to the kinds of mining and mineral processing activities that have not been done domestically for decades.

Another mine is already operational at Mountain Pass - the only one of its kind in North America, an hour's drive from Las Vegas - where JHL Capital Group is extracting neodymium and praseodymium, two metals used to make magnets for electric vehicle powertrains.

There, Joe Biden's administration has also provided federal funding to ensure a minerals processing facility is established nearby. Other similar initiatives are being pushed with money unlocked through the mammoth - and deceptively-named - Inflation Reduction Act.

In Marchese's opinion, China's grip on the market has left the US vulnerable - unable to independently produce even the materials needed for F-35 fighter jets and radar systems. But he acknowledges that ramping up domestic mining will be controversial too.

""It's a very touchy political issue,"" he says. ""On the one hand you have a tremendous need for the material. And on the other hand, people don't want mining of any kind in this country.""

Marchese says that the methods his company uses for mining are far less environmentally damaging then those used in China, and that in the US they are governed by the strictest environmental standards in the world. ""If this stuff has to be produced, surely we should produce it here?"" he says.

A similar ethos underpins proposals to establish minerals processing facilities in the UK, where multiple projects are progressing. Among the vanguard hoping to break our dependence on Beijing is Pensana, which is building a £125m rare earth minerals processing plant at the Port of Hull in Yorkshire.

Paul Atherley, the company's chairman, who is also chairing a scheme to establish lithium refining in Teesside, says Pensana's feedstock will come from a mine in Longonjo, western Angola. He is also seeking to source lithium from Australia for his other company.

""What we're arguing is that Australia, and South America and Africa should be doing what they are good at, which is mining and the extraction phase. And the processing should be done in Europe, in UK chemical parks hooked up to offshore wind, so we create these independent and sustainable supply chains, independent of China, so we can be absolutely sure about how it's mined and how it's processed.""

Many people in the mining industry also speak evangelically about the potential for recycling materials from existing electronics and batteries. Although the point at which a so-called infinite loop - a holy grail situation where all the material can be recovered - is still some time away. Glencore, which counts Tesla, BMW and Samsung among its customers, already has a huge lithium recycling business in North America, a spokesman noted.

Leicester University's Jenkin says the mining sector is also working to improve the efficiency of processes and reduce the need for harmful chemicals. He has just returned from a trip to the Philippines where he has been helping to extract more useful minerals from tailings than before.

Even further into the future, he says scientists could develop chemical solutions that are harmless for the environment and even methods to extract ore that require circulating liquid through the ground rather than disturbing large amounts of earth.

""There are good sides,"" he says. ""The standards are ever-improving. And mining provides income to local economies, to national economies. There's a nuanced debate that people need to have about this - but often it becomes very polarised and it just becomes ""˜mining bad'.""

Sanderson too is hopeful about efforts to overhaul the murkier practices in green technology supply chains, arguing that businesses will come under more and more pressure from consumers to clean up their acts. Some efforts are already under way to create a global ""battery passport"" that would ensure supply chains are transparent and meet the same standards.

""Green products should have clean supply chains, because, by nature, they are supposed to be good for the environment,"" Sanderson adds.

""For many years, most consumers were completely blind about how things got made and where the materials came from.

""But we are moving to a greater awareness. And there's now a strong link between electric vehicle manufacturers and the mining industry - and EV producers do not want to wake up and see the minerals they are using splashed across the front pages or in an Amnesty International report.

""So there are strong incentives - if miners want to be part of the supply chain - to clean up.""

Free-range eggs could be back on supermarket shelves next week

Government will lift bird flu restrictions from midnight on Apr 18, following reduction of risk level to ""˜medium'

Free-range eggs could return to supermarket shelves from next week as the Government lifts its bird flu lockdown.

Birds across England and Wales have been kept inside since a mandatory lockdown was imposed in early November following the outbreak of avian flu across the country.

Restrictions will be lifted from midnight on Tuesday, Apr 18, after the risk level was reduced to ""medium"".

The move means that eggs laid by hens with access to outside range areas can once again be marketed as ""Free-Range"".

Some areas of the country will remain in lockdown, including large parts of Norfolk, and poultry farmers will have to maintain enhanced biosecurity measures.

The risk of infection could circulate for several more weeks, the environment department warned.

Dr Christine Middlemiss, the UK's Chief Veterinary Officer, said: ""Whilst the lifting of the mandatory housing measures will be welcome news to bird keepers, scrupulous biosecurity remains the most critical form of defence to help keep your birds safe.

""It is thanks to the hard work of all bird keepers and vets who have played their part in keeping flocks safe this winter that we are in a position to take this action.

""However, the unprecedented nature of this outbreak has proven it is more important than ever for bird keepers to remain vigilant for signs of disease and to maintain stringent standards of biosecurity.""

Poultry and captive bird keepers must cleanse and disinfect all clothing, and reduce the amount of people entering and leaving their farms to minimise the spread of avian flu.

They are also being told to minimise contamination from manure and slurry, control vermin and thoroughly clean and disinfect bird housing on a continuous basis.

The UK Health Security Agency has said that avian viruses do not spread easily to humans and have so far found no positive cases in people while monitoring those who have developed flu or cold-like symptoms after being in contact with a bird.

They are advising that people avoid contact with any sick or dead wild birds they might find and wash their hands after feeding wild birds.

Leading vaccine makers, including GSK and Moderna, have said they are ready to make hundreds of millions of bird flu shots for humans, if the virus spreads.

Bird keepers are asked to report any suspicion of disease to Defra.

The Government said the risk to public health from the virus is very low, and properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat.

At least 48 million birds have been culled across the UK and Europe since the outbreak began in 2021.

Avian flu can cause birds to stumble around, their necks to twist and their heads to swell.

""Free-range egg producers will be relieved to see their hens outside again,"" said Robert Gooch, chief executive of the British Free Range Egg Producers Association.

Last month, the Government said it was exploring the potential use of vaccination for poultry as a preventive measure against future outbreaks of avian flu, as vaccinating poultry is currently banned.

But it said that further research was needed and cautioned that bird flu vaccines would not be a viable solution to the current outbreak.

""˜The boss just loves nature': a tour of Dumfries House, King Charles's beloved Scottish project

From its Van Cleef & Arpels rose garden to its educational farm, the historic estate is preserving the past and protecting the future

Ever since I saw Peter Shaffer's play Lettice and Lovage, starring Maggie Smith as the frustrated tour guide of a not very stately home in which exciting things nearly happened, I have felt great sympathy for anyone steering visitors around historic buildings. 

No such concern was necessary as the story of Dumfries House, the 18th-century Palladian mansion in Cumnock, East Ayrshire - saved for the nation in 2007 by the then Prince of Wales - was laid out before me with humour and drama by its excellent collections manager, Satinder Kaur.

In 1754 William Crichton-Dalrymple, 5th Earl of Dumfries and Sheriff of Clackmannan, commissioned 26-year-old Robert Adam (along with his brothers James and John) to build him a new home. The resulting property, Dumfries House, was completed in 1760, on time and within budget at a cost of £7,979, 11 shillings and tuppence. So young was the lead architect that the building wasn't furnished with the neoclassical chimney pieces he is famous for, as Adam was yet to make his Grand Tour  and go mad for marble. 

However 59 items of furniture were ordered from Thomas Chippendale's workshop, including a magnificent one-of-a-kind rosewood bookcase as well as ""˜18 elbow chairs and two settees to hold three people each'. The house still retains order notes and receipts for all these pieces. The master craftsman's great catalogue of 1754, from which his customers shopped, lies open on the desk in Lord Dumfries's study - the Ikea catalogue of one's dreams. 

Following untimely deaths, a woeful lack of direct heirs, one louche relation who was considered un­reliable, a baby described as ""˜the richest infant in Christendom', and a female heir's union with Viscount Mount Stuart, the house was absorbed into the property of the Bute family. 

In 1867 the 3rd Marquess of Bute had a Turkish bath installed in what is now the library, where we sip our morning tea. The cups are brought in by a young butler in black jacket and striped trousers who is being trained for a career in hospitality on one of Dumfries House's many educational programmes.

In the late 1800s the house was extended to include a large tapestry room, lined in cedar from the Bute Docks in Cardiff, as well as a double-height chapel, increasing its footprint twofold. In 1909, under the direction of the 4th Marquess, Dumfries House was wired for electricity. 

Our guide, Kaur, has a hands-on approach to curation. Her familiarity with the surroundings goes deep. Lingering over the portrait of the 5th Earl of Dumfries in the Blue Drawing Room, she muses, ""˜He had such athletic legs considering his gout and diabetes.' Passing the noble head of Scotland's best-loved poet in an alcove, she murmurs, ""˜There's not a Scottish country house without a bust of Robert Burns.' 

Kaur explains that the estate, which includes 2,000 acres of farmland and gardens, is in the business of heritage-led regeneration, aiming for a balance between conservation, restoration and innovation. She draws my attention to the iMat I am standing on - a digital representation of the original highly patterned floral Axminster (complete with tobacco plant and flowering cactus), which has been printed on to rubber and laid over the existing carpet for its protection. She asks me what I think. I'm not sure. ""˜It divides people,' she says cheerfully.

When elaborately painted decoration was discovered on the domed and arched walls of the Pewter Corridor - they had been painted over in battleship grey by the house's last inhabitant, Lady Eileen Bute, in the 1960s - it was decided that only the first part of the corridor would be restored. After that, a team of young painter-decorators was brought in to carry on the decorative scheme uncovered, giving a fresh sense of the work's original vibrancy, as well as saving money and time. 

Our curator-guide's concern for the wellbeing of Dumfries House extends to collecting quills from the estate geese to carve into plectra for the 18th-century harpsichord in the yellow damask Family Parlour. ""˜A much richer sound than plastic,' she says, giving us a few bars of Chopsticks. Wednesday is the day she winds the eight grandfather clocks, the ""˜heartbeat' of the house. ""˜Do you talk to them as you wind?' She does! What's more they have different personalities, requiring different registers. 

One of the things I most like about the house is the profusion of vestibules, only a yard or two in length, with closing doors, between the grander rooms. They are places for a servant to linger until summoned, but also somewhere guests might get up their courage, putting on their public faces before facing others""¦ 

In the Blue Drawing Room with the astonishing rosewood bookcase - or was it the Pink Dining Room with the Murano chandelier, which is rather ""˜Marie Antoinette Barbie' - we are told that from 1993 to 2007 the house fell into a state of limbo. 

Its owner saw it as his grandmother's house (Lady Eileen of the grey paint) and couldn't imagine living there. He decided to auction Dumfries House as well as its contents that summer - some of the larger pieces still have the Christie's tags in their drawers. At the 11th hour the crisis at Dumfries House came to the attention of the then Prince Charles, who spent £20 million from his charitable foundation and secured a deal of £45 million to preserve the house and its contents for the nation.

What has followed in terms of regeneration, in an area of Scotland that has suffered from deprivation since the mines were closed down, is ambitious and inspiring. After vital restoration works were carried out, the Prince's Foundation set about establishing a broad range of educational programmes and training schemes for infants, secondary school children, job seekers, local residents, students and early career practitioners. 

The estate boasts an educational farm specialising in rare breeds such as Vaynol cows, with black noses and ears, as well as black-laced white turkeys - creatures so glamorous that they appear to be wearing evening dress. Denise Richardson-Rowell from the education farm recently took an incubator of chicks about to hatch into a school to show embryo development. ""˜I just can't wait to meet them,' reads a speech bubble from a little girl photographed at school. 

In the education garden I pick a black pod pea, its dark purple casing revealing peas so bright and sugary they go down like sweeties. Tom Scoble, the executive chef in the teaching kitchen, which trains local school leavers - as well as advising visitors young and old on nutrition - teaches me to make beetroot-cured salmon. 

A health and wellbeing centre, which takes referrals from local GPs, offers everything from psychotherapy for trauma to tai chi on the lawn. There's fellowship and meditation for those affected by social isolation and anxiety. An intergenerational tea dance takes place every three weeks for locals who like to shake a leg. The centre itself is quietly luxurious with a New England feel. Its services are free. I meet one of its alumni, 

Tom Nolan, a Cumnock man in his early 70s whose doctor had situated him health-wise in ""˜the last chance saloon'. Now he takes 50,000 steps around the estate every day and is on nodding terms with the King. 

Evidence of King Charles's belief in traditional building crafts such as thatching, stained glass, stonemasonry, blacksmithing and assorted decorative arts - all taught on the estate - is everywhere, especially in the Live Build projects, where selected students work for 10 weeks alongside professionals to create new structures. These include the walled garden arbour with its romanesque motifs, and the charming shepherd's hut, lined with fleece - the ideal spot for a weary cowherd to have a breather after tending to the Castlemilk Moorits.

There's a Stem education centre, a textiles training studio delivering sewing skills that can lead into employment, and a children's ""˜engineering playground'. It's hard to take it all in. Occasionally the breadth of thought and care and hope involved in this project struck me almost like a mirage.

Entry to the grounds of Dumfries House is free and it is open to visitors all year round. There are 600 acres of garden. The next day I walk some of them with Melissa Simpson, the head of gardens, who is an inspiration not only in terms of knowledge but in her world view. One acre of garden usually requires a full-time gardener, and she has a team of just 12, as well as some keen volunteers. How is this possible? 

Simpson is rigorous but realistic about what can be achieved. Her version of sustainability means doing what you can with the resources you have, minimising mowing and watering, encouraging meadows rather than lawns, paying attention to key formal areas while letting other parts settle into a more flowing aesthetic - ""˜We've stopped strimming the bejesus out of everything!' - and the result is a lot of natural regeneration: ""˜Trees for free!' She's been focusing on raising the tree canopy lately and mentions making improvements to the 10-acre arboretum. 

Mossy areas are being cultivated. ""˜The King loves moss,' she confides. They aim to plant 1,000 young trees every year and a kilometre of hedgerow, mixing hawthorn with hazel, acer, viburnum, dog rose, elder and holly for biodiversity. 

She sends weekly updates with photographs to the King. ""˜I have a boss who just loves nature,' she says. ""˜For a bit of fun' she planted a large CR in marigolds on the side of a hill in the walled garden for the Coronation. ""˜I wanted to do something""¦ I heard he was pleased.' 

The walled garden, opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 2014, is magnificent, from its long bank of phlox and soaring delphiniums to the surprisingly regal bed of cavolo nero resembling dark green fleurs-de-lis. Its five acres are divided into terraces, boxed parterres, herbaceous borders, flowering summer beds and display glasshouses, with more fruit and vegetable departments. 

A stately tea urn in a greenhouse catches my eye. ""˜There was shocking bad clay soil when I first got here,' Simpson says. The area was derelict with a large cattle shed, the ground damaged by being driven on endlessly. ""˜We set about double digging; you go down two spades deep, add manure, and fork through the bottom of the soil. It's the kind of thing you can only do once.' As temperatures of -13C aren't unusual during winter here, beloved plants are wrapped in fleece from the estate and covered in straw. 

Our final destination is the rose garden, which this month is being named after Van Cleef & Arpels, principal patron of the Prince's Foundation Gardens and Estates. It's a fitting association for the French jeweller, which has always drawn inspiration from nature. 

Its designs, featuring flora and fauna, traditionally include no thorns and no claws, promoting a sort of ideal, but the partnership with the Prince's Foundation doesn't shrink from the practical aspects of horticulture. It supports stewardship and sustainability, including the installation of electric charging points and the estate's transition towards electric-powered tools.

""˜The maison will enable the continued management of the extensive estate including the formal gardens as well as woodland and hedgerow creation schemes. This help, along with boosting biodiversity, will also ensure that the gardens continue to be a valuable and accessible asset for local communities and visitors alike,' announced Nicolas Bos, president and CEO of Van Cleef & Arpels. 

""˜This will also include the creation of a pathway, the creation of eight large circular flower beds, the replacement of the roses at the rear of the garden the replacement of soil and introduction of more organic matter into the area to help the new roses grow.'

There are more than 3,300 roses here. Simpson talks me through them as though we're discussing our relatives. Lady Marmalade struggled this year but Lucky triumphed with masses of highly scented lilac-pink flowers. Thinking of You, a deep crimson hybrid tea, is going from strength to strength. The yew hedge has been scalloped, adding an unexpected playful foil. 

I tell her I adore roses, and whenever I look at them I see not the world as it is but the world as it should be. Above us the Maid of Kent, a mass of pale pink blooms, is attempting a vigorous takeover of large portions of the outer wall. It's festive and charming, and it feels as though we're standing next to the backdrop of a Tchaikovsky ballet, the damp air around us scented with Turkish delight.

""˜It beggars belief that a private company can discharge waste into a lake in a national park'

Swimmers, hoteliers and Michelin-star chefs are battling to save Windermere from pollution, overtourism and climate change

It looks like an exotic piece of psychedelic art: swirls of luminous green and inky black, like a glam-rock album cover. But, look again. Photographed last December, this is Lake Windermere, England's largest natural lake. It's not meant to look like this.

The colour is caused by an algal bloom, when increasing phosphorus levels in the water create a rich source of nutrients, resulting in the rapid growth of algae. Some species produce toxins which, at high concentrations, can lead to serious health problems in humans, pets and wildlife. 

But this isn't nature at work. Windermere, as a contained, freshwater body of water, is naturally nutrient-poor, or oligotrophic. Any increase in phosphorus, therefore, is due to human intervention. 

Windermere is in need of saving and has attracted two committed, but very different, organisations to its cause: Save Windermere and Love Windermere. This week, the former is holding a series of fundraising dinners in grounds overlooking the lakeshore.

Both agree that there are three main sources of pollution: wastewater (both treated and untreated), private septic tanks and agricultural run-off. Rising temperatures are also in the mix. 

On Monday (September 11), 27-year-old Matt Staniek, a zoology graduate and founder of Save Windermere, gave a short but impassioned speech - ""our lake is being exploited by a billion-pound water company"" - at a £220-a-head fundraising dinner for the campaign. 

The diners, of various ages but mostly locals, like Staniek, had been unaware of the causes of the lake's issues until recently. But, in 2021, having taken up photography to study the lakeshore while recovering from a car accident, Staniek noticed a decline in its wildlife. Researching further, he was shocked to discover that in 2020 ""more than 7,000 hours of untreated sewage was discharged from storm overflows in the Windermere catchment area. I dropped everything, ran through my savings, and started a campaign to raise awareness."" It should be noted that water companies are issued with permits from the Environment Agency to allow a certain amount of discharge during periods of high rainfall in order to prevent flooding. 

Earlier this year, Staniek's campaign was formalised as Save Windermere, a not-for-profit Community Interest Company (CIC). Its campaign document alleges that United Utilities, the region's water company, bears the most responsibility. Monday's 100-seater event - the start of a sold-out week-long series, and using the cream of the region's chefs - was produced by the kitchens of Michelin-starred Simon Rogan's Cumbrian restaurants. Held in a chandelier-hung marquee in private grounds above Windermere, the lake glimmered benignly below, a faint luminous sheen.

Damaging ""˜brand' Lake District

""I was horrified [when I discovered] that a private company felt it appropriate to discharge waste into a lake in a national park, a national jewel; it beggars belief,"" says Barney Cunliffe, owner of the Gilpin Hotel, close to Windermere. ""A river can run into the sea, but with a lake, it's trapped there. I also feel my own business is in danger. If there's a catastrophic event, the Lake District brand could be damaged.""

He acknowledges that there are other causes - private septic tanks and agriculture - but suspects ""they're miniscule"", pointing out that farms in the local catchment area have low stock levels and little use of fertiliser. 

United Utilities agrees it has a part to play. ""The factors affecting water quality in Windermere are complex and, without targeted action by multiple sectors, we will not see the changes we all want,"" a spokesperson said. ""For our own part, we will continue to improve our operations and their contribution to the overall health of Windermere. In the last five years we have halved the amount of phosphorus that is now entering the lake from our processes. We know there is more to be done and in the next two years we are making an early start on reducing storm overflow operations at four locations around the lake."" The company's investment plans include £230m between 2020 and 2025 to reduce overflows.

Put this to Save Windermere and it points out that the company paid out £1.6billion to shareholders between 2015 and 2020.

Talk to those who support Love Windermere - whose 10 partners include the Environment Agency, the Lake District National Park Authority and the National Farmers Union, as well as United Utilities - and responses are more measured. ""We've got to take a holistic approach,"" believes Nigel Wilkinson, managing director of Windermere Lake Cruises, one of the area's most popular tourist attractions. He welcomes the water company's investment plans but believes all sources of nutrients need to be addressed. ""The best way is a partnership working between those bodies who have the ability to improve the water quality.""

Overtourism's footprint

It could be argued that one of the biggest stakeholders is the tourist industry, which in 2019 was worth £750million in the Windermere water catchment area. Is overtourism a culprit? ""It's a contributory factor,"" says Staniek. ""But due to the lack of investment. I'm not opposed to people coming here. It's not people's fault if they want to come [to the Lake District]. It's the fault of the people who have not protected the area due to the lack of investment."" 

""There's been woeful underfunding of infrastructure,"" believe Christy and Ian Hayley, who live on the south-west shores of the lake. They attended Monday's dinner because they ""care passionately about the lake. It's in the Lake District National Park, which is for everybody.""

Gill Haigh, managing director of Cumbria Tourism, is cautious in her views: ""For the majority of the year, tourism is relatively steady but on sunny days coinciding with key holiday dates, the widespread appeal of a place like Windermere""¦ can create additional pressures. What's key is having a collective plan and infrastructure to support that."" She adds that Cumbria Tourism is ""supportive of a science-based approach."" 

Pete Kelly, who with his wife Andrea runs the Ambleside-based Swim the Lakes, vocalises a view that many of the area's other businesses may well share but prefer not to state. ""I feel very strongly [about the issues] although it's highlighting something that may be detrimental to our business,"" he says. He believes increasing water temperatures, due to climate change, are as much of a concern as the increase in nutrients in the lake. ""I've been in business 20 years and never had to cancel due to water quality. But I foresee that, in the future, I may have to stop using Windermere.""

Cunliffe admits that there is ""a core of hoteliers who are against what I'm doing. They feel it's damaging the Lake District brand through negative social impact."" But he feels that it's time someone did something ""rather than just shouting"". This week's chefs' dinners will raise around £100,000 (no one is being paid and all food and drink has been donated) which will primarily be used for ""innovative"" data collection and political lobbying. ""Once we have the data, we can put things on desks that can't be ignored.""

Staniek is uncompromising about the solution: ""Complete removal of all treated and untreated sewage in the lake, and for United Utilities to take ownership of private septic tanks."" (According to United Utilities, there are almost 2,000 private septic tanks around Windermere.) Clearly, this is a huge task. But the Save Windermere campaigners point to the example of Lake Annecy in France, also a large glacial lake and popular tourist destination. It too suffered increasing algal blooms but, after local campaigning, the sewage is now transported to treatment works outside the catchment area. The lake is considered the cleanest in Europe.

These perennials will flourish, bulk up and return each year - garden gifts that really do keep on giving

Growing annuals can be tricky - try these hardy blooms instead, for flowers and foliage that will always look their best

At this time of year, as the days lengthen and the temperatures start (please God) to creep up, the lure of planting thousands of annuals from seed is strong. With irresistible sweet shop-style catalogues and endless social-media posts of carts tumbling over with bucketloads of summer blooms, a patch full of breezy annuals feels like a quick, fast-growing floral fix.

For the novice, though, or the slightly unfocussed and disorganised grower, this initial excitement can soon turn to disappointment, if any one part of this process - or the weather - does not go according to plan.

But there's an easier and more sustainable way to ensure you have material to cut year round: a cutting patch of perennial plants will reward you year after year with vasefuls of flowers and foliage. Perennial plants, shrubs and trees tend to be tougher, too, withstanding erratic temperatures or rainfall more readily than annuals. And they require far less maintenance - an annual mulch and prune is all most of these plants need to flourish.

One convert is Rachel Siegfried, author of The Cut Flower Sourcebook: Exceptional Perennials & Woody Plants for Cutting (£35, Filbert Press, from March 23). Not long after she launched Green & Gorgeous, a four-acre flower farm and floral design studio in Oxfordshire, in 2008, she started to note how much more useful, resilient and hard-working her perennial plants were. They had a lighter environmental impact, too; unlike the annuals, they did not require the huge investment of time and resources, but crucially they could often tough out wet or dry conditions.

""By 2018, things had got to the point where it was getting too difficult to rely on annuals as much,"" says Siegfried, whose main business from April until October is growing cut flowers for weddings. She also sells her flowers from her farm shop. 

During one particularly cool and sodden summer she lost entire crops of annual flowers. ""I was finding that the perennials were always the ones that were saving the day for me and I realised that I had to change the way I do things.""

Siegfried began her career in horticulture, designing therapeutic gardens at NHS hospitals around Oxfordshire. At the same time she studied garden design at Pershore College in Worcestershire, where Chris Beardshaw was then a tutor, and he fuelled her passion for plants. Wanting a more hands-on role, she then took a job on a private estate in the Cotswolds, running a beautiful Victorian walled garden for six years, where part of her job was to take bucket-loads of flowers and arrange them for the house.

""I wasn't a florist, I didn't have any training,"" says Siegfried, who had free rein to forage around the estate and incorporated wild foliage, fruit and flowers into her arrangements. ""I got quite creative. I absolutely loved it. I mean, who wouldn't? And that's when I started to see the potential for local and sustainable flowers."" 

Back then there was much talk about the slow food movement, but nothing comparable in the flower world. By the time she set up Green & Gorgeous, the seeds were already sown for an exuberant, seasonal and naturalistic style. And the use of perennial material, that so closely reflects the seasons, is central to it.

Right now, in early spring, a typical arrangement could begin with a framework of emerging cherry plum blossom, branches of Amelanchier lamarckii with its pale star-shaped flowers and delicate coppery leaves, or branches of pussy willow that is cut and then dried to preserve its velvety catkins (with its vigorous growth, it's also a contender for a wind-breaking cutting hedge).

She will then add winter hellebores, which have formed their seed pods (they won't flop at this stage of their lifecycle), and the beautiful nodding Fritillaria uva-vulpis (forced in pots for an earlier harvest), with narcissi and some flamboyant early tulips as focal flowers. ""It's my favourite time of year, maybe because we've waited all winter and it's just such a relief to have flowers,"" says Siegfried. ""You appreciate them more deeply. There's not as much range, but what there is is exquisitely beautiful.""

It's this sense of seasonality that is at the heart of Siegfried's book, which is an intensely practical guide to what and how to grow to provide cutting material year round. The first half of the book details her philosophy and process, with arrangements through each season, while the second half is a guide to her favourite perennial plants, from bulbs and herbaceous perennials though to climbers, grasses, trees and shrubs. While she writes from a commercial standpoint, all the advice works just as effectively for domestic gardeners too.

She started the book in 2020, but since then, the discussion around the environmental impacts of the cut-flower industry has significantly increased; the carbon footprint of imported flowers includes heating, electricity, packaging, transportation and refrigeration, but environmentally, these flowers also come with a heavy chemical cost too, with fertilisers, pesticides and preservatives often used through their growing process.

In 2018, Rebecca Swinn, a student at Lancaster University, carried out postgraduate research on this unseen impact and found that a commercially grown British bouquet would have just 10 per cent of the carbon footprint of imported flowers. 

A local outdoor-grown bouquet would halve that figure again to around 5 per cent. But of course, there is nothing more local and sustainable than growing your own flowers and foliage, with no chemicals necessary, just outside your own door. And then composting your own green waste, once you've enjoyed them in the house.

Many perennial plants and shrubs do take time to mature, but Siegfried believes that, as with the slow food movement, people need to adjust their mindset. ""I think people do need to learn to be a little bit more patient and realise that not everything can be instantaneous,"" she says. ""When you're a gardener, that becomes intrinsic. Waiting three years to be able to pick a peony is not really a big deal."" 

She's equally quick to point to all the perennial plants that will reward you in their first season, too - rudbeckias, achilleas, catananche, agastache, echinacea, gaura, the list goes on.

Her advice to anyone starting out is to get anything that will take time to mature - woody plants, trees, shrubs, climbers - planted first. If you need to create any boundaries in your garden, then creating a cutting hedge will do double-duty, providing foliage, flowers and fruits too - hawthorn, viburnum, euonymus, beech and hornbeam are all useful for cutting in different stages of their growth.

Her other key advice is to treat these plants like a crop and keep them separate from your borders, for ease of maintenance and cutting, but also because, even with the very best intentions, you are unlikely to cut material from a beautiful border.

The other key benefit for Siegfried of using perennials and woody plants for cutting is the unique material that you'd never find commercially. The first emerging lime-green leaves on spring branches, the twisted graceful stems of fruit tree branches from bud to full flower, the winding growth of vines and climbers that bring incredible movement to a vase. All of these are in complete contrast to the straight stems that are sold commercially for ease of shipping. 

Having access to these plants in your own garden also allows you to use a plant at all stages of its life, not just for the prized blooms in one moment. Long before they flower, stalwarts such as Alchemilla mollis, Anthriscus sylvestris ""˜Ravenswing', Thalictrum ""˜Elin' all produce exquisite foliage.

Similarly, after flowering, many perennials are still prized for their autumn fruits (Blackthorn's sloes, crabapple varieties, Berberis gagnepainii ""˜Georgeii' with its clusters of coral berries), seedheads (including Baptisia australis, crocosmia or Dierama pulcherrimum), and autumn colour (Euphorbia schillingii and Amsonia hubrichtii both have fiery autumn foliage).

What all these plants share is a soulful beauty, and with very little effort or cost (both financially and environmentally), they will flourish, bulk up and return each year. Garden gifts that really do keep on giving.

Magnolia x soulangeana 

Once they unfurl their huge velvet pink flowers in spring, a couple of magnolia branches arranged in a small bowl using a Japanese kenzan (flower frog) need no embellishment.

Snowy mespilus 

Amelanchier lamarckii

Can be grown as a small tree, shrub or hedge and flowers early in spring with star-shaped white blooms and the most beautiful emerging copper foliage. Cut when the flowers are still in bud.

Physocarpus opulifolius ""˜Diabolo'

An invaluable shrub with beautiful emerging bronze leaves in spring, followed by pretty white flowers and deep burgundy foliage. The older, woodier stems last longer in a vase.

Flowering currant

Ribes sanguineum 

These currant bushes have pretty, pendulous flowers in white or pink in early spring, followed by scented palmate leaves and exquisite golden autumn leaf colour.

Guelder rose

Viburnum opulus 

A useful, fast-growing shrub or tree, with flowers in spring and lush autumn fruits that can be picked from late summer. ""˜Roseum' has lime-green pom-pom flowers which look wonderful in an arrangement.

Spirea thunbergii 

A florist's stalwart plant with fine arching stems covered in delicate white flowers in spring, followed by feathery foliage in summer, which turns into fiery shades in autumn.

Smoke tree

Cotinus coggygria 

Another vigorous, large shrub or tree prized for its hazy, delicate flower heads. ""˜Grace' has deep amber flowers and foliage, while ""˜Flame' has green leaves and dusty pink flowers.

Mock orange 

Philadelphus ""˜Belle Etoile' or ""˜Enchantment' 

Unlike many of the plants here, the gloriously scented mock orange has just one moment in midsummer, but its delicate flowers are a perfect backdrop to blowsier blooms.

Rubus idaeus ""˜All Gold'

This autumn-fruiting raspberry has a long fruiting season from late summer to early autumn and has wonderful textural foliage, as well as stunning golden fruits that look lush in autumn arrangements.

As a doctor, I find Cambridge University's veganism worrying on many levels

The student union is aiming to remove animal products from its cafÃ©s and canteens - a well-intentioned move, but not the best for everyone

I gather trigger warnings are in at the moment, so here's mine: this article may contain opinions that vegan students find hard to swallow, much like my last brush with a nut burger.

Yesterday we learned that - in response to ""climate and biodiversity crises"" - Cambridge University student union has voted to: ""initiate talks with central catering services about removing all animal products from its cafÃ©s and canteens."" The aim, they say, is to create a sustainable and 100 per cent plant-based menu. Almost three-quarters of students who voted backed the plan. 

As a doctor I find this worrying on many levels. Freedom of choice aside, I'm married to a GP who tells me that she regularly sees young people - especially girls - who have embraced faddy diets, including veganism. As a result, they end up tired, anaemic and underperforming. Is this the outcome we want at one of the world's best universities?

The irony that they've chosen to announce this at a time when some supermarkets are rationing cucumbers, lettuces and tomatoes probably hasn't escaped the majority either.

Nevertheless, many are justifiably more concerned that such basic decisions are being made for them. There's also the gross assumption that a comprehensive vegan diet for all is a good and healthy idea, and automatically addresses the climate biodiversity crises. Clearly the students advocating for this are not studying natural sciences, else they would be better versed in the discoveries of a former Cambridge meat-eating academic and founding father of evolution, Charles Darwin.

I'm paraphrasing, but the insight of this great biologist was that selective pressure from the environment moulds a population to make it the best fit for the space it inhabits. We, and our human ancestors, have been evolving in this way for millions of years. The structures of our teeth, and those of our close animal relatives, speak volumes on this, telling us that we are adapted to consume a range of foodstuffs, including meat, and not just nuts, quorn and quinoa. 

Consequently, our bodies rely on some sources of micronutrients that we just cannot get in reliable quantities from non-animal sources. So eschewing a whole raft of foodstuffs that we are genetically dependent upon is like feeding tofu to a tiger and expecting it to lap it up and be happy and healthy. It won't.

Let's take a related example of a way in which fighting against our genes has significant and well documented health consequences. With a few exceptions - most of them probably students - humans are generally not nocturnal. We wake up when it gets light and we go to sleep when it gets dark. But some jobs dictate that we work night shifts, essentially fighting against what our genes have programmed us to do. The result: higher levels of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, stroke and heart attacks, as well as breast cancer, among regular shift workers.

This is obviously an extreme example, and I'm not saying that going vegan carries all these risks, but eating what is a grossly unnatural diet is most certainly not risk-free. Yes, the majority of us in the West probably do eat a bit too much meat, but many who launch themselves down the vegan dietary track unwittingly become deficient in a range of key vitamins and iron, potentially robbing their cognitive and physical performance. 

There are also the more nuanced arguments over whether a vegan menu really is better for the environment. Done wrong, it can be worse for the planet than serving up roast chicken, because the carbon footprints of much of the plant produce we pick up in the supermarket to make meals less monotonous can vary enormously. Just because it's plant-based doesn't make it ""˜green'. Crops are forced out of season in heated greenhouses. The water footprint of many common, popular plant foodstuffs is also shocking and environmentally destructive: avocados can require up to 140 litres of water per kilo to grow. Crop yields are also sustained by fertilisers that have significant carbon costs attached, and some plant food items have more air miles under their belts by the time they end up on your plate than Prince Andrew. 

So while considering our impact on the environment is a laudable and essential aim, virtue-signalling knee-jerk diktats controlling cafeteria menus may cost the Earth in other ways, and not just because of the quinoa.  

Fortunately, the student union plan doesn't include the dining halls of individual colleges. And if the queues at the kebab van on the Market Square, and the greasy spoon near Trinity College are anything to go by, I'm sceptical of the true depth of feeling among the student body. For now, Cambridge meat-eaters can probably relax.

How the multi-billion dollar vegan bubble finally burst

Consumer tastes are changing - but is this really the end for ""˜fake meat' substitutes?

The year began so optimistically. Veganuary was hailed a triumph with record numbers signing up all over the world - only the Vatican City and North Korea were missing from the list of countries where people committed to a meat-free start to the year. 

Pope Francis famously loves a steak, so that was chalked up to a win. It was to be the year when our eating habits would shift, driven by a cost-of-living crisis that was sending meat and dairy prices soaring, coupled with a pressure to eat with one eye on the planet. By March, the plant-based picture was looking altogether less rosy. 

First, NestlÃ© announced it was withdrawing its vegan ranges Garden Gourmet and Wunda from sale in the UK, saying the products were simply ""not viable"". In May, it was the turn of British sausage company Heck, which announced it was reducing its range of meat-free products, citing a lack of consumer appetite.

Most of its vegan sausages and burgers were shelved, with co-founder Jamie Keeble declaring shoppers were just ""not there yet"" when it came to buying vegan. And Heck weren't the only ones.

Analysis by The Grocer showed the number of meat-alternative lines on sale in Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrisons and Waitrose fell 10.9 per cent in the 26 weeks to March 20. 

Further signs the meat-free boom was beginning to trail off came in June, when Meatless Farms stopped trading and let staff go (though they were later acquired by a plant-based company). Then came the big one: Beyond Meat.

Launched in 2012 with investment from Bill Gates and Kim Kardashian, Beyond Meat was the original meat-free fast food brand, providing the plant-based options for McDonald's and KFC. It was on the Nasdaq exchange by 2019, by which point the meat-free market was beginning to grow.

Four years later, in August this year, the company announced sales had fallen by almost a third, blaming ""softer demand in the plant-based meat category"". 

The appetite for meat alternatives had, it seemed, slumped. News outlets, including this one, declared the vegan bubble officially burst. 

According to Heather Mills, the ""gaslighting"" meat and dairy industries are to blame for the great fake meat flop. Mills, who once declared she was going to turn the North East into the ""Silicon Valley of plant-based foods"", is the latest in a long line of meat-free casualties in 2023.

As the vegan business she founded in the '90s, VBites, prepared to file for administration this week, she criticised the industries whose campaigns she accused of both ""insulting lactose-intolerant people"" and sowing ""seeds of doubt in consumers who deserve to know the truth"". 

One interpretation of ""the truth"" might simply be that the fake meat experiment has flopped. 

Plant-based meats should be booming in Britain - government figures show we are eating less meat at home now than we have done since 1974. And yet, it seems that four years after the market swelled with meatless burger brands, our tastes never quite caught up. 

When it came to it, many of us didn't actually want to swap our sausages for vegan alternatives, our beef burgers for beetroot, our chicken nuggets for tempeh. In fact, the latest Kantar data shows the past year has seen a nine per cent drop in fake meat sales in Britain. 

Why? It's partly because consumers never quite got on board with the idea that fake meat was really going to be healthier for them than the real thing. This year's annual Waitrose Food & Drink Report revealed how an increased understanding of the risks of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) has led some to ""turn away"" from mock meats and fish, ""prompting manufacturers to ditch lines that aren't selling"". 

Rather than seeking out imitation chicken packed with flavourings to make it taste as close to the real thing as possible, consumers now want plants to look and taste like plants. ""We're noticing a shift towards more natural plant-based ranges,"" says Catherine Shadlock, a vegan buyer at Waitrose. 

Gabriela Peacock, a nutritionist who counts Princess Beatrice and Dame Joan Collins among her clients, says attitudes towards meat replacements are changing. Peacock is ""generally quite negative"" about fake meats.

""Generally, they are made from a lot of additives and some fake proteins - it's very far from a natural vegan diet and from plant-based foods."" 

A meat-free chicken nugget is no healthier than a regular one, she says. ""It's extremely processed. Also it can be quite bland. If you're faking the chicken you need to get the flavour from somewhere. [...] There will be a lot of e-numbers and flavourings and sugars."" 

A rise in the popularity of protein-rich diets has led to a change in how people feel about meat, says Peacock, who has seen a shift away from plant-based lifestyles and back towards meat eating among her clients.

""It's completely turning around. It's been very popular to be vegetarian or vegan - [now] I can see quite a big turn. People do understand that actually meat is really not that bad if it's from good sources. 

""Now, I see a lot of clients that were vegetarian are now going back to having a steak once a week, because it's very hard to maintain the protein intake. You become tired. Protein is absolutely essential. If you're a vegan and you don't want to eat processed food, you have to eat a lot of lentils."" 

For many consumers, cost has been a factor too. ""Some vegan mimics can be more expensive than the real thing, which has deterred non-vegan shoppers who just want to eat less meat and a few more plants,"" says Shadlock. For others, it's a matter of taste.

Received wisdom in 2018 was that if you were going to give up burgers, you'd want your plant-based alternative to still bleed like a cow. For some, that was borne out; others realised they would really rather a chickpea looked like a chickpea, a soybean like a soybean, not a minced hunk of meat. 

But for all the changes in consumer tastes, experts suggest this isn't necessarily the end for fake meat (Waitrose say the bubble is ""maturing"" rather than burst) - in fact, some say a dip like this was on the cards all along. 

Andy Shovel, founder of plant-based meat brand THIS, says this is par for the course with ""any new and emerging category"". ""It happened with craft beer when craft beer went crazy a few years ago. It happened with smoothies in the late '00s. It happened with coconut water. 

""What tends to happen is you get an over-proliferation of brands, where everyone is like ooh craft beer this is cool we're going to pile into this. You tend to get consumer demand remaining relatively stable but then loads of brands drop out because the market consolidates around the best-quality brands and products, like Brewdog with craft beer, or Vita Coco with coconut water."" 

Shovel says in his sector, when companies like Beyond Meat and Oatly achieved IPO, they had ""very high valuations"". ""Valuations that were completely detached from the fundamentals of the business. So it did set the bar pretty high for investors. And I think that's been a challenge for the category to meet those expectations from investors."" 

Sales at his own company are 50 per cent up year on year, though after four years they are not yet profitable (they hope to be by the end of next year). Does he see the conversation around UPFs as posing a risk to companies like his, which make processed meat alternatives like plant-based bacon (made out of soya protein, pea protein and vegetable extracts among other things)?

""Only as much as it does sliced bread companies,"" says Shovel, who feels the UPF debate lacks nuance. ""A consumer doesn't know when they go to the supermarket whether their pasta is less or more bad than cupcakes or sliced bread. 

""It's completely insane to have a binary debate about that, it produces no guidance to the customer at all that they can practically use."" Instead, he argues, the UPF debate leaves consumers feeling they're ""not allowed anything apart from vegetables"", which isn't really how anyone shops or eats. 

But while there might be a fight to the death playing out between the UPF naysayers and the plant-based devotees, there is also a sense among experts that meat-free brands have missed the mark when it comes to branding. 

Lindsay Gorton-Lee, a brand strategy consultant at Kantar, points out that only seven per cent of meat-free buyers identify as vegan. Rather than casting consumers who don't buy fake meat as being vegan-avoidant, or suggesting people are just ""not there yet"" when it comes to meat-free alternatives, these companies should be aiming their branding at a broader church. 

""Are enough brands really stepping up to the plate and delivering the right mix of value, health, taste and sustainability to match appetites?"" she asks. 

Very few meat-free brands are ""meaningful"" to consumers yet, says Gorton-Lee. ""There was a boom in 2019 and there are now a number of players in the market and what we [can see] is there is a range of equity - not all of these new brands have built equity yet in consumers' minds."" 

Young brands are all ""vying for share"", she says. Meanwhile, Kantar data reveals that when it comes to plant-based food, our tastes are pretty old-fashioned - three of the biggest meat-free brands in Britain are still Quorn, Linda McCartney and Birds Eye.

""The established brands are really strong. [""¦] When you look at the power of those brands there is a really long tail in terms of the equity they have built."" 

There are ""opportunities still to be met"" though, she says. Kantar's research shows people want ""health and convenience"" from their meat-free products. ""People are looking for those incremental benefits,"" she says, urging alternative meat companies to focus on ""what they are bringing as a brand"", rather than making assumptions about what people want. 

Would a new meat-free brand launching next year have a chance? ""Absolutely,"" says Gorton-Lee. ""If they can get it right before they are delisted.""

There's a challenge to the fake meat founders for 2024.

Jo Wood on gardening: ""˜A surprise diagnosis opened my eyes to all the chemicals in food'

From making her own honey to growing avocados, the former model is no stranger to a new challenge

The entrepreneur and ex-wife of Rolling Stones rocker Ronnie Wood on the joy of going off-grid and being in touch with nature.

Where do you live?

I live in Northamptonshire, near Silverstone, in a place I saw online four years ago. The property was being sold as an off-grid farmhouse and I'd dreamed of going off-grid. I loved the idea of being self-sufficient, not only growing my own food, but having my own heat, electricity and water supply. This was it! It came with six acres, old sheds and barns ripe for conversion. The land was barren and there was no garden, but it meant I could do things my way. After my divorce from Ronnie in 2011, I'd been living in central London, so it was a huge change.

What did you have to do to get the house and garden up and running?

I moved into the house in November 2019, and in those first few weeks, the water ran out, the solar panels didn't work, the electrics were dodgy, and the generator for heat and light broke down. I sat in the kitchen and said to myself: ""I've made such a terrible mistake."" But slowly, I found the right people to help me turn things around. A modern generator was installed, new solar panels fitted and, after locating an underground water supply, an engineer drilled a hole nearly 300ft down to provide me with my own water. It was expensive, but from then on, I'd have no more bills.

What were your plans for the garden?

One of the first things I did was to plant 70 trees, including willow, oak and apple. But my priority that first spring was to build raised beds for growing organic fruit and veg. Of course, four months after I moved in, the country went into lockdown; but with my son Tyrone and my daughter Leah and her family, we were all in the same bubble, so I got cracking and they helped me. Within no time, we'd sown everything from potatoes to pumpkins, with nasturtiums and calendula for colour. The house itself was already covered with climbing roses, so I planted lavender, rosemary and other scented herbs and flowers beneath.

Why did you become so passionate about growing organic food?

I met Ronnie in 1977, when I was just 22. At that point, I had my son Jamie and he had his son Jesse. We had Leah and Tyrone together and got married in 1985. Then in 1990, I got ill and was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. I was on steroids; I was miserable. Then someone who'd read about my illness told me to cut out processed foods and go organic - veg, fruit, meat, the lot. With nothing to lose, I did. Four months later, I felt fantastic. But I got ill again. This time, I found out I didn't have Crohn's, I had a perforated appendix. Doctors were amazed I was still alive. I recovered, but my eyes were opened to all the chemicals in food, so I became even more obsessed with organic.

How did your family react to your organic obsession?

Ronnie thought I was mad and the family banned me from using the word ""organic"". But I was on a mission. The only thing I didn't have was a garden big enough to grow my own food. It was when we went to stay at Ronnie's house in Kildare, in Ireland, that I got my first taste of growing organic veg. I loved it. In fact, one year we had such a huge crop of potatoes, I put a load in a suitcase, took them to a Stones gig in Paris and asked their chef if he'd cook them. Keith Richards turned to me and said: ""The trouble with you, darling, is that you're addicted to organic."" Actually, Keith's wife, Patti, has a veg garden in Connecticut. She gets it!

What other projects have you focused on in your new home?

One thing my kids were excited about was creating a wild swimming pond. It was part of my plan to rewild a huge section of the land that I'd already scattered with native wildflower seeds, such as red clover, cowslip, ragged robin and oxeye daisy. Tyrone took charge. He had the pond dug out and lined with local clay, and once we'd filled it with water, Leah, who now lives with her family up the road, helped me get started with aquatic plants such as water hawthorn, spearwort, lilies and yellow flag iris. By the second year, they all went mad. Glorious! It came alive with wildlife and watching birds fly in and out was magical.

Did you have a garden as a child?

Mum was from South Africa. She met Dad, who was from Devon, on a train. He was an architectural model maker and, after the war, he worked for Essex council on the model for a new town called Basildon. When it was completed, the council gave him a new council house and as soon as we moved in, Mum wanted chickens and an avocado tree - no one ate avocados back then. She also grew medicinal herbs; she was a huge believer in feverfew, an old remedy for fevers, and mullein, which is great for coughs. She's inspired me to create a medicinal herb garden here. I might even grow avocados!

Do you think gardening is good for your mind as well as the body?

More and more, I find it's so important to be outside, to soak up natural light, be in touch with nature, to feel the earth on my skin. In the summer, I often go around barefoot. Other times, there's nothing like the simplicity of sitting under a tree and just soaking it all in. Trees are such amazing things. In 2016, I bought a little house with two acres in the hills of Murcia, in Spain, and filled it with fruit trees - pomegranate, fig, orange, lemon and olive. It's my little getaway.

What's your next project in the garden?

I have so many plans and one of them is to have a whole field of lavender. It would be so beautiful and I could get someone to harvest it. And now that we've got wildflowers, I also want to make my own honey. The bees will have a feast. Jamie's also been studying the health benefits of supplements made from mushrooms and wants to start growing them, while Tyrone has converted old sheds into a bar and a play area for the kids. I've now got 10 grandchildren, so they have the best time here.  

What have been the biggest challenges to going off-grid?

In the early days, I'd often have to stick on my wellies and go out in the rain in the middle of the night because the lights hadn't come on or the hot water was like ice. Now, I've replaced everything and there's an app on my phone that tells me if the generator's on and how much heat I'm getting from my solar panels. It's other things that give me grief. Rabbits. One morning, I came out to all these holes and half-eaten muddy carrots. The audacity! But mud or no mud, I haven't given up my glamorous life altogether. I still swap my wellies and woolly hat for heels and sequins sometimes. I've got the best of both worlds.

More from The Telegraph

Is having three dogs really as bad as flying on a private jet?

The environmental impact of pet ownership has come under scrutiny. Can your canines' emissions be off-set?

Where once my life was filled with books and art and writing, even a bit of travelling, there is now wet fur and noses, jabbing paws, thumping tails and barely any travelling because who-will-look-after-the-bloody-dogs? 

I have to admit to the following: I spend an insane amount of time with beings that bark. And there are three of them, an eccentric trio comprising mother and daughter labradoodles called Margot and Panda, aged 6 and 2, and a disobedient, imperious five-year-old pug called Mog who should be up the sleeve of a Chinese emperor rather slumming it in Somerset with me.

They rule me, not vice versa, and they all seem to be over-attached. But I love them. They have, at various times and often simultaneously, fulfilled the role of GCSE and A level therapy dogs, guard dogs, botherers of DPD delivery drivers and, of course, best friends.

Last week I shelled out £649 for one to have an infected ear de-fluffed under a general anaesthetic and the other to have antibiotics after sustaining a neck wound during boisterous play. Vaccinations this week came to more than £300.

Haircuts for the doodles reached £135, a new high - or low. And just as the battered debit card was going back in my purse, I was asked without irony ""˜Might the pug like a scale and polish?'.

I am the scraggy handmaid to these pets, ungroomed and wild while they prance around with good teeth and hair. My pug is much like the pampered dog Snookums on The Muppets, and next time I'll be asked ""Would Miss Margot like a copy of Vanity Fair to read while having her mani and pedi?' 

All this is karmic punishment for my stupidity at having three dogs in the first place, because I now learn that they impact not only on my budget but my conscience too. 

Patrick Hansen, chief executive of airline firm Luxaviation, recently told a Luxury summit in Monaco that three medium-sized dogs - more or less my dogs, give or take a smaller pug - emit the same carbon as flying once on a private jet every year. 

So in other words, if I ditched my furry jailors I could become Shiv Roy who, of course, is dog-free if the last season of Succession is anything to go by. 

Hansen took his figures from data in How Bad Are Bananas: The Carbon Footprint of Everything, by Prof Mike Berners-Lee, who calculated that an average-sized dog emitted 770kg of carbon each year compared to 310kg for a cat. Multiply 770kg by three and you have a flight on a private jet, or so Mr Hansen argued.

I have a healthy environmental conscience. I don't eat meat. I have, to the best of my ability, succeeded in immunising my teens against fast fashion and single-use plastic. I recycle. I shop on eBay while they buy from Depop.

We all frequent charity shops and I valiantly try to mend clothes that seem to have had the life thumped out of them by my 12-year-old son. I try to travel by train. Long-haul flights require a lot of reasoning.

Every time I see a cow, which is a lot in Somerset, I imagine great clouds of carbon being emitted from their rear ends and congratulate myself smugly. But I have never once considered the carbon pawprint of my dogs. Is there nothing in the world that's immune from angst? 

So I bought How Bad Are Bananas and then read in horror that Prof Berners-Lee had also said, factoring in the CO2 emissions from running day-to-day vet practices, ""˜you can also add something like 15kg CO2e for every £100 you spend at the vet.' 

He had the good grace to add ""˜and, from experience, don't underestimate what you could be letting yourself in for.' Given that I'd hit a four-figure spend in vet's bills in just two weeks, I had already reached 150kg. 

I messaged my fellow dog lover Evan Davis, presenter of Radio Four's PM programme and proud owner of the whippet Mr Whippy (who, being an ""˜only' dog has a lower carbon pawprint): ""˜Evan! Help. How are you managing with this news?' 

""˜I occasionally worry about Mr Whippy's carbon pawprint,' he soothed. ""˜But what can you do? He doesn't have a car, he doesn't turn up the heating. He can't really change his habits because all he does is eat, sleep, play and poo. If he's an environmental problem, it's his mere existence that is the cause of it, not his reckless disregard of the planet. 

""˜But who am I to say he shouldn't exist? I always feel animals have a certain entitlement to space on our planet - in the wild, or in our lives. So I feel the onus is on us to make sure we don't behave recklessly.'

Hmm, it is a little uncomfortable contemplating whether three dogs falls into the ""˜reckless' category. I put their weights into an online carbon pawprint calculator and came up with 755.77kgs carbon emissions per year for Margot, 377.89 per year for the pug and 577.94kg per year for Panda. So big dogs really are worse than little dogs. Prof Berners-Lee's data, for example, confirms a Great Dane is 2,500kg a year while a goldfish is 25kg.

It was with some trepidation that I then got in touch with author and researcher on carbon footprinting Prof Berners-Lee (brother of Tim, inventor of the internet) who happens to be the proud owner of a soft-coated Wheaten Terrier called Maisy who weighs in around the 10kg mark and is very efficient in limiting travel for the Berners-Lee family:

""˜It's so funny to hear that my book got used to defend private air travel,' he says, ""˜and by somebody who hasn't read the book, because what I do say is that the best thing about having a pet is that it makes it so much harder to fly away on holiday!' ""˜Yes, that's me!' I told him.'

""˜And,' he continued, ""˜the numbers from Luxaviation are suspiciously low. It looks to me as if he is talking about a very small jet on a very small flight and probably not including a mark-up factor for high altitude effects.'

But still, what of the environmental impact of having a pet? Since the start of the pandemic, 3.2 million households in the UK acquired a pet, bringing the total up to 17 million homes. The Pet Food Manufacturers Association reports there are now 34 million pets in the UK, 12m dogs, 12m cats and 3.2m small animals.

""˜It's all about their food and how much they eat and the fact that it is meat-based. The plastic poo bags are pretty nasty if they are non-biodegradable, but from a carbon point of view, it's the meat dogs eat and the calculation is based on their size. And it's contentious whether or not it is okay to put a dog on a vegetarian diet because their short digestive tracts aren't cut out for vegetables'. 

Prof Berners-Lee had some further advice, this time for the soul: stay away from offers advertising Pet Carbon Offset to try to assuage your guilt. 

""˜When you do something that has a carbon footprint, you need to own it. You need to be able to say ""I think this is worth it. This means so much to me that I'm doing it."" That is honest and that is between you and your conscience. 

""˜You can't off-set it. Off-setting is a dubious concept at the best of times. If you have an unnecessary carbon footprint, there is nothing you can do to un-do the damage. But what I would say is that if owning pets stops your family from going on long-haul flights on holiday, that is actually a net saving.

""˜The other thing is that you don't want to over-feed the dog or cat. It's not good for the dog and you do want to keep your dog fit. Fit animals have more efficient metabolisms and actually that means they need less food. So give your dog a proper walk every day and don't over feed them. It will be better for them, cheaper for you and much lower carbon-wise. And think about the food too, keeping it basic and simple and leaning towards the dry stuff. What they don't need is all this super dainty posh stuff.'

With this, Prof Berners-Lee puts to bed an on-going, shall we say, ""˜issue' in my house. My husband is obsessed with keeping the dogs' weight down. Perhaps because they are so badly trained (by me), I assume they live in a state of permanent starvation. But now I know. Their streamlined physiques are good for the planet.

In the UK, statistics suggest that 51 per cent of dogs and 44 per cent of cats are obese. Only recently, a vet told my husband that the pug was ""˜pleasingly slim'. He relayed this news like he'd won the lottery.

So can I ""˜own' the carbon pawprint x3? I can and I will. My dogs have given my family hours of free companionship and therapy. We love them. But I won't have three again. I also take away something rather useful. There really is no excuse for missing a daily walk - teens, I'm talking to you! 

And also, miraculously, when it comes to pet food, the dried, less meat-based stuff is really much better than anything else on sale in the doggy deli.

Why you should never keep milk in the door of your fridge

As Marks & Spencer takes use by dates off its milk experts offer timely advice on how to stop it from going off

Householders have been warned to avoid putting milk in the door of the fridge if they want to keep it fresher for longer.

This week, Marks & Spencer became the latest supermarket to remove use-by dates on their milk, to encourage people not to throw it away too soon.

Dairy farmer Ceri Cryer, of Brinkworth Dairy, in Wilts, warned that there were too much milk is being thrown away each year and advised shoppers to place their bottles in the back of the fridge to keep them fresher.

About 490 million pints of milk are wasted in the UK per year, according to the Sustainable Food Trust.

Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Ms Cryer said: ""You've got to make sure that when you're taking it home after purchasing it that you're keeping it cold, putting it with other cold produce.

""You need to put it in the main part of the fridge at the back and not in the front of the fridge, in the door of the fridge which is the warmest part of the fridge. And once you've used your milk, put the lid on straight away and get it back in the drive as quickly as possible and don't drink from the bottle.""

Attitudes differ on whether milk should be kept in the fridge door.

Telegraph food writer Xanthe Clay recommends that cream, yoghurt and cream cheese, such as mascarpone, should be stored in the main compartment as they are usually kept for longer, but said that milk tends to be used quickly before it has time to spoil.

Manufacturers, meanwhile, said that while it was true older fridges tend to be cooler on the inner shelves, more modern fridges have temperature-controlled compartments which maintain more consistent cooling.

Sam O'Connor, head of product management for domestic appliances at Samsung UK, said: ""It's not a myth - in a lot of conventional fridges, temperatures can vary. This means some foods are at greater risk of perishing prematurely if they're stored in the wrong place. 

""People shouldn't have to put up with that - especially given the rising cost of food.

""It's why we've invested so heavily in research and development to solve these problems. The crucial thing to remember is that not all fridges are equal. The secret is to have a fridge that cools each compartment independently to maintain consistent and optimum temperature and humidity.""

However, if your milk has clotted, has a yellow hue to it, or fails a sniff and taste test all is not lost - as even sour milk could still be used in cooking.

""It will still make amazing American pancakes,"" suggested Ms Cryer.

The strange story of a polar bear, a farm in Suffolk and Jamie Oliver's best friend

It would be easy to be cynical about polar bears in Suffolk - but Jimmy Doherty believes wildlife parks have a role to play in conservation

Picture the largest polar bear reserve in Europe.

It is not in the northernmost reaches of Finland or the snowy Alps but, in fact, in Suffolk - the surprising pet project of farmer and television presenter Jimmy Doherty, best known for the BBC series Jimmy's Farm, and for presenting various other series with Jamie Oliver, his childhood friend.

A polar bear in flat, green Suffolk, with the mainline train to London Liverpool Street rumbling along the horizon every half hour or so, is an incongruous sight. It's hardly the Arctic tundra. 

But polar bears were never part of Doherty's plan. This was a rescue mission.

A year and a half ago, Doherty, 48, received a call to say a wildlife park - Orsa Rovdjurspark (Predator Park) in central Sweden - was closing down. It had been sold to developers and the animals needed to be rehomed by a certain date or they would be put down.

""Amongst those animals was a group of polar bears - among them, Ewa, a female who was 18 years old""¦ it was very unlikely she could be rehomed,"" he says. ""I never wanted those conventional animals you see [in zoos], like tigers, or polar bears. But here I am."" 

On the edge of his eponymous farm and wildlife park, which is already home to paddocks of sheep, cows, goats, capybaras, tapirs and camels and more than 90 other species, there is a high fence.

Concealed from public view (until later this month) sits a newly built 16-acre enclosure with deep springs and woodland, confirmed by the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (Eaza) to be Europe's largest. Sat in the middle of her new home is Ewa, face turned to the sky, sniffing the air.

So far, Doherty has discovered that Ewa's favourite food is honey and she particularly likes rolling in bark chippings, but he isn't trying to pretend polar bears are cute and cuddly.

""She likes a bit of love, but you can never forget that this is a wild animal and the planet's largest [land] predator,"" he says. 

Doherty, with his reputation for rescuing exotic species as varied as racoons and macaques, got the call as a last-ditch attempt to save Ewa. Initially, he says, he was ""terrified"" of rehoming the world's largest land-based carnivore in an enclosure - albeit a very large one - just two miles from the suburbs of Ipswich. 

His wife, Michaela ""thought we were crazy,"" he says. They have four daughters and live nearby. ""She had nightmares""¦ [she] envisioned the idea of waking up and there being a polar bear in the garden. That's what you think, isn't it. What if it gets out?"" 

But he couldn't bear the thought of Ewa being put down. ""That was the main thing. But out of that, we didn't just want an enclosure with a polar bear, it had to tell a bigger story. That's why we rehomed the Arctic wolves - we're telling the story of the tundra,"" he says.

""I've always thought if you can do something, you should do something, rather than going, that's too much work, I can't be bothered."" 

Ewa's 1,000-mile journey from Orsa with a specialist courier took her through Sweden by road, to Germany by ferry, and then to England via Le Shuttle [Eurotunnel] to Folkestone. 

But when she arrived, tragedy struck. Doherty had planned to rehome her two-year-old cub, Miki, with her, but she died in transit, fuelling a small group of vocal ""naysayers"" (as Doherty calls them) who have argued that rehoming the bears in Suffolk is unwise.

""We did an autopsy pretty much immediately, three vets have verified it""¦ unfortunately unbeknownst to us, she had an enlarged heart and could have died at any moment,"" he says. ""You just want to pull your hair out""¦ but it's one of those things.""

We are here to discuss polar bears, but there is an elephant in the room. Is it sensible, or indeed responsible, to have a polar bear best suited to an icy environment in Suffolk, where average temperatures are 20C-23C in summer?

On this point, Doherty is well prepared. ""From afar, it's easy to [cast] aspersions. But when you look at the details, you understand this bear has no other option,"" he says. Ewa has lived her entire life in a wildlife park - if she were released into the wild, says Doherty, she wouldn't last long as she would likely be killed by a rival and has no hunting skills.

Several experts were consulted on the viability of keeping polar bears in Suffolk's temperate climate. ""In 2018, in Churchill, Manitoba, the polar bear capital of the world, it was 31C. Polar bears aren't always on the ice,"" says Douglas Richardson, the zoological consultant who alerted Doherty to the closure of Predator Park.

""I've worked with polar bears in zoos all over the world and I've seen them out on hot days. This idea that they can't cope with a warmer climate [is incorrect]. They cope very well - it's not a problem."" 

The Highland Wildlife park has successfully housed polar bears since 2009. ""We [also] looked at Yorkshire Wildlife Park - they have polar bears and their temperature range is very similar to ours,"" says Doherty.

""We probably have more sunlight hours than they do, and they probably have a bit more rain. But average summer temperatures were one degree different. We looked at Hudson Bay, Canada, where you find them in the wild, and summer temperatures are 25C. 

""We're fairly confident we can provide a home that's agreeable - it's not like where you see polar bears in Mexico Zoo or Singapore Zoo. So long as we give them the areas where they can regulate their temperature and cool themselves down, they're absolutely fine."" Ultimately, for Ewa, it is better than the alternative: ""I can live with that because I know the bear hasn't been shot."" 

It would be easy to be cynical about the fact that Ewa will be a visitor attraction, but underpinning this mission is Doherty's long-held belief that modern wildlife parks and zoos have an important role to play in the conservation of endangered species - a belief that is now officially recognised. 

In a ""position statement"" released earlier this month, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) said it ""proudly recognizes and applauds the significant contributions made by botanic gardens, aquariums, and zoos in their critical mission of conserving wild animals."" 

Doherty doesn't call Jimmy's Farm a zoo - ""We're a wildlife park, because we have a lot of space, and we don't have so many animals,"" he says - but he is broadly in favour of them. ""I think people have got to look at the conservation [work] zoos do, and the access they provide to amazing species that are so inspirational."" 

Tundras are among the world's harshest and least hospitable areas, characterised by low temperatures and little rainfall, and they are under threat as the permafrost melts as a result of rising temperatures.

""Everyone talks about the rainforest disappearing, and the loss of biodiversity""¦ but there is a huge environment that spans North America all the way across the top of Eurasia - the tundra - that is disappearing so quickly because of climate change."" 

The first arrival to the new exhibit, named The Lost Lands of the Tundra, was a pack of 13 Arctic wolves rehomed from Cumbria Wildlife Park last month. They needed to be kept a secret from visitors and dog walkers on the nearby footpath while they settled in. ""A lot guessed""¦ but some people said giraffes,"" says Doherty.

Some passing train passengers assumed they were an unusual breed of sheep, he says. He didn't correct them. The wolves will be joined in the park by Arctic foxes and the farm's resident herd of reindeer, as well as more polar bears ""by the end of this year or the beginning of next year"".

Word has got out. As we make our way across the park, a regular visitor with a buggy exclaims: ""Polar bears! Really? I thought that was just a drunken story.""

The reserve - which has cost £800,000 so far - stretches out below us from what will be the public viewing area. It has been well thought out, with multiple ""homes"" and hiding places for Ewa and whichever bears end up joining her, plus six acres of woodland with ""lots of deadfall and trees [Ewa] can break up and sniff around""¦ and smell the squirrels and the bluebells.""

It has been designed with high and low areas, which is ""not only about the sight, it's all about the olfactory stimulus""¦ all the smells coming in"".

It also contains two coldwater springs, one 14 metres deep and one 8 metres deep, which is important for the bear's temperature regulation. There is a secure bark enclosure and a saltwater bath (""like a spa,"" says Doherty) and three interconnected areas through which the different animals can roam.

He plans to introduce a ""carbon classroom"" to ""explain the things we can all do to help mitigate climate change""¦ I don't mean glue yourself to walls and placards and stuff,"" he adds, referring to climate activist groups Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil. ""Just simple stuff, like turning the lights off, and what we do about food waste.""

Doherty studied zoology and was working on a PHD in entomology when he decided to try his hand at farming rare pig breeds in Suffolk. He moved to Wherstead, Ipswich, as a 24-year-old and set up the The Essex Pig Company on the site of Jimmy's Farm, which is now home to the wildlife park, a restaurant and farm shop.

It is a challenging time for British farmers, he says - the sector is in ""flux"" with the pressures of rising costs, climate change, and the shift in agricultural policy post-Brexit. ""I'm bored of people creating models and pontificating and never getting a bit of dirt under their fingernails,"" he says.

""I hate the idea of someone saying farming""¦ is destroying the world. I'm like, ""˜Are you an idiot?' We all eat three times a day. The idea that a plant-based diet is going to save the world is, for me, complete nonsense. We forget that it's an urban elite luxury to be plant-based. I'd much rather focus on local, mixed farming."" 

And bears, of course. The next step is to rehome a European brown bear, Diego, who Doherty visited in Sweden, ""before it's too late. That's a complicated one because we need to move him before he goes into hibernation, and we've got to find somewhere to put him so he can sleep through the winter,"" he says. 

""My wife said: ""˜No more bears! We've got no money left. You've just taken a massive loan out,'"" says Doherty. ""But it's like going into any animal sanctuary and there's that one dog left waiting for adoption that seems to say, ""˜What about me?'"" He couldn't resist.

Ignore the French. This is the reason we should all be eating horsemeat

To some it's outdated, to others it's taboo... the French are saying nay to the high-protein, low-fat dish, but should we take up the reins?

Paris may be the city of love but in Lyon, France's self-styled Capitale de la Gastronomie, it is the stomach and not the heart that governs the emotions. My lunch spot, however, is not one of the city's 20 Michelin-starred restaurants or a historic bouchon hidden down a Renaissance-era alleyway in Vieux Lyon. Instead I'm on a workaday street near the rugby stadium in the city's rough-around-the-edges southern 7th arrondissement, following a tip from Pierre Koffmann, the former chef-patron of three-Michelin-starred La Tante Claire in London. And rather than sampling Lyon's world-renowned charcuterie I am here to try a delicacy that one will not find for sale in the famed market hall of Les Halles de Lyon Paul Bocuse: horsemeat.

Carnegie Hall - the ""˜g' is pronounced softly, as in ""˜gee-gees' - is the sort of off-the-beaten-track restaurant that Francophiles dream about when they picture ""˜la France profonde': rugby shirts framed on the wall, Kronenbourg on tap at the bar and not a word of English being spoken at tables that are impressively busy for a Monday lunchtime. There is cÃ´te de bÅ“uf and pot-au-feu, escargots and tÃªte de veau. And, down in one corner of the menu, there is ""˜Le cheval de chez John Robert', the Lyon-based butcher who supplies meat to the dwindling number of restaurants in France that still serve horse.

I start with horse tartare, a chunky puck of brick-red raw mince flecked here and there with onion and scattered with parsley. There is squeezy Dijon mustard on the table by way of seasoning but the rich meat is good enough to eat without any further adornment, silkily textured and with an almost milky flavour. My waiter tells me that the restaurant sells 100 plates of horse a day and that tenderloin is the most popular cut. I can see why: the crimson meat is soft as velvet and tastes both sweet and minerally, with a nutty finish that is quite distinct from beef.

John and his brother Jim supply Carnegie Hall with 60kg of horsemeat a week. Their wholesale business, Profil Export, and its retail website steakapapa.com, was founded by their father, Claude, 57 years ago after his grandmother got him a job in the horse butcher's where she sold parsley. Only 10 per cent of the 200 horse carcasses that pass through their facility each week are destined for France, however; most are exported to Switzerland and Italy.

For the French have largely lost their appetite for horse. According to Interbev, the national livestock and meat association, the French eat 80 per cent less horse than they did in the 1970s, consuming the equivalent of 290g a year per head. In 2019, horsemeat represented less than one per cent of all fresh butcher's meat purchased in France, compared to 23 per cent for pork and 22 per cent for beef.

Profil Export supplies just 10 restaurants in France, and none in Paris. The Robert brothers' final client in the French capital, Le Taxi Jaune, shut two years ago. Chef Otis Lebert caused a sensation on the Paris dining scene serving the likes of cured horse sausage, horse brain and horse heart with shallot butter and red wine but says he closed the restaurant after becoming disillusioned by the gentrification of the Marais. ""˜The 3rd arrondissement used to be more cosmopolitan but now it looks like everywhere else,' he says. ""˜It's all burgers in Paris these days. My cuisine is more traditional French.'

Gentrification is not the only reason for abandoning a meat that is low in fat and rich in iron and vitamins. ""˜Overall there are fewer butchers in France,' Jim Robert says. ""˜But it's also become difficult to buy horsemeat after some supermarkets stopped selling it after the scandal of 2013. We lost 10 per cent of our business.'

The scandal revealed a shocking lack of traceability in the European food supply chain. Ireland's Food Safety Authority raised the alarm in January 2013 after traces of equine DNA were discovered in frozen beefburgers; the following month, the UK Food Standards Agency found that some Findus UK beef lasagnes in fact contained 100 per cent horsemeat. Supermarkets across 13 European countries rushed to withdraw products, with £300 million wiped off Tesco's market value alone.

Memories of the scandal were revived this January by two trials in Marseille. Twenty-five wholesalers, vets, dealers and butchers were accused of selling horsemeat from the pharmaceutical industry that was unfit for human consumption. The animals were former racehorses which had been earmarked for retirement rather than an abattoir. A separate trial involved 18 people accused of tricking the owners of ageing horses into believing that their animals would end their lives peacefully in the countryside; instead, they were taken to the slaughterhouse.

""˜It is clear that such scandals contribute to the deterioration of the image of horsemeat,' admits Guy Arestier, the president of the equines section of Interbev. ""˜However, what limits consumption is availability. Distributors encounter difficulties in obtaining supplies, in particular of French horsemeat, which would meet consumer expectations. A recent study estimates that 15 per cent of the French population are potential consumers. This is why we are working to try to relocate the production of horsemeat to France.'

Arestier has a point. France only produces 30 per cent of the horsemeat it consumes, with the remainder made up of imports from North and South America and the European Union. We may associate eating horses with our Gallic neighbours but the practice of ""˜l'hippophagie', to use the sonorous French term, is barely more than 200 years old across the Channel.

The consumption of horsemeat was not made legal in France until 1811, possibly due to the return from the Napoleonic Wars of soldiers who had developed a taste for horseflesh seasoned with gunpowder in lieu of other emergency rations. Statutory regulations governing the butchery of horses were introduced in 1866, just in time for the Prussian siege of Paris four years later, which forced widespread hippophagie on the French capital and cemented the image of the French as a nation of horse-eaters, at least in British eyes.

L'hippophagie hit a peak in 1911 and has been declining steadily since the Second World War. Consumption is concentrated on Paris and the north. Traditionally, the cheap meat of draught, or dray, horses has been sold in specialist butchers called ""˜boucheries chevalines' so the meat would not be confused with beef.

A trip to the chevaline remains a childhood memory for many of the older generation of French people. ""˜It was tradition for us to eat horsemeat on a Monday,' says Koffmann, who grew up in Gascony in south-west France in the 1950s. ""˜The butchers selling beef and pork were closed on a Monday, but not the boucheries chevalines. I love the sweet flavour of horsemeat, maybe because I associate it with being young.'

Koffmann still seeks out chevalines on trips back to France but, according to Interbev, the 74-year-old fits the increasingly elderly demographic of the typical horsemeat consumer. Koffmann, in fact, is lucky to still find anywhere selling horse: in 2005, there were more than 1,000 horse butchers in France; today, there are around 300. Most work in markets such as the Bastille market in Paris or at the market hall at Courbevoie in the La DÃ©fense business district of the capital. The fact is that younger - and I use the term loosely - generations simply aren't interested in eating horse.

Dorian Nieto is the author of over 40 cookbooks in France, as well as the 2012 celebration of horse-eating La Boucherie Chevaline Was Open on Monday. He still eats horsemeat, though few of his friends do. ""˜Eating horsemeat is not common in my generation,' he says. ""˜I turned 60 last year, but when I go to buy horse I am almost the youngest person in the queue. In my small village in the Ile-de-France the boucherie chevaline closed more than 20 years ago, but there is still a horse butcher in the market.'

Nieto blames the decline of horsemeat consumption on the decline of meat-eating in general with younger consumers. ""˜They eat less meat and they prefer meats with less flavour, like chicken, that are easy to prepare. Horsemeat recipes are rare and if you don't know how to cook something, you're unlikely to buy it. I don't think the decline can be reversed unless, perhaps, one day an Instagram influencer celebrates horsemeat. But I can't see that happening.'

He's probably right; social media-savvy, switched-on French foodies are shunning horsemeat. ""˜I don't know anyone who eats horse,' says Sabrina Ubinana, a 47-year-old resident of Paris's hip Marais district. She lives near the former premises of Le Taxi Jaune, where she never ordered horse, now home to what Ubinana says is one of the best Parisian bistros, Parcelles, where horse is not on the menu. ""˜I have nothing against horsemeat, but I wouldn't buy it,' she adds. ""˜It is never served at dinner parties in Paris and I've never seen it in a butcher's shop. It's just not fashionable.'

Ubinana should know: as the French PR for the World's 50 Best Restaurants awards, she gets to eat in the coolest restaurants in the country. ""˜No Michelin-starred chef in France, to my knowledge, offers horse on their tasting menu,' she says. ""˜It would be a very strong statement because horse is now considered more of a pet than livestock and too cute to eat. I don't think restaurateurs have taken horse off the menu out of conviction but because the French public see consuming horse as almost taboo.'

It is an opinion echoed by Bertrand GrÃ©baut, the head chef of Septime, a one-Michelin-starred restaurant that is also the highest-ranking Parisian dining room on the World's 50 Best Restaurants list, at number 22. GrÃ©baut once carved and cooked a horse's heart on the big screen at a culinary event to encourage debate around eating offal. ""˜It might have been less appalling if it was a beef heart,' GrÃ©baut admits, ""˜but horse heart is better, absolutely delicious.' Why, then, is there no horse on Septime's menu today?

""˜Eating horsemeat is divisive in French society,' GrÃ©baut says. ""˜People have an emotional relationship with the horse, just as they do with a pet, and they often don't make a distinction. I mentioned a horse recipe on the radio and it created some virulent reactions, nothing nasty but protests outside the restaurant and graffiti. Horse is a very good meat in terms of taste but, in the end, we stopped serving it because the supply chains were rather vague and traceability was not transparent. I don't consume horsemeat any more because I don't see it any more.'

And it's not just the Parisians who have lost their appetite for eating horse. LaÃ«titia Visse is the chef and owner of La Femme du Boucher, a meat-focused Marseille restaurant where the not-for-the-faint-hearted menu includes beef testicles and black pudding made by simmering a pig's head overnight. Yet she suspects that horse might stick in the throat of diners. ""˜I have never had the opportunity to cook horsemeat for the simple reason that breeders are difficult to find,' she says. ""˜I'd be curious to serve it at the restaurant but I'm a bit apprehensive about the reaction of customers - stupidly, maybe.'

Or maybe not. Koffmann explains the French affection for horses in two words: Brigitte Bardot. The actor-turned-animal-rights-campaigner founded the Fondation Brigitte Bardot in 1986, which has as one of its slogans ""˜le cheval: Ã§a ne se manger pas' (""˜you can't eat a horse'). Bardot wrote an open letter to the prime minister of Malta in 2017 stating: ""˜The horse, like the dog, is a life companion not an edible product.' Koffmann remembers a programme Bardot made for French television. ""˜It showed horses having their legs broken before being put on a train to France. That put a lot of people off eating horsemeat.'

Managed carefully, however, eating horsemeat can lead not only to better animal welfare but more sustainable agriculture. Interbev claims that not only do equine grazing habits contribute to the conservation of flora and fauna biodiversity, but raising horses for food ensures their genetic survival: the nine French breeds of draft horses are classified as ""˜breeds threatened with abandonment'.

""˜Slaughter must be considered a favourable end-of-life solution for horses,' says Arestier. ""˜Maintaining the horse's value for a butcher contributes to limiting the abandonment and mistreatment of old animals. We believe that improving the treatment of horses requires the responsible management of their death.'

It is an argument espoused by Britain's most high-profile equestrian, the Princess Royal. Addressing the World Horse Welfare charity in 2013, she asked, ""˜Should we be considering a real market for horsemeat and would that reduce the number of welfare cases if there was a real value in the horsemeat sector?' Her comments sparked predictable outrage from animal-rights charities, with some wondering whether the late Queen's corgis would be next. Yet why do the British feel such a deep revulsion to the idea of eating horsemeat?

""˜The sets of creatures that we think are appropriate to eat or not eat form a complex and deeply held set of traditions,' says Charlie Taverner, a food historian and academic at Trinity College Dublin. ""˜When the French were eating starvation food such as horse, snails and thin soups, they appeared as poor and weedy to British eyes. In comparison, the British associated their boisterous national character with eating well-bred beef. Food has a real power to tell us who we are like and who we are dissimilar from and an emotional strength to make us feel very strongly about what is right and what is wrong.'

Yet might the cost-of-living crisis be the time for Brits to confront their aversion to horsemeat? Kezie is a mail-order company based near Duns in the Scottish Borders that specialises in exotic meat such as crocodile, kangaroo, zebra - and horse. A pair of striploin horse-fillet steaks costs £6.08, roughly a third cheaper than the beef sirloin Kezie sells and with half the calories - though given that fat is flavour, the steak I tried lacked the lusciousness of beef sirloin.

Kezie's head of sales Clare Stewart says that while she receives at least one phone call a month from an animal lover disgusted by the idea of selling horsemeat, the public reaction is usually more positive, with a spike in sales evident after appearing at British food festivals. ""˜We get our horsemeat from Uruguay and the animals are bred exactly the same way that we would rear cattle grazing out on the pasture,' she says. ""˜Obviously it would be better if we could purchase horses from British slaughterhouses. The only way to do that is to increase demand by steering the nation into a different mindset, which is not easy.'

Could the country's most respected chefs play a part in changing attitudes? Claude Bosi, the chef-patron of the two-Michelin-starred Bibendum in Chelsea, grew up in Lyon and used to serve chips fried in horse fat at his previous, two-starred London restaurant, Hibiscus. Would he ever put horse back on the menu? ""˜If I were to open a Lyonnais-style bistro in London, I would like to offer horse-fat chips and grilled horse steak as a tribute to where I'm from. Before going to school in France, I'd have horse steak with persillade for breakfast. Horse is really lean and has a delicate, clean flavour. Donkey charcuterie is delicious, too.'

Bosi remains appalled by some British culinary traditions. ""˜You used to eat squirrel pie here. That's f­­""”ked up. A squirrel is a rat that runs up a tree! I'll eat horse over squirrel every time.'

Chacun Ã son goÃ»t, as we should all perhaps say a little bit more.

""˜I lived under a pylon and it was hell - now I'm battling to stop it happening again'

Thousands of furious householders across Britain are fighting plans for a huge wave of new electricity pylons

A row of pylons was forced upon my family's farm in West Tilbury, Essex, in the 1950s, before I was born. They brought the power out of Tilbury towards Chelmsford, crossing the paddock that was right next to our farmhouse - our ponies grazed beneath the power lines.

As a child, I was continually aware of the buzzing and humming sounds they made, particularly when it was damp or foggy. You could feel the static electricity in the air and the barbed wire around the paddock had a current running through it as the electricity earthed. 

My parents received some financial compensation but it didn't make up for the ugliness or the disturbance or the dead birds we'd find lying beneath the cables. I can't imagine it was a healthy place to live. My father died young and my mother suffered from horrific migraines. Any study that suggests links between high voltage cables and illnesses such as leukaemia seems to be debunked yet I wouldn't want to bring up children anywhere near them. Friends avoided visiting us - they said they always got a headache - and whenever new people arrived they'd immediately ask, ""What's that noise?"" 

In my early 20s, I married and moved 25 miles away to Writtle, a beautiful part of Essex with deer parks and ancient forests, but now the National Grid is catching up with me again. The proposed 112-mile Norwich to Tilbury section of the Great Grid Upgrade, which will reinforce the high voltage power network between substations in Norwich, Bramford and Tilbury, passes right next to our house. On certain parts of the route, the cables will be buried because they cross areas of outstanding natural beauty, but around us they're proposing super pylons - soaring metal giants that are taller than 11 double decker buses. 

The pylons I grew up with are nothing compared with these monsters. Constructing each one will require a wide, concrete road to provide access for machinery, destroying acres of woodland and agricultural land, and the end result will scar the whole landscape and ruin businesses, tourism and communities.

This time we won't be getting any compensation, as the pylons aren't directly on our land, yet our lives will be sorely affected. Even though Norwich to Tilbury is only a proposal, it's putting people off buying in the area. I dread to think how much value it's knocked off our house and whether we'll ever be able to sell in the future.

I'm all for upgrading the power network; it's essential that we keep modernising our infrastructure. The proposed Norwich to Tilbury project will also connect new offshore wind generation, which can only be a good thing. It's so windy here in East Anglia; I can see that it makes sense to harness the power. What I don't understand is why, when they're introducing new sustainable technology, they're continuing to destroy the landscape with pylons and cables - what about taking the whole route offshore? In farming, you're always trying to find a better, more environmentally friendly way; it's simply not green policy to dig up landscape and bury cables, and build super pylons, higher than Nelson's column, across our country.

Locally, we're all panicking that the project will be bulldozed through at government level. It would be a catastrophe as there doesn't seem to have been any joined-up thinking in terms of the route. In trying to avoid large conurbations and highly populated areas, they've gone straight through the countryside - including the historic Dedham Vale in the heart of Constable Country. Until recently, the route went over a school (it's now been moved just to the side of it) and part of it includes land that has been compulsorily purchased for the Lower Thames Crossing road project, which couldn't co-exist with power lines. 

We've had two consultations and are now waiting for the final one in early 2024. So far, no one at National Grid seems to be able to prove that the proposed route is the best and most cost-effective way forward. The glossy brochures they send out, with people skipping through fields, don't answer any of our questions. Given that the National Grid is cabling offshore in other places, it would be useful to know why it is not viable here. 

A report in 2020 by National Grid ESO, a National Grid subsidiary that operates the electricity transmission system, suggested that offshore transmission networks are much cheaper. We're not sure what point there is in another consultation: everyone has told National Grid twice that the offshore option is what is needed. That ""everyone"" includes 27,400 people on the Essex Suffolk Norfolk Pylons petition, all the region's 14 MPs, and all three county councils, plus the district councils. 

I'd never choose to buy a house near a pylon - for the aesthetics but also the noise and the static. But if the plans go ahead, I'm going to be living less than 100 metres away from the biggest type you can get. It's frustrating when you have to fight so hard to get planning permission for a small extension in the green belt and yet the Government can give the green light to something so destructive, even when so many are opposed to it. 

I think Jeremy Hunt's announcement of a rebate on people's energy bills is bribery to accept old technology: metal monstrosities that will destroy our natural environment.

There is a cheaper offshore option that should be considered as part of an integrated grid. This would be £2 billion cheaper with 50 per cent less infrastructure. That's better for communities and the environment.

As told to Anna Tyzack

How gardening helps to burn calories in winter

Pruning, weeding and raking are all great activites that can help you burn calories in the garden

Winter days are much shorter and colder, yes - but it's a myth that gardening stops: there are a number of jobs that can be done in readiness for spring. 

Additionally, since the mental health benefits of exercise and time outside are well known, exerting yourself in the garden is a sure-fire way to stave off the winter blues - and, as an added bonus, the calorie burn from doing those outside jobs will help to offset any recent indulgences. 

Bear in mind that calorie burn will vary according to age, height and gender.

How to burn calories in the garden

Pruning 

Some plants lend themselves best to pruning when they are dormant: for instance, most types of roses, apples, pears and clematis. Take care of these in the winter and they will flower more abundantly in the spring - plus, pruning for an hour will burn around 280 calories.

Weeding 

While many other growing things are dormant, it's a sad fact of gardening that a little thing like winter doesn't stop the weeds. Tackle them for an hour and not only will your flower beds thank you, but your waistline will as well, with 300 calories burned.

Cutting back 

Although evergreens should really only be cut back in spring, deciduous hedges - for example, hornbeam, hawthorn and purple beech - are fine to do in winter, and will grow back stronger in the spring. Trim your hedges for an hour and you'll melt around 400 calories.

Raking & bagging 

Fallen leaves can quickly make a winter garden look untidy and unkempt. Avoid noisy leaf blowers and put some muscle into the task by wielding a rake - you'll burn around 320 calories in an hour's work.

Planting a hedge 

As long as the ground isn't waterlogged or frozen, winter is an ideal time to plant new hedges: because the plants are in a resting state, they can just focus on establishing their roots, rather than putting out new growth. An hour of planting blasts approximately 300 calories.

Cleaning tools 

Now's the time to put all of your tools and workspaces through a thorough maintenance routine, ready for the madness of spring. Sterilise pots and spades; sharpen secateurs and spades and tidy up your shed. Not only will you be wiping out bacteria and fungus, but also around 240 calories in an hour.

Planting trees & shrubs 

Colder months are ideal for planting for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the fact that moister soil, caused by regular rainfall, helps roots to expand and find nutrients. There's less competition for water and food, too, since there are fewer weeds around - meaning that newly-planted trees and shrubs can establish themselves before having to compete against these garden villains. Digging torches approximately 500 calories in an hour, and planting around 320.

Mulching 

This is a task for later in the season, when you can trap in the moisture that the wet months have provided. Branches cut from fir trees are useful for this job, and have the advantage of being easy to remove when the weather warms up - alternatively, if you have the patience, you can use the pine needles and later work them into the soil for their nutritional benefits. Other bonuses? You're likely to burn around 350 calories over an hour.

Swabbing the decks 

Swabbing has taken on something of a different meaning in the past two years, this type is gag-free. Well, if you get to it in time, that is: otherwise you may have slick, swampy green sludge to contend with, which is a slip-hazard. You could, of course, hire a pressure washer to deal with your patio, paving or decking, but putting in the elbow grease with soapy water and a scrubbing brush will use up about 400 calories.

Laying turf 

Winter is an ideal time to lay turf: members of your household are less likely to spend time on the grass, which means that it will have time to settle and take root before the party and barbecue traffic of warmer weather. Better yet, although you can't lay turf on frozen ground, frost won't do freshly-laid turf any harm. As for the effort involved, the job will use around 320 calories in an hour.

Harvesting vegetables 

If you've played your sowing cards right, you'll be feasting on kale, broccoli, leeks, parsnips, cauliflower and, of course, Brussels sprouts, all winter. Picking crops packs a substantial punch in terms of health and wellbeing: as well as eating homegrown, zero miles food, you'll also be using up about 250 calories in an hour.

According to Gareth Allen, personal trainer and owner of Studio Twenty 3, gardening falls into the category of ""˜NEAT' - Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis. This, he explains, is burning calories through movement outside of structured exercise and accounts for 15 to 20 per cent of our daily calorie expenditure, unlike EAT (Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) which tends to account only for about 5 per cent. 

""We walk, stand and climb stairs every day,"" he says. ""We don't necessarily work out every day, and some gardening jobs are actually very strenuous."" Working alongside Draper Tools for a study on how effective gardening can be for fitness, compared to a gym workout, Allen advises gardeners against ""planning to do too much in one day. You should also schedule regular breaks, stay hydrated and not spend too long in one position - bedding plants, for example."" He also recommends stretching at the end of a gardening session to help the body recover.

""˜I was a millennial priest - and discovered the dark side of the CofE'

In an exclusive extract from his memoir, The Reverend Fergus Butler-Gallie discusses dating with a dog collar - and meeting abusive clerics

What made you become a priest?' I've been asked this many times by many people. In pubs, in the street, at dinner parties. Over the years I've realised it's several questions, depending on where the questioner puts their emphasis.

""˜What made you become a priest?' The tone adopted by a stranger at a party or drinks event; usually a precursor to a prolonged sharing of their hostile attitude to religion - they almost always carry the lager-fuelled hope that they might turn me from the error of my ways. Oh, to have such faith!

""˜What made you become a priest?' A knottier, more difficult question, asked by wise vicars or by my fraught conscience, and one I struggle to answer. Can anyone truly become the priest they should be, least of all someone in their mid-20s? 

Coward that I am, I normally defuse each with humour. Taking a deep breath, I pretend to consider it. I might allow my eyes to flit upwards as if invoking divine wisdom, before uttering, ""˜Well, I heard that black was slimming.'

The questioner will smirk and nod, their question expertly evaded. I might even elicit a chuckle. And we can move on to simpler things.

I was ordained in June 2018. The average age of a vicar that year was 52. I was half that age.

I never set out to become a priest. I'd grown up in Kent, the eldest of five children, in a military family. Right the way back to Waterloo, Butler-Gallies, including my own father, put on military uniform. Although my father had left behind any relationship with the armed forces when I was young, he found the lack of structure related to having five children too much to bear and he would fly into rages at the chaos. I vowed very early on that I would, instead, be part of the world of chaos rather than a futile force of order, so I joined the Church of England. 

When I told my father that I wanted to be ordained, I expected him to be sceptical, but he gazed at me with a well-worn hangdog look and remarked: ""˜In many ways it's not so different from the Army. The outfit's stupid and the pay's crap. Carry on.' 

I was 20 when I told my parents this. I'd read History and Czech/Slovak at the University of Oxford, and at first I toyed with becoming a diplomat, but as I neared graduation, encouraged by advice from clergy, I found myself edging towards ordination. At the time I was living above a pub in the centre of town, with one of my best friends, an engineer and the rugby captain. He - and our ragtag group of mates - were supportive of my decision, though occasionally confused by it. But I knew it was the right path: I went on to study theology at the University of Cambridge and was ordained at Liverpool Cathedral in 2018, spending my first two years of ministry in a church in Liverpool.

Ordination is a strange business - part legal procedure, part celebration, part terrifying stare over the precipice of the rest of your life. Beforehand, I'd asked a friend how it felt to be ordained. Having drunk various spirits the night before, he replied that he felt like he was at his own funeral. I had not dissimilar feelings. 

Not, alas, from a hangover, but because I knew it would change how people saw me: I'd no longer just be me, a young man who liked beer and lie-ins and watching stupid YouTube videos, but a symbol of hope to some and hate to others. I had vowed to do and be something more. I'd promised to ""˜die to self and live to Christ and my neighbour'.

Of course I failed in this. All clergy do. I fail to die to self when I conceal my collar because I haven't got the cash to buy a Big Issue; when I get off the bus a stop early to avoid a barrage of questions about death (normally of pets) from fellow passengers; when I recall all the drinks I had at a university party in 2013 instead of listening to a sermon. In short, I'm called to make God known while being all too human.

Imposter syndrome is also a very real thing for clergy - unsurprising, perhaps, since our ultimate boss is God, whose intangible, incomparable majesty it is our job to make known in no more than about 55 minutes once a week. 

So, in those early months after I was ordained I found it hard not to believe that a TV crew was going to appear during a sermon and announce it was all an elaborate practical joke.

Being ordained in my 20s also meant my first years of ministry coincided with a flurry of housewarmings, new-job drinks and engagement parties. It was difficult. To my friends, weekends were a glorious 48 hours in which to indulge their interests or vices. For me, they were the warm-up and then the Church equivalent of the ""˜big game'.

Most Sunday mornings, while my mates shared McDonald's breakfast orders over WhatsApp, I'd be sharing my often ill-formed thoughts on the Gospel according to St John.

The realities of church work when I was feeling a little worse for wear were not unfamiliar to me in those first six months - a faceful of incense is not an effective hangover cure. It soon became clear that I'd have to tone down the partying. 

Or learn to say, ""˜No, thanks. I'm C of E', when a JÃ¤gerbomb was proffered. So I made an Epiphany resolution: to rebalance things.

This meant moderation rather than total abstention. It became a ritual - turning up for the start of a party, then making my excuses to catch the last train.

All this makes it sound like punishment - but it isn't. Being ordained is a privilege and a joy. It doesn't always feel like that when an alarm goes off at 6am on a Sunday or when someone urinates down the walls of the church loo or when I'm dealing with the cold, dead hand of the central Church of England, but there can be no denying that, as a priest, my life feels richer and happier.

Not long after my Epiphany resolution, I had, well, an epiphany. I'd gone to London for a friend's birthday. It was a bleak midwinter evening and I'd stepped out on to a patio to calculate my escape. Suddenly the noise from the party intruded on the quiet as a fellow guest slipped out and stood next to me, lighting a cigarette.

We made small talk until the inevitable surfaced: ""˜And what do you do?' When I revealed my profession, I wasn't met with sneering atheism or a lewd joke, but with an unburdening of emotions. 

It isn't my place to say what, exactly, we talked through, but at the end of our chat, as I embraced my new acquaintance, my eyes were damp.

Saying, ""˜No, thanks. I'm C of E' isn't an option when someone bares their soul. It doesn't matter whether that happens in a church or outside a party. For all its faults, the Church is called to be where people are, and where they need it to be. 

And if I was the unlikely tipsy face of the C of E to that person on the patio, it was just as much a part of my ministry as my sermon the next day. 

Another early challenge to navigate, as a millennial priest, was dating. I was ordained while single but to have a job that involves celebrating love, and preparing people for their weddings, isn't a barrel of laughs - especially if it's considered suspicious if you don't have a partner. So I thought I ought to try to get out there. 

Dating as a cleric is weird. I was rubbish enough before I was ordained, a poorly put-together mass of nerves and badly timed jokes. Add clerical angst and you have a seriously unattractive package. 

That looming, inevitable question ""˜What do you do?' is no longer a chance to crack a joke at parties but the cue for a look of total bemusement and/or horror as a lifetime of village fetes and Victoria sponges flashes before the eyes of someone who, until then, you were getting on with quite well. 

Along with weddings, funerals inevitably take up much of my professional time. While most people engage with death rarely and only when absolutely necessary, for the clergy, it may crop up three times a week, and as such, all clergy have anecdotes about death. 

Some tell stories with gallows humour, such as the vicar who witnessed a gravedigger keeling over dead into the hole he had just dug. I remember one of the first times I anointed someone on their deathbed: I arrived at a care home with, I was told, little time to spare but was met not by doctors or family but with a procession, headed by a man determined to pull his trousers down. Each time he succeeded, the staff would rush to pull them up again. 

Observing these natural moments of comedy or irony isn't a mark of disrespect. A funeral, for all its sombreness, is a gathering of people, fallible and funny as they are. 

The memory that sticks most took place one afternoon in mid-August, not long after I was ordained, I went to a cul-de-sac in Liverpool for a ""˜lying-in' appointment, the practice of saying prayers over a body that has been brought home prior to the funeral. 

In some parts of Liverpool, this is traditional. Every former docker or cabbie is treated like a minor royal, every two-up two-down becomes Westminster Abbey, as people flock to pay their respects. It's an admirably forthright way of dealing with death, and strikes me as healthier than a Home Counties ""˜life celebration' at a faceless crem.

It was a hot day, the tarmac shimmered. I was still getting used to my cassock, a black woollen garment, and my briny essence poured from my brow. A crowd swelled outside the house. Inside it was even busier. There was beer, smoking, a few winking ""˜very young for a vicar' shots. 

I was led to a room with 15 mourners already squeezed in and only a small crack in the window letting in air. I looked at the body and launched in, as more people piled in: ""˜Our Father, which art in Heaven""¦' By the time I got to, ""˜Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee,' it was stifling. Then I noticed a wisp of smoke creeping through the window. And a familiar smell. Someone outside had lit a joint. Uh-oh. ""˜That's weed,' went my brain. ""˜Hail Mary, full of grace,' continued my lips. 

As a young priest, this is not the kind of nightmare you anticipate.

I considered whether I could change the direction of the smoke, but blowing marijuana over a body was probably not the best look. In the end, I decided to speed up the Hail Marys. To its credit, the congregation kept up. 

Considering the occasion, they were all in quite a good mood.

For all of the moments of humour, there are also occasions when life in ministry can seem less like a jolly pilgrimage and more like a stagger through an inhospitable cultural landscape - or like banging your head against a brick wall. I was only a lowly curate, the bottom rung of the ladder, but even I encountered some of the less savoury conflicts that mark the life of the Church as a national institution.

One Ash Wednesday, we were due a visit from a clerical VIP. He arrived with a gaggle of staff, which outnumbered our home team, and swept into our church, where he was talked through what he had to do during the service. Every time he wanted to query something he would dramatically wave an empty sparkling-water bottle - his constant companion - in the vague direction of the issue and expect a solution.

It was my first encounter with a Prince of the Church. If the priesthood has taught me anything it's that things - and people - are often not as you expect. Sometimes that's a reminder of the breadth of humanity, but it can also be disappointing. 

Collecting any group of people together with a supposedly common cause will invariably lead to disagreement. The sort of arguments that occurred at parish level - who had the keys to the parish centre where we stored the kneelers, the speed at which the organist played ""˜happy birthday' - were gentle reminders of human fallibility. But in due time I would experience an even darker side of the Church. 

After I left Liverpool at the end of 2020, I took up a new position down south. I'd been warned by friends and fellow clergy not to go to that particular church; the culture was, in one priest's words, ""˜utterly toxic'. 

But I knew better. And things started out OK. Nothing worked, time was wasted, vanity and pomposity were the norm, but those are all wildernesses I could live with. Soon, though, more invidious experiences began to sneak in: controlling, manipulative behaviour. I'd be humiliated at meetings, ignored in public, endlessly gossiped about. There was an atmosphere of, dare I say it, wickedness.

I found that those I worked with in this particular church, at first honest with me about the toxic atmosphere, soon became hostile and cagey, caught up in the climate of fear and loathing.

One thing was said behind backs, another in public. Explosions of anger and spat venom were the norm. Soon it became clear that I wasn't the only one who had suffered. I started getting phone calls, emails, messages on social media, the accounts eerily similar. It had gone on for years. 

I was shocked to be refused communion that Christmas, and it remains one of the most painful incidents of my life.

I discovered that for all the kind and good clerics, a minority are manipulative and abusive, uninterested and duplicitous. I encountered clerics who delighted in sidelining their juniors or volunteers, those who were sweetness to people's faces, then dealt in calumnies behind their backs, those who would preach about the poor, then ignore them in situ. It was often depressing. 

Priests are meant to work in the wilderness, but when there's no way out, no redemptive arc, just more damaging behaviour, it becomes too much. And it becomes necessary to walk away.

This, in the end, is what I did. 

Throughout that hideous year, I'd kept the memory of the happier years in Liverpool in my mind; a reminder that it didn't have to be like this, that wildernesses of the soul should be the toxic exception rather than the general rule.

But I also felt a sense of unease. After all, I was no longer a disinterested observer from the pew. Was it me, rather than the Church, who was at fault? 

Plenty of things about life as a cleric give cause to weep. I always wondered why we were historically known as ""˜men of the cloth'. 

I now know it's because we spend most of our time touching it. Failure and frustration are constant companions.

Since leaving that church, I've failed to find any permanent job - my most recent ministry in London has been as an unsalaried stand-in, doing dogsbody work in return for a house but no pay. A sort of zero-hours contract for vicars. 

My new diocese has told me there is nowhere for me at the moment and so I am, I hope temporarily, leaving ministry. I'm not sure I mind. 

In the five years since being ordained, I have found out things about myself of infinite value and, I hope and trust, have served others in the spirit of my calling. If the Church of England doesn't think that's a good thing, it's on them. 

My ministry brought me into contact with the true treasures of the Church. Not its silver plate or its pomp but its people: the strange, awkward, wonderful, holy people, who, despite all the Church throws at them, still come to it in search of love. They're the ones who run the practical expressions of love on the ground - the Sunday clubs and food banks. And they're the ones who, more importantly, point me in the direction of a love that is even greater. 

I suppose I'd learned, too, that everything is circular: being a young cleric wasn't about wearing the collar. It was about coming up against the same moments - birth, life, death - over and over, and still failing. But failing with better humour, with a greater consideration of others - failing more Christianly each time. 

Each moment of death or failure, wherever it brought me into contact with the love of people and the love of God, was a gift. And realising that death was, to quote the greatest Easter hymn, ""˜but the gate of life eternal'.

So, back to the start: why did I become a priest? Death, I suppose. The death of self, and birth of a new self. And, to be fair, it has been much, much more fun than I ever could have imagined.

Get the Crufts look - what I learnt from a doggy salon

How hard can it be to give your pooch a DIY hairdo? Sometimes it's best to leave it to the professionals, says Ben Rowell

What on earth did dogs do before they had doggy hair salons on every British high street? How did they manage? The answer perhaps lies in TV coverage of Crufts, where the humans, when they are not prance-trotting with their charges around the arena, spend every spare second obsessively snipping, crimping and primping their petit basset griffon vendÃ©en's mane in the cause of purebreed supremacy. 

This year's Best in Show, Orca, a four-year-old lagotto romagnolo, certainly looked as though she had enjoyed more than a little attention: lagottos need to be cut back about four to five times a year, three hours at a go, by very skillful hands. None of this is a problem for me; my dog, Dublin, is banned from Crufts. Not for any personal failing (though she has many, not limited to starting rows with other dogs at the vet's and nervously losing control of her bladder - more of that later) but because she is a crossbreed. She is a cockapoo. 

With her cousins, the other poodle-cross varieties such as labradoodles, maltipoos, schnoodles and poochoons, she is among Britain's most fashionable dogs, certainly if you count new purchases. Oodles of these doodles are bought because they are neat, healthy, hypoallergenic, do not shed and look cute. Which makes it more galling that Crufts, dealing with a PR nightmare, recently instituted a second competition for crossbreeds that they called Scruffts.

Compounding the errors, its website states: ""While the emphasis is on fun, Scruffts also seeks to stress important messages relating to responsible dog ownership."" For the love of dog - you want to throw shade at the humans as well?

Anyway the doodles can lay claim to being the smartest looking canines in the kingdom: look around your local park for the best turned-out pooches and those will be the poodle-crosses. Admittedly some will have taken it too far, accessorising themselves with designer leads, couture raincoats and Chanel travel-bags, but they""˜re not called designer dogs for nothing. Indeed the doodles are thought to be single-handedly responsible for the proliferation of dog groomers or poodle-parlours on our high streets. They don't shed, but they do moult and this causes matting. At which point you have to take your dog to the groomer and fork out £70. Five times a year. 

During the pandemic pup-surge, 11 per cent of British households bought a dog, giving us 3.2""‰million extra canines. At its peak, the price of a cockapoo went up to £3,500. Owners then need to fork out for food (anything between £300 and £2,000 a year and rising, especially if, like my dog, their pets insist on hand-delivered, freshly cooked food), vets' bills (astronomical: our cockapoo has never actually been ill, but she did chew a stray asthma inhaler once, explosively ingesting its contents - £750), and insurance (well, after that she had it).

Then there's grooming, on which Britons managed to spend £346""‰million in 2022. This is a startling sum but not when you consider that many groomers offer ultrasound tooth whitening for dogs, baths and colour-enhancing shampoos. At the London Dog Grooming Company, which operates a salon in Battersea and one within the Liberty department store, you can plump for a ""fruity facial"" or even a mud bath (£50) or - and I can't believe I'm writing this - you could go for a luxury canine massage from its ""Mind & Body"" menu for £180.

I am actually standing outside ""the posh groomer"" on our highly-gentrified London high street (this is different from ""the other one"", which Dublin usually attends, though there's scarcely a price difference) mulling what on earth we did before dog-groomers, when I bump into our neighbour Pat, who has lived in this area all her life- well before the yuppies arrived. ""What did we do? You did it yourself, of course,"" she says. ""My mum used to get a big pair of scissors and take a handful of fur - we had poodles - and just cut away. They looked perfect.""

Hmm. I head home and a little online research produces the Cockapoo Club of GB's home-grooming advice, which seems a matter of buying a ""Nobby Starline Soft Gripper Disentangler"", a flexible ""slicker brush"", thinning scissors and a shaver. How hard can it be? I'm not setting up as a dog groomer - every breed has different requirements - I just want to groom my own dog. It could be a moment of bonding between Dublin and me, and possibly a kindness as she is a nervous groomee. And then on the common, during the normal catechism (""Lovely!""; ""gender?/ breed?""; ""Which groomer do you use?""), I could reply: ""Oh, no, I do it myself. It's a small discipline but a worthy one. A craft, really.""

But before I invest in all of the tools, I decide to get a lesson. It might be awkward to ask Dublin's own groomer, so I throw myself on the kindness of the ""posh"" salon, Dog & Groom. When owner Anna Ochendzan finishes laughing at the idea of me grooming my dog, her expression grows appalled. ""No, I really couldn't endorse it. It would be""¦ dangerous."" In the end I think that she only agrees to demonstrate dog-grooming to me - and Telegraph readers - to stop us ever trying it at home.

I am just explaining to head groomer Roisin McInerney how I've actually bought an eight-bladed ""dematter"" and am keen to use it, when her face blanches: Dublin is weeing on the floor of the very smart boutique. This is embarrassing, but it turns out Roisin is perturbed about my dematting ambitions. The salon regularly receives home-groomed dogs with wildly uneven coats for rectifying, or bald patches, or cuts. ""And holes, actual holes in their skin"". 

Post-lockdown, many dogs had to be shaved because their owners had not brushed them for weeks and they were irrecoverably matted. Roisin is keen that I learn how to wash Dublin properly and brush her thoroughly and that I don't de-mat. Nor will I be allowed near scissors. Or a buzz-cutter. Or even the special hair-dryer - a potential danger. 

So here's the drill: shampoo your dog (twice) and condition if necessary; deploy your slicker brush but don't deploy your razor-sharp dematter (which does indeed look deleterious to a dog's health). Don't deploy (round-ended) scissors, especially not around the eyes. And I would not attempt to shave Dublin's under-carriage - jeez, it looks dicey. Definitely don't try clipping your dog's toenails, especially if they are dark and you can't see the quick: you will give your hound PTSD. 

The brushing, though: brush every week, at least, and scrutinise every inch of your dog's skin. You can clean their ears using a hypoallergenic wet-wipe, but go no further. Get your dog regularly groomed by professionals. Having witnessed how hard and labour-intensive the job is, frankly £70 begins to seem a bargain. 

As I slip off the bow-tie Rosin put round Dublin's neck, I think that I have gone off the craft of home-grooming. Braver, more crafty or assiduous souls may wish to take the dream on. If so, Dog & Groom offers free courses in the maintenance of dogs' coats, or you can take yourself to The London Dog Grooming Company for a three-hour dog grooming course for £600 - a snip. 

Would you take your dog to a professional groomer? Please let us know in the comments

Our countryside is being wantonly sacrificed at the altar of net zero

The failure to build new nuclear power stations reeks of political short-termism. Now, one of this nation's great assets is paying the price

The first time I saw a modern wind turbine I thought it was a thing of sculptural beauty and couldn't work out what all the Nimby fuss was about. Especially when electrical pylons and telecom masts were so hideous by comparison. I even had a self-righteous row with my late, 93-year-old mother-in-law about the encroaching turbines in rural Berwickshire; declaring it was better to have eco-power than old-style power stations belching fumes. She then trounced me with her counter-attack on the threat to wild birds and bats and her instruction to see who was benefiting from subsidies - but then she did once work at Bletchley Park, so you'd expect her to beat all comers. 

That came before I took a road trip to San Francisco and passed a sea of wind farms on a calm, gust-less day and observed many defunct, corroded turbines like the ghosts of good intentions. I did a bit of research and gathered the average lifespan of a turbine was only around 20 years and that, ironically, the fibreglass blades are very hard to recycle. Perhaps you can have too much of a good thing, I thought. 

Back here in the UK we have far too little empty landscape to spare, beyond that needed for a minimum level of calm communion with nature. So, it makes sense to keep the majority of these elegant, alien structures offshore, where strong wind is relatively reliable and there's sufficient open space to diminish the visual impact. Which is the precise conclusion the Tory government came to when it passed legislation (in 2015) effectively banning the construction of new onshore wind farms - since an objection from even one UK resident meant plans would be overturned. 

The judicious nature of this decision is something I ponder every time I take a coastal hike with old school friends and gaze out at occasional rows of industrious turbines. They're too distant to spoil our sense of the British coastline's turbulent history. In early August, we set out on the 1066 walk, which takes you through Rye and Battle, with detours to Hastings, Pevensey and Bexhill, if you so choose. Out in the English Channel the turbines spin without sweeping away the past. 

But if you had these giant Airpods on the tranquil, green haunted fields where King Harold faced the Norman conquerors, even the most hardened eco-warrior would surely concede something ineffable had been vanquished. 

Now we learn that backbench Tory MPs, supported by Labour ones, are set to renege on the legislation - spurred on, inevitably, by the requirement to achieve net zero by 2050. What makes this so infuriating is the reckless short-termism of it all. No backsliding would be necessary if the Government (which has now been in power for 13 years, lest we forget) had had the bravery and nous to heed the repeated call for new nuclear power stations. Dear God, if even the late climate scientist James Lovelock (originator of the Gaia theory) could see this was the best option to satisfy the competing needs of humans vs environment, then you'd think our politicians would grasp the thistle. 

But the rule of thumb for successive administrations has been to never spend hard cash on the future, when you can bluster your way out of responsibility today. It's what we see as our schools crumble before our eyes. I fear that by 2066 our glorious landscape - our greatest legacy and the reason millions visit the UK every year - may resemble a great barren battlefield of turbines.

Britain's greatest scenic train journeys

The best ways to take in the wonderful landscapes of Britain from the comfort of a rail carriage

There is no more relaxing form of travel than rail, and no better way to enjoy the beauties and sights of a country than through a carriage window, whatever the season. When it came to seeing landscapes, Robert Louis Stevenson thought ""none more vivid... than from a railway train"". 

Britain has hundreds of attractive rural railway lines offering scenic delights, and access to great walks or picturesque villages and towns. It has more tourist railways than any other country per capita, attracting millions of passengers every year. 

Royal Scotsman

This hotel on wheels has become a byword for luxury in train travel. The cabins, all en suite, are generously proportioned for a train carriage, but it is the quality of food and the pitch-perfect friendliness of staff that makes a journey on the Belmond Royal Scotsman such a pleasure.

The small galley kitchen produces refined dishes using the country's produce wherever possible, and there is a good selection of malts to accompany a chat in the lounge car before or after dinner. The varied tours, from three to eight days, are designed to showcase the finest scenery Scotland has to offer, with some focusing on history, others on food and whisky. An open balcony on the rear coach helps photographers capture the sights; wellness aficionados will appreciate the new on-board Dior Spa, with two tranquil treatment cabins. 2024 will also see the addition of two Grand Suite cabins, featuring Highlands-inspired furniture and design.

The details: From £4,400 per person for its Taste of the Highlands itinerary (0845 077 2222; belmond.com).

North Yorkshire Moors Railway

Britain's busiest heritage railway runs through 24 miles of glorious countryside, much of it within the North York Moors National Park. Using a section of Network Rail, trains climb along the Esk Valley from the coast at Whitby to reach the North Yorkshire Moors Railway's own tracks at the junction of Grosmont.

Engineered by George Stephenson himself, the railway traverses wooded country to the moorland village of Goathland, still remembered as the setting for the TV series Heartbeat. Some passengers break the journey here to walk into the village or explore the famous mile-long stretch of road - Roman or even earlier - across Wheeldale Moor. Leaflets suggest walks from the other intermediate stations before journey's end at the market town of Pickering and its 13th-century castle.

The details: Daily services return on March 23, and tickets for 2024 will go on sale soon (01751 472508; nymr.co.uk).

The Jacobite

The West Highland Railway traverses some of the wildest country crossed by a British railway line, connecting Glasgow with Fort William, though it's the onward extension to Mallaig that is best known. The famous curving viaduct at Glenfinnan (pictured top) featured in four of the Harry Potter films, and the Jacobite steam trains that run to the fishing port from April to late October draw thousands to the area for its spectacular landscapes.

After a glimpse of the Caledonian Canal at Neptune's Staircase - a flight of eight locks - the railway skirts Loch Eil and is soon running beside the sea. Cattle can sometimes be seen on the white sands near Morar with views over sea lochs to the Small Isles of Muck, Eigg and Rum. Inland there is a panorama of mountains dotted with the stones of sheep pounds and crofters' cottages. The Caledonian Sleeper from London, some carriages with en-suite showers and even a double bed, are the most romantic and relaxing way to reach Fort William.

The details: The Jacobite runs from March 28 to Friday October 25, from £64 return (0844 850 4685; westcoastrailways.co.uk). Caledonian Sleeper, London to Fort William, from £405 for a double cabin (0330 060 0500; sleeper.scot).

Ffestiniog and Welsh Highland railways

Both these narrow-gauge railways terminate at a shared station in Porthmadog and thread Snowdonia. The Welsh Highland Railway to within a stone's throw of the castle at Caernarfon, and the Ffestiniog Railway to the slate-quarrying town of Blaenau Ffestiniog.

The Ffestiniog Railway has numerous claims as to why it should go down in railway history - locomotive trials in 1870 attracted delegations from nine countries, including Russia and India - but it is the spectacular scenery that fills trains. These leave Porthmadog across the narrow Cob with the sea on one side and a mountain-backed polder on the other, before climbing to a unique spiral near the summit.

The scenic highlight of the Welsh Highland Railway is the passage through the Aberglaslyn Pass, though there isn't a single dull moment in its 25 miles. The steep gradients of both lines call for special steam locomotives. The Ffestiniog Railway offers an observation car while the Welsh Highland Railway has two Pullman cars, one of them with an observation end (a supplement applies to all).

The details: Welsh Highland Railway from £70 for two, return; Ffestiniog Railway from £50 for two, return. Services restart on March 25 (01766 516000; festrail.co.uk).

Dartmouth Steam Railway

West Country resorts were the destination of hundreds of excursion trains during the summer months when everyone went on holiday by rail. The Dartmouth Steam Railway was once the route of the Torbay Express and now makes an end-on connection with Network Rail before continuing south to a terminus at Kingswear.

The line climbs from Paignton to give a panorama over Torbay before crossing a saddle in the hills to descend along the Dart Estuary to Kingswear, passing Agatha Christie's holiday home at Greenway, now in the care of the National Trust. Various ticket options allow you to take the return journey by river cruise with a bus connection to complete the circuit between train and boat.

The details: £21 return (01803 555872; dartmouthrailriver.co.uk).

Bluebell Railway

Southern's trains to East Grinstead provide an easy way for Londoners to reach the Bluebell Railway whose station is a few minutes' walk from the main-line platform. The 11-mile journey to Sheffield Park weaves through well-wooded Sussex countryside, carpeted with bluebells in spring.

Each of the four stations is restored to evoke a different period in the line's 137-year history, and the quiet country junction of Horsted Keynes, with its small refreshment room on the island platform, is one of the most atmospheric of all heritage railway stations. Because it was the first standard-gauge heritage railway, opening in 1960, the Bluebell has a fine collection of vintage carriages, adding to the charm of the journey. Take a stroll to the National Trust gardens at Sheffield Park before returning.

The details: All-day Adult Rover tickets from £25 (01825 720800; bluebell-railway.com).

Shrewsbury to Pwllheli/Aberystwyth

The railway serving the resorts of Cardigan Bay between Aberystwyth in the south and Pwllheli in the north meanders through central Wales and landscapes of rolling hills devoted to livestock farming or woodland. The two lines diverge at lonely Cyffordd Dyfi (Dovey Junction), accessible only by footpath. The southern route heads for the university town and a chance to take the Vale of Rheidol narrow-gauge railway to the well-known eponymous falls.

Gingerly edging along the cliffs above the sea, the northern line also provides connections to narrow-gauge railways - the Talyllyn Railway at Tywyn and the Ffestiniog and Welsh Highland railways at Porthmadog. A highlight is the crossing of the Mawddach Estuary by the 1867 timber bridge near Barmouth, shared with cyclists and pedestrians.

The details: Shrewsbury to Pwllheli, from £27.10 return; Shrewsbury to Aberystwyth, from £24.80 return (0333 3211 202; tfw.wales).

Cumbrian Coast (Lancaster to Carlisle)

The fastest way between Lancaster and Carlisle is the West Coast main line over Shap summit, but the slow-travel route via Barrow and Whitehaven provides long stretches of railway beside the treacherous sands of Morecambe Bay and the Irish Sea. The West Coast main line is left at Carnforth Station where Brief Encounter was filmed in 1945. 

Long viaducts carry the railway across estuaries, and the landscapes bear few scars from the mining, steel and shipbuilding industries that once dominated the Furness peninsula. Past the firing range at Eskmeals is Ravenglass and the start of the delightful Ravenglass & Eskdale Railway, a 15-inch gauge line used by many walkers as a way to reach the western fells. Beyond Whitehaven, one of England's first planned towns, the railway turns inland through pleasant farming country to reach the border city of Carlisle.

The details: From £26.50 return (0800 200 6060; northernrailway.co.uk).

Michael Morpurgo: ""˜Children who went to boarding school have an advantage in prison'

The former children's laureate, 79, reflects on how his own childhood and difficult school years shaped his life and writing career

It was in the 1940s when, aged five, I went to a primary school in Earl's Court that was very strict. Copying out and rote learning was deeply disappointing to me, because I was fond of books and stories instead. My mum had read to me often, and Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky had given me the idea that words, poems and pictures were quite fun. 

I thought school would be a continuation of that, but the teaching in those days (and I have to say, to some extent these days) was all about tests. It wasn't about sparking the imagination, it was simply about being examined - punishments, red lines, standing in corners - and occasionally the cane. I wasn't very good at it, and so I left the world of books behind. 

Instead, I found something else I liked, which was playing sport. I enjoyed football, rugby and just messing around in the playground, and so I became an outdoor child, rather than an indoor one. 

Then aged seven, I was sent to boarding school in Sussex with my brother. I didn't want to go and I was very homesick, finding the regime very oppressive. There was lots of discipline, shouting and people telling me what to do. I wasn't a very good student, and I was in trouble all the time. I'd get black marks as part of a system of minuses and pluses, and I was often called up in front of the whole school to be ticked off.

My way of dealing with the punishment and humiliation was to become particularly good at cricket and rugby. This meant I was looked upon with some favour by the teachers. I learnt a lot; we were all going through the same thing, and we all had to find strategies to get by.

I spent my weeks longing for letters from my mother. I had to try not to cry in public when I saw her handwriting, so I read them in the toilets. 

The school was called The Abbey. It's closed now, which is what it deserved. My experiences there informed my book The Butterfly Lion. I've always used my own life and my own memories enormously in my stories. I vividly remember running away in the rain one time, knowing that if I was caught I'd be beaten. 

Thankfully, I met a lady who was very nice to me. I got in her car and went back to her home in Ashurst Wood. She sat me down, put my wet shoes in the bottom of the oven, talked to me and calmed me down. She said, ""what are we going to do with you? Shall I phone your parents?"" I felt that my parents, particularly my stepfather, would be disappointed, so she drove me back, dropping me off in the woods so I could slip back into school without getting caught. I've never forgotten how kind she was. 

School was a diet of Latin, stew, rugby, detentions, cross country runs, chilblains, squeaky beds which sagged in the middle, and semolina. We weren't allowed to read in bed, but we did anyway, under torchlight. It wasn't all bad though, there was a lot of camaraderie between us, and a lot of daring. We were all scared, and we didn't want to be punished, but we were naturally rebellious. As well as the sport, I also enjoyed singing in the choir. 

In The Butterfly Lion, the bully Basher Beaumont corners the protagonist in the boot room and smears shoe polish all over him. I learnt to avoid bullies during my time there. 

I think children who went to boarding school have an advantage if they ever go to prison. I learnt survival. I'm not advocating this as a way of educating children, but a lot of us went through similar trials. It gave me mechanisms I would use later in life, but the damage I think was quite significant. 

We talk a lot about mental health now, but in those days, no-one talked about mental health. A lot of the children at that school, I'm quite sure, went through a lot of deep sadness and depression. I might have done too, who knows - but certainly, it wasn't great to feel so much oppression around me. If there was any real damage done, I think it was due to being away from our mothers and fathers. That was quite hard to bear.

In The Butterfly Lion, one teacher stands the main character, Bertie, in a corner with a book on his head. That happened to me a lot. I remember standing there and trying not to cry. To stop myself from crying I learnt how to make myself think about something different. Hurting myself was something else I discovered. I remember pushing my finger so hard into a plaster wall that it hurt, deliberately. If I hurt myself, I could stop thinking about the humiliation.

Suffering is not something to encourage, but it certainly makes you think quite hard about other people. You learn about other people, if you're treated this way. You think, ""why is this master or this man like this?"" Later in life, when I came to read Shakespeare and so on, I understood more. I'm certainly not advocating suffering, loneliness or isolation, but now I see that these experiences can inform you.

It's why there's a lot of sadness in my books, because I'm still dealing with sadness. No more than anyone else, but I deal with it in my stories. I learnt about sadness and rejection at that school. In my book I Believe in Unicorns, the character Tomas hates school - but he finds solace in the library. 

As for myself, I stayed away from books and learning for pretty much all of my school days. I was told so often I was stupid that I believed it. If you tell a child they are stupid often enough, their self-worth will drop. 

Later, when I was 13, I went to the King's School in Canterbury. My academic record was mediocre, but I still loved singing and sport and I managed to create a reputation as a leader, so in my last year I was captain of the school, with a lot of authority. It was a way of succeeding that had nothing to do with academia.

It was suggested to me that I'd do well in the army, I was happy to do it. I didn't want to be challenged intellectually or emotionally. I was shying away from all that stuff.

Sandhurst, the Royal Military Academy, was extremely good for me in one way, in that it taught me the value of friendship. Once again, I was in a regime where everyone was shouting at me and telling me what to do, and some of it wasn't very pleasant. 

Then I got lucky. I met a girl, Clare, who is my wife to this day. We've been married for 60 years now. She asked me back then, ""why are you doing this? Why are you dressing up in this uniform and marching up and down?"" In a sense, she was saying, what's your problem?

I told her that my two uncles, my heroes growing up, had both served in the Second World War. One was killed, and one was a war hero. To some extent, I was trying to imitate that heroism, though it wasn't very mature. She said, ""well, is that what you want to do for the rest of your life? Let's go off and do something else."" 

When it came to university, I went to King's College London, to study English, French and Philosophy. I ended up with a third class degree, of which I am not proud, and went on to become a teacher. 

After many years of teaching experience later, the then education secretary Michael Gove announced that he believed that it wasn't a good idea to have teachers who have third class degrees! Philip Pullman also had a third class degree, and I think Mr Gove's idea was absolute nonsense. It's what you do with your degree that counts. 

Teaching made me grow up. I found myself in front of a Year 6 class, and had to dig very deep to both educate and entertain, if you can't entertain, you can't educate. It's that simple in my view. I enjoyed one particular aspect of teaching, which was reading and telling stories, and acting them out.

My mum and my real dad had been actors, so I had a little bit of that gene in me. The children seemed to like it, and there was a wonderful head teacher at the Kent primary school where I worked. One summer day, she gave a diktat that all staff were to do that day was to read stories. She was quite right, everyone was too tired for anything else. 

I was reading a story, and I could see the children were bored and not enjoying it. I told my wife Clare, who was also a teacher by this time. She said, ""well, don't go on with the story if it's boring them"". So I decided to make up my own story. It was the first I ever told, to about 35 children, a whole classroom of 11-year olds, and it was a wonderful moment. They looked at me open-mouthed, and when the bell went I left it on a cliffhanger. 

I wrote it out, and the headteacher put me in touch with a publisher friend at Macmillan. A month later, I got a letter from them offering to pay me to write five more. 

I knew perfectly well that if you wanted to inspire children, particularly those who were not inclined to learn, or came from homes where their parents didn't read, you had to entertain them. 

I'd had enough good and bad experiences of teaching during my own education to know what worked. The choirmaster at my horrible little prep school, for example, had been extraordinarily enthusiastic and encouraging. At King's College in Canterbury, I'd had one teacher who told me there was more to life than rugby, and gave me his own copy of Wordsworth.

At university, one tutor would read Beowulf in his tweed suit with the same conviction and commitment as my mother would read Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky or her favourite poet, Edward Lear. 

My wife and I have clear ideas that reading was the path to sparking intellect, emotion, knowledge, wonder, curiosity and understanding. Get that right for children when they're young, with wide eyes and wide hearts, and the world is their oyster. 

My wife's father Sir Allen Lane was a great publisher, the man who started Penguin Books in 1935. He wanted to make money, but he understood that if you put good books in front of children without charging an arm and a leg, then you can show them how wonderfully life-changing stories can be. 

I believe that children must always have the opportunity to read and go to the theatre. Since then, Clare and I have also established the charity Farms for City Children. Our motivation was to give inner city children the chance to experience the countryside, too. It's a similar idea; we'd realised that many of our pupils hadn't had the chance to experience the countryside and to really be part of it.

We didn't want them to just take out a stupid clipboard and just tick things off a list. We wanted them to stay somewhere Hogwarts-like, go off and plant trees, peel potatoes, muck out the animals, find out where their food comes from, work with farmers, look up at the sky and see buzzards, and come across a still heron by the side of a river. They never forget it. It becomes who they are, and like a great book or a great play, it's a life-changing experience. 

As a middle class kid, I was seriously lucky. I climbed trees and did all sorts of things out in the fresh air. Money mustn't get in between what children can and can't do.

A theatre adaptation of Michael Morpurgo's I Believe In Unicorns from award-winning storyteller Danyah Miller is at the Apollo Theatre from 27 July-12 August, followed by a national UK tour from 6 October-5 November; ibelieveinunicorns.co.uk
