Scientists claim going 50 percent vegan could curb climate change.

A new study suggests swapping half of your meat and dairy products for plant-based alternatives for the next 27 years could drop emissions by 31 percent. 

The findings are based on agriculture and land use needed to raise livestock and grow crops.

However, previous research shows China alone produces more emissions than meat and dairy products combined, suggesting personal behavior may not be enough to save the planet.

A new study has suggested swapping half of your meat and dairy products for plant-based alternatives for the next 27 years would drop emissions by 31 percent

Meat-heavy diets risk our health and that of the planet, as livestock farming on a massive scale destroys habitats and generates greenhouse gases. 

A 2021 study by the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign found meat and dairy account for 57 percent of food-based greenhouse gas emissions.

The new study, published in the journal Nature Communications, aligns with the previous research, noting that going 50 percent vegan would reduce agriculture and land use.

Study co-author Eva Wollenberg of the University of Vermont said: 'We'll need much more than 'Meatless Mondays' to reduce the global GHG emissions driving climate change""”and this study shows us a path forward.

'Plant-based meats are not just a novel food product, but a critical opportunity for achieving food security and climate goals while also achieving health and biodiversity objectives worldwide. 

The authors found a 50 percent substitution scenario would substantially reduce the mounting impacts of food systems on the natural environment by 2050. Pictured above are meatless burgers

'Such transitions are challenging and require a range of technological innovations and policy interventions.'

The team looked at the global food security and environmental impacts of large-scale plant-based meat and milk consumption, considering the complexity of food systems.

Fact-box text

The authors found a 50 percent substitution scenario would substantially reduce the mounting impacts of food systems on the natural environment by 2050.

These impacts included a 12 percent decline in global agricultural area, nitrogen inputs to cropland are nearly half of the projections, a 10 percent drop in worldwide water usage and a 31 percent drop in greenhouse emissions.

While many countries rely on meat and dairy as major food sources, researchers said their work determined undernourishment globally would decline to 3.6 percent - reducing the number of undernourished people by 31 million.

According to the study, impacts across regions could differ due to differences in population size and diets, unequal agricultural productivity, and participation in international trade of agricultural commodities. 

The main impacts on agricultural input use are in China and on environmental outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa and South America. 

These regional differences could also be used to design better interventions.

'The food sector produces roughly one-third of global greenhouse emissions""”and has been notoriously difficult to de-carbonize,' said Wollenberg. 

'Given the magnitude of benefits we show from substituting meat with plant-based alternatives for global sustainability, climate action, and human health, this research provides important food for thought for consumers, food producers, and policymakers.'

Peter Loeters, his wife Maartje and their two young children stand forlornly outside the family's small farmhouse. 

A few yards away is an empty barn, padlocked for nearly a year, which once housed 40,000 egg-laying hens.

That was until Peter's permit to keep animals on his own land was abruptly withdrawn by the Dutch state, swiftly shutting down his farm and pitching him into near bankruptcy. 

What had Peter done to deserve this? Nothing.

He had become the latest victim of a draconian scheme by the Dutch government to overhaul agriculture in an attempt to reduce greenhouse gases and, supposedly, protect national nature reserves foisted on Holland by the European Union.

Peter Loeters, 45, with his wife Maartje and their two children. Their farm faces closure under new government initiatives in the Netherlands 

A tractor demonstration in November 2022. Citizens are fighting back against the net-zero obsession, beloved of the EU and Holland's 'green' coalition government

'Farmers are 'the bad guys',' says Peter, who is clearly distraught. 'We do nothing right in the eyes of our government. My farm is closed. The hens are gone. We have lost our money. My wife cries a lot, we are both stressed and the children know something is wrong.'

Yet an unconventional saviour may be coming to the family from a remarkable new political movement sweeping Holland, bringing with it lessons extending far beyond this small country.

It could, in time, transform the fortunes of Peter, 45, as well as the lives of the many farmers who tend Holland's 53,000 farms and smallholdings.

Just 11 days ago an astonishing victory by a fledgling populist party, the Farmer-Citizen Movement (BBB), turned Dutch politics on its head overnight.

In a shock result after a huge turnout, the BBB ""” the BoerBurgerBeweging ""” became the biggest party in the influential Dutch Senate (the upper house), winning a fifth of the seats.

Demonstrators attend a rally in Amsterdam in July 2022. The BBB has risen on the back of a people's revolution convulsing this normally peaceable nation

Farmers from the Netherlands join Belgian farmers with their tractors to block traffic on a road in the centre of Brussels in March 2023

It was an astounding success given that the party was launched only in 2019 as a farmers' protest movement. The BBB's founder, former agricultural journalist Caroline van der Plas, exclaimed when the results came in: 'F***, what's happened?!'

She added later: 'Our success is about citizens who feel they are not seen, not heard, nor taken seriously by their government. No one can ignore us any longer.'

The BBB has risen on the back of a people's revolution convulsing this normally peaceable nation. Its citizens are fighting back against the net-zero obsession, beloved of the EU and Holland's 'green' coalition government.

In particular, Dutch farmers loathe Prime Minister Mark Rutte's plans to cut livestock numbers and buy out farms to reduce nitrogen emissions, which are caused by manure and fertiliser.

The BBB promises a radical agenda to seize power from the net-zero elite and restore it to the people who say eco-measures are causing huge economic pain to farmers such as Peter.

Crucially, however, the BBB won votes from city residents in Amsterdam and The Hague as well as from rural supporters. Dutch voters have thus joined Swedes and Italians in swinging towards populist parties, as ordinary people band together to question overreach by pro-EU politicians.

Even in the EU's heartland of Belgium, passions are running high. Flemish farmers last month blockaded central Brussels with 2,700 tractors in protest against an EU-backed plan to limit their emissions.

In Holland, the EU has been particularly influential over the local climate change policy, promoting protected 'Nature 2000' reserves across the country ""” and successfully urging the Dutch to shut down 'polluter' farms that are said to spoil these areas.

By 2030, the closure of thousands of farms is planned by the government to comply with EU nature-preservation rules. 

At least 17,000 farmers will also be ordered to reduce their livestock production dramatically to halt pollution.

Next month the Dutch authorities will release a list of farms that ""” despite the BBB's shock victory ""” are still facing closure. 

Last week the EU's Dutch-born climate chief, Frans Timmermans, insisted imperiously: 'The Netherlands can only achieve the net-zero targets by buying out farmers and greening agriculture.'

Frans Timmermans, the EU's Dutch-born climate chief, said the only way the country could achieve net-zero targets was by buying out agriculture 

The contentious plan is for owners to be offered compensation from a £22billion government fund and barred from ever being 'animal keepers' in Holland again. If farmers refuse, compulsory buyouts and evictions will follow.

As the screw tightens, the system of issuing permits to farms has also been restricted by local agricultural ministries. Without one, a farmer breaks the law if he or she continues to keep animals. Banks are not allowed to lend to them. A farm lacking a permit loses value on the open market so it cannot be successfully sold.

The result? According to Holland's pro-agriculture activists, including the BBB, farm owners are fire-selling at a loss, emigrating, going bankrupt and even committing suicide as the country's farming system, once the envy of the world, slips into chaos.

The BBB's supporters have not been shy, using 10,000 tractors a time to block motorways, spraying manure at ministers' offices and even tossing flaming rubbish on to roads to highlight their distress.

Last year, two Dutch parents filed a case against police who shot a bullet at their 16-year-old son while he sat in a tractor at a farmers' protest. It narrowly missed the boy's head as the demonstration turned nasty.

These violent protests have taken place against an incongruous backdrop of Holland's famous traditional windmills (now outnumbered by turbines) and canal towns interwoven with immaculately tended pastures.

Remarkably given its size, Holland exports more food than any country in the world except America. Since the World War II, when the Nazis sought to starve the country into defeat, it has prioritised self-sufficiency in food.

Dutch farmers have become global experts in how to grow more on less land, methods copied by poverty-stricken nations to stop their people starving.

Yet now farmers find themselves on the frontline of the culture wars. Although the BBB does not call itself Right-wing, Donald Trump and Marine le Pen have both voiced their support for it.

Some believe that the BBB's triumph could spell the end of the international elite's passion for green diktats, often imposed against ordinary people's wishes.

Little wonder that Dutch political commentator Tom-Jan Meeus maintains that the climate-change policies long championed by the Dutch government are in 'big trouble'.

He believes that the BBB has harnessed Dutch voters' worries not only about the EU's green agenda, but also on uncontrolled immigration into the continent. (There are widely voiced suspicions here that state-seized farmland is being earmarked for housing newcomers.)

Even Holland's renowned agricultural 'innovation hub', Wageningen University, has turned away from traditional farming.

Bizarrely, it is investigating the potential of insects as food for both humans and whatever livestock is allowed to remain in Holland.

Under the headline 'Don't Say Yuck!', the university website proclaims: 'Our consumption of animal protein is the source of greenhouse gas and climate change.

'Alternatives, such as insects, can provide an economically viable, and interesting, solution to the world food problem""¦ Greenhouse gas emissions from farming insects are 100 times lower than those from pigs and cattle.'

The insects-for-food lobby, with Davos's World Economic Forum as its cheerleader, has put out ads featuring Hollywood stars gleefully devouring the unconventional foodstuff. One showed actress Nicole Kidman happily chomping down on a bowl of crickets.

All this further troubles Dutch farmers. They welcome the BBB's triumph, but still worry about their future in a country where the green lobby seems hell bent on feeding people insects instead of traditional meat.

One dairy farmer in Utrecht making Gouda cheese exported all over the world told the Mail cautiously this week: 'We have won the battle, but not the war.'

Another who believes the fight is not yet over is Nanda van den Pol, 29. She runs a family farm a short drive south-east of Amsterdam with her husband Harry.

Nanda van den Pol, 29,a dairy farmer who lives 20 miles south east of Amsterdam. She has been to the BBB protests

In their barn are 98 dairy cows who will go out to pasture once spring starts, and not come in again until October. Nanda is a middle-class BBB supporter who has been to the protests.

Her family farm sits nine miles from a Nature 2000 reserve that the EU says needs 'protection'. 

This makes Nanda and Harry's farm particularly vulnerable to closure. They, and farmers nearby, can no longer get bank loans because their future is so uncertain.

'In April, when the government releases its list of farms to shut, we could find three generations of work and investment disappearing,' she says. 'It is really scary.'

Nanda adds that Harry, 31, is devoted to his animals. 'He can tell which cow is another's aunt, which the niece, which is the sister or the cousin. I really question if he will be so happy farming insects,' she adds ruefully.

She knows of farmers who have taken their lives as they face losing their farms. Last summer in the Dutch village of Stroe, where Nanda's parents have 1,250 beef cattle, residents gathered to lay wreaths in a field for their compatriots who had died by their own hand.

The main farming lobby group, Land en Tuinbouw Organisatie, says suicide rates were 37 per cent higher in 2020 (as the anti-farm policies began to bite) than the average for the previous seven years.

Further north, in the province of Friesland, near the German border, lives Femke Wiersma, the BBB party's de facto second in command, on a smallholding with chickens, a pony ""” and her four children.

She is divorced, but met her ex-husband in 2010 on the Dutch version of the TV show A Farmer Wants A Wife.

A vivacious figure in a black mini-dress, Femke oversees the BBB's policies on farming and climate change. 'We are taking our responsibilities very seriously,' she tells the Mail at her kitchen table.

Femke Wiersma, the BBB party's de facto second in command, lives on a smallholding with chickens, a pony ""” and her four children

Femke believes ordinary Dutch people did not have a voice until the BBB came along. 

'We represent all classes. We have other policies outside farming, such as how to better control immigration, which many feel strongly about. There is clearly a feeling that state control has gone too far. The Government has let down their own citizens.'

Femke adds that ministers and civil servants ignore the fact that 'farmers are born, not made'. 

'My son of eight wants to be a farmer,' she says. 'I asked him to sort out the logs delivered and dumped in a huge pile outside the other day. He did it because he enjoyed it.'

At his family home in Creil, a village in the province of Flevoland, Peter Loeters would agree. He always wanted to be a farmer. Now his life is in a mess, he admits, as he shakes with anger about losing his hens.

He voted for the BBB but did not join the recent farmers' protests because he works all hours on an arable farm in Creil to earn money to pay the interest on bank loans still outstanding from the time he was running his own egg-producing business.

'I didn't have a big tractor to drive to The Hague, nor the time to protest. I was working hard to try to put food on our table,' he says.

He invites us into the family farmhouse to explain how he has been left in a cruel limbo by the Dutch government's green agenda.

His son, eight, and daughter, five, play with a train set on the floor and his wife, Maartje, begins to cry as she does the ironing. 

'Our worry levels are very high. I don't know what I will do if I cannot farm. It is what I am good at,' he says as he puts his arm around her.

'We have already lost so much because of the new hatred of farmers here in Holland.'

Warning to vegans: Diet of meat, eggs and milk is healthier than plant-based foods, major review finds

Vegan diets are 'less healthy' than including meat, eggs and milk in your meals, a major review has found. 

A report by the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which looked at more than 500 studies, concluded that animal sources of food offer 'crucial sources of much-needed nutrients'.

These include protein, fats and carbs, as well as iron, calcium and zinc, which are vital for health and development, it said.

However, these macro and micro nutrients are hard to find 'in the required quality and quantity' if following a vegan diet, according to the FAO.

It noted that meat, eggs and milk are 'particularly vital' among children, young people and older people, as well as pregnant and breastfeeding women. 

Meat, eggs and milk provide key nutrients such as high-quality protein, fatty acids, iron, calcium, zinc, selenium and vitamin B12, the report found

To assess the benefits of risks of consuming animal products, the FAO looked at more than 500 scientific papers and 250 policy documents.

It makes the study its most comprehensive analysis to date. 

'Terrestrial animal source foods provide energy and many essential nutrients, such as protein, fatty acids and several vitamins and minerals that are less common in other food types,' FAO deputy director-general Maria Helena Semedo and the body's chief economist Maximo Torero Cullen wrote in a foreword to the report.

It noted that plant-based 'meat', available in all major supermarkets, cannot replace animal products, is deficient in some essential nutrients and is high in fat, sodium and sugar.

Evidence suggests that in adults, yoghurt and milk consumption reduces the risk of all-cause death, high blood pressure, stroke, type 2 diabetes, colorectal and breast cancer and osteoporosis, the report states.

Leading cardiologists rank the 10 most popular diets in terms of heart health (look away now, vegans!) 



The report also found there was relatively solid evidence that egg consumption does not increase the risk of stroke or heart disease. 

Meanwhile, milk and dairy consumption during pregnancy promotes a healthy birth weight of the baby, evidence shows. 

And beef consumption was found to improve cognitive outcomes and protect against iron deficiency - which can cause dizziness, fatigue, headaches, an irregular heartbeat and pale skin. The report states that eating 72g of beef each day is safe. 

However, the authors wrote that even consuming small amounts of processed meat ""” such as deli meats, bacon and sausages ""” should be avoided.

The World Health Organization says there is strong evidence that processed meats increase the risk of bowel and stomach cancer.

However, the FAO called on the livestock sector to address an array of issues, such as deforestation, greenhouse-gas emissions and pollution, as well as unsustainable water and land use, poor animal welfare and overgrazing.

Professor Gunter Kuhnle, a nutrition and food scientist at the University of Reading, told MailOnline: 'One aspect are nutrient deficiencies, especially iron, zinc and vitamin B12 - meat is a good source for them.

'And iron deficiency is a problem for many women (especially young women) in the UK, so this is quite relevant.'

However Professor Kuhnle said those who lead a vegan or vegetarian diet can be 'perfectly healthy' and stressed it just requires 'more planning' to ensure they get the correct nutrients.

He added: 'The same applies to protein - meat always contains all essential amino acids, but not all plants do. 

'However, meat and animal products are missing fibre - which is important for health - and many plant bioactives which are believed to have a beneficial effect on health.'

Professor Kuhnle also warned of 'polarisation' in nutrition, where it is claimed a specific diet or food group is essential. He says the focus should be on humans eating a wide range of foods.

What should a balanced diet look like? 



Meals should be based on potatoes, bread, rice, pasta or other starchy carbohydrates, ideally wholegrain, according to the NHS

The Duchess of Edinburgh looked stylish as she stepped out in Berkshire today to meet agricultural students. 

The royal, 58, toured the Berkshire College of Agriculture near Maidenhead this morning, where she learned more about the course of studies. 

She got a front row seat as the students demonstrated their gardening skills, before completing a shearing demonstration with a flock of sheep. 

For the occasion, mother-of-two Sophie donned a smart look, with a pair of sage green trousers she's worn previously, which she paired with a cream wool blazer and a satin shirt. 

The Duchess, who is the wife of Prince Edward, has been multiplying event this week, travelling all over England to meet different communities, charities and businesses.

During today's visit, Sophie was the picture of pose as she made her way to the university. 

She paired her trendy trousers with tan leather espadrilles and a belt of a similar leather, which complimented the cream tones of her double-breasted blazer. 

Under her jacket, she wore a satin light pink shirt, which matched well with the shade of green of her trousers. 

The mother-of-two also accessorised with a raffia bucket handbag with a bright orange handle, a gold necklace and studded earrings with pink gems that matched the accents of pink in her shirt. 

Sophie wore her blonde tresses in an impeccable straight blow-dry with a middle parting. 

She wore a flattering day makeup, with a rosy blush and black eyeliner adding definition to her features. 

A touch of pink lipstick completed the look. 

She was all smiles as she arrived at today's engagement, meeting with the agricultural students in a green room where she learned more about their curriculum and training.

Sophie then was treated to a shearing demonstration were several students teamed up to shave a sheep. 

She appeared in great spirits throughout the event, and spoke with both student and staff. 

It's been a busy week for the Duchess so far, as she's been multiplying events arounf the country. 

Yesterday, the royal toured the Colwith Farm Distillery, near Crewell Moor, where she learned more about the business and toured their premises.

Earlier in the day, Sophie put her best foot forward as she met with the Children's Sailing Trust by Lake Trevassack 

Earlier in the morning, she had already met with members of the Children's Sailing Trust on the banks of the beautiful Trevassack Lake near Helston in Cornwall.  

Prince Edward's wife remained elegant, even as she put on a life jacket over a white blazer, which she paired with checked beige trousers. 

These coastal engagements were miles away from the garden party the Duchess attended in Buckingham Palace on Tuesday, which was hosted in the honour of the Not Forgotten Association's annual event for ex-service men and women. 

For the occasion, the royal recycled a grey ensemble she first wore to attend a military parade in Dorking, Surrey in 2017.

The elegant piece of outerwear - which is designed by one of Sophie's favourite fashion houses, Suzannah - has a V-neck cut and a chic silk bow at the waist. 

Sophie then teamed this with a matching light grey hat which was also by the designer.

The newly-appointed Duchess completed her ensemble with a pair of white silk high heels and simple jewellery. 

The royal swept her blonde hair into an elegant updo and opted for minimal makeup.

More than 13,000 cases of CANCER in US every year are caused by foods laced with toxic metals including CHOCOLATE and cereal, shocking study finds

Toxic metals found in foods like dark chocolate, leafy green vegetables, and baby food have, for the first time, been linked to thousands of cases of cancer annually in the US. 

Lead, arsenic, and cadmium levels in food have been rising in recent years as they seep into soil and water and contaminate crops used to feed particularly vulnerable populations like children.

For decades, these metals have been linked to cancers and other health problems - but until now, there has never been a number.

Now, researchers have found that 13,000 cases of bladder, lung, and skin cancers every year can be linked to contaminated foods.

Researchers found that foods highest in toxic metals like lead, arsenic, and cadmium included baby food, root vegetables like beets, rice, and dark chocolate

Metals occur naturally in the environment and can seep into soil and water, contaminating crops

Paradoxically, it was healthy foods like rice, wheat, and leafy green vegetables that were most likely to cause cancer. 

The toxic metal cadmium - found in foods like potatoes and dark chocolate - had a 'very high' chance of causing pancreatic cancer, which is notoriously difficult to detect and kills more than 90 percent of patients once it spreads.

The team called upon the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to enact stricter limits on metals in food and for the food industry to adopt safer practices, as these foods have higher than the recommended limits. They also urged stronger warnings to consumers. 

In January, the FDA issued a limit for lead of 10 parts per billion (ppb) in fruits, some vegetables and yogurt, and 20ppb in root vegetables - which include carrots, beets and potatoes - and dry cereal.

The agency also stated that the food industry should cap arsenic levels in infant rice cereal to 100ppb. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), drinking water should contain no more than 10ppb.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends daily cadmium consumption be limited to 0.0002 milligrams per kilogram.  

Dr Felicia Wu, lead study author and food scientist at Michigan State University, said: 'Results from these studies have important implications for food safety regulations, public health policies, and consumer awareness.' 

The team analyzed studies on humans and animals conducted between 2000 and 2023 on the effect of lead, cadmium, and arsenic on cancer and other illnesses like heart disease, kidney failure, liver toxicity, and developmental delays.  

They found that foods laced with metals were linked to 6,000 cases of bladder and lung cancers. Arsenic, in particular, also contributed to 7,000 cases of skin cancer.

Toxic metals like lead and cadmium have been linked to several brands of baby food 

The above graphic shows the 28 chocolate bars tested by New York-based nonprofit Consumer Reports. All were found to contain lead and cadmium. Consumer Reports compared levels of the heavy metal in about an ounce of the chocolates to the recommended daily exposure levels from the Californian Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment

Foods containing lead were shown to increase the risk of kidney, brain, bladder, breast, and stomach cancers. It was most strongly linked to kidney cancer, which affects 81,800 Americans every year and kills 14,890, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS). 

Typically, kidney cancer affects adults ages 65 to 74, and it's twice as likely to impact men over women. About 80 percent of patients are expected to survive for five years after being diagnosed. 

Lead was also linked to developmental effects in children, which is in line with other recent research. 

The CDC warns that young children exposed to lead can suffer hampered development of their brain and nervous system.

Around 2.5 percent of children under the age of five have been exposed to dangerous levels of lead, experts believe.

As a result, they may have slowed growth, learning, behavior, hearing and speech issues.

Lead is most commonly found in beets, chocolate, and baby food.

Earlier this year, the FDA warned that kids' WanaBana fruit puree pouches were high in lead after four children in North Carolina had 'extremely high' concentrations in their blood. 

The researchers also found that arsenic, which has been detected in baby food, seafood, rice, and mushrooms, was linked to a greater likelihood of developing skin and bladder cancer.

The lawsuit claimed the product deceived customers with allegations of being an all-natural product.

Skin cancer affects more than 5.4 million Americans every year, the ACS estimates, though more than 90 percent are expected to survive after five years.

Arsenic was also 'very likely' to lead to heart disease. It has also been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and higher chances of infant mortality.

The researchers also evaluated cadmium, a toxic metal found in nuts, potatoes, seeds, cereal grains, and leafy green vegetables like spinach.  

Of the cancers linked to cadmium, pancreatic cancer was the only type to receive a 'very high' likelihood. 

Pancreatic cancer is the third deadliest form of the disease in the United States, according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI). On average, just 12.5 percent survive after five years. Once it spreads, that figure drops to just three percent.

NCI estimates there will be about 64,000 new cases of pancreatic cancer diagnosed this year, along with more than 50,000 deaths. 

Cases are on the rise. In the US, the disease incidence has increased by one percent every year since 2000, the ACS estimates.

The disease has been dubbed a 'silent killer,' as symptoms, which include jaundice and abdominal pain, are often attributed to other diseases. By the time most patients catch it, it has spread to other organs, making it more difficult to treat. 

Other cancers linked to cadmium included prostate, renal, bladder, breast, and endometrial cancers.  

The study comes after an October report from the watchdog Consumer Reports found that one-third of chocolates had high levels of lead or cadmium, and every single one had detectable levels of the metals. 

This summer, Consumer Reports also sounded the alarm after finding that several brands of baby food, including Gerber, are still packed with lead, arsenic, and cadmium, despite the FDA recommending limiting these metals in baby food. 

Some states have started pushing stricter regulations for metals in baby food. In October, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill forcing baby food makers to test for metals and publish results on the products' websites. 

The researchers plan to conduct additional studies on the effect of toxic metals on long-term health. 

The studies were presented Tuesday at the 2023 Society for Risk Analysis Annual Conference in Washington, DC.

The skies above southeastern Mexico darkened last Tuesday afternoon as miles-long swarms of locusts flooded over MÃ©rida, the capital of the Mexican state of YucatÃ¡n. 

One Latin American newspaper covering the incident quoted the Book of Revelation 9:3, 'And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth, and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.'

But local officials were less dire, telling reporters that the locusts were expected to finish passing through the city in about two days without endangering local crops.

Technically known as the Central American locust (CAL), the insect is native to the region and hit YucatÃ¡n's capital from rural, vegetation-rich regions to its northwest.  

YucatÃ¡n, famously home to the infamous Chicxulub impact crater that heralded the apocalyptic end of the dinosaurs, is located far south of the US-Mexican border.

YucatÃ¡n, home to the Chicxulub crater that heralded the end of the dinosaurs, is located far to south of the US-Mexican border. The American southwest has faced 'Biblical' waves of Mormon crickets this year, but there's no indication MÃ©rida's locust swarm will reach the US

'I won't open my mouth again!' one local posted to X (formerly Twitter). 

The poster, described on the platform as a local tutor, joked that researchers in MÃ©rida have been 'barely studying Chicxulub's crater' and are already looking for another apocalyptic blow.

While the American southwest has suffered 'Biblical' waves of millions of Mormon crickets, killer bees and other insects this past year, there's no indication that MÃ©rida's locust swarm will reach the US, yet.  

Last year, however, a research initiative at Arizona State University came to the conclusion that the intensity of locust swarms is likely to 'dramatically increase' worldwide due to climate change ""” threatening crops and raising food prices.

According to local news reports from publimetro, the locust swarms were at their thickest in the western and northern areas of the state capitol.

YucatÃ¡n is frequently plagued by S. piceifrons locust swarms, which can consume a staggering 30 tons of vegetation per day, impacting 14.6 million acres of land, the state's locust program coordinator, Mario Poot-Pech, said in a recent report, adding 'the CAL is an old pest in Mexico'

Researchers from the US have developed an electronic version of a special neuron, unique to locusts, that allows them to react rapidly without using much energy. 

But the insects, known as the Central American locust (CAL) or Schistocerca piceifrons, were also spotted in the smaller nearby tows of Chuburna, Villas Oriente, TemozÃ³n Norte, and Colonia Gonzalo Guerrero.

'The CAL is an old pest in Mexico,' said Poot-Pech, who serves on the YucatÃ¡n State Plant Protection Committee, in that report, published this past February in the Journal of Orthoptera Research.

Climate conditions, like the status of the El-NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the current state of the local vegetation and the bug's natural predators are all indicators that Poot-Pech hopes to use to predict future locust outbreaks.

Videos of Tuesday afternoon's swarms were posted to Facebook by resident Gonzalez Jose and a local theoretical chemist, Professor Gabriel Merino, who runs the Merino Lab at Centro de InvestigaciÃ³n y de Estudios Avanzados Unidad MÃ©rida.

'The end of the world,' ('El fin del mundo.) Merino posted to X, potentially in jest.

Amid the cost of living crisis, researchers have discovered one in three Britons now have their own fruit and vegetable patch in a bid to become more self-sufficient.

Among the third of UK gardeners, the average amount are nurturing seven types of produce that they can then use in cooking, meaning at least three meals a week will contain ingredients grown in the garden.

The study, which was undertaken by gardening experts Miracle-Gro, also found that 80 per cent think that growing their own food would leave them more protected against the current shortages.

Last month marked a full year since monthly grocery inflation rose beyond four per cent as consumers named it their second most important issue behind energy costs and two-thirds said they were concerned about food and drink prices. 

The latest rise in food prices follows as half of the people in the UK have claimed to buy less food when shopping in recent weeks, figures released in late February showed.

The survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) demonstrated the rising cost of living caused people to cut back on spending, leaving a significant proportion of households struggling to afford to eat.

Half of the adults who took part in the survey over the two weeks to January 29 said they were buying less when food shopping, slightly more than the amount who said so in a previous survey.

Jayne Horswill, a spokesperson for Miracle-Gro, said: 'Growing your own food is an easy, cost-effective move which will not only save you a few pennies but also bring you joy when watching them grow - and eating them!'

A further one in five admit that they want to rely less on supermarkets, with 27 per cent of people agreeing that it is cheaper to grow their own fruit and vegetables.

However, Brits aren't just looking to save money by growing food in the garden as many also bake bread and cakes, make jam and chutney, while some even pickle their own chillies.

35 per cent of people also insists they want to grow their own fruit and vegetables at some point, while a further 5 per cent would love to have their own chickens and other livestock.

Strawberries and tomatoes at 21 per cent were found to be the most popular foods grown at home, followed by potatoes at 18 per cent and lettuce at 16 per cent.

There is also space in our gardens for herbs, with Rosemary coming in at 19 percent, Thyme with 17 percent and Parsley at 16 percent, which are all common in Brit's gardens.

Gardener and Chartered Horticulturist, David Domoney (pictured), 60, said that growing your own produce during the cost-of-living-crisis 'should not be underestimated'

Ms Horswill added: 'Our mission is to get more people to grow and spend time outdoors - because it's not only good for your mental health but also super easy to do, contrary to what people think.

'All you need is the right tools, an idea of what you want to grow and the correct guidance on how to grow - all of which we're here to help with.'

The culture of growing has moved on so far that 31 per cent of Brits believe that they could be self-sufficient and live off the food they've grown themselves if push came to shove.

Chartered Horticulturist and celebrity gardener David Domoney, said: 'Putting aside the obvious benefits of growing your own to combat the cost-of-living crisis and the unavailability in supermarkets, the process of growing and harvesting your own food has significant mental and physical benefits.

'Both keeping your body active, planting, tending, and harvesting, plus more vitamins and flavour from the freshly picked crops.'

The 60-year-old added: 'Growing your own should not be underestimated. In fact, everyone in the country should be reaping the rewards it brings.'

Mr Domoney, who co-presents the TV gardening programme Love Your Garden and is the resident gardener on ITV's This morning, said growing your own crops means that you will produce less plastic waste, eat healthier fresh food, save money, and benefit the plane as you engage with nature.

26-year-old Hannah Reid, a plant science student, uses her social media platform on Instagram (gingergrows1) to document her journey to growing produce in her garden, showing people just how easy it can be. 

The push for people to grow their own food comes as millions of Britons are bracing for the latest cost-of-living hit as an onslaught of bills are set to rise including broadband, mobile, water and council tax.

Households are facing price hikes which could leave the average family up to £700 worse off a year, according to research from the CEBR.

A study found that soaring bills and tax hikes due to come into effect from tomorrow will leave a family on a £50,000 annual income nearly £700 worse off - marking the sharpest blow to living standards since the 1950s.

The increase in these unavoidable bills comes as hard working Britons are already grappling with the cost of living crisis, including soaring inflation and food prices.

In a bid to spend less money in the supermarket, 30-year-old Richard Hollis from Cornwall grows vegetables in his garden.

He said: 'I love growing veg because it's so rewarding. It's incredibly relaxing tending to the plants you grow and after lots of love and care you get to enjoy the fruits of your labour on the dinner plate!

'The veg always tastes better when it's homegrown and straight from the garden, even more so when you get to share the harvests with your friends and family.'

However, those living in cities should not worry about missing out, as 25-year-old Chloe from London said: 'There's a misconception that living in an urban area means you can't grow your own fruit and veg but that's not the case! 

'Last year in our small London family garden we grew green beans, tomatoes, strawberries and a few herbs like rosemary.'

She added that they didn't need much space and 'it was so rewarding to grow our own, 

'They didn't need much space and it was so rewarding to grow our own! This year we've planned on growing the same thing but considering adding a few extras to our list - it will definitely help us save a few pennies, and make us enjoy our outdoor space even more'.

Jack Peat, 37, from South East London, acquired an allotment last summer after having been on a waiting list for over two years.

Although the plot was 'an overgrown mess' when he first took it on, Jack had a great time clearing the space and mapping out where to plant his crops.  

He said: 'It has honestly changed my life.

'It now has a small kitchen garden with herbs and edible flowers, curry beds for chilli's and garlic, two big plots for planting veg and even a luxury bug hotel with a rooftop garden full of eco-friendly wildflowers!

'I'm looking forward to bringing in my first full crop this year and expect it to be a bountiful harvest with a wide range of produce.'

The 37-year-old added: 'I use the cooking apples and onions to make brown sauce which has been a big hit with friends and family. In the cost of living crisis, a big Kilner jar of 'JP sauce' and other garden-grown treats helps keep the fridge well stocked for next to no money.'

Supermarket price inflations have risen to a staggering 17.1 per cent in the four weeks to 19 February, according to data firm Kantar, meaning shoppers face spending an extra £811 on average for food this year.

This year, one in four Britons are struggling to make ends meet, compared to one in five last year.

As British grocers ration vegetables due to shortages, researchers said sales were unlikely to be affected as shoppers usually bought fresh items in smaller quantities - making the prospect of growing produce at home all the more appealing.

Vicky Carter, 40, from Cornwall said: 'I grow my own because I find a huge sense of wonder and amazement when I get to harvest food that I have grown from seed. 

'It's highly addictive and the fruit and veg taste amazing, so much more flavourful than shop bought.'

While Tegen, 23, and her cousin Aillia, 11, both from Cornwall, said: 'Every year our family heads to the allotment to grow our own fruit and veg and it always turns out to be a bit of a competition, who can grow the biggest courgette or tomato for example!

'Growing our own fruit and veg is something that is very important to my family and has helped to build such a strong bond between all of the family generations. Not only do we enjoy growing fruit and veg as a family activity, but I really enjoy the experience of growing my own and watching food grow from food to fork.'

Livestock ripped to pieces. Carcasses with huge puncture marks deep into the bone. More than 1,300 reported sightings. And wildlife experts are taking them seriously... Does this new dossier prove big cats ARE on the prowl in Scotland?

It was just after 10pm and light was draining from the sky when the two villagers saw it. A very large black cat, the size, said one, of a labrador. 

Silently the animal stalked the edge of a field close to the village of Brydekirk, near Annan, before vanishing quickly out of sight.

Large housecat? Well-fed dog? Or could it be that the creature roaming this bucolic corner of Dumfriesshire was, in fact, a black leopard?

Astonishingly, Paul Macdonald, head of the Scottish Big Cat Research Team, who has already dispatched a field researcher to the area following the sighting last week, says that preliminary findings may point to the latter.

""˜We are convinced it was a genuine report and that it is something of interest to us given the size of the cat and the description of it,' he says.

Two people spotted a very large black cat, the size of a labrador sometime after 10pm the edge of a field close to the village of Brydekirk, near Annan, last week

Without photographic or DNA evidence however, last week's sighting may remain one of the thousands of unsubstantiated reports that have plagued the Scottish countryside for decades, and fuelled the eternal question: are big cats living wild in Scotland?

Recently released documents, however, might just put paid to the doubters.

Details of a number of sightings of big cats have been released by the makers of an upcoming documentary, suggesting that the thorny issue of whether or not panthers, lynx and black leopards roam Scotland has been taken seriously by several official bodies.

Researchers obtained 86 pages of correspondence and pictures under freedom of information laws from Police Scotland, the Scottish Government and NatureScot. 

They include tantalising reports about spates of livestock killings where sheep carcasses were stripped of meat in a way which didn't resemble fox or bird attacks, and one officer who recorded three to four sightings of a big cat.

Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) recorded a description of a big cat ""˜the size of a Labrador' which killed 36 sheep between August 2015 and January 2016, described as ""˜black or black/brown depending on the light' and ""˜panther/melanistic leopard'.

In April 2019, the charity Scottish Wildcat Action was told of a ""˜lynx type cat' near Montrose.

""˜The body was about the size of my female black lab,' the sender of an email said. 

""˜Back legs and chest were a lot more defined on the cat and muscular, short tail, maybe four or five inches long, all the little tufts of fur sticking out past the top of its ears.'

In November 2018, experts found a ewe carcass had been dragged 20 yards ""˜up a rock face'.

And a police officer told Scottish Wildcat Action about ""˜lots of reports of big cat sightings and activity on the north coast'.

The officer said: ""˜I was present when a ewe was brought in off the hill with two puncture marks on the front of her right shoulder and two at the back of it. The wounds were over three inches apart.' 

Other carcasses had ""˜very large puncture marks into bone'.

Local resident Andy McLachlan, 54, of Kirtomy with the remains of savaged sheep Swordly, near Bettyhill, in north Sutherland in 2012

Mr Macdonald, who has been steadily mapping all reported big cat sightings in Scotland over the past five years, is not surprised.

""˜We believe that there have been sightings fairly frequently over the years but we only receive the smallest proportion of those,' he says. 

""˜In fact, we conservatively estimate our mapping to document no more than 1 to 5 per cent of all sightings there have been in Scotland, and we have over 1,300 pinpoints on the map.'

That's a lot of big cats. Then again, when you consider that as of 2020, according to charity Born Free, 320 wild cats including 11 lions, eight tigers, 11 leopards, 18 pumas, ten cheetahs, two ligers (lion and tiger hybrid offspring) and one jaguar are currently being kept privately in the UK, it seems eminently possible that a few big cats may indeed be roaming the British countryside.

""˜There has always been an illicit trade in exotic species,' says Mr Macdonald. ""˜I think it's almost impossible to eradicate that completely. And as long as that's existed, then associated issues have existed with it as well.

""˜If owners ever find themselves in a place where financially or logistically, those big cats and animals become unsupportable, releasing them into the wild is a way of making them disappear quickly without having to actually destroy them.'

Dr Mark Jones, head of policy at Born Free, agrees. ""˜These figures are likely to represent only the tip of the iceberg,' he says.

""˜They only record those animals being kept and registered with a Dangerous Wild Animals licence. Born Free believes that many additional dangerous wild animals are being kept without a licence.' 

Although sightings of big cats in the Scottish gloaming go back to the 1940s, there was a huge uptick in the late 1970s following the Dangerous Wild Animals Act of 1976, which meant licences had to be sought from local authorities in order to keep anything other than a regular domestic pet.

Many owners of big cats decided that instead of giving their animals to a zoo or a wildlife park, they would prefer to release them.

That was certainly the case with Felicity the puma, who was caught by a farmer near Drumnadrochit in 1980. 

A big cat footprint was discovered by police and animal welfare experts in the woods near Balbirnie Park golf course in Fife in 2005

For years the area had been plagued with reports of a big cat killing sheep and even stalking Shetland ponies, until farmer Ted Noble, concerned about the threat to his livestock, set a trap to find out exactly what was going on. 

But even he was astonished to find a fully grown live puma in it.

The puma was taken to Highland Wildlife Park where it soon became clear that rather than a vicious wild animal, Felicity had clearly been a pampered pet, used to dining on cooked food and enjoying pats on the head. 

She died five years later at the age of 20, far beyond the lifespan for a wild puma, and was later stuffed and put on display in Inverness Museum and Art Gallery.

Former pets or not, however, one has to wonder: do big cats roaming wild - and Mr Macdonald estimates that most sightings in Scotland have been of pumas, lynx and melanistic (very dark brown or black) leopards - pose a risk to the public?

""˜There have never been any recorded incidents of direct impact on humans with big cats,' he says. 

""˜We believe that the reason for that is that actually, the UK offers quite an ideal environment, a perfect, lush, pretty, abundant environment with healthy cover.

""˜We think they're living comfortably enough. They're not desperate enough in terms of food shortage to see us as prey.

""˜Big cats on the whole tend to avoid human contact and will avoid any animal it can perceive as a threat. Because if a big cat is injured, it can't hunt, which means it dies.'

The makers of the documentary Pantherus Brittanica Declassified however, who released the documents on suspected big cat attacks, said the threat has more to do with a lack of responsibility.

""˜Any ""concerns for public safety"" linked to big cats on the loose were glossed over with the reassuring sentiment from one detective inspector who said he was ""happy that there's not an imminent risk to public safety if it's well fed"",' a spokesman for the documentary makers said. 

""˜But without reliable and accurate data on the number of big cats at large and precisely how well fed they are, this might do little to reassure anyone.'

Indeed. And it would seem that any big cat population could pose a threat to livestock. In addition to the attacks detailed in the FOI papers, Mr Macdonald says he has had reports of sheep and deer carcasses found up trees.

It's one of the reasons why Mr Macdonald says he keeps the precise details of many of the big sightings reported to him under wraps. 

A mystery beast believed to have savaged 18 sheep was caught on camera near Embo in Ross-shire in 2011

""˜There are certain gamekeepers and farmers that have made themselves known to us and made their intentions clear that they would shoot [a big cat] on sight.

""˜We have known of cats that have been shot and gone to ground over the years, and that includes black leopard and lynx. Unfortunately, we've not been able at this stage to recover any of those remains yet to get further evidence.'

Indeed, despite a lack of concrete evidence, Mr Macdonald also has a tantalising theory about the lynx, thought to have become extinct in Scotland 1,300 years ago, whose controversial reintroduction to the land is currently under proposal at Holyrood. He believes the plans are obsolete, because lynx are already here.

""˜I've had a meeting already at Holyrood with an MSP leading the debate on lynx reintroduction, and we see our evidence so far as presenting an interesting picture, and one that can potentially even change the question from one of reintroduction to one of boosting a current population,' he says.

""˜It's also one that counters any negative opposition to the whole idea of lynx being back in Scotland again, which is largely based on fearmongering that they will devastate flocks overnight. 

'But if they're already here, then the flocks are doing just fine.'

It's an intriguing thought, although one likely to irritate farmers and gamekeepers. Earlier this year, National Farmers' Union of Scotland president Martin Kennedy called on Holyrood to reject any proposals to reintroduce lynx, saying it was ""˜causing considerable angst and anxiety to those who keep livestock in Scotland'.

And yet while concrete evidence remains slim, certain big cat sightings over the years have caught the public imagination. 

In 2007, the ""˜beast of Banff', a big, panther-like black animal was spotted prowling above the Links in the Aberdeenshire town by a holidaymaker and a local.

In 2015, a dog walker on the outskirts of Galashiels spotted a large black creature running past her which she described as ""˜much bigger than my labrador' and with a long tail. 

Six years before, a local councillor saw a panther-like cat at the edge of a forest in the same area. He claimed to have watched it for long enough to convince him that what he could see was a genuine big cat. 

Possible big cat sighting taken in the Irvine area of Ayrshire in 2001

There have also been sightings of a big black cat in 2018 and 2020, 30 minutes down the road in Hawick.

In Angus there have been many sightings of a big cat roaming the area over the past 20 years, particularly near Edzell, where witnesses reported seeing a panther-like creature in nearby woodland. 

One man even claimed that in 2001 he came face to face with the animal lying on a wall by the roadside.

Not all sightings pan out, though. In Helensburgh in 2009 a ""˜panther-sized' cat was caught on video by an off-duty police dog handler wandering near a railway line. It turned out to be an over-grown and well fed domestic cat.

As for the Brydekirk sighting? When it was posted on a local social media page, it turned out that the two villagers who spotted something slinking along the side of a field last week weren't the only ones to have had an encounter with the creature.

""˜I watched a big black cat for ages in the field from the park a couple of months ago,' wrote one local. ""˜It looked bigger than a domestic cat but not as big as a medium/large dog.'

So is it another animal misidentified? Or yet more evidence that there really ARE big cats on the loose in our countryside...

Scientists have called for zealots to stop pushing vegetarian and vegan diets on to people, warning that meat is crucial for a healthy lifestyle.

Almost 1,000 academics from leading universities across the world have signed an initiative which argues that livestock farming is too important to 'become the victim of zealotry'.

Publishing in the academic journal Animal Frontiers, as part of a collaboration between professional animal science societies, dozens of experts looked behind new claims that eating meat causes diseases, as well as being harmful for the planet.

It comes amid a bigger push from campaigners to take up a plant-based diet, with initiatives such as Veganuary and Meatfree Mondays.

Further to this, the medical journal The Lancet published a paper The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factor Study in 2020, where they said a high red meat diet was responsible to 896,000 deaths globally.

Almost 1,000 academics from leading universities across the world have signed an initiative which argues that livestock farming is too important to 'become the victim of zealotry'

Researchers found, however, that it is hard to replicate the nutritional content of meat.

It added that those who live in poorer communities and have a low meat intake often suffer from a number of nutrient-deficient diseases such as stunted growth, wasting and anaemia, The Telegraph reports.

Researchers in Animal Frontiers said that unprocessed meat is responsible for providing B12 vitamins, omega-3 fatty acids, and minerals, such as iron and zinc, as well as supplying retinol.

The paper suggested that the link between red meat and disease was almost eradicated when it was combined with a healthy diet, leading to the suggestion it was the rest of the diet that is the cause behind health issues.

One the authors of the peer review, Dr Alice Stanton from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, explained that peer reviewed evidence showed that the Global Burden study's claim was 'fatally scientifically flawed'.

She added: 'Removing fresh meat and dairy from diets would harm human health. Women, children, the elderly and [people on] low income would be particularly negatively impacted

'Livestock-derived foods provide a variety of essential nutrients and other health-promoting compounds many of which are lacking in diets even among those populations with higher incomes,' the declaration states.

'Well-resourced individuals may be able to achieve adequate diets while heavily restricting meat dairy and eggs. However this approach should not be recommended for general populations.'

Another one of the reports author's Dr Wilhelm Windisch, of the Technical University Munich, added: 'One-sizefits-all agendas, such as the drastic reductions of livestock numbers could incur environmental and nutritional consequences on a massive scale.'

When you lift a forkful of food to your mouth, whether sitting down for a meal with family or chewing on a takeaway burger while scrolling through your phone, you probably think it's your decision.

This is especially true if you are eating something you know is not good for you. The guilt you experience may be part of an internal conversation you have been having for years, berating yourself for poor decisions and failures of willpower.

And even though this reproachful voice makes you miserable, you believe it. You have free will, after all. So why do you keep making the wrong choices?

Here's why. You are not free. You are part of a system so vast, so complex, so powerful and so intimately woven into everyday life that you hardly even know it's there. Every choice you make, everything you buy and eat, is informed by the tweaking and nudging of this giant machine, in which each of us is an unwitting cog.

The food system is no longer simply a means of sustenance. It is one of the most successful and most innovative industries on Earth ""”but one that is taking a terrible toll on our bodies.

Over 80 per cent of processed food sold in the UK is unhealthy ""” low in fibre and high in salt, refined carbohydrates, sugar and fats. This is not because food manufacturers are evil: it is a simple matter of supply and demand.

Because our species evolved in a world where calories were hard to come by, we are predisposed to pounce on anything high in fat and sugar.

That means unhealthy food is easier to sell. Companies therefore invest more into developing and marketing it. This in turn expands the market further still. The bigger the market, the greater the economies of scale.

As a result, highly processed foods are on average three times cheaper per calorie than healthier food. We live in a cornucopia of cheap, unhealthy, processed food of a kind we find hard to resist, trapping us in what I call the Junk Food Cycle.

The food system sits right at the centre of many of our current problems. It is making us ill, which makes us less productive, which is dragging down the economy.

Because our species evolved in a world where calories were hard to come by, we are predisposed to pounce on anything high in fat and sugar. That means unhealthy food is easier to sell. Companies therefore invest more into developing and marketing it

A report last year by the Institute for Public Policy Research found that 2.5 million people were off sick from work: more than at any time since records began in the 1990s. (Although this statistic reflects the fallout from the pandemic, it also illustrates the underlying ill health of the nation.)

Almost every form of long-term illness, from back pain to cancer and even depression, is either caused or exacerbated by our bad diets.

In 1950, less than 1 per cent of the UK population was clinically obese. Today, that figure stands at 28 per cent. Are we to believe that, in the intervening years, the British public has suffered a massive collapse of willpower? Of course not. People haven't changed; the food system has.

That system has its origins in the decade after World War II, when, with populations predicted to shoot up dramatically, humanity faced an existential problem: how could it grow enough food to avoid mass starvation?

Out of nowhere came a brilliant (and little known) American botanist by the name of Norman Borlaug who, through genetic engineering, managed to breed a rust-resistant, short-stemmed wheat with astonishing yields, producing three times the quantity of grain from the same area of land.

By adopting Borlaug's more productive methods, farmers around the world saved billions of people from starvation. This is what became known as the Green Revolution

Sixty per cent of adults in this country are now overweight or obese, and by 2060 that proportion is expected to reach 80 per cent. The costs of this man-made disaster are hard to overstate

On the other hand, its side effects are making us seriously ill. The food system we created prioritises quantity over quality. We have changed our diet to match this system, and this diet is now making both us and our planet ill.

But it's not just abundance of food that has created this landslide. It's also the particular nature of the food.

Biologically, we are still hunter-gatherers. If you have to search for everything you eat, it makes sense to look for things that give you more calories than you expend.

Honey, for example, contains six times more energy than an equivalent weight of berries. When we eat honey, our taste buds respond with intense pleasure: a natural feedback mechanism to reward us for finding such a bountiful source of energy.

This craving is strongest when fat and sugar are combined in a ratio of 1 to 2: the ratio found in breast milk. Manufacturers use this formula in ice cream, milk chocolate and biscuits, knowing that we find it irresistible. Even allegedly savoury products, such as ready meals, are often packed with sugar and fat to give them a ""˜moreish' flavour.

As well as being easy to sell, in larger quantities, this kind of food is cheap to make. The Green Revolution begun by Borlaug has created an abundance of sugar, flour and vegetable oil. For good commercial reasons, therefore, companies invest a lot of money into researching, developing and promoting foods that chiefly consist of these ingredients. This research is intended not just to capture a bigger slice of the market, but to grow the market itself. Young marketeers are taught about the ""˜consumption effect' ""” meaning that consumers who have more food in their home will eat more of it.

Promotions such as the classic BOGOF deal (""˜buy one, get one free') are designed to persuade shoppers to buy and take home more than they intended. Research has found that BOGOFs increase purchases of a product by an average of 15 per cent. And if you run a BOGOF on chocolate, customers will on average consume almost twice as much.

The average Brit now consumes five times more crisps than in 1972. We also eat 1.5 times the amount of sugary breakfast cereal.

The food system we created prioritises quantity over quality. We have changed our diet to match this system, and this diet is now making both us and our planet ill

In 1980, 57 per cent of the average household budget in this country was spent on fresh ingredients to cook at home. This has fallen to 35 per cent. We now get 55 per cent of our total calories from ultra-processed foods.

It's not all the fault of the manufacturers. In most modern households, both adults have to work, just to pay the rent or mortgage. Over the past 60 years, the average time spent preparing an evening meal has gone from one and a half hours to just over 30 minutes.

And the less we need to cook, the less likely we are to learn to cook, which makes us more and more dependent on convenience food.

The fruit and veg market in the UK is now worth a measly £2.2 billion per year, whereas confectionery alone ""” one small section of the processed food market ""” is worth £3.9 billion.

The World Health Organization has created a ""˜Nutrient Profile Model' to score how healthy or unhealthy products are. It gives a cut-off, below which it suggests products should not be advertised to children. A massive 85 per cent of the products of the 18 largest food and drink companies fall below this threshold.

They are making almost all their money from ice creams, sweets, sugary drinks, crisps, biscuits, cakes and highly calorific, sugary and fatty ready meals and sauces.

Food companies, like consumers, have become trapped in this cycle. What are company bosses supposed to do? If they stop making and selling unhealthy foods, someone else will. They will lose their competitive edge.

Behind the scenes, several company bosses have told me they would welcome government legislation to reduce junk food sales.

They know the food they are selling is terrible for their customers, and they want to do the right thing. But they need a level playing field. They can't act alone. They can't even be honest ""” at least in public ""” about what they know. Any CEO who called for stricter government legislation on junk food would be sacked.

But something has to be done. Because, as a result of the food we eat ""” and are encouraged to eat by those who sell it to us ""” we face a health crisis of giant proportions.

It gives a cut-off, below which it suggests products should not be advertised to children. A massive 85 per cent of the products of the 18 largest food and drink companies fall below this threshold

It is a bizarre fact, but commercially unsurprising, that in the UK you can buy 28 different kinds of KitKat. They are easier to sell than kale.

This is one reason why diet-related disease is now the biggest cause of avoidable illness and death in the developed world.

By 2035, the NHS is projected to spend more on treating type 2 diabetes, just one condition caused by bad diet, than it does on all cancers today.

For almost all of human history, it was hard work satisfying a big appetite. There simply wasn't enough food around. But since the Green Revolution, we have developed the opposite problem: highly calorific food is so cheap and ubiquitous that we have a struggle not to eat it.

Over the past half-century, as we have consumed more of this food, we have become heavier. Everyone, even the naturally slender, has put on some weight, but those with a genetic predisposition to lay down fat began to tip over into obesity and then into severe obesity, resulting in the ""˜obesity epidemic' we are now experiencing.

Fat is a wonderful thing: it is light, stores lots of energy and keeps us warm. It acts both as a petrol tank and as insulation. We all need some fat on our bodies. But too much of it makes us less mobile, liable to overheating and prone to all sorts of physical malfunctions.

Sixty per cent of adults in this country are now overweight or obese, and by 2060 that proportion is expected to reach 80 per cent. The costs of this man-made disaster are hard to overstate.

Already, the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) estimates that the UK economy loses £74 billion a year in lost workforce productivity, shortened lives and NHS costs because of conditions related to excess weight.

No other avoidable cause of illness, not even smoking, steals so many years of life from us.

And before it kills us, it makes us miserable. The side effects of obesity include depression, anxiety, infertility, high blood pressure, painful joints, breathlessness and broken sleep. That's before we even get to the big ones: cancer, dementia, heart failure and type 2 diabetes, which has its own attendant risks of blindness, peripheral neuropathy and limb amputation.

It's extraordinary that there isn't public uproar about this. Imagine if a new virus started killing and disabling people on such a scale, and with no end in sight.

Unlike Covid, however, the plague of diet-related disease has crept up on us stealthily, and under the seductive guise of ""˜choice'. We appear to have fallen into the trap where a system slides into dysfunction gradually, so that no one panics until it is too late.

Government-endorsed solutions turn out to be not just wrong, but counter-productive.

""˜Better education on diet ""” and exercise.' That's the panacea often presented, with the underlying belief that we are getting fat and ill because we are too lazy to take exercise, and too ignorant to eat well. If only we were better informed about healthy eating, and more conscientious about getting up off our enormous bottoms, the obesity crisis would melt away.

But these suppositions are demonstrably false. The truth about many forms of exercise is that they're great for improving muscle tone, lowering blood pressure, protecting against heart disease and so on, but not for bringing down weight.

Every January, people take out gym memberships in droves, but when the scales don't budge, they become disheartened and give up. The amazing things that exercise can do are eclipsed by the one thing it can't.

As for education, numerous studies show that the British public already know what a healthy diet looks like. More than 90 per cent of us know we should eat ""˜five a day' of fruit and vegetables and restrict our intake of foods that are high in fat, sugar or salt. We don't need any more preaching on this.

No, the inescapable fact is that we are getting fatter and more unhealthy because we live within a dysfunctional food system. Over the decades, the abundance of salt and sugar in processed foods has retrained our palates, so that we now expect it in everything we eat. Adults in this country consume an average of 50g of sugar a day. That's 20g over the recommended limit.

Children aged 11-18 eat even more: an average of 55g a day. This means they are getting 12 per cent of their daily calories in the form of sugar.

Ultra-processed foods tend to contain the same sugars, oils and starches that you'll find in natural ingredients such as butter, sugar and honey.

But instead of being used sparingly, these ingredients make up the bulk of the dish.

The British eat more ""˜ultra-processed' food than any other European country: it constitutes 57 per cent of our diet (compared with just 14 per cent for France and 13 per cent for Italy). These foods are chiefly composed of cheap sugars, oils and starches, and go through multiple stages of processing. They contain ingredients unfamiliar to domestic kitchens, such as soy protein isolates or dextrose. Colourings, emulsifiers, flavourings and other additives are used to make the products better-looking, tastier, more stable and longer-lasting.

All this is designed to make the end result both cheap and extremely ""˜moreish'.

Foods in this group include most shop-bought biscuits and cakes, mass-produced bread, reconstituted meat products, mass-produced desserts, some vegan sausages and burgers, and many ready meals. So what is this ultra-processed diet doing to our bodies? It is known to have a disproportionate effect on weight and health, compared to equivalent food cooked from scratch.

Yet in tests ultra-processed food also came over as tasting extra-delicious, meaning that people found it much harder to control their intake and we eat more of it.

The result? Whereas the average person, globally, eats 35 tonnes of food over a lifetime, Americans eat more than twice that amount ""” and we Brits are not far behind.

In modern Britain, the way we eat is one of the clearest markers of inequality. Children from the least well off 20 per cent of families consume around a third less fruit and veg, 75 per cent less oily fish, and a fifth less fibre than children from the most well off 20 per cent.

Children in the most deprived tenth of the population are three times more likely to have tooth decay at age five, compared to those in the richest decile, and nearly twice as likely to be overweight or obese at age 11.

Their parents are almost twice as likely to die from a diet- related condition.

Dietary ill health is a major reason why, at the height of the pandemic, people in the most deprived areas were twice as likely to die from Covid. Yet nutritional medicine remains a chronically underfunded area of health research.

People who want to lose weight often find themselves trapped in a vicious circle. Determined to take control of their weight, they go on a diet ""” to which the food manufacturers respond commercially with products that are marketed as ""˜healthy' or ""˜slimming'.

Usually they are nothing of the sort. ""˜Low fat' tends to mean high in sugar or starch, but it never says so. A snack that is sickly with concentrated fruit sugars can still carry the pious boast: ""˜Free from added sugar'. Nutritional values ""” calories, salt, sugar, etc ""” are given ""˜per portion', even when a portion bears no resemblance to the quantity of food on offer.

We cannot break out of the Junk Food Cycle without changing the system itself.

The Government needs to take meaningful action to rebalance the commercial incentives within the food system, so that good food becomes more profitable, and junk food less so.

It could start by introducing restrictions on BOGOFs and the advertising of junk food to children before the 9pm watershed. The Government promised to do this back in 2020.

We are still waiting, despite 83 per cent of the British public wanting these measures.

Under pressure from food companies, advertisers and free-market ideologists, the Government appears to have lost its nerve. Legislation has been delayed three times, and continues to languish in the long grass.

One of the arguments put by those opposing the watershed is that junk food adverts don't actually influence what a child eats.

It's a strange proposition. Why do companies spend so much money on advertising if it doesn't work?

For some years now I have been agitating for the Government to intervene in our malfunctioning food system.

People often ask me, in a pitying tone, whether I really think politicians will act.

The answer to this is yes. They will have to, eventually. The only question is how bad things will get before they do.

EU health chiefs pull apart ultra-processed food warnings: Studies warning of increased heart attack and stroke risk should be 'considered with caution'

EU health chiefs have warned studies on ultra-processed foods claiming they can be seriously damaging your health, should be 'considered with caution'.

There are ""˜uncertainties' over the data in the studies and the ""˜usefulness' of the term ultra-processed foods, the EU-funded European Food Information Council said.

The warning was issued following two studies published this week linking ultra-processed foods, which are those containing preservatives, sweeteners and artificial colours, to an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes. 

But British dieticians said the term ultra-processed is being 'demonised', 'overused' and 'not explained well', causing unnecessary confusion and worry among members of the public.

They told MailOnline they want UK health chiefs to issue a similar clarification to soothe public fears.

Experts warned that the UK faces a 'tidal wave of harm' from the over-consumption of ultra-processed food, after two studies suggested they raise the risk of heart attacks and strokes, but dietitians argue this classification is causing confusion

One, Dr Duane Mellor, said the recent hyper-focus on ultra-processed food (UPFs) was unhelpful and British health authorities should step-in to clear the confusion.  

'They need to explain carefully and clearly that the term Ultra Processed Foods, is getting a lot of attention at the minute, but it is possibly being overused, and not explained well,' he said.

While he acknowledged the food industry needed to use processing methods that produced healthier food, the panic over UPFs wasn't helping. 

'We need a food system which supports our health, but by getting consumers to worry or not worry about UPF is not tackling that issue,' he said. 

He added that avoiding ultra-processed foods is not helpful for some people, for example, those with poor appetite or illness who need to consume nutritional supplements while they recover.

Instead, he suggested providing advice on what we should be eating more of such as fruit, vegetables, nuts and seeds which have been consistently shown to be associated with a decreased risk of heart disease.

Nutritionists split food into three groups based on the amount of processing they have gone through. Minimally processed foods, like apples, are usually exactly how they appear in nature. Processed foods, like apple sauce, have gone through at least one level of processing that has changed their original form. In contrast, ultra-processed foods like apple jelly babies, have gone through multiple levels of processing and are usually full of extra fats, colours and preservatives

Instead of telling people to avoid all ultra-processed foods such as mass produced bread and baked beans, pictured, more advice should be provided on what we should be eating more of such as fruit, vegetables, nuts and seeds

Dr Mellor also stressed that we need to understand what we are eating so we 'don't falsely demonise all food ingredients'.

For example, although he admitted sweeteners may have 'a modest effect on how are bodies work', they can be used as a way of reducing sugar intake, which can help people avoid problems like obesity and diabetes. 

Other chemicals used in ultra-processed foods such as emulsifiers can change gut health.

Dr Mellor said: 'Emulsifiers are a wide range of compounds from synthetic compounds such as polysorbate-80 which has been linked to alterations in gut health through to lecithin which contains choline which has been shown in some circumstances to be beneficial to health.

'We need an open conversation about additives and understand that about these effects.'

Another expert, Professor Gunter Kuhnle, does not think we need a warning against ultra-processed foods, instead he wants to see more research.

The food scientist, based at Reading University, said there is currently no reason to worry people over ultra-processed food.

He explained that some ultra-processed foods such as soft drinks are associated with increased risks, but with other foods such as massed produced wholegrain bread, it shows a reduced risk for some diseases.

He said: 'Such a warning would achieve little but create uncertainty among consumers - there is already confusion about the distinction between processed and ultra-processed foods.

'The additives have been assessed by many different agencies and found to be safe in the amount consumed.

'If there are data that suggest otherwise and have not been reviewed, they should be sent to EFSA and FSA so they can assess them.'

However, some doctors are calling for warning labels to be slapped on ultra-processed foods due to the dangers it poses to our health.

Dr Chris van Tulleken told MailOnline the new studies added weight to calls for a warning label system in the UK to ward people away from eating them.

Meet the chart-topping electro DJ who became a revolutionary National Trust farmer with a mission to transform the way we grow food

On the day that changed my life, I found myself sitting bedraggled in an eastern European airport.

A few hours earlier, I had been DJ-ing atop a faux Greek temple whilst a mankini-clad microlight pilot dropped confetti on the dancing crowd.

Now, with a ten-hour trip home, I picked up the only magazine in English I could find and came across a disturbing article about the unforeseen health and environmental consequences of our industrial food system.

It was a call to action and contained the line: 'If you don't like the system, don't depend on it.'

At the time, life's unpredictable path had taken me to rural south-western France, where we lived in one of the seven north-south valleys that shape the Gers region.

My friend Tom and I formed a band called Groove Armada and had the good fortune to make albums and perform all over the world

True, our son Theo's first word was 'tracteur', as he pointed to the farm traffic that passed the kitchen window. But I was completely divorced from the landscape, with no understanding of even the most basic seasonal flow of a farming calendar.

Now, inspired by the article, I decided to have a go at growing my own food. Armed with a 1976 Guide To Self-Sufficiency by John Seymour and with the help of our farming neighbours, a corner of the garden was prepared. I built a small greenhouse and, for the first time in my life, planted some seeds.

From the moment I saw seeds become plants and plants become food, I was hooked. Why wasn't this miraculous process the first thing I had been taught at school?

This was the start of journey which would leave me convinced that solutions to our health and environmental problems begin with the way we grow food.

This conviction, and how to make it a mainstream reality, set me on a path from DJ to an unlikely French farmer and baker, and on to becoming a tenant of a National Trust farm, discussing soil health with Jeremy Clarkson.

But all of this was unimaginable as I grew my first vegetables. At that point, music was my life: in 1997 my friend Tom and I formed a band called Groove Armada. Since then, we'd had the good fortune to make albums and perform all over the world. Festivals, nightclubs, after-parties ""” a DJ's life is a parallel universe, and a world away from the quiet miracle of vegetable seedlings.

Happily, my new-found feeling of wonder about natural food production survived the difficulties of my early vegetable growing; the prototype mobile greenhouse that was blown on to the road, the sheep, ducks, rabbits and wild boar that relentlessly tested my attempts at fencing. Combined with beginners' incompetence, it made for challenging moments.

But, eventually, that patch of land grew into a small market garden, productive enough to begin selling vegetables at the local market.

As a novice English grower, selling food to French people was nerve-racking. It got off to a terrible start when a sharp-eyed lady spotted that I'd undersold her and broadcast this to the whole market. It was news to me that brand-new scales need calibrating and was a tough reputational blow. But in time, a reliable supply of tasty vegetables built up loyal customers.

I decided to have a go at growing my own food. Armed with a 1976 Guide To Self-Sufficiency by John Seymour and with the help of our farming neighbours, a corner of the garden was prepared 

I'd head off for DJ gigs with John Seymour's book still tucked in my record bag and amidst the sweat, noise, and lasers, find myself thinking about topsoil ""” in one teaspoonful of which there are a greater number of living things than there are humans on Earth.

As my understanding of soil grew, so did a sense of impending crisis. Great civilisations have fallen because they failed to prevent the degradation of the soils on which they depended. A post-war miracle has, for now, saved us from the same fate, but with dramatic, unforeseen consequences.

In 1939, Britain was importing 70 per cent of its food. As German U-boats began to sever these supply lines, the ensuing crisis unleashed an extraordinarily rapid increase in domestic food production; 66 per cent more wheat and barley in three years.

By the end of the war, a botanist from Iowa called Norman Borlaug had revolutionised farming.

Growing up during the Great Depression, he had seen hunger close up and set himself a lifelong mission to ensure people were fed. Breeding wheat varieties suited to newly available fertilisers and pesticides allowed him to bypass any deficiency in the soil, creating a system that massively increased production. Dubbed 'the Green Revolution', Borlaug's miracle spread around the world.

Jeremy Clarkson and I walked out to look at his fields, swapping tales of our Doncaster youth 

Combined with the wartime emphasis on production, by 1986 the New York Times reported 'Western Europe's grain mountain... stands at close to 17 million tons, stockpiled in regiments of ugly concrete silos that disfigure the countryside'.

My musical career began with the Doncaster Youth Jazz Orchestra just when the grain mountain was hitting its peak. My parents came from families that had known genuine hardship. For them, the abundance of the modern supermarket must have been an extraordinary thing. For me, food was something I took for granted.

Until picking up that article in the airport, I'd never considered grain mountains, or that behind them lay farmers reduced to the tightest of margins, or a 68 per cent decline in wildlife during my lifetime ""” equivalent in human terms, to killing off everyone in North and South America, Africa, China, Australasia, and Europe. Or that agricultural run-off is a greater source of water pollution than sewage, and the NHS crisis is largely a crisis of poor nutrition.

These uncomfortable truths combined with my new-found love of growing food led to another pivotal moment: I decided to sell the publishing rights to the songs I had written, a musician's pension, to finance the purchase of a nearby farm in France.

The first few years were a disaster. I quickly came to appreciate the vast array of skills that were required to be a farmer. I also realised that I didn't have them.

'I wanted to farm without chemicals but didn't have a plan to improve the soil to make that possible'

Under a tsunami of tractors, grain cleaners, seed drills and other large pieces of complex kit, I was overwhelmed.

When I stopped using the chemicals on which the previous owner had depended, it revealed that the soil was much better at growing weeds than crops.

Familiar weeds cover post-industrial wastelands for a reason; they are pioneers, able to thrive in poor conditions, and pave the way for the next wave of species. But these pioneer plants suited to poor soils were proving nightmarish for me.

I wanted to farm without chemicals but didn't have a plan to improve the soil to make that possible. As I struggled to make it work, the farm bills rolled in relentlessly. Farm work began when weekend DJ work often finished ""” at dawn.

I was lucky to be able to prop up finances with these gigs but, after a few years I was broke, exhausted and humbled. There seemed no option but to cut our losses and sell the farm. Until a book in a charity shop changed everything again.

An Agricultural Testament, published in 1940, was written by Albert Howard, an English botanist who travelled to India and collated decades of experiments about agricultural production methods.

Howard was part of a visionary pre-war group of farmers and researchers whose work began the modern organic movement.

He explained that one of the ways nature maintains its fertility is through a diversity of plants and animals, as we find in undisturbed woodland or grassland, and the opposite of large areas of single crops that dominate the farming landscape.

I decided to try again. This time, I realised part of the solution involved livestock. With a last roll of the financial dice, we bought some Sussex cattle.

I'd head off for DJ gigs with John Seymour's book still tucked in my record bag and amidst the sweat, noise, and lasers, find myself thinking about topsoil 

For a vegetarian of 20 years, who hadn't had a dog or cat, this was a steep learning curve, not helped by the neighbour's untrained collie chasing the cows all night and turning my orderly paddocks into scenes of desolation. The first time I drove a cow to the abattoir was a moment of deep introspection.

I wrestled with machinery and crop combinations that could regenerate and harness natural processes rather than fight against them.

Plants like beans or clover, able to capture nitrogen from the air and store it in the soil, lessening the need for fertiliser. Frost-sensitive plants to keep the weeds down then give way to winter cereals for which frost isn't a problem. Flowering plants to protect crops by attracting beneficial insects, just like marigolds do when planted alongside tomatoes.

The key is managing these combinations effectively, and there were many more setbacks than breakthroughs.

But when the breakthroughs came, like the field of rye and oats that was alive with bees feeding on the deep crimson flowers of the clover we'd planted as a companion, they were euphoric. Eventually, we were growing nutritious grains in fields full of life.

But I learned that growing was only one part of the story. When selling grain into the market there is only one measure ""” weight. Not how nutritious it might be, or the effects on the environment of how it was grown.

So, to realise the true value of our harvests, we installed a mill and produced flour ourselves.

But most local bakeries had baguette recipes they weren't keen to change. With flour sales stalling, I had to learn to bake bread. The flavour was great, but it took much longer to learn to make the loaves look passable. Even then, the local stores told me they already had bread suppliers.

As a last-ditch effort, I began distributing to families who had stopped eating bread because of digestive intolerances. The response was excellent and, from here, word of mouth eventually led to a farm shop, and a bakery team supplying local schools and restaurants.

As news of our efforts spread, I found myself delivering a loaf to the French president and, on a surreal day in an ornate Palais, becoming a Chevalier de l'Ordre du Merite Agricole. My son asked if I would be given a suit of armour.

Friends George Lamb and Edd Lees had helped me set up the farm bakery. Now came their pivotal moment, leaving jobs in TV and finance respectively to found Wildfarmed.

We wanted to build a community of farmers producing crops like we had in France, at scale and financially viable, without every farmer needing to become a baker as I had done. We wanted to give shoppers food choices that could positively impact their own health and that of the environment.

Crucially, we wanted Wildfarmed food not just to be the preserve of the wealthy. That is why we called our project The Long Road To Greggs ""” the day Wildfarmed flour is in a Greggs sausage roll, things are happening at a scale that can make a difference.

With Britain the place where we had the best chance of this working, I applied for the tenancy of a National Trust farm in Oxfordshire. The award of the lease came after a competitive process; stuck in France thanks to Covid, there were rounds of online interviews that the kids likened to an agricultural reality TV show.

Dawn, late May the following year, and I was terrified. Machinery issues the previous autumn and difficult weather meant that the fields were not at all how I wanted them to be. However, I was due to welcome some of the UK's best farmers, members of our new Wildfarmed community.

I will never forget the support I was given that morning. There were many dark days in France, with things not working and no one to turn to. Our farming community means this experience need not be repeated and is the thing of which I'm most proud.

Getting food from those farmers on to the High Street has involved the tireless support of Britain's artisan bakers, together with thousands of hours spent in fields with people from all tiers of the food industry, repeating the message that their procurement budgets shape landscapes.

It was an emotional moment when all this eventually came together, and my mum walked into M&S to buy a Wildfarmed loaf.

Last autumn, I was contacted by a potential new Wildfarmer, not far from me in Oxfordshire, concerned about the damage being done to his soil and fed up with the amount of financial risk on his farm relative to the return.

The farmer asked me over for a chat. I was surprised to find cameras rolling the moment I arrived. Jeremy Clarkson and I walked out to look at his fields, swapping tales of our Doncaster youth.

A good place to start is always to dig a couple of holes, one in the field and one by the fence where the soil hasn't been farmed. Often, the field sample is pale, slabby and carries a whiff of sulphur. The other is dark, crumbly, sweet-smelling. These differences matter. The darker sample shows its carbon content, carbon which means every hectare can retain hundreds of thousands of litres more water, reducing both flooding and drought-stricken crops.

Look at both samples under a microscope, and the lack of life in the field soil will be in stark contrast to the sample from the fence, where extraordinary creatures make those of the deep ocean look tame by comparison.

Infinitely complex and 500 million years in the making, healthy soil is the foundation of healthy plants, animals and people.

One in ten people living with diabetes, one in two getting cancer, floods, droughts, or the 1,500 UK species listed in the 2023 State of Nature report as at risk of extinction; none of this is inevitable.

It's a reflection of the fact that when we declare war on nature, we declare war on ourselves. This was never Borlaug's intention when he started the Green Revolution, but now with the understanding, tools, and science to do things differently, we have a choice.

There are brilliant farmers all over the world, growing abundant harvests of every type of crop, in ways which work with nature rather than fighting against it. It's not easy and there is no magic wand. Our Wildfarmed growers show amazing collective resolve in working through the difficulties of nurturing landscapes back to life.

But fields, food, and people full of life and health is a path we can take. When U-boats circled the UK in 1939, we completely transformed our food system in just a couple of years. Together, we can do it again.

I'm a climate activist and I want to see UK universities go vegan - serving meat to students is like offering cigarettes at a lung cancer conference

An animal justice campaigner has claimed that serving meat and dairy at universities is akin to offering cigarettes at a lung cancer conference.

Nathan Mcgovern and sheep farmer Karl Franklin, battled it out on Good Morning Britain today as they debated if British universities should be forced to go vegan.

Climate activist Nathan, 23, extended the face off to presenter Ed Balls, who repeatedly asked him if 'everybody has a duty to go vegan'. Nathan appeared to ignore the question and instead replied: 'I think we should be eating as sustainably as we possibly can'.

Karl branded Nathan's claims 'ridiculous' and encouraged viewers to 'buy British' which includes 'eating beef and lamb'. 

Leading the debate, Nathan said: 'I think we can all acknowledge that universities are sites of knowledge. They provide us with so much knowledge about the climate crisis and our food system. They have a duty to be acting on that research.

Karl Franklin (pictured), a sheep farmer, branded Nathan's claims 'ridiculous' and encouraged viewers to 'buy British' which includes 'eating beef and lamb'

'And what that research is telling us is that shifting to a plant-based food system is unequivocally a key solution to our climate and ecological crises.

'So what we're saying is: ""Universities, let's step up, make these transitions to plant-based catering"".

'You know, the way I see it - serving meat and dairy at a university is akin to serving cigarettes at a lung cancer conference.'

Ed then joined the debate and repeatedly asks Nathan if he believes everybody has a duty to be vegan. Ed looked markedly unimpressed as Nathan strategically avoided answering his questions.

Karl then branded Nathan's stance 'ridiculous' and said that 'beef and lamb makes our countryside look the way it does'.

He continued: '65 per cent of British farmland is grass - the last time I checked, we can't eat grass. Cows, lamb and sheep can so they're the best thing at producing sustainable and producing from the UK'.

Nathan conceded that the pair are '100 per cent on the same side', and said he's happy to support British farmers. 

However he soon argued that an 'adequate' subsidy system should be put in place to help farmers transition to plant based production - an idea that Karl branded as 'rubbish'.







Many people, including university students, took to X formerly known as Twitter, to weigh in on the controversy

Eager viewers took to X formerly known as Twitter, to weigh in on the controversy.

One person asked: 'If everyone went vegan what would happen to the world?'

Another said: 'It's fine to serve them as long as there are also vegan and veggie alternatives are offered alongside them'.

Someone else said: 'As a university student, no. It's a matter of personal choice. Yes, plant-based products should be made available, and I have indulged in some myself from time to time. But going completely plant-based would alienate some in the wider student body'. 

Meanwhile, one person explained: 'Firstly it's discrimination based on diet. Secondly I'm frustrated how the impact of insecticides and fertilisers on the environment are never mentioned, and of course the carbon footprint of producing those chemicals'.

Nathan hit headlines last year when he glued himself to a radio microphone while live on air.

The Just Stop Oil protester was speaking to Tom Swarbrick in LBC's Westminster studio when he glued his hand to the microphone.

He said that the station was 'not using' its 'massive platform' to inform listeners of the dangers of the climate crisis.

The broadcaster confirmed later that Mr McGovern had been questioned by police.

A Metropolitan Police spokesperson said: 'Police were called at 11:56hrs on Sunday, 3 April following reports a man had attempted to glue his hand to a microphone at a radio studio in Millbank, SW1.

'Officers attended and spoke with the informant who told them the man's hand had become unstuck before police arrived. They did not wish to support any further criminal action.'

Bill Gates is spending money on huge swathes of land, threatening farms and investing in fake meats under the guise of saving the planet while actually inflating net worth and trying to seize a monopoly on a vegan future, new book claims

Bill Gates' recent buying of American farmland is doing more for his bank account than the planet, a new book claims. 

Penned by bestselling journalist Seamus Bruner, the work also asserts the billionaire's investments in fertilizers and plant-based meats are doing little to slow carbon emissions as he claims, and come at the expense of everyday Americans.

A section of the just-released book titled Controligarchs, that hones in on this so-called 'war on farmers' elaborates on these claims.

There, Bruner writes how figures like Gates are monopolizing the nation's food supply with their purchases, paving the way for an at least partial takeover over the country's food system as families like the Rockefellers have done in the past.

Citing the Microsoft founder's recent investments in patented fertilizers, fake meat, and some 270,000 acres of American farmland, Bruner writes how Gates - an outspoken advocate for climate action - will capitalize on his speculations.

Bill Gates' recent buying of American farmland is doing more for his bank account than the planet, a new book that examines the influence of billionaires claims

The tech billionaire has quietly bought up 270,000 acres of farmland in 18 states - and 268,984 of multi-use land in 19 states in total, making him the biggest agricultural landowner in the US

'The takeover of the food system, like so many other control schemes in this book, began with the Rockefellers and was advanced by Bill Gates,' Bruner writes in his study of the influence billionaires have over Americans.

 'Like most of their monopolies - from oil to software and eventually biotechnology - the takeover of food is all about controlling the intellectual property of food production through trademarks, copyrights, and patents,' he continues.

He goes on to write about Gates' supposed connection to the Rockefellers through 'the Green Revolution,' a period of great increase in production of food grains in the US during the first half of the 19th century.

Those advances, Bruner says, were only made possible by millions of dollars of Rockefeller-funded research in the 1940s, which at the time had been billed to help solve the crises of poverty and starvation in the wake of the Great Depression.

While Bruner concedes this is true in part, the author goes on to write how the Rockefellers - currently valued at $8.4billion among 70 heirs - went on to take credit for the fruits of the effort, while deflecting blame for the negatives.

The negatives, he pointed out, included pollution created by pesticides, and the consolidation of small farms into sprawling operations - things Gates's investments appear to support. 

'The Green Revolution was simultaneous proof that problems like poverty and famine could be solved through human innovation and that the solutions, such as genetically modified pesticide-resistant crops, can present new problems,' Bruner writes.

A section of the just-released book hones in on this 'war on farmers', claiming Gates will soon capitalize on pollution created by pesticides, and the consolidation of small farms into sprawling corporate operations. A farm in North Dakota recently bought by Gates is seen here

Citing 'pollution, resource exhaustion and the consolidation of small-scale and family-owned farms,' the writer explains how he believes Gates is looking to obtain the intellectual property of food production through a series of trademarks, copyrights, and patents. Another part of the same potato farm, purchased for 13.5million last year, is seen here

In 2018, a 'Louisiana investor', later revealed to be Gates, paid $171 million for a large swath of farmland in the Horse Heaven Hill, making it one of the largest real estate transactions in recent memory

In 2014, Gates reportedly purchased more than 4,500 acres in Suwannee County, Florida, for nearly $28 million

Bill , whose house in the Medina area of Seattle is pictured, has built up a diverse property portfolio over the years. He bought farmland in Washington state in 2018

The farmland was bought by Gates and wife Melinda predominantly through their investment company, Cascade Investments. It is not connected to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which also works to help support farming

Citing 'pollution, resource exhaustion and the consolidation of small-scale and family-owned farms into giant corporate-controlled farms,' the writer explains how he believes history is now repeating itself and how he Gates is looking to obtain the intellectual property of food production through a series of trademarks and patents.

'Rather than take responsibility for the new problems,' he writes, 'the Rockefellers took all the credit for the crop abundance while blaming the new problems on the convenient scapegoat of climate change.

'Now, the Controligarchs [Gates and other investors] claim they can solve the climate crisis with new patented miracle products that happen to make themselves even richer and, once again, at the expense of small-scale independent farmers.'

Late last year, Gates defended his recent interest in agriculture on a Reddit AMA, after many accused him of buying 'the majority' of American farmland as part of a plot to cause food shortages.

'I own less than 1/4000 of the farmland in the US,' he wrote at the time, after snapping up several thousand acres across 18 states.

In his book, Bruner cites how Gates has invested millions of dollars in companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods - stocks that would likely rise in the event of a shortage. 

He claimed the businessman - the sixth person in the world with a net worth of $115.4billion - could reap the benefits with his other food-related investments.

'It should come as no surprise that while the peasants are expected to eat fermented fungi, lab-grown meats, and maggot milkshakes, the Controligarchs - with their private chefs - have no intention of doing the same,' Bruner writes.

'Bill Gates and Warren Buffett famously love eating beef burgers and steaks when Gates visits his mentor in Omaha,' he then points out, mentioning Gate's 93-year-old friend and fellow billionaire.

He adds that Mark Zuckerberg - another investor in alternative protein companies - 'likes smoking beef brisket and grilling pork ribs (from real cows and pigs) and says meats taste ""doubly better when you hunt an animal for yourself,""' to illustrate his belief the billionaires, Gates included, have ulterior motives.

At another point in the book Bruner comments on Gate's recent investments in the fertilizer industry, and how they come in conjunction with over $1 billion dollars spent on farms and the new technologies that run them.

Those assertions come months after United Nations initiative aimed at 'eliminating extreme poverty, reducing inequality, and protecting the planet' pushed to ban more traditional and affordable crop nutrients, leaving farmers irate.

Bruner notes how the restrictions on traditional fertilizer that the farmers argue would ruin them were only put into place 'after Gates and his buddies had secured the intellectual property for the replacement fertilizers.'

At another point in the book Bruner comments on Gate's recent investments in the fertilizer industry, and how they come in conjunction with over $1 billion dollars spent on farms and the new technologies that run them. In 2017, Gates reportedly bought a significant stake in 24,800 acres of land outside Phoenix, Arizona (seen here)

'For more than a decade, as he was targeting the fertilizer industry, Bill Gates has also been quietly buying up large swaths of American farmland,' the author states.

'All told, Gates has spent over $1 billion dollars on farm acquisitions and the Agenda 2030-compliant technologies they now employ.' Agenda 2030 is the aforementioned United Nations initiative

Bruner continues: 'When Gates buys tens of thousands of acres, he is not just buying the land ""” he is also buying the rights to water below ground. 

'In addition to farms (and the irrigation) and fertilizer, Gates has been hunting for sizable interests in water and water treatment ""” a crucial component when seeking to control the agricultural industry.'

In a statement sent Tuesday afternoon, a spokesperson for Gates slammed those claims - calling them outright 'false.'

The rep told DailyMail.com: 'Bill's farmland holdings represent less than 1/10th of one percent of the U.S. total. 

'For more than twenty years, his investment team has included American farmland in its diverse portfolio. 

'It's been a sound long-term investment with added value in agriculture and the jobs it generates for families across the country. 

'Regarding investment returns,' they added, 'Bill has pledged to give the majority of his wealth away in his lifetime. 

'Any money raised from farmland and agriculture investments will be returned to society through his philanthropy and dedicated to projects that have the greatest potential to improve and save lives around the world.'

Meanwhile, Bruner's book - which boasts the tagline 'exposing the billionaire class, their secret deals and the globalist plot to dominate your life - was released Tuesday, and is available for purchase both in stores and online.

EXCLUSIVEMormon church now owns $2BILLION of US farmland, with more acreage than Bill Gates and China combined: Huge land grabs in Nebraska and Florida spark backlash from local farmers

The Mormon church has sparked a fierce backlash from local farmers after snapping up around 370,000 acres of prime ranch land in Nebraska, with the Utah-based religion now owning at least $2billion of agricultural terrain across the country, DailyMail.com can reveal.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), commonly known as the Mormon church, has bought more land than anyone else in the state over the past five years, according to The Flatwater Free Press.

It now owns an estimated $134million worth of agricultural land in Nebraska and is on track to surpass CNN founder Ted Turner as the single largest landowner in the state if it continues its spree at the current rate.

But the church has provoked the ire of the Nebraska Farmers Union, whose president John Hansen told DailyMail.com that its land grab was driving up prices and forcing out local farmers.

'It's not fair competition when folks bring in that much outside money and bid against local farmers and ranchers,' he said.

The Mormon church owns at least $2billion worth of US agricultural land, according to DailyMail.com analysis of data collected by nonprofit newsroom Truth & Transparency. But other estimates based on current market values put the figure as high as $12billion

The church is already thought to be the largest private landowner in Florida, after it purchased nearly 383,000 acres of timberland in 2013, adding to the 290,000 acres of ranch land it already owned in the state.

Its total agricultural holdings in the Sunshine State alone are thought to be worth a whopping $884million.

It comes amid growing scrutiny over the church's finances, with a recent report estimating it could be worth as much as $1trillion in 20 years.

The secretive institution has been blighted by a federal investigation into its finances amid accusations by whistleblowers that it is misusing its vast reserves.

Even some of its own members have sued the church, accusing it of misusing hundreds of thousands of pounds of their donations.

A Mormon agricultural empire

The extent of the church's huge agricultural portfolio can be revealed following DailyMail.com analysis of data shared by nonprofit newsroom Truth & Transparency.

Unlike other nonprofits in the US, religious organizations do not have to publicly report their income or assets.

But Truth & Transparency identified church-owned companies to build a picture of church real estate holdings across the US.

Its findings show the Mormon church now owns around $2billion worth of farmland across the US, covering around 859,000 acres, more land than Bill Gates (270,000 acres) and China (383,935) combined.

But this is likely to be a significant underestimate as it only includes corporations definitively linked back to the church.

The Widow's Mite, a research group staffed by current and former Mormons with financial backgrounds, has estimated that the church owns around $12billion of agricultural land across the US.

This applies current market values to church holdings, rather than the Truth & Transparency data which uses assessed value in public records, hence the significantly larger figure.

Religious organizations do not have to publicly report income or assets, but Truth & Transparency identified church-owned properties to build a picture of its real estate holdings

The Widow's Mite, a research group staffed by current and former Mormons, estimated the value of church agricultural holdings based on current market values

Truth & Transparency puts the total value of Mormon land across the US, including agricultural ecclesiastical, commercial and other real estate, at $15.7billion, whereas The Widow's Mite believes it could be as much as $102billion.

The Mormon church has previously declined to comment on The Widow's Mite report because the 'main themes' come from 'anonymous accounts'.

But it signaled its intent on becoming one of America's biggest landowners when it beat Microsoft founder Gates to buy 12,000 acres of farmland in Washington in 2021.

The land, situated next to the Columbia River in Benton County, was bought through affiliate AgriWest for $210million.

The property generates revenue through large-scale farming of potatoes and onions and cattle herding. 

It also provides the landowners with access to water rights, an increasingly valuable asset in the context of climate change.

Angering the locals and accusations of secrecy 

But the church's seemingly insatiable appetite for land has upset some of the farming communities it has displaced.

Hansen said the Nebraska Farmers Union had nothing against the Mormon church, but was opposed to land grabs by large, outside corporations of any description.

'[The Mormon church] bought more farmland than anybody else in the last five years in Nebraska,' he said. 'That's a big deal.

'We support independent ownership of agriculture because that's the system that maximizes the economic, social and environmental benefits.

'So whether it's large outside corporations, insurance companies, churches, investment funds, whatever it is, that are coming in and buying up farmland, that's not as economically, environmentally, or socially beneficial.

'It's also land that individual family farmers or ranchers do not have the opportunity to own.

'It tends to drive up land prices, because these folks come in with deep pockets, and they can outbid local bidders.'

The farm is one of the largest almond growers in the Golden State, covering 17,000 acres and is estimated to be worth $369million

It has also rekindled controversy over the transparency of church finances.

The church uses both nonprofit and for-profit subsidiary companies to manage its real estate under a variety of names, making its tentacles hard to trace.

Sam Brunson, a church member and tax law professor at Loyola University, Maryland, said the church likely started purchasing land in Nebraska through its nonprofit, Farmland Reserve Inc.

This allowed it to use a loophole in state law that once banned for-profits from owning farmland, Brunson added.

AgReserves Inc., a for-profit corporation also owned by the church, now manages the Farmland Reserve land in Nebraska after the law banning for-profit ownership was quashed.

This includes the crown jewel of Rex Ranch, which The Widow's Mite values at $990million, making it the church's most valuable piece of agricultural real estate.

Both AgReserves and Farmland Reserve pay personal and property taxes like any other business, a spokesman said.

But an unknown amount of revenue generated from the land is passed to the church itself, which doesn't have to pay tax on what is deemed a passive investment.

Brunson believes that any revenue that is not reinvested in the business is likely passed onto the church in this manner.

Complex ownership structures are a trademark of the Mormon church, which likes to keep its wealth a closely-guarded secret.

In February, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fined the Mormon church and Ensign Peak a total of $5million for using shell companies to 'obscure' the size of its investment portfolio.

Investigators found the church 'went to great lengths' to hide $32billion in securities over nearly 20 years.

Church officials have said they 'regret mistakes made' and consider the matter closed.

Doomsday prepping or prudent investing?

The Mormon Church has amassed a vast reserve of ready cash that it can call upon in the event of a period of upheaval or economic instability. Its 'cash cushion' is more than three times the size of that held by tech giant Apple and significantly larger than Microsoft and Google

There is no evidence to suggest impropriety in its business dealings in Nebraska.

But the sprawling Mormon agricultural empire raises further questions over why the church is seeking to build such a large portfolio and what it is using the proceeds for.

Farmland Reserve has said it sees its land purchases as an investment 'to generate long-term value to support the Church's religious, charitable, and humanitarian good works'.

There are also indications that it could form part of the church's 'prepping' ethos.

Mormons believe that before Jesus returns, there will be a period of war and hardship and need to be prepared.

Leaders set aside a fixed percentage of church income to build reserves for what late church President Gordon B. Hinckley called 'a possible 'rainy day'.

'Prudent management requires that this money be put to use,' he said during a church general conference in 1991.

'We have felt that good farms, over a long period, represent a safe investment where the assets of the church may be preserved and enhanced, while at the same time they are available as an agricultural resource to feed people should there come a time of need.'

Brunson said produce and meat from the church's various farms either goes to a charitable grocery store for church members called the Bishop's Storehouse, or is sold on the open market for profit.

But he believes 'that the amount sold on the market dwarfs the amount that goes to the Bishop's Storehouse'.

Patrick Mason, professor of Mormon history and culture at Utah State University, told DailyMail.com that the church's agricultural portfolio is primarily influenced by its desire for prudent investing, rather than preparing for Doomsday.

'Land is the one thing that they're not making any more of, so it's a good, solid investment for the church,' he said.

'It doesn't report to shareholders on short-term earnings, so it is more than happy to invest in something that in 20, 30, or even 50 years, will deliver returns.'

Late church President Gordon B. Hinckley said farms represent a good, long-term investment while providing 'an agricultural resource to feed people should there come a time of need'. The comment was seen as an allusion to the Mormon approach of preparing for The Second Coming, which they believe will be preceded by a period of war and hardship

He added that the Mormon church has an advantage over other religious institutions, such as the Catholic church, in its ability to buy up such large swathes of land due to its centralized structure.

Each Catholic diocese 'essentially functions as its own corporation', Mason said, whereas the Mormon church 'acts as one entity'.

This allows it to pool its resources to make bigger purchases and invest strategically across the US, buying land in areas such as Nebraska and Florida, where the church traditionally does not have a large membership.

'The Catholic church has concentrated their investment in buildings, in schools and hospitals and churches,' Mason added. 'We haven't seen the same kind of agricultural purchases.'

The Widow's Mite estimates that the church's wealth currently stands at a staggering $236billion.

Investments make up around 75 percent of the church's total assets, with the rest made up of ecclesiastical buildings, welfare farms and ranches, mission properties and a smattering of small businesses, The Widow's Mite claims.

Brunson believes its interest in farmland is part of its bid to build the 'ultimate diversified portfolio'.

Misleading members or community champions?

But not all Mormons are happy with the hierarchy's investment strategy.

Movie mogul and scion to a powerful Mormon dynasty James Huntsman accused the church of 'lying' about how it has spent billions of dollars of members' donations in a bombshell interview with DailyMail.com earlier this year.

The son of billionaire Mormon philanthropist Jon Huntsman is suing the church for $5million over accusations it 'repeatedly and publicly lied' about how it was spending member donations solicited for charitable purposes.

Mormon leaders expect the rank-and-file to donate 10 percent of their income in tithing, which is put towards annual expenditure, such as building new temples.

But the surplus is invested in a portfolio of stocks, bonds, private equity and other businesses.

Huntsman alleges in his lawsuit that Mormon faithful were led to believe their contributions would only be spent on missionary activities, building temples and other charitable work.

The church has previously said his claims are 'baseless'.

But a separate lawsuit filed in October by three men who claim to have donated a combined $350,000 to the church over the past decade also claims the leadership misused member donations.

At issue in both lawsuits is whether the church's investments in stocks, bonds, real estate and agriculture reflect the wishes of its donors.

James Huntsman (pictured), the son of a billionaire Mormon philanthropist, is suing the church over claims it 'lied' about how it spent billions of dollars of its followers' hard-earned cash. The church has said the claims are 'baseless'

Others have reacted favorably to Mormon agriculture.

When AgReserves bought its timberland in Florida, environmental group The Conservation Fund said it was 'pleased' a buyer 'with a record of stewardship' had taken over the land, pointing to how the church had managed its 290,000 acre Deseret Ranches in central Florida since the early 1950s.

The church's Deseret Land and Livestock Ranch, which covers more than 200,000 acres in Rich County, Utah, has also been praised for developing an innovative system of rotational grazing that has increased profits and sustainability.

Brunson believes that those running the ranches are likely to be members of the church, with its employees a mix of members and locals.

Farmland Reserve has said that Rex Ranch in Nebraska is very much part of the local community.

It said more than 90 percent of its supply of feed and ranching equipment comes from Nebraska suppliers, while its workers live on the land they work and engage with the Nebraska Cattlemen's Association and Nebraska Grazing Lands Coalition.

They also volunteer with local schools and at county fairs, the company said.

Hansen, however, is not convinced.

'Ownership matters,' he said. 'The Mormon church is saying that it's all okay because our folks are engaged in the local community, but they're engaged as employees, not owners.

'There's a big difference. The profits go from that local community, to where the ownership is. It is not reinvested in the community.'

EXCLUSIVE: Student at Royal Agricultural University dubbed 'Oxbridge for farmers' strapped dead stag to Land Rover - after sparking outrage over dead fox tied to roof of a car

Students at a prestigious university dubbed 'Oxbridge for farmers' strapped a dead stag to the bonnet of a car during a charity rally, MailOnline can reveal. 

A photo from the fundraising event at the Royal Agricultural University (RAU) in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, shows the lifeless animal's head and hide strapped to the bonnet of a Land Rover with yellow string.

It comes after another photo from the event showed a dead fox attached to the roof of a car with each leg secured by blue rope.   

The university, whose patron is Charles III, is known for attracting the scions of wealthy farmers and counts Captain Mark Phillips, Princess Anne's former husband, among its alumni.

A photo from the fundraising event shows the stag's head and hide strapped to the bonnet of a Land Rover

Founded in 1845 as the first agricultural university in the English-speaking world, the RAU recently ranked among the top-ten universities in the country for student experience.

But its 'Hooray Henry' students have also gained a reputation for rowdy behaviour and a heavy drinking culture. 

Referring to yesterday's incident, a source told MailOnline: 'Given it's a university with the motto ''caring for the fields and the beasts'', it's a fairly clear (if not shocking) breach of their supposed ethos. 

'The RAU is full of entitled old fogeys who are resistant to any sort of change - most are so rich they think they can get away with anything.' 

The university said it condemned the students' behaviour and had contacted Gloucestershire Constabulary for help with identifying the perpetrators.  

The force said it had spoken to the students on the day and given them 'words of advice' but no crime had been committed.  

Wild foxes are considered vermin, so while it is against the law to hunt them with dogs it is not illegal to shoot them humanely with a registered firearm. 

The offence of outraging public decency concerns behaving in a way that is 'lewd, obscene or disgusting' in the presence of at least two members of the public.

Students from the Royal Agricultural University were in attendance last week during a visit to a dairy farm by the Countess of Wessex.

Sophie, 58, got stuck in bottle-feeding a young calf milk during her visit to Smerrill Dairy in Cirencester.    

A Royal Agricultural University spokesman told MailOnline: 'We condemn this behaviour. 

'As soon as we were made aware of this incident, the details were passed to our Student Services team and an investigation was started immediately.

'We have spoken to the Police and to our Students' Union to identify those involved. 

'We will absolutely not tolerate this kind of behaviour and will deal with those involved appropriately in light of the severity of the incident.

'The behaviours on display by a select minority of our students during this year's RAG Rally go against the University's core values. 

'The severity of those incidents has led to the decision by the University to withdraw support for the Rally in future years.'

Gloucestershire Police said: 'We are aware of the incident and have been in contact with the Royal Agricultural University.

'Officers were present at the rally and spoke to students at the time with words of advice. No criminal offences are believed to have taken place at this time.'

United Nations set to call on Americans to stop eating meat in an effort 'to tackle climate change' - despite only making up 1.4% of global emissions

A United Nations agency is expected to call on Western countries, including the US, to drastically reduce meat consumption to combat climate change.

The UN's Food & Agriculture Organization (FAO) announced it will publish a road map with global food recommendations during its COP28 climate summit in Dubai, which starts Thursday and lasts two weeks. 

In a first-of-its-kind document, the agency will call upon nations that 'over-consume meat' to limit consumption to reduce greenhouse emissions. 

It will also issue guidelines on how farmers can adapt to 'erratic weather' and reduce emissions from food waste and fertilizer. 

However, the US agriculture industry only accounts for 1.4 percent of global emissions and 10 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions.

Critics of US green policies often point out that countries like China have produced more greenhouse gasses than all of the world's other developed nations combined. 

China is the world's second-largest polluter even when emissions going back to 1850 are taken into account, new figures have shown, rebutting Beijing's insistence that the West is 'historically responsible' for the climate crisis

Meat consumption in the US has largely been to blame for the climate crisis, but data suggests cutting it would not have a significant impact 

The UN guidance is a recommendation and is not legally binding, much like the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which are released every five years. 

Kaveh Zahedi, director of the FAO Office of Climate Change, said: 'We already have solutions to tackle climate change, and many of these solutions, whether it is agroforestry, restoration of soils, sustainable livestock, or fisheries management, have multiple benefits as they can also support the sustainable use of biodiversity, as well as help with food security ""” multiple benefits from the same solutions that only agriculture and food systems offer.'

A 2021 study from Nature Food Journal found that the global food system generates 18 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year - one-third of total worldwide emissions. Livestock is responsible for about 14.5 percent of global emissions.

The UN and other agencies have long called for ditching red meat and swapping to vegetarian or vegan diets to prevent climate change. 

In 2021, food and climate experts told DailyMail.com that the US will have to drastically reduce its meat consumption to meet President Biden's benchmark of slashing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 percent by 2030. 

Brent Kim, a Maryland-based expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for a Liveable Future, said at the time: 'To avoid the most catastrophic climate change scenarios, the evidence is clear that citizens in high-meat consuming countries - such as the United States - need to dramatically reduce their meat and dairy intake,' he said. 

Data from the UN has shown that beef is the largest food contributor to greenhouse gas emissions

Beef is also the biggest source of protein responsible for greenhouse gas emissions

Studies have also suggested that cutting out red meat could reduce the impact of climate change.  

A September study published in Nature Communications found that going 50 percent vegan would reduce agriculture and land use, cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 31 percent by 2050.

Study co-author Eva Wollenberg of the University of Vermont said: 'Given the magnitude of benefits we show from substituting meat with plant-based alternatives for global sustainability, climate action, and human health, this research provides important food for thought for consumers, food producers, and policymakers.' 

Meat-heavy diets require larger-scale agricultural operations, including dedicating more land to livestock. This involves cutting down trees to make space, which releases carbon dioxide into the environment. 

Animals like cows also produce methane, which decreases air quality. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, a single cow produces between 154 and 264 pounds of methane every year.

However, data tracing carbon emissions back to 1850 found that even though Western nations bear 'historic responsibility' for the climate crisis, China is directly behind the US as the world's second-largest polluter. 

Additionally, an analysis from research firm Rhodium Group in tandem with Breakthrough Energy found that in 2019, China produced more greenhouse gases than all of the world's other developed nations put together. 

In May, researchers from the University of California, Davis, published a study that showed that lab-grown meat - which is designed to fight climate change and not kill animals - is up to 25 times worse for the climate than beef. 

'Currently, animal cell-based meat products are being produced at a small scale and at an economic loss, however companies are intending to industrialize and scale-up production,' the researchers wrote. 

'Results indicate that the environmental impact of near-term animal cell-based meat production is likely to be orders of magnitude higher than median beef production if a highly refined growth medium is utilized.'

These findings suggest that ditching red meat might not provide substantial improvements to global emissions. 

There have also been debates about if plant-based meat is healthier than red meat. It's long been shown that over-consumption of red meat is linked to a greater risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity. 

However, a May report by the FAO that analyzed 500 studies found that animal food sources are healthier than plant-based varieties because they offer 'crucial sources of much-needed nutrients, including protein, fat, carbs, iron, calcium, and zinc.

Additionally, a study published last week in the journal Nature found that a molecule in beef and dairy called Trans-vaccenic acid (TVA) helped cancer patients respond better to treatment.

The exact guidelines that the UN is expected to release are not yet clear.

Chocolate, coffee and bananas could disappear from supermarket shelves in less than 30 years because of climate change.

Hotter temperatures threaten the plants that produce chocolate, coffee and bananas and could lead to them becoming scarce, according to the Fairtrade Foundation.

A new report, titled 'Endangered Aisle', has been published by the charity, which supports disadvantaged farmers in developing countries through its Fairtrade mark.

It warns cocoa-growing regions Ghana and Ivory Coast, which produce more than half the world's crop, will become too hot by 2050 to grow the beans the UK relies on for its chocolate.

And within three decades as much as half of the global surface area currently used for coffee farming could no longer be suitable due to climate change, according to analysis by the 3Keel consultancy, which advises on sustainability.

Chocolate, coffee and bananas could disappear from supermarket shelves in less than 30 years because of climate change

More than 90 per cent of Fairtrade Kenyan coffee producers say they are already experiencing the effects - with more erratic rainfall and an increase in pests and diseases.

Three quarters of Britons are aware that global warming is impacting their supermarket shop but only 38 per cent are making changes, say study authors.

A spokeswoman said: 'Say goodbye to banana bread, farewell flat whites and ciao to chocolate, as experts warn these products could be off our supermarket shelves as a result of climate change - in as little as the next 30 years.'

Fairtrade Foundation chief Mike Gidney added: 'It's time to wake up and smell the coffee - because it may not be on our shelves forever.

'Today, climate breakdown is making it harder and harder to grow food crops, making our food security ever more vulnerable.

'There is a risk that farmers will have to stop farming.'

Mr Gidney urged UK customers to buy Fairtrade goods so producers receive a fair price that enables them to invest in sustainable farming.

Caitlin McCormack, 3Keel Senior Consultant, which carried out analysis for the report said: 'The UK sources a significant proportion of consumer favourites including bananas, coffee and cocoa from countries that face potential risks to future production, including from changes in the climate and the loss of biodiversity and habitat that provide ecosystem services that are critical to farming.

'It's essential that we work with producers in these countries to help them shift to sustainable and resilient methods of production.'

Devastating risks of transitioning to 'green' energy: Mining for electric-powering minerals has left 23 million people exposed to toxic waste, 500,000km of rivers polluted and 16 million acres of farmland ruined

Tens of millions of people ""” more than live in the entire state of Florida ""” are now exposed to toxic water runoff from metal mining, a new study has found.

The report lays bare the devastating impacts that can follow a reckless transition to 'green' energy, compounding the ecological damage wrought by over 150 years of drilling and mining for fossil fuels.

The researchers found that 23 million people worldwide, as well as 5.72 million in livestock, over 16 million acres of irrigated farmland and over 297,800 miles worth of rivers have been contaminated by mining's toxic byproducts seeping into the water.

This metal mining includes many so-called 'rare earth elements' essential to the manufacture of high-tech electronics, solar cells, wind turbines and all the batteries needed to store sustainable 'green' energy (and power electric cars and iPhones).

While the new study focuses on environmental impacts, global metals mining has recently faced shocking lawsuits against major tech firms, including Apple, Google, Microsoft and Tesla, over child slavery in the Congo, where 70 percent of the industry's cobalt is sourced.

Researchers found that over 297,800 miles worth of rivers have been contaminated by toxic mining byproducts. Above, a March 27, 2021 aerial view of an area contaminated with toxic waste generated by mining companies that have polluted the Tagarete river in Bolivia

The scientists found that 23 million people have been exposed to toxic mining waste worldwide. Above, Dan Bender of the La Plata County Sheriff's Office takes a sample from the Animas river in Colorado polluted by about 3 million gallons of waste from the Gold King Mine

'Rapid growth in global metal mining is crucial if the world is to make the transition to green energy,' noted Chris Thomas, a zoologist at the University of Lincoln whose specialty is in spatial ecology and threats to the global water supply.

Thomas led the analysis and modelling work for the new study, which was published today in Science.

Thomas and his colleagues have developed a new database, supported by on-the-ground testing, which now maps the hundreds of square miles' worth of rivers and floodplains contaminated by these industrial processes across the globe. 

The devastation wrought by this contamination, they found, was widespread, affecting approximately 297,800 miles (479,200 km) of river systems total and over 63,000 square-miles (164,000 sq-km) of floodplains worldwide. 

But, North America stood out as the most affected, at 123,280 miles of tainted river systems, and approximately 10.7 million acres of polluted floodplains. 

But the damage was not much better in South America with 50,766 miles of rivers and over 9.5 million acres of floodplain impacted; nor in Asia with about 37,842 river-miles and about 8.3 million acres of floodplain polluted by metal mining waste.

In terms of potency of local damage, however, the the scientists saved their harshest criticisms for 'the environmental legacy of historical mining,' which they said was 'most problematic in western Europe,' where long-abandoned old mines have left lasting environmental damage.

'Much of the estimated global contamination we have mapped is a legacy from the industrial era,' Thomas said in a press statement. 'Rightly, modern mining is being encouraged to prioritize environmental sustainability.' 

Potentially harmful mining contaminants can seep into the local water supply, whether transported downstream to along river beds and floodplains, or deep into underground aquifers. Chronic copper metal poisoning kills a sheep in North Ronaldsay, Texel, Suffolk

The researchers identified 159,735 abandoned mines, marked in blue above, whose environmental impact due to laxer historic regulations contributed 'much of the estimated global contamination,' according to report co-author and spatial ecology expert Chris Thomas 

The study also modelled the waste from 22,609 active mines, marked in red above, as well as 11,587 mining waste storage facilities and 257 known cases of failed and leaking storage sites (not pictured above): 'the most comprehensive compilation of metal mine locations to date'

The researchers developed a model to predict the spread of contaminants from all known active and inactive metal mines ""” plus facilities used to seal off hazardous mining waste ""” with a focus on pollution from lead, zinc, copper, and arsenic.

These potentially harmful contaminants and industrial byproducts can seep into the local water supply, whether transported downstream where the metals are deposited along river beds and floodplains, or otherwise sinks deep into underground aquifers.

Mark Macklin, director of the university's Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Health, who led the international team behind the new research, said he anticipates the new study's maps and modelling tools will help prevent future reckless mining.

'We expect that this will make it easier to mitigate the environmental effects of historical and present mining,' Macklin said.

'Our new method for predicting the dispersal of mine waste in river systems provides governments, environmental regulators, the mining industry and local communities with a tool that, for the first time, will enable them to assess the offsite and downstream impacts of mining on ecosystem and human health.'

Inactive mines and their pollution outnumbers the mining waste generated by new mines

All told, the researchers identified 159,735 abandoned mines and 22,609 active mines ""” as well as 11,587 mining waste storage facilities and 257 known cases of failed and leaking storage sites. 

The team described the new database in their report as 'the most comprehensive compilation of metal mine locations to date.'

Concerns over just how bad the ecological impact of metal mining for sustainable technology might be is complicated by the diverse variety of resources involved, which can lead to 'apples to oranges' comparisons.  

According to the MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative, green energy technologies like wind turbines and electric cars often do require many more mined minerals than the present fossil fuels infrastructure. 

One electric car, for example, requires six times more metallic and mineral materials than a combustion engine car, MIT's university team reports. 

And a wind power plant requires nine times more of these mined compounds than a traditional gas-fired plant.

But these heavy investments in initial overhead are dwarfed by the repeated volume of fossil fuels currently mined today to meet present and growing energy demands. 

As of 2021, over 7.5 billion tons of coal were extracted from the ground, wreaking havoc on local people and environments from Sydney Australia's Royal National Park, to coal-rich Inner Mongolia in China and more.

This is a whopping 25 times the current estimates of the metal mining needed for a clean energy revolution by 2040, according to projections from the Paris-based International Energy Agency (founded during the 1970s oil crisis by the OECD).

The transition, according to the IEA, will require new mining under 30 million tons.

Scott Odell, a visiting scientist at MIT's Environmental Solutions Initiative who specializes in clean energy and mining, cautions however that these environmental impacts often need to be assessed on a more detailed, case by case basis.

They knowingly got a generation hooked on cigarettes ""” now research suggests Big Tobacco also fueled America's obesity crisis.

A study earlier this month found that for decades, foods like Teddy Grams and Hawaiian Punch sold by tobacco giant-owned manufacturers were up to 80 percent more likely to be ultra-processed than similar foods from non-tobacco-owned companies.

These 'hyper-palatable' foods (HPF), also known as ultra-processed foods, are filled with fat, sodium, sugar, and hard-to-pronounce additives and have been linked to several long-term health issues like dementia and early death. 

About 60 years ago, as the government passed regulations around cigarettes, tobacco companies ventured into the food business to diversify their portfolios. This resulted in them acquiring prominent companies like Nabisco and Kraft.  

Researchers found that tobacco-owned foods were 29 percent more likely to be classified as fat and sodium HPF and 80 percent more likely to be considered carbohydrate and sodium HPF than foods from brands not owned by tobacco companies during this time period

Mountains of studies show eating too many processed foods dramatically raises the risk of early death, dementia, and heart disease

Though tobacco companies no longer produce food, the research team called for better regulation of ultra-processed foods, comparing them to tobacco products before restrictions were placed on them.

'These products have become highly prevalent in the US food environment today. Despite growing scientific evidence regarding the addictive properties of HPF, there are no federal regulations addressing HPF accessibility,' the researchers at the University of Kansas wrote. 

'The state of the food environment for US consumers bears a striking resemblance to the US environment in the 1950s during the tobacco epidemic, before the US federal government regulated the availability of tobacco products.  

'Similar efforts are needed to regulate the availability of HPF, in light of our evidence indicating that the same tobacco companies may have been influential in shifting the profile of US foods toward greater hyper-palatability.'

The study, published in the journal Addiction, looked at food brands that were owned by tobacco companies between 1980 and 2001. 

Ultra-processed foods were classified as fat and sodium HPF or carbohydrate and sodium HPF, meaning that they had elevated levels of those nutrients. 

The team used data from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to identify which food brands were owned by the tobacco companies Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds between 1988 and 2018. Kraft, Nabisco, and Oscar Meyer, which make products like Teddy Grams, Lunchables, and Kool-Aid, were among the most popular. They compared those foods to 587 similar products sold by competing brands that were not tobacco-owned.

Jessica Cording, a New Jersey-based registered dietician, told DailyMail.com, that sticking to short ingredient labels with simple-to- pronounce items was a good rule of thumb for healthy eating. 

They found that tobacco-owned foods were 29 percent more likely to be classified as fat and sodium HPF and 80 percent more likely to be considered carbohydrate and sodium HPF than foods from brands not owned by tobacco companies during this time period. 

'Companies that specialized in creating addictive tobacco products led the development of the US food system for [more than] 20 years,' the researchers wrote. 

Processing involves adding or altering raw ingredients, such as by storing them in oil or putting sugar or salt into them.

Foods like apples are usually exactly how they appear in nature, and are classed as minimally processed.

Processed foods, such as apple sauce, have gone through at least one level of processing that has changed their original form.

Ultra-processed foods have gone through multiple levels of processing and are usually full of extra hard-to-pronounce fats, colors and preservatives. They target reward systems in the brain, similar to those triggered by tobacco products and illicit drugs.

Microwave meals, snack mixes, and ice cream are common examples.

These foods have become ubiquitous in the American diet.  

A 2022 study from Northeastern University's Network Science Institute, for example, estimated that 73 percent of the United States food supply is ultra-processed. 

And a study published in Frontiers in Nutrition found that more than 60 percent of US caloric intake comes from these foods. 

Mountains of studies show eating too many processed foods dramatically raises the risk of early death, dementia, and heart disease. 

A 2022 study published in the journal Neurology, for example, found that a 10 percent increase in ultra-processed food consumption could raise the risk of dementia.

Additionally, a large cohort study in France found that the same increase in ultra-processed foods led to an increased risk of breast cancer. 

And a pair of studies from researchers in Spain and France found an association between consuming ultra-processed foods and an increased risk of early death. 

Though tobacco companies no longer have a stake in food production, the study authors believe that other companies reformulated their foods to make them just as ultra-processed and addictive as those sold by their competitors.

For the environmentalists among us, a plate of turkey might once have come with a side of climate-induced guilt.

However, meat lovers will be in high spirits this Christmas as a new report reveals an all-veg diet isn't as eco-friendly as once thought.

In their new UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) report, the UN says that swapping out meat for plant-based protein decreases your carbon footprint by as little as 4 per cent.

'The expected reduction in the middle-income countries is marginal (4.4 percent),' the report said. 

'With increasing emissions in some countries due to increased consumption of nuts, fruits and vegetables, partly grown in greenhouses.'

The report used an advanced modelling tool to study the sources of greenhouse gases in the production of animal products.

Previously, the UN and a number of climate campaign groups have called for a move away from a diet rich in meat, eggs, and dairy. 

However, this latest study found that in middle-income countries, such as India or China, cutting out meat would only result in a 4.4 per cent drop in greenhouse gas emissions.

For those in high-income countries, such as the UK or US, making the change would cut greenhouse gas emissions by between 13 and 17 per cent. 

Across the 37 countries studied in the report, a complete change would result in a 2 to 5 per cent reduction in emissions associated with the entire global food system. 

Previous studies 'oversimplify' the benefits and plausibility for most of the world changing to a plant-based diet, making farming more efficient would yield bigger reductions than swapping (stock image)

Farming animals produces greenhouse gas emissions at each stage of production, but particularly as direct emissions from the methane produced by cattle 

What is the climate impact of meat? 

In 2015, livestock farming produced the equivalent of 6.2 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions in various gasses.

This made up 12 per cent of the total greenhouse gas emissions and 40 per cent of food production emissions.

Without intervention, this is forecast to increase to 9.2 billion tonnes by 2050.

Cattle produce 62 per cent of livestock's total emissions.

Methane produced by ruminants like cows makes up about 60% of meat production emissions.

The rest comes from producing fertilizers and feed, transport, and changing land use. 

The report's authors write that 'some studies may oversimplify' the climate benefits and plausibility of switching to plant-based diets. 

They say that these recommendations assume 'an immediate, universal dietary shift, neglecting the nutritional challenges and the financial constraints that may render such changes unfeasible particularly for the world's poorest.' 

The report points out that there are wide disparities between the carbon cost of different production methods.

'Replacing meat with calorically equivalent greenhouse vegetables or out-of-season fruits flown from afar could potentially reverse many GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions offsets,' the authors explain. 

As global populations grow, demand for meat products is expected to increase in much of the world, even as demand stays level or even decreases in Europe. 

The researchers predict that by 2050, demand for animal products will increase by 20 per cent globally.

Without any change to farming techniques, this would lead to greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 9.1 billion tons of C02 per year.

However, by improving the efficiency of animal rearing methods, greenhouse gas emissions could be cut by up to 30 per cent. 

The report found that efficiency gains in dairy farming alone contribute between 38 and 46 per cent of this total emissions reduction by 2050.

'Solutions such as improving animal health, breeding practices, reducing food loss and waste, and directly targeting GHG emissions have the potential to provide multiple benefits for people and the planet,' said Ms Maria Helena Semedo, Deputy Director-General for the Food and Agriculture Organization. 

'But they require investments in the sector to narrow efficiency gaps, while meeting an increased global demand for animal protein.'

The researchers also considered the possibility of replacing animal protein with plant-based 'meats' and lab-grown alternatives.

Other UN reports argue that meat alternatives could feed humans more sustainably. 

Professor Mario Herrero says: 'Novel alternatives to animal-sourced foods can potentially play an important role in shifting our in ways that are more sustainable, healthier and less harmful to animals, humans and the planet.'

However, this latest report says that the climate impact of lab-grown meat is not yet fully understood and depends largely on the type of energy used.

Additionally, the report's authors write that: 'Animal's roles in providing financial security, status and social value beyond its food value may be jeopardised, further causing inequalities between high- and low-income countries.'

COULD INSECTS BE THE NEXT 'SUPERFOOD'?

Edible insects have been touted as the next 'superfood', with the creepy crawlies packed full of protein, nutrients, potassium, magnesium and three times more fatty acids than omega-3 in salmon.

Insects contain more than twice as much protein per 100g as meat and fish, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.

Crickets are the most widely cultivated insects for the human diet across the world and are considered the ""˜gateway bug' for people who choose to eat insects.

They, along with other insects are touted as highly nutritious and much better for the planet - environmentally and financially - than traditional livestock, due to the comparatively efficient rate at which they convert feed into body mass.

The global population is predicted to top nine billion by 2050, putting enormous pressure on the environment, conventional food sources and farming techniques. Insects could help meet demand for food.

Plenty of people in non-Western countries already eat insects regularly. They are very efficient at converting vegetation into edible protein and full of vitamins and minerals.

Previous studies have found that four crickets provide as much calcium as a glass of milk, and dung beetles, by weight, contain more iron than beef.

Farming insects generates one-tenth of the methane produced by farming traditional meat sources, and it uses comparatively little water, making the process better for the environment.

Burger lovers rejoice! Lab-grown meat is up to 25 times WORSE for the climate than beef, study claims

Lab-grown meat has been touted as a way to save the planet, but a new study suggests its green credentials are not as solid as many believe. 

Researchers have revealed that lab-grown or 'cultured' meat, produced by cultivating animal cells, is up to 25 times worse for the climate than real beef. 

Production of real meat has a huge carbon footprint because it requires water, feed and the clearing of trees to make way for cattle. 

Despite this, experts say the carbon footprint of lab-grown meat could be 'orders of magnitude higher' once the industry grows. 

Although lab-grown meat is yet to hit the shops, British scientists are among those growing meat products in a lab with a view to commercialise them. 

Lab-grown meat is set to become more ubiquitous in the next 10 years, transforming from a niche concept to a common fridge staple (file photo) - but a study says the industry could have a huge carbon footprint once it takes off

The new research was led by scientists at the Department of Food Science and Technology, University of California, Davis. 

It has been detailed in a new study published as a preprint paper, yet to be peer-reviewed, on the bioRxiv server.

'Currently, animal cell-based meat products are being produced at a small scale and at an economic loss, however companies are intending to industrialize and scale-up production,' the scientists say in their paper. 

'Results indicate that the environmental impact of near-term animal cell-based meat production is likely to be orders of magnitude higher than median beef production if a highly refined growth medium is utilised.' 

Good Food Institute, a non-profit organisation that promotes plant- and cell-based alternatives to animal products, stressed that the study has not yet been through a full peer review process, 'so its assumptions and conclusions are subject to change'. 

'Several key assumptions in the UC Davis study do not align with the current or expected practices for sourcing and purification of cell culture media ingredients,' a Good Food Institute spokesperson told MailOnline. 

Lab-grown meat is different from plant-based 'meat', which is not meat at all but uses vegan ingredients such as vegetable protein to replicate the look and taste of real meat. 

Lab-grown or 'cultured' meat is generally seen as more ethical than real meat because it requires a sample of body tissue rather than the death of the animal, although many vegans and vegetarians will not touch it because it is made of animal.

The process can be done with multiple types of animal cell to create an approximation of the real thing, whether it's chicken, pork or beef.  

Taking beef as an example, scientists use a cow's stem cells - the building blocks of muscle and other organs - to begin the process of creating the cultured meat.

Professor Mark Post at Maastricht University in the Netherlands (pictured) was the first person to present a proof of concept for lab-grown meat

The cells are placed in petri dishes with a 'growth medium' comprising nutrients such as amino acids, glucose, vitamins, and inorganic salts.

Why is real meat bad for the planet? 

Meat-heavy diets risk the health of our planet, as livestock farming on a massive scale destroys habitats and generates greenhouse gases. 

Animal agriculture contributes to global warming because of the methane, nitrous oxide and carbon emissions of livestock and their supply chains. 

The clearing of trees to make way for grazing cattle also reduces carbon sequestration - the process of capturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide.  

This is supplemented with growth factors and other proteins to help the muscle cells multiply and grow.

They're allowed to proliferate just as they would inside an animal, until there are trillions of cells from a small sample. 

These cells later form muscle cells, which naturally merge to form primitive muscle fibres and edible tissue that can be packaged, shipped and sold. 

Experts think lab-grown meat is set to become more ubiquitous in the next 10 years, transforming from a niche concept to a common fridge staple.

But for this to happen, production methods will have to be scaled up from mere petri dishes to massive energy-intensive industrial units. 

In the study, the scientists estimated the energy required for stages of lab-grown meat's production, from the ingredients making up the growth medium and the energy required to power laboratories, and compared this with beef. 

They largely focused on the quantity of growth medium components, including glucose, amino acids, vitamins, growth factors, salts and minerals. 

They found the global warming potential of lab-grown meat ranged from 246 to 1,508 kg of CO2 equivalent per kilogram of lab-grown meat, which is four to 25 times greater than the average global warming potential of retail beef.

US start up Eat Just revealed lab-grown chicken nuggets that have already been sold in Singapore

According to the experts, this does not change depending on which animal's cells are being grown and the meat that's being created, whether it's beef, chicken or lamb. 

But the team say that they did not consider the environmental impact of scaling up animal cell-based meat production facilities, which could bump the industry's footprint up even higher. 

The team conclude the environmental impact of emerging technologies such as cultured meat is a new concept but 'highly important'. 

'Our results indicate that animal cell-based meat is likely to be more resource intensive than most meat production systems according to this analysis,' they say. 

Lab-grown meat has its origins a decade ago but the industry is still very young, and Singapore is so far the only country in the world to have approved the meats for sale. 

The authors say: 'Livestock production is an integral component of the global food system, providing staple proteins (milk, eggs, and meat) consumed worldwide' (file photo)

Lab-grown chicken produced by the US company Eat Just was first served at Singapore restaurant in 2020 and was described as tasting 'just like its farmed counterpart'. 

Earlier this year in the US, the Food and Drug Administration declared cultured meat safe for human consumption, paving the way for them to be sold stateside, but in the UK the Food Standards Agency is yet to do the same. 

The industry has since grown to more than 150 companies as of late 2022, backed by $2.6 billion in investments, according to the Good Food Institute. 

Professor Mark Post at Maastricht University in the Netherlands was the first person to present a proof of concept for lab-grown meat, back in 2013. 

He thinks it will be so popular with animal welfare activists and burger fans alike it will eventually displace plant-based substitutes, like soy burgers, that are increasingly common in UK supermarkets. 

'Novel technologies such as the ones developed in cellular agriculture are part of the solution, next to reducing food waste and changing consumer behaviour,' Professor Post previously told MailOnline. 

Never mind plant burgers! Could lab-grown red meat save the environment?  

Lab-grown meat is set to become more ubiquitous this decade, transforming from a niche concept to a common fridge staple. 

Professor Mark Post at Maastricht University in the Netherlands unveiled the world's first lab-grown burger from cow muscle cells, in 2013.

He's now pioneering a 'kinder and cleaner' way of making beef with his firm, Mosa Meat, which created the world's first hamburger without slaughtering an animal. 

The company extracts cells from the muscle of an animal, such as a cow for beef, when the animal is under anaesthesia.   

The cooked Mosa Meat patty looks similar to conventionally-made beef burgers. The company says it tastes 'like meat'

The cells then are placed in a dish containing nutrients and naturally-occurring growth factors, and allowed to proliferate just as they would inside an animal, until there are trillions of cells from a small sample. 

These cells later form muscle cells, which naturally merge to form primitive muscle fibres and edible tissue.  

From one sample from a cow, the firm can produce 800 million strands of muscle tissue, which is enough to make 80,000 quarter pounders. 

Mosa Meat has also created cultured fat that it adds to its tissue to form the finished product, which simply tastes 'like meat', the company says. 

Professor Post think this product will be so popular with animal welfare activists and burger fans alike it will eventually displace plant-based substitutes, like soy burgers, that are increasingly common in UK supermarkets. 

'Novel technologies such as the ones developed in cellular agriculture are part of the solution, next to reducing food waste and changing consumer behaviour,' Professor Post told MailOnline. 

'A good example of strong trend in consumer behaviour is increased vegetarianism among young generations to unprecedented numbers. 

'Most likely, this trend will continue and spread towards other age groups and eventually will lead to disappearance of plant-based meat substitutes.'

Mosa Meat received $55 million in 2021 to scale up production of cultured meat. 

The funding will help extend the firm's current pilot production facility in the Dutch city of Maastricht and develop an industrial-sized production line.

Furious meat-loving Britons have said the RSPCA are 'deluding themselves' after the animal charity said their survey found the majority of people are backing subsidies for plant-based alternatives.

New figures suggest a revolution in eating habits for a nation that was previously defined by its love of roast beef and a fry-ups, with their bacon, sausages and eggs.

A study sponsored by the RSPCA found 58 per cent have taken steps to eliminate or reduce their own meat consumption. And 57 per cent think the country should consume fewer animal products, mainly due to health, environmental and animal welfare reasons.

Significantly, some 58 per cent said they would be supportive of government subsidies to help cut the cost of plant-based alternatives.

But Britons are not convinced by the results of the survey - arguing most people don't choose plant-based alternatives to meat and suggesting more 'accurate' ways of assessing sales.

The RSPCA said the nation's laws and treatment of meat and livestock farming lag behind consumer attitudes towards animal welfare, the environment and health.

The research, which comes from a report compiled by the Social Market Foundation (SMF), found three in four - 74 per cent - want animal welfare labels on meat products covering rearing and slaughter methods.

These formed part of a Kept Animals Bill, which was recently dropped by the Government.

At the same time, 91 per cent want stricter regulations to protect farm animals and 61 per cent want a ban on factory farming, such as the use of cages for egg-laying hens and pigs.

A National Food Strategy review commissioned by the Government recommended pursuing a 30 per cent reduction in meat consumption over a decade.

The idea was subsequently rejected by ministers, however the SMF and RSPCA said the research demonstrate they are out of step with public opinion.

The SMF findings show that alternative proteins, such as plant-based sausages or burgers, can play a role in helping people to eat less animal products, though there are qualms over taste and cost.

Some 44 per cent complained they were not affordable, while 58 per cent would support a 20 per cent price subsidy.

The SMF Interim Director, Aveek Bhattacharya, said: 'Our research shows that far from being a fringe concern, efforts to eat less meat are entirely normalised and mainstream within British society.

'The question is when politicians will catch up and help the rest of us to make the changes to our diets necessary to better our health, protect the environment and improve animal welfare.

'Acknowledging the meat reduction target in the National Food Strategy, and the necessity of significant changes to our food system and our habits to meet it, would be a good start. But beyond that, there is substantial appetite for stricter welfare standards and investment in alternative proteins to help accelerate these societal trends.'

The RSPCA's Assistant Director Policy, Advocacy and Evidence, Gemma Hope, said: 'The public is clear that we all need to be eating less meat for the sake of animals, our health and our planet.

'Even during the depths of a cost of living crisis, a majority want their taxes spent on subsiding plant-based alternatives to meat. This is a priority issue for them and they want action.

'The quickest and cheapest first step is to have clear labelling of meat products telling shoppers how animals were reared.'

You might already be a convert to sourdough bread ""” perhaps you even make your own. 

But did you know that, with the right ingredients, it could improve sleep and lower high blood pressure?

That at least is the claim made by Mim Habits, a Spanish company that has launched a range of loaves in the UK billed as the 'first bread designed by scientists to help restore your gut health'. 

The firm advises eating two slices of its bread a day to balance the gut microbiome, the collection of bacteria, viruses and other microbes living in our digestive systems.

This microbial mixture helps digest the food we eat and is increasingly thought to influence our health in all sorts of ways, from supporting our immune system to helping ward off conditions such as type 2 diabetes.

But bread is not the only baked product getting a health-inspired makeover.

Scientists around the world are also developing recipes for 'healthy' muffins, which are rich in antioxidants, for example, or are very high in fibre without compromising the taste, it is claimed.

But will they actually improve consumers' health? The key ingredient in the souped-up sourdough is postbiotics.

We normally associate a healthy microbiome with probiotics ""” the so-called 'good' bacteria in foods such as yoghurt, sauerkraut and cheeses. 

Postbiotics are their lesser-known cousin ""” they are the compounds that gut bacteria produce when they break down food as well as dead microbes ""” whole or in fragments.

The idea is that by taking postbiotics (there are some supplements now available), you get many of the health benefits of probiotics, without needing to take the actual live bacteria, as well as possibly some added benefits. 

For instance, breaking up microbes might release healthful compounds that are normally locked inside them.

Crucially, in the case of baked products, such as bread, postbiotics (unlike probiotics) aren't killed off by heat.

The four types of bread in the new range ""” 'immunity boost', 'bowel balance', 'stress relief' (also designed to help with sleep) and 'tension care' (which aims to help control high blood pressure) ""” contain different cocktails of postbiotics chosen with the help of scientists at a biotech firm that's creating microbiome-based treatments for cancer, says Mim Habits' founder Xavi Cortadellas.

The postbiotics in the 'immunity boost' loaf, for instance, include fragments of cell wall (the outer layer of bacteria) and amino acids (the building blocks of protein).

The cellular wall fragments are described as being involved in the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (immune system proteins), while the benefits of the amino acids range from 'aiding the formation of antibodies' to encouraging the 'correct functioning of our immune system'.

However, scientists are divided over whether postbiotics really are the next big thing in health improvement.

Some bacterial fragments and compounds produced by bacteria do have health benefits, says Glenn Gibson, a professor of food microbiology at Reading University. 

Bacterial cell walls, for example, stimulate the production of antibodies, while butyric acid, another postbiotic found in the new bread, keeps gut cells healthy.

However, he says, it is unclear whether when taken in food or as supplements postbiotics make it intact to the gut, where they would normally be produced and so where they are most likely to have an effect. 'I'm not too convinced by postbiotics,' says Professor Gibson.

But Colin Hill, a professor of microbiology at Cork University, told Good Health: 'There are several compelling lines of evidence that suggest eating postbiotics is a good way of delivering them to the gut. Most of our immune cells are in the gut, most of our nervous system is in the gut and the gut is where we digest our food.'

He says getting postbiotics into the gut could also benefit brain and skin health, since they are connected to gut health, too. In a trial commissioned by the manufacturer, 240 participants ate two slices a day of the bowel-boosting bread or the stress relief loaf for six weeks.

The company claims the unpublished results show 64 per cent had more regular bowel movements and 45 per cent slept better. But at £15 per loaf (available from mimhabits.com), it will eat into your budget more than your normal sourdough. If 'healthy' bread doesn't seem that novel a concept, scientists are also now looking at giving muffins a makeover too.

The idea behind the postbiotic bread and virtuous muffins is to improve health not by suggesting people change their diets but by taking food they already eat and making it better for them.

Bread, which has long been a staple, is bought by 99.8 per cent of British households, with nearly 11 million loaves sold a day (file image) 

Do This... 



Aim to walk 8,000 steps just twice a week ""” this is enough to reduce the risk of an early death significantly, according to a study in the journal JAMA Network Open. 

Researchers found those who managed to do this were 14.9 per cent less likely to die over a ten-year period than those who never reached the 8,000-step mark.

In those who did so more than three days a week, the mortality risk was even lower. 

Walking for regular activity can reduce the risk of heart disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and depression. 

Bread, which has long been a staple, is bought by 99.8 per cent of British households, with nearly 11 million loaves sold a day.

The global market for muffins, meanwhile, is expected to reach £10 billion by 2028.

While we are all familiar with fortification ""” the addition of vitamins and minerals to food such as breakfast cereals ""” many of the muffins being whipped up in labs around the world involve extensive reformulations of the recipe.

Strategies being researched include cutting the high fat and sugar content of the mixture ""” muffins that are a coffee shop staple, for instance, typically have around 23g of sugar and 17g of fat per 100g) and swapping the refined flour for wholegrain flour.

The latest efforts involve adding novel ingredients. Researchers in India and Norway, for example, have created a muffin made with hibiscus flowers, which are high in plant compounds such as anthocyanins and phenolics, as well as B vitamins and vitamin C.

Anthocyanins and phenolics are antioxidants, compounds that protect our cells from damage and ageing. And at 14.8mg per gram, the concentration of anthocyanins in the hibiscus flower is more than three times that in blueberries, another good source.

The hibiscus flower also contains around 20 times as much vitamin C as an orange, while its plentiful B vitamins (B1, B2 and B3) are important for, among other things, a functioning nervous system. To make the muffins, researchers replaced milk in muffins with liquid hibiscus extract before carrying out taste tests with volunteers ""” using 17 variations of the recipe. Their views were used to create the tastiest muffin, one with 4.5ml, just under a teaspoon, of hibiscus flower extract.

Dr Eva Falch, a food scientist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, and one of the researchers, says hibiscus flower extract is under-utilised. She adds: 'In food cultures where baked goods like this are part of the daily diet, they can add extra nutrients.'

Other attempts to reformulate muffins to make them healthier include a version made by Loughborough University in 2021.

'In the UK, we eat more ready meals than any other European country. And almost 90 per cent of us eat them regularly'

They used inulin, a sweet-tasting plant fibre, as a sugar and fat substitute and replaced some of the flour with flour made from dried, unripe bananas. This is rich in resistant starch, a carbohydrate that can make the body more sensitive to insulin, which mops up sugar from the blood and can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.

The reworked muffins contained up to 12 per cent fewer calories and were, in the main, judged to be both springy and tasty.

Writing in the journal Foods, the researchers concluded: 'There is significant potential to industrially produce reduced sugar or fat muffins using inulin or green banana flour without significantly deteriorating quality attributes.'

Meanwhile, researchers in South Korea have used Chinese cabbage leaves left over from making kimchi to create muffins with a higher fibre content ""” 13 per cent ""” almost double that of a standard muffin.

And in New Zealand, food scientists have experimented with using beta-glucan, a fibre with cholesterol-lowering properties, to make 'heart healthy' muffins.

But Duane Mellor, a dietitian and a senior lecturer at Aston University Medical School, fears some will over-estimate the health gains that come with recipe tweaks and says that reducing the size of muffins ""” or how often we eat them ""” would bring better health benefits.

'Muffins are increasing in size,' he says. 'They've gone from what used to be called cupcakes to brimming over the top of the little cups they sit in. We have to think about the portion size. After all, cakes are still cakes.'

If you can't forsake your morning muffin, Mike Lean, a professor of human nutrition at Glasgow University, advises making your own. He said: 'Most commercial muffins are enormous and made with ridiculous amounts of fat and sugar.

'If you like a muffin from time to time, as I do, the tricks are: make them smaller, cut the yucky fat, cut the sugar and earn them with a decent run, walk or cycle ride.'

Making your own won't be the solution for everyone, says Dr Chris van Tulleken, an associate professor of infectious diseases at University College London and author of the book Ultra-Processed People: Why Do We All Eat Stuff That Isn't Food . . . And Why Can't We Stop.

'The tragedy is that for many people the ingredients, skills, time and energy costs of cooking a muffin at home make them totally unrealistic,' he says. 'That's what we need to change about our food system.'

He's one of the biggest social media influencers in the farming world - with thousands of fans flocking to get a glimpse inside his life.

But next week, Will Young will be swapping his wellies for flip flops as he enters the Love Island villa. 

The 23-year-old, from Buckinghamshire, has 128,000 followers on Instagram and another million on TikTok, on which he shares the bonds he has with his animals, as well as insights of everyday life.

However, he is far from the only famous 'farm-fluencer' taking social media by storm. Dozens of young farmers are sharing everything from mishaps with cattle to a hyperactive sheep dog, providing educational and entertaining content at a rapid pace.

Here, MailOnline looks at the rising stars of the industry and how they are influencing the way the general public views farming and farmers.

Looking for love: 'Having grown up on a farm, it's been quite difficult juggling relationships and work,' he explains. 'Love Island will give me time away from the farm to solely find love'

128K followers, 3,000 sheep, pigs and alpacas 

Farmer Will Young, 23, from Buckinghamshire, is one of the most high-profile farming influencers with 128,000 followers on Instagram - and one million on TikTok.

He shares regular updates of his work, mainly of him around the farm, which has been in the family since 1870, tending to sheep and pigs.

The influencer is unafraid to show a bit of skin to his fans, which will have prepared him well for his upcoming trip into the Love Island villa.

He and his family take care of between 3,000 and 4,000 sheep on their 230 acre farm.

Mr Young has shared videos of him tending to sick animals around the farm - but they don't always get the attention for the reason he is hoping.

One follower wrote on a clip of Mr Young explaining how to help an ill sheep: 'Poor man is trying to talk about how to help sheep but everyone's talking about how hot he is!'

Some of the videos, including several which show him assisting sheep having problems with labour during lambing season, have reportedly provoked some backlash online from animal rights' organisations.

But speaking to MailOnline, his mother Jenny, 53, said Will is a 'lovely, caring young man' who treats all of the animals as his pets. 

This includes two pigs who he has named Timon and Pumbaa after characters in The Lion King.

What!? Elsewhere, Will revealed that Claudia Winkleman , 50, once came to his Buckinghamshire farm and threw a bucket of water over him, while he was shirtless

Will's Love Island stint won't be his first brush with fame, as he has also revealed that Claudia Winkleman, 50, once came to his Buckinghamshire farm and threw a bucket of water over him, while he was shirtless.

Back in November, the farmer took to TikTok where he shared a video of his hilarious interaction with the Strictly Come Dancing host.

The farmer is hoping to have the time to dedicate to his love life as he takes a break from his busy job with the start of Love Island on Monday.

'Having grown up on a farm, it's been quite difficult juggling relationships and work,' he said. 'Love Island will give me time away from the farm to solely go out and find love.'

'I think I'm at the time of my life where I'm mature enough to go and find a wife.'

Hannah Jackson and Danny Gallagher

Hannah: 80.9K followers, Danny: 21.8K followers. 250 sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, a pony and a pumpkin patch 

Power couple Hannah Jackson, aka 'The Red Shepherdess' and farrier Danny Jackson share regular updates about life on the farm, having a combined total of more than 100,000 followers.

Based in Cumbria, the Red Shepherdess decided to pursue a career in farming after helping a sheep give birth on a family holiday.

Her decision to then start sharing an insight into her life and career online has proven challenging, but she wants to continue sharing informative content so the 'public knows where food comes from'.

Ms Jackson ditched her 'townie' lifestyle in Wirral nine years ago and moved to a farm near Carlise, Cumbria with her partner.

She's highly communicative with her 80,000 Instagram followers, answering questions from fans about the ins and outs of farm life and how she tends to her animals.

In 2022, Ms Jackson announced she'd branched out from livestock and had been tending to a pumpkin patch which would be open to the public.

'I am so proud when I wander through this field finding beautiful pumpkin treasures everywhere, of all different colours and all different sizes,' she told her followers. 

Meanwhile partner and farrier Mr Gallagher shoes horses from around the area as well as chipping in with regular farm tasks.

As well as snaps of him mid-shoeing and with the couple's many dogs, Mr Gallagher and Ms Jackson recently announced they are expecting a baby in the near future

As well as snaps of him mid-shoeing and with the couple's many dogs, Mr Gallagher and Ms Jackson recently announced they are expecting a baby in the near future. 

In 2022 they took over a new farm in Cumbria, from which they look after their hundreds of sheep and other animals. 

Erin McNaught

8,340 followers, sheep 

In 2018, Erin McNaught was crowned British Young Handler Champion and won the BBCs One Man and His Dog the following year for her work training and trialling sheepdogs.

The student also has a keen interest in the impact of climate change and puts a heavy emphasis on sustainability at Pandy Farm, her family's 250-acre beef and sheep farm near Bala in Wales.

She's a fourth generation farmer who uses her social media platform to tackle real issues facing the industry, particularly relating to the cost of living crisis, earning her a legion of loyal followers.

Ally Hunter Blair

23.5K followers, crops including wheat, barley and sugarbeet

Ally Hunter Blair took over his family farm in Herefordshire in 2012, after his father first began renting the land in 1968 from the Duchy of Cornwall.

An arable farm, he grows crops including wheat, barley, oilseed rape, beans and sugarbeat - but has also expanded the business to offer glamping stays and an equestrian business.

He told MailOnline that the weather 'controls my day-to-day life far more than it should', with high inflation and recent extreme weather events such as flooding leading to him sometimes questioning the risk vs reward of his industry.

Mr Blair began amassing his social media fans after appearing on several television shows, including Channel 4's First Time Farmers from 2012 to 2014

In a recent flood, a third of Weir End farm was left underwater, reminding him of the large proportion of his income which is out of his control. 

Mr Blair said: 'Often if I'm on Plan A at 7am I'll be on Plan D by 9am. It's half the fun but can be a bit stressful if you're a completer finisher!'

But he added: 'I always thought farming was what I wanted to do and I love it as a career and life.

'Highlights are definitely working in the beautiful countryside and being your own boss. 

'The last few years has really highlighted to me how lucky we are to call this part of Herefordshire work and home.'

Mr Blair began amassing his social media fans after appearing on several television shows, including Channel 4's First Time Farmers from 2012 to 2014.

As well as being able to show daily life as a farmer and ongoing environmental changes, he also appreciates the opportunity to connect with others: 'I've been chatting to some followers for well over a decade and probably know them as well as some of my closer friends having possibly never been within the same county or even country.

'The vast majority of my followers are fantastic, really supportive and [they] love to see what you're up to next.'

This connection is of increasing value to Mr Blair, who pointed out that increasing technological advancements mean there are fewer people required on the farm, which can lead to moments of loneliness. 

Emma Gray

69K followers, 600 sheep, 12 sheepdogs 

Right now, Emma Gray and her family are in what she calls 'survival mode'. It's winter, and as a farmer, she's 'a slave to the weather'. 

Even still, Ms Gray is delivering regular content for her 69,000 Instagram followers, sharing a slice of life battling the temperamental conditions on her 680 acre farm on the Scottish Isle of Bute.

While Ms Gray and her husband, firefighter Ewan, plan to turn Ardros into the first organic farm on the island, rearing and selling scotch lamb and beef, their passion lay in training sheepdogs.

There's 12 sheepdogs on the property, and they're in charge of shepherding 600 ewe sheep. She tells MailOnline farming is in her blood.

'I was lucky enough to be born into a farming family. It's really in my blood to want to do this... I know this is all I'll ever do.'

But that doesn't mean it's easy, or that she doesn't ever have her doubts. Living on the west coast of Scotland, it can often be a hard slog in trying to keep the farm in tip top shape, particularly in the harsh winter.

'Half of the joy of farming is the variety, and the fact that nor two days are the same, as farmers we are ruled by the weather and the time of year... it can make or break us, and living on the West Coast of Scotland it often breaks us.'

But the spring brings newborn lambs to care for, and in the summer Ms Gray spends most of her time making sure there's enough hay and silage to last the winter.

Autumn is dedicated to tending to the sheep, and preparing for the cycle to begin again. 

On her Instagram and YouTube channels, Ms Gray and her family share sweet videos of her dogs hard at work - and occasionally when they get into mischief.

Just three weeks ago she revealed she found one of her dogs, Turk, 'a busy, hyperactive, anxiety ridden mess' and realised he'd eaten all of her coffee grounds.

'We've all been there,' she told her followers. She rushed Turk to the vet, where he was treated and made a full recovery.  

As the youngest solo shepherdess in England, Ms Gray won two British Farming Awards, and starred in BBC 2's This Farming Life.

Sophie Gregory

7,800 followers, 500 animals including 360 cows 

Sophie Gregory is a first generation farmer in Dorset and passionate advocate for organic dairy.

She was the recipient of the 2021 Dairy Industry Woman of the Year award, and in addition to educating her followers on social media, she's involved in educating school-aged children about the importance of dairy and farmers.

She tells MailOnline she's up at 4am every day, first to meditate and then out in the shed by about 4.30am to start milking.

'Most of the time my posts are just in real time, sharing what it is we do. The only reason I do social media is to try to show, first that a career in farming can be for anyone, but also that dairy is really important.

Sophie Gregory (right) begins milking her cows at 4.30am every single morning

Ms Gregory wants farmers across the nation to be more open about the bond they have with their animals, explaining she doesn't believe there's any reason to be ashamed or hide the fact they'll 'one day be turned into meat and join the food chain'

In hilarious videos with her herds of cows, Ms Gregory asks them questions, pairs footage to music and offers an insight into the bond she has with her animals.

She says: 'I know every cow on farm. They're all really important.'

But her favourite cow is Pet Cow, who has been part of the family for nine years and is 11 years old.

'I don't think people realise us farmers love our animals.' 

Ms Gregory wants farmers across the nation to be more open about the bond they have with their animals, explaining she doesn't believe there's any reason to be ashamed or hide the fact they'll 'one day be turned into meat and join the food chain'. 

'I think the fact that we've given them so much respect is really important and I think the consumer would see the benefit of that.'

Tom Pemberton

126K followers, cows, goats and sheep  

Tom Pemberton has also made a name for himself in television, but far away from the world of bikinis and blind dates. 

Mr Pemberton, from Lancashire, keeps hundreds of dairy cows, most recently posting photos of himself and his team milking the animals on Christmas Day. 

He is an award-winning farmer who was recognised as a Hero Farmer at the British Farming Awards in October.

The influencer is a BBC Three presenter of the Fast and Farmer-ish and also has more than 50,000 followers on TikTok. 

Justine Fitton

3,400 followers 

Justine Fitton is a rising social media star who offers an insight into her life as an apprentice butcher at The Butchers Quarter in the centre of Manchester.

While butchery is largely considered a male industry, Ms Fitton was inspired to push her limits as a way to take a break from her previous job in social housing.

'I'm interested in sustainability, regenerative farming and moving away from factory farming,' she told MailOnline.

The glamorous butcher still has six months to go on her apprenticeship, but spends her days plying her trade and thinks she's nailed the perfect sausage.

'Me and another butcher once made around 2000 sausages in a day,' she said.

'You can normally tell if a popular chef has been on TV cooking a recipe with a specific cut of meat as everyone comes in asking for the same thing.'

She created a dedicated Instagram page for her butcher career in May 2021 aptly titled 'rack of glam', and has quickly amassed 3,000 followers.

When should I go to the butcher to get my meat? 

If you're after easy to cook meats, Ms Fitton said any day during the week you'll be able to pick up what you're after.

Friday and Saturday, the butcher is most likely to have cuts of steak out on display, as these are the days people are most likely to want to cook them.

On Sunday, the meat you're most likely to find is roasts.  

On the page, she shares videos of making sausages, pictures of her best cuts and even meat recommendations.

'When I first started butchery I didn't really have an idea of where it was going to take me. It was just an escape from the stress of working in social housing and what I thought was a really cool job,' she said.

'Now I can say I love doing what I do. Whilst trying to be relatable as possible, encourage good meat eating and sustainability, I wanna show girls can do it too.'

Ms Fitton is primarily interested in the 'field to fork' journey and hopes to educate her followers about appreciating where their food is coming from. 

'People may view the industry as being old fashioned and intimidating but really it's fun and inclusive and I want others to see that.'

One thing that's taken her by surprise in the job is the rise in demand for offal and liver.

The best cuts of meat often never make it to the shop floor as butchers will keep it for themselves, but Ms Fitton also shared tips for customers to ensure they're heading to the store on the best day for the meat they're after.

'In the week we tend to have easier to cook meats in the counter, Friday and Saturday, steaks, and Sundays are for roast dinners.'

Many of her followers say they were inspired by career path, and that she hasn't sacrificed any 'glamour' in the role.

'Love seeing more and more girls getting into the trade - especially when they are looking as glam as you,' one fan told her.

What prompted the rise of the farming influencer?

City life lost a bit of its shine for many people when Covid wrought havoc on densely populated areas.

With an uptick in remote working opportunities and skyrocketing costs, people were increasingly seeking inspiration - and a final sprinkling of motivation - to make the move.

The idyllic countryside and wide open space of farm life was tempting for many, but even those who remained in the city found themselves more interested than usual in how life was carrying on.

'Everything got stripped away in lockdown, and so people have been seeking out simple pleasures and more wholesome living,' farmer Laura Hodgkins told Marie Claire in 2021.

Ms Gray told MailOnline her rise to Instagram fame was a happy accident, having started to share snippets of her life to her personal account.

'Nowadays, everyone has a social media account. I was just one of those, I started sharing a few years ago and the followers just cam.

'I think there's a real and big appetite for living a rural life and working outside with animals, and for those who can't live it themselves, social media provides a window.' 

Meet the teenage farmer juggling a 150 acre plot of land with his GCSEs 

Will Banham, 15, began rearing livestock two years ago on a small patch of land near his Dorset home and made thousands of pounds from the venture.

When Harriet Sykes heard about his business acumen she asked him to work with her on her 150 acre farm near Bridport.

The odd couple are now breeding rare Castlemilk Moorit sheep which they will sell to market.

They currently have five lambs and hope to quickly grow the flock to 30.

Will will then sell the sought-after sheep to other farmers for around £80 each, making around £2,400.

The flock graze Harriet's land rent free - and in return Will helps her tend to her own flock of 60 sheep and 15 long horn cattle.

Together they make the 'perfect team', with teenager Will riding the quad bike and doing the heavy lifting, while Harriet offers her expertise and guidance in animal husbandry.

Will, who is also studying for his GCSEs, wakes up at 6am every Saturday to check on the sheep and visits the farm after school.

Harriet, meanwhile, feeds them in the week and 'makes a list' of jobs for him to do when he next visits.

She described him as a 'knowledgeable and dedicated young man who is one in a million'.

The widow, who purchased the land with her late husband, Anthony, over 20 years ago, said: 'I heard about William last spring and he was very keen to come and help with the lambing.

'I kept him on because I think it is important to give young people the opportunity for experience.

'We've since become partners which is good for both of us. He gets free grazing for his flock and he sells some of my sheep on my behalf. He's very knowledgeable and dedicated.

'He's very good at checking up on me - he will often call and say, ""have you broken the ice on the troughs?"" He can be quite bossy.

Past customers have described the lambs meat sold by Will as 'sensational' and said he offered a 'great service'

'I'm 78 so its good to have a strong young lad around. He can do things that I can't like turning over sheep and hammering in posts. It's gold dust.

'He works incredibly hard. He comes back from school on the bus and we work after dark.

'On the weekends he comes on his bike very early in all weathers - it is really admirable. He's one in a million.

'I suppose I will have to step down at some point and he could take over some of the business.'

Past customers have described the lambs meat sold by Will as 'sensational' and said he offered a 'great service'.

Farmers like me have felt besieged for the past two decades, castigated by Nimby neighbours, trussed up in red tape by over-zealous civil servants and, worst of all, frequently targeted by animal rights fanatics and militant vegans, particularly on social media.

The 'culture wars' have spilled out of university campuses onto our green and formerly pleasant farmland. Guardian journalist George Monbiot openly advocates the end of farming and its replacement with industrially produced laboratory food to achieve 'Net Zero'. We can't even turn on the television without being made to feel redundant and guilty by our publicly funded broadcaster.

BBC One's Countryfile seems to portray the traditional farming community as anti-nature, wholly responsible for the climate and biodiversity 'crises' and even racist.

The Archers plotlines on Radio 4 become more woke every year and the BBC's environmental presenter Chris Packham is brazenly spending this weekend promoting humourless, meat-free anarchy on the streets of London alongside Extinction Rebellion.

Enter stage right an unlikely saviour in the slightly paunchy shape of the 'world's most famous motoring journalist' (his own words)

I keep reminding myself that rural life must have felt like this in the 1650s. Cromwell's puritans hadn't quite banned foxhunting but they had banned almost everything else and everyone kept their heads down for fear of saying the wrong thing and being accused of witchcraft.

It would have taken a clairvoyant back then to predict that in 1660 the Restoration of the monarchy with Charles II would usher in a period of cheerful debauchery ""” and the political correctness of the puritans would go out of fashion.

Will the third Carolean Age see a similar sea-change in attitudes? Well, hopefully, it just might.

Enter stage right an unlikely saviour in the slightly paunchy shape of the 'world's most famous motoring journalist' (his own words). Walk into the snug bar of any rural pub and eavesdrop on the conversation of the young farmers and the word of approval on all their lips is: Clarkson.

Suddenly there is a national figure on TV who is on our side.

On the BBC, Springwatch's Chris Packham wears stylish clothes and adopts a self-righteous tone to tell us we're farming our land all wrong.

In Clarkson's Farm on Amazon Prime, Jeremy Clarkson takes a deliberately shambolic, double denim-clad approach to portraying farming as a series of cock-ups, mingled with intense frustration and occasional moments of joy, all told with charmingly self-deprecating humour.

It succeeds because we are bored with being preached to by woke people on mainstream TV and Clarkson is refreshingly candid and honest as he discusses the challenges and inevitable compromises involved in producing food for the nation, frequently at a financial loss, while preserving the natural landscape and its wildlife.

It's been a huge success because we are drawn in by the reality of farming life as we watch the team on Clarkson's Diddly Squat Farm battle to turn a profit from its photogenic acres

It's been a huge success because we are drawn in by the reality of farming life as we watch the team on Clarkson's Diddly Squat Farm battle to turn a profit from its photogenic acres (although, of course, Clarkson's wealth and television earnings make the farm profit and loss account relatively inconsequential). It is all in the very best British tradition of what Winston Churchill called KBO ""” Keep Buggering On.

And it is making Britain's urban majority see farming communities in a new light, as what the great 18th-century political philosopher Edmund Burke described as 'the little platoons' that still form the building blocks of rural society.

Every farm has its cast of characters ""” the Kalebs and Geralds we see on Clarkson's Farm, people often without much formal education or the attributes valued by modern society but nevertheless highly skilled and committed individuals who lovingly tend to Britain's livestock and landscape with practical intelligence and often great physical bravery.

Clarkson's hapless farming persona is also uncomfortably accurate for many of us who try to make a living from the land ""” the half-wit boss who pays all the bills, routinely gets trodden on or kicked in the gonads by livestock, and puts up with a stream of invective from his employees when he breaks machinery or generally gets in the way. And who often earns only around 40p per day from the enterprise for a 100-hour week.

Though we are very fortunate to work in beautiful surroundings and most of us would not swap what we do for any other existence, farming life is hard and often threatening to mental health ""” tragically, more farmers take their own lives than in almost any other profession and it is far removed from the comfortable stereotype in the socialist narrative.

But most importantly, what Clarkson's Farm does is shine a bright light on where public policy is going wrong.

In fact, it has done more for the farming industry in a couple of years than the National Farmers Union has in decades.

Every farm has its cast of characters ""” the Kalebs and Geralds we see on Clarkson's Farm

Clarkson, though, is modest about his role in this. He told me he is: 'Not a proper farmer so why should people listen to any agenda I might have. I just show things as they are and the system, particularly the bits designed by teenagers in Whitehall, is bonkers. You don't have to make anything up!'

As someone who also came into farming relatively late in life with a fresh pair of eyes, in my case after a first career in the Army, I can endorse that.

Take badgers, a protected species. Clarkson's plain speaking ""” 'I f****** hate badgers' ""” is fantastically refreshing after decades of being fed a carefully slanted diet of half truths about farming and conservation by the metropolitan Establishment and by shows such as Countryfile and Springwatch.

They unfailingly portray badgers as cute, cuddly and rare. Yet there is overwhelming evidence that badgers spread tuberculosis in cattle, and this can lead to entire herds being slaughtered ""” one devastated farmer in the series had lost 60 cows to tuberculosis along with her livelihood.

The truth is because it is protected, I believe the badger population is spiralling out of control and it is having a devastating effect not only on cows but also on other species such as hedgehogs, hares, ground nesting birds, bees, grass snakes and other vanishing species the animal preys on.

I'm sure Clarkson doesn't really hate badgers; he reveals himself to be a rather sentimental animal lover and keeps one unproductive heifer as a pet, which no farmer can really afford to do. But he is right to challenge the prevailing narrative of the keyboard conservationists ""” and brave, for the animal rights mob are not people to upset lightly.

His sardonic humour is also the ideal tool for highlighting the neo-Stalinist way that, despite our exit from the EU, the Big State still insinuates its way onto farms, stifling innovation wearing down management in form-filling and frustrated impotence.

This is a serious issue; in the post-Brexit era farms need to adapt rapidly to avoid catastrophe as 'Global Britain' adopts free trade. West Oxfordshire District Council's refusal to allow the sale of milk from eight miles away, over the county boundary in Gloucestershire, in the Diddly Squat Farm Shop is a classic piece of red tape ripe for cutting.

We all know farming has to change if we are to meet the challenges of reversing biodiversity loss and taking carbon out of the atmosphere. It is evident to those of us who obsess about the farmed environment that Diddly Squat Farm is managed sensitively with food production and the preservation of wildlife habitats well balanced.

The crops are established without ploughing, hedges are laid then allowed to grow tall and thick, there is a healthy, biodiverse woodland floor beneath Clarkson's native broadleaf trees and there are areas of the farm sown with nectar rich plants. He doesn't need to virtue-signal like the Monbiots and Packhams of this world.

The countryside narrative we have all been listening to has been biased and wrong for too long. But it is changing at last. Keep broadcasting, Jezza!

Jeremy Clarkson's Diddly Squat farm made just £144 in its first year - highlighting the threat faced by farmers from what he calls council bureaucrats, 'badger vigilantes' and 'cow police'. 

The former Top Gear host has been praised for using his hit Amazon Prime show to expose the problems facing the agriculture industry, from meddlesome pen-pushers to uncertainty caused by Brexit. 

Working on the farm has previously led the presenter to wonder how farmers 'who don't have Amazon film crews' would survive the removal of agricultural subsidies after Brexit. 

Charlie Ireland, who advises Clarkson on how to manage his 1,000-acre farm, predicts the UK will lose '30 per cent' of farmers who can no longer make the industry financially viable, pointing out that Diddly Squat's paltry revenues had also been boosted by media attention. 

And in last night's episode, Clarkson stormed out of an Oxfordshire council planning meeting after learning that plans for his Diddly Squat Farm restaurant would be refused.

In episode five, Jeremy Clarkson can be seen attending a planning application meeting, in which his plans for a restaurant on the farm are refused

Despite recording limited profits, the TV personality's farm has £1.34million in assets and 17 employees. 

While Clarkson has faced plenty of criticism from locals in the village, he has also won praise from other farmers.

Among them is fellow celebrity farmer, Roger Daltrey, former frontman of The Who fame, who texts him: 'If we can't overcome the opposition to diversification schemes, what hope is there for ordinary farmers?' 

Jamie Blackett, who farms in Dumfriesshire and has written several books about rural life, said that despite Clarkson's 'slapstick' approach, he 'puts his finger on some of the most important challenges in the British countryside'. 

Mr Blackett praised him for standing up to the 'Packhamites' - a reference to naturalist Chris Packham - and 'white settlers clustered around Nimby Central in the former farming community known as the Cotswolds'. 

Writing in The Telegraph, he said Clarkson's view of badgers - which '[borders] on clinically psychopathic' - is 'shared by anyone who really cares about our native fauna' due to the harm they do to wildlife and how they contribute to the spread of TB.  

But, he adds, the 'bigger theme running through the eight episodes explores his thesis that the post-Brexit plan to remove agricultural subsidies has set British farmers up for catastrophe unless red tape can be cut to allow them to diversify and add value to their produce by selling direct to the consumer'. 

West Oxfordshire District Council last night spoke out after Clarkson's clash with officials. 

After the show aired fans suggested 'pen-pushing' council officials 'hate Clarkson' and had a 'vendetta' against the star.

Roger Daltrey of The Who, another celebrity farmer, is among those praising Clarkson for shining a light on the reality of farming

In response, a council spokesman said the presenter is treated 'no differently' than anyone else. 

The council has stressed that proper procedures were followed in Clarkson's planning applications, which included plans for a car park.

A statement said: 'We understand that the planning process shown in Season 2 of Clarkson's Farm can seem obstructive and that people will be confused by the planning decisions at Diddly Squat Farm.

'As with any other planning authority, we have a legal responsibility to make sure that planning laws and policies are followed correctly by everyone to manage development and protect local communities and the environment.

'This is regardless of who they are and we treat Diddly Squat Farm no differently.'

It comes after the furore over Clarkson's comments on Meghan Markle in a column in The Sun newspaper - after which he temporarily closed the doors to his shop.

But yesterday Clarkson confirmed there will be a third season of his hugely popular farming show, despite suggestions Amazon would axe it in the wake of the backlash.

Diddly Squat Farm, in Chadlington, is located in the Cotswold Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty which means it is subject to tighter planning restrictions than other areas of the country.

There were huge queues outside Clarkson's farm shop after it reopened at the weekend for the first time since its winter closure

The council added: 'As shown on the programme, officers from the council went to meet with the owners of Diddly Squat Farm to provide advice which was one of multiple conversations we had to try and support the farm.

'Over recent years, Diddly Squat Farm has had many planning applications approved where they were in line with national and local planning policy.

'This included approving the farm shop with its current car park, approving a lambing shed and allowing the area from which farm shop produce could be sourced to be extended.

'The farm shop we approved can sell local produce from local farmers - which we wholly support.'

Clarkson and the council have come head to head several times since he took over the farm in 2019. 

Many locals were dissatisfied with the business when the presenter decided to build a farm shop and restaurant.

Clarkson has admitted his neighbours are 'divided' when it comes to him and his farm, suggesting it was partly to do with 'my past'.  

After criticism from Clarkson, the council insisted all the relevant planning laws had been followed  

West Oxfordshire District Council has hit back at Clarkson - saying his Diddly Squat Farm must abide by planning and bylaws, despite its popularity

The council rejected two planning applications for the restaurant last year, which he appealed.

Applications to expand the car park from ten spaces to 70 were also rejected by the council, which said it would be 'visually intrusive'.

The plan also included new entry and exit points off Chipping Norton Road and a storage compound. 

After the council overturned his plans to turn his old lambing barn into a restaurant, Jeremy settled for transforming an abandoned barn instead.

Since reopening over the weekend after being closed for the winter, the farm shop saw huge queues of eager fans.

Photographs show long lines of people waiting to enter the TV star's shop on Diddly Squat Farm and many cars parked along the country road. 

Local council officials warned Clarkson fans not to cause any traffic chaos by parking near his farm ahead of the expected influx of fans to the site.

Meanwhile, preparations for the grand opening of the restaurant on the weekend were thrown into disarray when Jeremy and the team were faced with electrical faults in the venue.

There was soon a pile up of visitors arriving in their cars as the restaurant was not ready to seat them. As a result, Clarkson reportedly stormed off in a rage.  

It comes as Clarkson has confirmed there will be a third season of his farming show, after claims Amazon would axe it amid backlash over his controversial Meghan Markle column.

The 62-year-old received glowing reviews on social media after the new season came out on Friday morning.

Many fans have reportedly binge-watched the series in the space of one weekend and are already keen for more.

From Kaleb to Charlie: Who are the key characters in Clarkson's Farm?

KALEB COOPER

Kaleb has become the unlikely star of Jeremy Clarkson's fly on the wall documentary thanks to down-to-Earth manner.

Despite being the less senior of the two, the 24-year-old is regularly seen giving his boss Jeremy a dressing down, and has even claimed he is in charge of the operation. 



Kaleb and Taya, who have a son, Oscar, recently announced they were expecting a baby girl 

Born and bred in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, a small town with a population of just 6,337, Kaleb says he never wants to leave, despite his immense success.

Speaking to The Times magazine, he revealed the furthest he has ever travelled from his village is London, which he has visited three times, and hated, describing it as 'f****** awful'.

The prospect of travelling abroad is even less likely, as the farming expert does not currently own a passport.

Last year, he revealed that he and his fiancÃ©e Taya are expecting a baby girl.

Kaleb shared the happy news on social media with a gender reveal video featuring two tractors blowing out pink exhaust. 

The couple already have a young son, Oscar.  

Following the success of Clarkson's Farm, which debuted in 2021, he has built an army of a million Instagram fans and written a book. 

GERALD COOPER

Gerald - no relation to Kaleb - is a dry stone waller who has won his own fan account despite having an accent so thick that many viewers have been left needing to turn on the subtitles. 

The West Country native has been combine harvesting on the farm for 50 years and seems to have a constant smile on his face. 

However in one hilarious encounter, Gerald is helping Clarkson to harvest crops but because of his thick West Country accent the Top Gear presenter was unable to understand him at all.

Gerald Cooper has stolen the show alongside Kaleb. Despite sharing the same surname the pair aren't related 

And in the end some of the crops were wasted because Clarkson couldn't keep up. 

In an interview with Farming Weekly, Clarkson admitted it was Gerald who originally inspired him to make the show. 

'He's such a character, I knew he'd be great on TV,' he said. 

In 2021, Clarkson told the Oxford Mail: 'It doesn't matter if you can't understand what he's talking about, because he's usually talking about Manchester United.

'He's fantastic. We've known each other for a very long time. He's 72, also never been outside the village, but has worked on this farm for 50 years. He's a great dry stone-waller, which is a dying art.'  

CHARLIE IRELAND

Charlie is Clarkson's land agent and adviser, who was hired in 2019 after the former Top Gear host first made the decision to run his own farm. 

The University of Nottingham graduate is an agricultural specialist who advises the presenter on all aspects of farm management, from where to plant crops to managing the finances. 

This role leads to him regularly having to tell Clarkson where he has gone wrong, leading to his ironic nickname of 'Cheerful Charlie'. 

Mr Ireland is a managing partner with Ceres Rural, an agricultural services firm in Saffron Waldon. 

He previously worked as an agricultural consultant with Strutt & Parker for 20 years.

LISA HOGAN 

Lisa is Jeremy's girlfriend, and makes regular appearances on the show as the manager of the farm shop. 

The Irish model, 49, is the ex-wife of multimillionaire Baron Steven Bentinck, and has previosuly jested that Jeremy 'wears the trousers' in their relationship.

She said: 'We do have a really good relationship. Jeremy definitely wears the trousers but I'd like to think it's fairly even, to be honest.'

Educated at the prestigious Alexandra College in Ireland, she got her big break in acting in the early 1990s, when John Cleese employed her as a researcher. 

Jeremy kisses girlfriend Lisa Hogan as Kaleb awkwardly averts his eyes

She was later cast as a sea lion keeper in the 1997 comedy flick Fierce Creatures, starring alongside Cleese, Michael Palin and Jamie Lee Curtis.  

Lisa was once referred to as Cleese's muse, but denied any suggestion they were romantically involved, telling Irish Independent journalist Barry Egan: 'We certainly didn't have an affair. We were seen quite a lot but we used to work together. We got on well.'

In August 1997, Lisa - then aged 25 - had a near-death experience when her partner's £1million private Lear jet crash-landed on the A40 dual-carriageway after it overshot the runway at RAF Northolt in London. Jeremy's first marriage was to Alex Hall in 1989, however they split six months later when she left him for one of his friends.

In 1993, he married his manager Frances Cain and had children Emily, 28, Finlo, 25, and Katya, 23.

I'm a Harvard researcher - this is why buying 'organic' food is a total con

There is no evidence proving that organic food is any healthier than conventionally grown options, a Harvard University professor claims.

Organic foods, valued at over $75 billion, have long been touted as superior to conventionally grown foods, with some studies claiming they have added health properties and can ward off disease. 

More than two-thirds of Americans believe these foods, which claim to be grown with fewer pesticides and often cost significantly more than regular food, are healthier.

 However, Dr Robert Paalberg, professor in the Sustainability Science Program at Harvard University, said that evidence suggesting organic food is more nutritious is unreliable, and consuming fewer pesticides may not have an impact on health.

'There is no reliable evidence showing that organically grown foods are more nutritious or safer to eat,' he said. 

'If we follow science, organic food loses its apparent advantage.' 

In order to be considered organic by the USDA, foods have to have been grown on soil that contains none of its prohibited substances for at least three years prior to harvest

Dr Robert Paalberg, professor in the Sustainability Science Program at Harvard University, said that evidence suggesting organic food is more nutritious is unreliable, and consuming fewer pesticides may not have an impact on health

Dr Paalberg pointed to a 2012 review from Stanford University, which looked at 237 studies on organic food. The researchers found no convincing differences in nutrients or health benefits between organic and conventional foods.

The main difference was that organic foods had fewer pesticides. 

Dr Dena M Bravata, senior study author, said at the time of publication: 'There isn't much difference between organic and conventional foods if you're an adult and making a decision based solely on your health.'

Organic foods still use pesticides, but per the US Department of Agriculture, they are mostly restricted to natural sources, like copper and sulfur, whereas conventional produce can use synthetic pesticides.

However, organic farmers still have restricted access to 25 synthetic pesticides, whereas conventional farming can use more than 900.  

Dr Paalberg said that banning synthetic pesticides from organic foods doesn't have any health benefits.

'The organic ban on synthetic chemicals also fails to improve food safety in the US, since the use of pesticides is now significantly regulated in conventional farming (insecticide use today is 82 percent lower than it was in 1972), and because produce in supermarkets has been washed to remove nearly all of the chemical residues that might remain,' he said.

What is organic food? 

The term 'organic' refers to how certain foods are produced. 

In order to be labelled 'organic' foods have been grown and farmed without the use of:

Organic foods range from fresh produce, dairy products and meats. 

But also includes processed food such as crackers, drinks, and frozen meals  

The market for organic food has significantly expanded since the late 20th century, and has become a multibillion dollar industry. 

He pointed to a 2021 USDA analysis of pesticide residues on more than 10,000 conventional food samples. It found that more than 99 percent of samples had residues that were safely below the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) tolerance levels, which are one in one hundred parts of exposure. 

'Food scientists at the University of California, Davis, conclude from such surveys that the ""marginal benefits of reducing human exposure to pesticides in the diet through increased consumption of organic produce appear to be insignificant,""' Dr Paalberg said. 

In order to be considered organic by the USDA, these foods have to have been grown on soil that contains none of these prohibited substances for at least three years prior to harvest.

Organic meat regulations require animals be raised in conditions that accommodate their natural behaviors- such as grazing in a pasture- fed 100 percent organic, and not be administered any antibiotics or hormones.  

Still, about 40 percent of Americans believe at least some of the food they eat is organic, according to Pew Research data. And 68 percent believe organic food is healthier than conventionally grown options. 

This could be due to organic food's higher price tag, as well as some studies that suggest it could be healthier.

For example, in 2018, a French study in JAMA Internal Medicine showed that among 70,000 adults, those who consumed organic food had 25 percent fewer cancers than those who never ate organic. 

Two years earlier, a meta-analysis in the British Journal of Nutrition found that organic meat and milk provided 50 percent more omega-3 fatty acids, which are vital for brain and heart health, than non-organic products. 

Dr Paalberg suggested Americans may be more drawn to organic food because they think it supports smaller farmers, but this isn't the case.

'Many consumers continue to think organic foods come from small local farms, but most now come from distant industrial farms. By one estimate in 2014, only 8 percent of organic sales in the U.S. were still being made by small farmers through farmer's markets or through community-supported agriculture,' he said.

The war in Ukraine has fuelled a crime wave in rural Britain as gangsters steal farm machinery to smuggle into Russia. 

Police say the conflict has contributed to a 300 per cent rise in machinery theft in England and Wales in the first quarter of the year. 

Particularly prized are agricultural and construction machines - such as excavator and GPS units for mapping fields - which are shipped to Eastern Europe before being taken across the border. 

While Western sanctions against Russia and Belarus have sought to spare the agricultural sector to avoid global food insecurity, major manufacturers including John Deere have halted shipments to both countries. 

The Russian army raided a John Deere factory in Ukraine during the first weeks of the war as farmers struggled to obtain vital spare parts.

'In my professional opinion, without doubt the war in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia are having an impact on rural crime in the UK,' Supt Andy Huddleston, the head of the National Rural Crime Unit, told the Telegraph.

'We would normally expect to see around 70 high-value agricultural vehicles being stolen across the country each month but in March we recorded the theft of 180.' 

Gangs previously targeted rural regions in eastern England but are now also raiding farms in the North and Scotland, police say. 

New research from NFU Mutual revealed the cost of GPS theft in the first four months of 2023 exceeded £500,000, more than double compared to the same period last year. 

Some criminal groups are using drones to identify expensive equipment before swooping at night. 


It comes as members of the National Farmers' Union and representatives from 40 police forces met yesterday to discuss the problem of crime in rural areas.

NFU Vice President David Exwood, who hosted the event, said: 'Highly organised gangs of criminals continue to plague the great British countryside, stealing livestock and expensive GPS equipment, trespassing on private land and regularly fly-tipping tons of rubbish; their actions significantly impact farm businesses, farming families and rural communities, both financially and emotionally.'

The National Rural Crime Unit was formed recently to help police forces crack down on organised criminal gangs operating in the countryside.

AI predicts majority of the world will be VEGAN by 2075 - thanks to Gen Z and Millennials

Artificial intelligence has predicted the majority of the world will be vegan by 2075. 

This is due to the record numbers of environmentally conscious Gen Z and Millennials ditching meat for plant-based options.  

Now, OpenAI's ChatGPT has shared details for the end of meat and dairy consumption after being asked to ' provide a timeline of the world going vegan starting in 2024 when Gen Z and Millennials raise awareness on animal agriculture.'

The chatbot said the term 'flexitarian' will become more common by 2027 as people adopt a more plant-based diet worldwide.

And by 2073, 'the world is almost entirely vegan' because it is the typical diet among the current generation in 2055.

Researchers previously forecasted that these generations will push for more dairy and meat plant-based alternatives by 2024

The NPD Group, a data research group, recently conducted a study about Gen Z and Millennials, which will spark the movement that could lead to a vegan world.

Darren Seifer, NPD food industry analyst and co-author of the study, said in a statement: 'As consumers continue to prepare more meals in the home and younger generations cook more, plant-based foods and ingredients will be a part of their repertoire.

'In addition to providing a variety of plant-based foods and ingredients, food manufacturers should also focus efforts on Millennials and Gen Zs since they will be driving the category's growth. 

'Their concerns for sustainability and animal welfare should also be taken into account when messaging them.'

Using the information collected by The NPD Group, DailyMail.com asked ChatGPT to create the timeline.

After Gen Z and Millennials start raising awareness in 2024, major food technology companies will release more varied plant-based meat alternatives by 2028 and spread the word on social media platforms.

Using this information, OpenAI's ChatGPT created a detailed timeline for the end of meat and dairy consumption, with the change starting with an increase in awareness of ethical, environmental and health issues related to animal agriculture

ChatGPT predicts plant-based diets will be on the rise among North Americans and Europeans one year later.

While dairy and meta alternatives are pricey - Impossible Food's vegan paddy costs standard restaurants $3.63, compared to an average meat burger's price tag of $1.58 - the chatbot believes this will change in 2032, according to a report from BestCasinoSites.net, an online casino site. 

'A breakthrough in food technology leads to more affordable and convincing plant-based meat and dairy alternatives,' according to ChatGPT.

This was especially acute if they had applied for jobs that the researchers claimed were stereotypical 'male,' such as a financial analyst. 

Around the same time, some regions will see a decline in traditional farming.

By 2037, North American and European governments will implement subsidies for plant-based agriculture.

ChatGPT predicts the first 'Climate Action and Veganism Day' will be celebrated in 2048, endorsed by celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and Natalie Portman.

However, it will not be until 2057 that veganism is 'widely accepted and normalized in many parts of the world.'

The chatbot believes athletes like Serena Williams and Lewis Hamilton will push to normalize the diet in 2059.

And 'Global Vegan Week' will become an international event in 2064.

'McDonald's re-introduces 'McVegan' [in 2068], now leaning into a rapid transition to a fully vegan menu,' reads ChatGPT's timeline.

'2070: Most younger generations, who have grown up with veganism as the norm, have significantly shaped a predominantly vegan world.'

And by 2073, 'the world is almost entirely vegan' - two years before animal farming becomes obsolete.

'While it's impossible to predict the future with certainty, I can offer a hypothetical timeline based on the assumption that Gen Z and Millennials raising awareness on animal agriculture will lead to a significant shift in dietary habits,' ChatGPT shared with its response.

'Keep in mind that this is a speculative scenario, and the actual timeline may vary widely by region and culture.'

EXCLUSIVE Outrage after students at Britain's top agricultural university strap dead fox to the roof of a car for charity rally as stunt is reported to police

Students at a prestigious university dubbed 'Oxbridge for farmers' strapped a dead fox to the roof of a car during a charity rally, MailOnline can reveal. 

A photo from the fundraising event at the Royal Agricultural University (RAU) in Cirencester, Gloucestershire shows the lifeless animal sprawled on the vehicle's roof with each of its legs secured by blue rope. 

The students' union stunt appeared to spark amusement among onlookers yesterday, with two spectators apparently laughing as the car passed by them. A caption on the social media photo read 'does it get anymore Ciren'. 

The university, whose patron is Charles III, is known for attracting the scions of wealthy farmers and counts Captain Mark Phillips, Princess Anne's former husband, among its alumni.

Founded in 1845 as the first agricultural university in the English-speaking world, the RAU recently ranked among the top-ten universities in the country for student experience.

But its 'Hooray Henry' students have also gained a reputation for rowdy behaviour and a heavy drinking culture. 

Referring to yesterday's incident, a source told MailOnline: 'Given it's a university with the motto ''caring for the fields and the beasts'', it's a fairly clear (if not shocking) breach of their supposed ethos. 

'The RAU is full of entitled old fogeys who are resistant to any sort of change - most are so rich they think they can get away with anything.' 

The university said it condemned the students' behaviour and had contacted Gloucestershire Constabulary for help with identifying the perpetrators.  

The force said it had spoken to the students on the day and given them 'words of advice' but no crime had been committed.  

Wild foxes are considered vermin, so while it is against the law to hunt them with dogs it is not illegal to shoot them humanely with a registered firearm. 

The offence of outraging public decency concerns behaving in a way that is 'lewd, obscene or disgusting' in the presence of at least two members of the public.

Students from the Royal Agricultural University were in attendance last week during a visit to a dairy farm by the Countess of Wessex.

Sophie, 58, got stuck in bottle-feeding a young calf milk during her visit to Smerrill Dairy in Cirencester.    

A Royal Agricultural University spokesman told MailOnline: 'We condemn this behaviour. 

'As soon as we were made aware of this incident, the details were passed to our Student Services team and an investigation was started immediately.

'We have spoken to the police and to our Students' Union to identify those involved. 

'We will absolutely not tolerate this kind of behaviour and will deal with those involved appropriately.'

Gloucestershire Police said: 'We are aware of the incident and have been in contact with the Royal Agricultural University.

'Officers were present at the rally and spoke to students at the time with words of advice. No criminal offences are believed to have taken place at this time.'

Scientists warn Cavendish bananas could go EXTINCT as 'catastrophic' fungal disease is about to wipe out the world's most popular type of fruit

Nearly half of the world's bananas are on the brink of extinction as a fungal disease threatens plantations across the globe.

Cavendish crops in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Australia and Central America have already been infected by the Panama disease, a soil-born fungus.

The disease causes the plants to wilt by targeting their vascular system and reducing the amount of water they take in from the soil. 

Experts recently identified early signs of the 'catastrophic' fungus in South America, where most exported Cavendish bananas are grown in our supermarkets. 

Cavendish crops in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Australia and Central America have already been infected by the Panama disease, a soil-born fungus.

Cavendish bananas account for 47 percent of global banana production and exports.

However, this type of banana was grown to replace another that was eradicated by the disease.

Gros Michel, also called Big Mike, was the main type until the 1950s.

The United Fruit Company popularized Gros Michael but introduced Cavendish in 1947 when the banana plantations began to die off.

Cavendish was immune to the strand, allowing it to dominate the market.

However, in 1997, scientists found a new strain called TR4 in Australia that could infect Cavendish, and the fungus traveled throughout the continent by 2015.

Experts recently identified the 'catastrophic' fungus in South America, where most exported Cavendish bananas are grown in our supermarkets

James Dale, a professor and leader of the banana biotechnology program at the Queensland University of Technology, told Insider: 'Since then, it has spread to India and China, the world's largest producers of bananas. 

'It has also spread to the Middle East and Africa and very recently was found in South America.'

Panama TR4 is easily spread by people, vehicles, machinery and animals by the movement of infected banana plants, planting material, and contaminated soil and water. 

The infection is apparent when leaves begin to turn yellow, which then leads to wilting and browning.

The stem of banana plants will then rot on the inside, which appears as a discoloration when cut open.

Scientists are working on a TR4-resistant Cavendish or a resistant replacement for Cavendish, which is done by developing a genetically modified version.

This is possible using CRISPR-Cas9, a precise technique that allows academics to alter and remove sections of DNA, allowing the total eradication of the disease. 

A team of researchers at Queensland University of Technology (QUT) is also developing a genetically modified variety of Cavendish bananas called QCAV-4.

QCAV-4 bananas, developed in partnership with government and industry, have been grown in field trials in the Northern Territory for over six years and have proven highly resistant to Panama Disease TR4. 

The fruit is a Cavendish Grand Nain banana that has been bioengineered with a single gene, RGA2, from the wild southeast Asian banana.

'I would say with certainty that there will be a solution before the export market for Cavendish is severely affected,' Dale told Insider.

WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF THE CAVENDISH BANANA?  

The Cavendish banana is currently the world's main commercial crop.

It was first grown in large volumes by the Peak District stately home of Chatsworth house.  

According to folklore, Chatsworth's first head gardener, Joseph Paxton was inspired to grow a banana by one he saw depicted on Chinese wallpaper in a bedroom at Chatsworth.  



For nearly a hundred years the story was thought to be a myth, as nobody could find the painted banana.  

Joseph Paxton was successfully growing bananas at Chatsworth by 1835 after obtaining one from Mauritius.  



There was great excitement at Chatsworth in November 1835 when the banana plant flowered. By the following May, it was loaded with more than 100 fruit. 

Within a few years, he had enough plants to offer them to enthusiasts from all over the country. 



The banana variety known as Gros Michel was initially the world leader and had the edge until the Second World War.

But the Dwarf Cavendish had certain characteristics which gave it an advantage.

The one property which enabled the Cavendish variety to take the crown as top banana was its greater resistance to disease.

The Gros Michel was virtually wiped out worldwide by Panama disease, also known as banana wilt, caused by a fungus. 

Within a decade, the Dwarf Cavendish and its varieties had become the main commercial crop around the globe.

More than a dozen major food manufacturers have earned an F grade for their lack of progress in reducing pesticides, a report has found.

The nonprofit organization As You Sow scored 17 manufacturers of popular products like Kraft Mac and Cheese, Green Giant vegetables, and Lunchables on their efforts to combat pesticide use in their foods.

The report found all 17 manufacturers, which included household names like General Mills, PepsiCo, Nestle, and Kraft Heinz, earned a C grade or below for their efforts to reduce pesticide use, and 10 of them received an F. 

Pesticides are substances designed to kill pests, such as insects, that could otherwise get into crops. Long-term exposure to several of these has been linked to detrimental health issues, including asthma, depression, ADHD, and cancer. 

A report from nonprofit As You Sow evaluated the efforts 17 food companies have taken to reduce pesticides and gave them grades. None of the companies scored better than a C

Long-term exposure to pesticides has been consistently linked to chronic health issues such as cancer, asthma, anxiety, depression, and ADHD

As You Sow's report rated each company on 27 elements of risk reduction, including transparency to the public about pesticide use, identifying the highest risk chemicals and requiring raw food suppliers to perform pesticide risk assessments. 

The data was collected from a review of publicly available information, including the companies' published reports, press statements, and information on their websites.  

The companies were scaled on a score from one to 10 and then assigned a corresponding letter grade. 

As You Sow also compared the findings to its previous reports from 2019 and 2021. The average grade was a D in 2021, which dropped to an F this year.

On a scale of one to 10, the average company score was 4.5 points. 

General Mills, which owns brands like Annie's, Cheerios, and Green Giant, earned the top spot with a C rating.

General Mills had the second-highest score in the 'Pesticide Risk Reduction Strategy' section, indicating it is putting effort into reducing pesticide use in its foods. 

GM has published goals to reduce pesticide use across its supply chains and improve its transparency. 

The company was followed by Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), which manufactures ingredients like sweeteners and syrups. 

Ten companies received an F, and J.M. Smucker Company, which makes Folgers coffee, Jif peanut butter, and Smucker's jam, took last place.

The company did not score a single point in any category, including pesticide risk reduction, transparency, and monitoring pesticides of high concern. 

None of the 10 companies receiving an F prioritized the health and safety of farmworkers who use the chemicals, the report said. 

Long-term exposure to pesticides has been consistently linked to chronic health issues such as cancer, asthma, anxiety, depression, and ADHD. 

Children and unborn babies are especially susceptible to the adverse effects of pesticides. 

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, pesticide exposure during pregnancy can lead to an increased risk of birth defects, low birth weight, and fetal death.

'Exposure in childhood has been linked to attention and learning problems, as well as cancer,' the academy said. 

Last year, researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, found fetuses who were exposed to four types of pesticides were more likely to develop the eye cancer retinoblastoma. 

Additionally, a study funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) found men, particularly male farmers, who were exposed to the herbicide glyphosate had higher oxidative stress biomarkers in their urine. 

Oxidative stress damages DNA and is thought to be a key feature of carcinogens - substances capable of causing cancer.

YOU can now eat pigs genetically modified using CRISPR: FDA approves altered German-style sausages to be sold at restaurants and grocery stores

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the sale of genetically modified pigs at restaurants and grocery stores.

The altered pork, made as German-style sausages, was developed by scientists at Washington State University who used CRISPR to improve genetic traits in livestock.

The team used the gene-editing tool to pass elite DNA from one breeder to several others, which let more males pass on desirable traits and improve food production.

This process could produce livestock that can thrive in harsh conditions - and still provide adequate nutrition for people. 

The altered pork, made as German-style sausages, was developed by scientists at Washington State University who used CRISPR to improve genetic traits in livestock

Jon Oatley, a professor at Washington State University(WSU), led the research and worked closely with the FDA to gain approval.

Oatley and his team used CRISPR on five pigs to demonstrate that food made from the animals is safe and that an academic institution can achieve this type of FDA authorization.

The two-year-old pigs were processed at the WSU Meat Lab, and the US Department of Agriculture inspected the meat as it does with all meat products. 

The team edited the pigs to let them pass traits from another male down to other pigs. 

Known as surrogate sires, this technology first gene-edits male animals to be sterile by knocking out a gene called NANOS2 specific to male fertility. 

These animals can then be implanted with another male's stem cells, creating sperm with that male's desired traits to be passed on to the next generation.

Essentially a high-tech form of selective breeding, surrogate sire technology can greatly expand the dissemination of valuable genetics in livestock.

It has the potential not just to improve meat quality but the health and resilience of livestock in the face of changing environmental conditions, a critical goal for increasing protein sources in developing nations.

Environment Secretary George Eustice insisted that gene-edited products would not need to be advertised as such because they are 'fundamentally natural.' 

Piglets born from the surrogate sires have not been approved for sale as of yet but will be reviewed by the FDA for possible inclusion in the food chain. 

Approving the initial work took about two years and hundreds of thousands of dollars. 

'The original intent in making these animals was to try to improve the way that we feed people,' Oatley said. 

'And we can't do that unless we can work with the FDA system to get these animals actually into the food chain.' 

WSU is the first organization to receive FDA approval for genetically altered pork, but a company named Acceligen obtained approval in 2020 for products made from 'Slick-Haired Cattle,' which are gene-edited to have coats that increase the animals' resilience to higher temperatures. 

Oatley said that the public often holds many misconceptions about gene editing and hopes the WSU example will help dispel misinformation and improve perceptions of this technology.

'There's a trust that comes with university-based research,' Oatley said. 'At WSU, we're all about the science. 

'We just want to ensure the research is valid and the animals we produce are healthy.'

The Mexican eatery, owned by Masterchef champion Thomasina Miers, 47, hopes to go as green as possible by ditching any dish that contains the red meat item.

It comes after the chain, which boasts 13 restaurants, began displaying the carbon footprints of its dishes last year. 

It found the chargrilled steak burritos to be the worst offender, meaning the item, along with the bestselling steak and cheese tacos, will now no longer be served. 

Wahaca joins a growing number of restaurants to remove meat items from menus, after a report in January found it cuts costs while appealing to the growing vegan market.  

Two of Wahaca's beef dishes will remain, however, including the slow-cooked beef tacos, although it is hoped diners will be open to trying more veggie options.

Last month, Ms Miers, who won Masterchef in 2005, said Britain's food system was 'completely broken' due to 'insecurities' such as 'climate and biodiversity.' 

Commenting on removing steak from Wahaca's menu, the outspoken environmentalist told the Telegraph this week: 'We wanted to look at a way of reducing the amount of meat dishes... while still offering truly tasty options for those that still enjoy eating it.

'Being conscious that meat and dairy products are among the biggest culprits from an emissions perspective has led to us expanding our vegetarian and vegan offerings in recent years.'

The company was founded in 2007 with a single location in Covent Garden, before expanding to an impressive 20 sites.

However it was forced to sell off seven of its restaurants after being hit hard by the Covid pandemic in 2020, and Wahaca's lenders wrote off millions in debts to keep the brand going. 

Ms Miers has become a successful celebrity chef over the years, writing a recipe column for the Guardian and hosting TV shows such as Mexican Food Made Simple on Channel 5. 

She was recognised for her contribution to the food industry with an OBE in 2019. 

Writing in the Guardian last year, Ms Miers called on people to eat 'significantly less meat' to help the environment. 

While she is not totally against meat-eaters, Ms Miers wrote that she is in favour of more regenerative farming practices. 

She said: 'I am much more for small-scale, community-driven farming because I believe in the potential of food to be a force for good, for human and environmental health.'

Cows are a big contributor to climate change, with farm animals producing around 14 per cent of carbon emissions from human activity worldwide. 

Ministers are looking to force farmers to give herds additives to reduce gas from digestion in 'compound feeds', which contain seaweed and essential oils. 

The Government's Net Zero Growth Plan, released earlier this month, looked to address concerns from the High Court that existing plans to reach the climate goal before 2050 were not detailed enough. 

The plan said the bovine supplements could be introduced 'at pace' from 2025 - or as 'soon as practically possible' - in efforts to reduce emissions by 20 per cent by 2030, as Britain's commitment to the Global Methane Pledge requires. 

It comes after a report in January found that restaurants are dropping meat from their menus in an effort to cut costs as well as appeal to the growing number of diners interested in plant-based food.

Numbers from Lumina Intelligence, a food and drink market research company, showed a 'notable decline' in the number of dishes containing meat served at restaurant chains in the last year, the Guardian reported.

Last summer, only 20 per cent of dishes served at such eateries contained meat according to the data, down from 24 per cent from last spring.

Katherine Prowse, senior insight manager at Lumina, said the reduction came about in an effort by restaurants to reduce their costs amid inflation, as well as meet customer needs.

'The impact of Veganuary should not be ignored', according to a marketing and insights manager, who says the initiative inspires 'a full conversion to vegan eating' for some, and prompts others to opt for the plant-based option for some meals (pictured: a pub in Eton advertises its Veganuary menu)

Describing the decline as 'notable', she added: 'We're seeing trends around healthier living and around eating less meat, and restaurants are tapping into that. The benefit is they can manage costs at the same time because they're saving on meat and saving on portion sizes.'

According to Lumina's menu tracker, when it comes to major restaurant chains, just 33 per cent of mains contain meat, and just 12 per cent of starters. Meanwhile, around 50 per cent of main course dishes at pubs contain meat.

Katherine Prowse added that while Lumina believes the ceiling for how much of the menu share will be given to plant-based foods has been reached, they are 'also seeing the expansion of vegan-only restaurants or with menus that are completely vegan'.

Speaking about the growing interest in vegan food, Kirsty Matthews, marketing and insights manager at Macphie, told The Caterer: 'Every year the Veganuary campaign prompts a new surge of vegan eaters. 

'For some, it causes a full conversion to vegan eating, and for others it means simply occasionally going for the plant-based option. Either way, the impact of Veganuary should not be ignored.'

The annual initiative has seen exponential growth since its launch in 2014, with some two million people taking part in that time.

Tory ex-health minister attacks 'un-Conservative' Government for failing to tackle £14billion-a-year obesity crisis - as shock graphic shows how fat people can cost NHS twice as much

A Tory former health minister today criticised the Government for failing to tackle Britain's spiralling obesity crisis.

Lord Bethell, who worked in the Department of Health and Social Care during the Covid pandemic, claimed ministers have 'squandered significant taxpayer funds', attacking the 'un-Conservative' approach.

He said policymakers should encourage Brits to live healthier lifestyles 'instead of defending vested interests'.

His comments come on the back of a landmark stud, which today revealed the UK's bulging waistline is stripping billions of pounds from the cash-strapped NHS each year.

Twice as much is spent on obese patients as on those of a healthy weight. 

One million patients, who were a healthy weight with a body mass index (BMI) of 18 to 25, were calculated to cost the NHS an average of £638 each in 2019, the final year of the study. By comparison, severely obese patients with a BMI of 40 and above cost more than double - at £1,375 annually. Meanwhile, the NHS spent £979 a year on obese patients with a BMI of 30 to 35, which increased to £1,178 a year for those with a BMI of 35-40

According to the latest global data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the UK's adult obesity rate lies at 26.2 per cent, while France sits at 17 per cent. South Korea and Japan recorded rates of 5.5 and 4.2 per cent respectively

The findings lay bare the enormous strain of obesity on NHS finances, suggesting the service could save up to £14billion annually if people kept a healthy weight.

Commenting on the study on Twitter, Lord Bethell wrote: 'Squandering significant taxpayer funds and human potential is un-Conservative. 

'Govt should promote #HealthyBritain instead of defending vested interests.'

He added: 'I've seen first-hand the staggering price Britain pays for our obesity problem during the pandemic: packed emergency rooms, overwhelmed ICUs [intensive care units], prolonged lockdowns, lingering post-viral illness (#longcovid) and increased death rates. It's time to take action.'

Lord Bethell, who worked in the Department of Health and Social Care during the Covid pandemic, said ministers have 'squandered significant taxpayer funds', attacking the 'un-Conservative' approach

Lord Bethell added: 'Dear @hmtreasury [The Treasury] and [Chancellor] @jeremyhunt, take a close look at this report. 

HOW TO CALCULATE YOUR BODY MASS INDEX - AND WHAT IT MEANS

Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on your weight in relation to your height. 

Standard Formula:

Metric Formula:

Measurements:

'Is supporting a junk-food cycle worth the cost to taxpayers in welfare, healthcare expenses, lost productivity, and damage to our international reputation for hard work?' 

The Government has delayed a ban on promoting buy-one-get-one-free deals on unhealthy snacks until October, blaming the cost of living crisis.

A ban on television adverts for junk food before 9pm and on paid-for adverts online has also been delayed by 12 months until 2025.

Critics of the government's delay in implementing an obesity strategy today echoed Lord Bethell's comments. 

Tam Fry, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said: 'The figures calculated in this impressive study are, sadly, not the full story. 

'Over the last two decades the NHS has had to spend millions on the infrastructure required to support obesity treatment, from larger ambulances with reinforced chassis to super-sized beds, operating tables, mortuary fridges and stretchers to name but a few. 

'During all their years in power Conservative governments have done next to nothing to tackle the problem.' 

He added: 'The £6.1billion annual cost that the NHS states it spends treating obesity costs is dwarfed by the £58billion believed to be the total cost of obesity and its co-morbidities. 

'A government prediction made in 2007 that half the UK would be obese by 2050 is very likely to be correct. Inaction is inexcusable.'

Costs per patient rise drastically the more people weigh, as they 'collect obesity-related conditions' such as type 2 diabetes, cancer and heart disease, according to research involving nearly 2.5million people, presented at a conference in Dublin this week.

One million patients, who were a healthy weight with a body mass index (BMI) of 18 to 25, were calculated to cost the NHS an average of £638 each in 2019, the final year of the study.

By comparison, severely obese patients with a BMI of 40 and above cost more than double - at £1,375 annually.

Meanwhile, the NHS spent £979 a year on obese patients with a BMI of 30 to 35, which increased to £1,178 a year for those with a BMI of 35-40.

Overall, 400,002 patients were classed as obese, with another one million classed as overweight but not obese, with a BMI of 25 to 30.

Those who were overweight cost on average £756 a year - 19 per cent more than those who were healthy.

Around two thirds of over-16s in England (64 per cent) are overweight, including tens of thousands who are morbidly obese. This is an 11 per cent rise on 1993, when 53 per cent were considered overweight. Experts blame sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy diets. Source: Health Survey for England 2021

Rates of obesity and being overweight have fallen this year after spiking during the Covid pandemic, but are still higher than pre-lockdown 

Latest NHS data shows 26 per cent of adults in England are obese and a further 38 per cent are overweight but not obese.

The report suggests that when at the peak of treatment, 28.1million people with a high BMI could cost the NHS £23.8billion annually, compared to £10.1billion spent on those who are a healthy weight.

Obesity rates have been on the rise for decades, with experts blaming sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy diets.

They are also soaring in children, with a quarter of children in reception now considered overweight, and one in ten obese.

The report also comes in the wake of comments made last month by Henry Dimbleby, a former adviser at the Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs. 

The founder of 'healthy' fast-food chain Leon called for bold action in the war on obesity and urged against a reliance on giving millions of Brits weight-loss and appetite-suppressant drugs such as WeGovy.

Speaking the Institute for Government, he said Britain could not 'drug its way out of the problem'.

Instead, Mr Dimbleby, who was commissioned to conduct an independent review of the food system - the national food strategy - praised the 'very interventionist' approaches to obesity Japan, France and South Korea have taken. 

Fat-fighting policies introduced in Japan include free school lunches for all, while at-risk adults are expected to go to dieting classes. 

Japanese law also requires companies to measure the waists of their employees and send those above a certain size on weight-management courses, Mr Dimbleby told the event. 

Speaking to TalkTV this morning, Steve Miller, the director of Fatnosis - a weight loss hypnosis business said: 'The government need to be more ballsy.'

He added: 'They need to be more like the Japanese. They're dead blunt with it. They're firm.

'It's your issue, you are fat and actually if you're not taking responsibility, you're going to start paying for some of your treatment, not the taxpayer.'

Child-friendly packaging on sugary cereals and yoghurts should be banned, experts say

Breakfast cereals and yogurts containing high amounts of sugar should remove any packaging that appeals to children, a health group says.

Action on Sugar warned the products, which contain up to 4 teaspoons of sugar per serving, are designed to attract the attention of a child and exploit 'pester power'.

It wants firms to remove cartoon characters, animations and vibrant colours from food graded as high or medium for sugar, salt or saturated fat, based on the Department for Health's nutrition guidelines.

Research by the group, based at Queen Mary University of London, compared cereals and yogurts offered by different companies in the UK.

It found 47 per cent of cereals and 65 per cent of yogurts contained a third of the recommended daily maximum sugar intake for a four to six-year-old, excluding the milk.

Health officials advise that 4 to 6-year-olds should consume no more than 19g of sugar each day, equivalent to five teaspoons. However, the Lidl Crownfield Choco Hazelnut Pillows cereal contained 28.5g sugars per 100g, equal to 8.6 grams of sugar or 2 teaspoons per serving. And the NestlÃ© Smarties Vanilla yogurt contained 14.6g of sugars per 100g, equal to 15.6g of sugars or 4 teaspoons sugar per serving

Of these, products by supermarket chains Lidl and Aldi and international brand Nestle had the highest average sugar levels with packaging targeted at children.

By contrast, healthier products tended to be sold in more plain packaging targeted towards adults.

Only nine cereals and six yogurts surveyed were found to be low in sugars and only four cereals were low in both sugars and salt.

Health officials advise that 4 to 6-year-olds should consume no more than 19g of sugar each day, equivalent to five teaspoons.

However, the Lidl Crownfield Choco Hazelnut Pillows cereal contained 28.5g sugars per 100g, equal to 8.6 grams of sugar or 2 teaspoons per serving.

And the NestlÃ© Smarties Vanilla yogurt contained 14.6g of sugars per 100g, equal to 15.6g of sugars or 4 teaspoons sugar per serving.

Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London and chairman of Action on Sugar, said: 'Obesity is estimated to cost the UK £58billion each year, having a huge impact on economic productivity and the NHS.

NestlÃ©, Lidl, and Aldi had the highest sugars on average across their cereals and yogurts targeted to children. NestlÃ©'s Smarties Vanilla yoghurt recorded the highest level of sugar at 15.6g, the equivalent of four teaspoons per serving

'Drastic changes are needed to the food system and that includes responsible marketing of food and drink, especially to children.'

There are restrictions on the advertising of foods high in fat, salt, and sugar during peak TV viewing times for children but there are no specific rules governing the visual appeal and design of packaging which influences children's preferences.

Action on Sugar said this marketing tactic, known as 'pester power', is 'intentionally designed to attract the attention of children and influence their caregivers' purchasing'.

Lidl announced in 2020 that it would remove cartoon characters from all its own-brand cereal packaging in Britain.

Breakfast cereals and yogurts saw significant reductions in sugar levels between 2015 and 2020, at 14.9 per cent and 13.5 per cent respectively.

But the Sugar Reduction Programme announced in the Government's obesity plan in 2016 set a target of 20 per cent in that timeframe.

Dr Kawther Hashem, campaign lead at Action on Sugar, said: 'It's ludicrous that whilst breakfast cereals and yogurts celebrate the largest reductions in sugars during the Sugar Reduction Programme, those same products with child-appealing packaging still have excessive amounts of sugars, unsuitable for regular intake by children.

'Given the soaring numbers of under-18s suffering weight-related health problems and tooth decay being the leading cause of child hospitalisation, now is the time for companies to be forced to remove child-appealing packaging from products that are misleading parents and making our children unhealthy and sick.'

Zoe Davies, nutritionist at Action on Sugar, said: 'There is no reason why products with high or medium levels of salt or sugar should be marketed as ""suitable for children"".

'If we are to protect the health of our future generation, then bold action is required now from both government and companies alike and this must include child-friendly packaging only being placed on healthier products.'

WHAT SHOULD A BALANCED DIET LOOK LIKE? 

Meals should be based on potatoes, bread, rice, pasta or other starchy carbohydrates, ideally wholegrain, according to the NHS

""¢ Eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day. All fresh, frozen, dried and canned fruit and vegetables count

""¢ Base meals on potatoes, bread, rice, pasta or other starchy carbohydrates, ideally wholegrain

""¢ 30 grams of fibre a day: This is the same as eating all of the following: 5 portions of fruit and vegetables, 2 whole-wheat cereal biscuits, 2 thick slices of wholemeal bread and large baked potato with the skin on

""¢ Have some dairy or dairy alternatives (such as soya drinks) choosing lower-fat and lower-sugar options

""¢ Eat some beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other proteins (including 2 portions of fish every week, one of which should be oily)

""¢ Choose unsaturated oils and spreads and consuming in small amounts

""¢ Drink 6-8 cups/glasses of water a day

""¢ Adults should have less than 6g of salt and 20g of saturated fat for women or 30g for men a day

Countryfile viewers went wild over a teenage farmer last night as they praised her for ditching TikTok for chores and working life. 

Katie, 16, from Appleby, revealed on the BBC1 programme how she juggles studying for her GCSEs with working on her family's 250-acre mixed upland farm.

The teenager has a number of jobs to complete every morning, from feeding cows and lambs to helping with any live births. 

Despite the challenging work, she said: 'I do like it, I like the way of life. It's the freedom that comes with it as well. To some people it may seem strange to have this much responsibility, but it is what motivates me and I do very much like it.' 

Many of those watching were amazed by Katie's positive attitude, with one writing: 'What an absolute credit to her family young Katie is.

'Sky is the limit for this young lady. Go Katie!' 

Meanwhile another wrote: 'What an impressive girl, Katie, they're interviewing this week! 

'If only they could bottle her good sense and her confidence and issue it out to other teenagers at school, it would be wonderful.'  

A third added: 'Katie on Countryfile should get her own show.'

A fourth commented: 'Katie is an incredibly impressive young woman. I hope she finds great success in her future career, whatever she chooses to do.'

'Katie's parents should be so proud,' another person wrote. 'Not wasting her time being some **** on TikTok.

'She's farming, contributing, wanting to better herself. Role model right there.' 

Twelve years ago, Katie's parents gave up their jobs as an electrician and an administrator to take up the farm.

Katie was just four years old and the family have been on their farming journey together ever since.

Appearing on the show, the 16-year-old said: 'At that age, it was just like a big adventure really and wanting to learn more about the farm. 

'How we can improve our livestock welfare and everything like that.'

'I've learnt it from what other people have said and watching other farming programs. 



Many of those watching were amazed by Katie's positive attitude, with some calling her 'a credit to her family' 

'I try to keep up with the current information. So many things are changing with farming, so sometimes it's quite hard to know what is currently going on.'

The teenager said she begins her morning chores at the farm at 7am. 

Her first job is to feed all of the nine pet lambs, with the teenager adding: 'In the morning, you're still a bit asleep and you come out here and you do get woken up by the noise.'

Of all the sheep on the farm, Katie is responsible for 30 of the animals, roughly a quarter of them.

If her sheep give birth, she is in charge of the lambs, which she raises and sells independently from the main flock. 

Appearing on the programme, Katie revealed she always viewed life on the farm as 'an adventure' (pictured)  

Each year, she reinvests her profits into more livestock. She bought some donkeys in 2016, and goats and a cow in 2020. 


At 9am, she has breakfast with her parents, saying: 'Before school I do all my morning jobs and then I come in, have breakfast and get ready for school.'

She also watches over the wild creatures who call the place home. 

She said: 'My favourite season is definitely spring. All those lovely, optimistic sounds that we have here. The marking of new life. 

'If you've had a tough winter and it's been hard work, the peacefulness of those sounds, it helps me get away from that busy schedule of revision and every day jobs on the farm.

Meanwhile the teenager spoke about how she juggles her farm work with her GCSES, and confessed she hopes to study at college in the future 

While filming, the reality of farming life is all too evident when she is called to help out with the birth of a lamb which her brother Jack is having difficulty with

She said: 'I love the sounds of all the birds we have here.'

'I guess it would be quite quiet if you didn't have all this wildlife, it definitely makes it feel like home.'

By 11am, she's feeding the goats and cows, which she bought with her own savings.

She said she 'doesn't know what she's doing' but said she is 'constantly learning on the job.'

And while filming, the reality of farming life was all too evident when she is called to help out with the birth of a lamb which her brother Jack is having difficulty with.

She said: 'I've got all my exams in the next couple of weeks. I'm doing okay really, managing my revision really and all the jobs I do on the farm. 

'I've got a timetable in my head to go off. I've got a cut-off point as well when I'll stop doing farm jobs.'

'I'm planning to go and do an agricultural course, I'm sure it'll be worth it.'

Meanwhile her mother Kirsten said she hopes her daughter will one day take on the farm.

She said: 'Katie told me if she didn't have the farm, she could tip into stress.

'I'd like to think Katie would like to take on the farm but I don't want her to feel she has to. 

'A part of me thinks that she can't wait to just think, ""Now I'm old enough, this is what I want to do. I want to stop doing that and just do this"".'

Dairy farmer's daughter wins court battle against her two brothers for share of their £9m fortune after she claimed she was left 'nowt' in her father's 'sexist' will despite years of working for the family business

A dairy farmer's daughter has won £652,000 after suing her brothers for a share of their £9million fortune after she complained of being left with 'nowt' by her father's 'sexist' will despite years of working for the family business. 

Julie Mate, 62, was 'devastated and dumbfounded' when her father Donald died in 1992 and left his share of the farm to his two sons, Andrew and Robert, and his wife, Shirley - who later also gave her share to the boys.

Julie complained that she and her two sisters - who got just £12,000 each - were the victims of old-fashioned sexist tradition, with 'us girls' left next to 'nowt' despite years of graft.

She did not challenge the will, but has now won a £652,000 payout from her brothers' fortune after a judge found it was her work which saw the value of part of the land rocket from £300,000 to £9million, making them both rich.

Julie said she had worked alongside her brothers on the land, sacrificing her social and school life to help out as a child, and dreamed of helping to run the farm as an adult. But she said she was ostracised, with Robert telling her 'you're not coming back' when she left for university, while she says Andrew treated her like 'a silly woman'.

Judge Andrew Sutcliffe KC said the brothers had been 'unjustly enriched' by her years of work in getting the land removed from the green belt so it could be sold to developers to build a 250-home estate and it was right that she should share in the windfall.

The court heard that the siblings' parents, Donald and Shirley now 89, had been partners in a milk bottling and retail business run from Fold Farm in Netherton, near Huddersfield.

In evidence, Julie told the judge that all five brothers and sisters had worked 'long hours' on the farm as children, feeding livestock, bottling milk and helping out with the milk round.

She said she had wanted to have a full role as an adult, but that Robert, now 65, and Andrew, 60, had made it clear she was not wanted there and, as a result, she did not return and become involved in the business after university.

From her childhood, she did not have a good relationship with the boys, she said, pointing to incidents when a 17-year-old Andrew had driven a Land Rover at her in the farmyard and when Robert, then 23, put his hands around her throat and said 'you're not coming back,' meaning she was not to return to the farm after her studies.

'Although Robert and Andrew denied or did not recall these incidents, I accept that they occurred,' said the judge in his ruling on the case.

'I also accept that from at least this time, and probably before then, the relationship between Julie and her brothers was strained, caused in part by the interest which Julie had shown in the farm and the brothers' determination that she should not be involved.'

Julie went on to study animal science at university and worked as an agricultural journalist and a senior executive in dairy companies and farming organisations.

She now lives in North Shropshire with her partner Tom Biggins, where she runs a herd of red deer, farming venison for Waitrose and M&S.

When their father died in 1992, he left his share of the 140-acre farm to his wife Shirley and the sons, with his daughters - Julie, Gillian Robson and Virginia Boothroyd - sharing only £36,000 between them.

The judge said Julie was unhappy with the terms of the will and felt like it gave the daughters only 'token recognition' for their work.

'In her view, it meant the sisters were subsidising their brothers so that they could have a life on the family farm, which was something she was not given the opportunity to pursue,' he continued.

By the beginning of the 2000s, the farm was beginning to struggle and Julie started to look into ways of making money from the land in order to realise some gains in which 'us girls' could also share, Julie claimed.

She said that, from 2007 at the latest and encouraged by her mother, she had started looking into the potential for redevelopment of 40 acres of farmland, known as Netherton Moor.

She deployed a planning consultant and worked on the project between 2008 and late 2015, claiming she relied on promises made to her by her mother that if she secured its allocation for housing, the proceeds would be shared equally in the family.

Fold Farm in Netherton, near Huddersfield, which was at the centre of the family dispute 

After the land was identified as suitable for housing by the local council in 2012, Julie called her brother Andrew to update him about what was going on.

But it resulted in an angry exchange, during which, in response to her saying she had done the work 'on behalf of the girls,' Andrew asked Julie: 'What's it got to do with you?'

'She described it as 'his typical rant,' which she understood to mean ''push off, you silly woman'',' said the judge.

The land was ultimately included in the council's Local Plan in 2015, but Julie soon discovered that - without informing her - her mother and brothers had already agreed a £9m sale to developers Persimmon Homes Ltd to build a 250-house estate.

And the following year, despite knowing she would be due a massive windfall, Shirley executed a deed of trust, handing her beneficial interest in the land to her two sons.

In 2020, Julie launched her High Court bid for a share of the spoils, which her mother Shirley did not contest, but her two brothers fiercely fought through a two-week trial last year.

In his ruling, the judge said Julie and her brothers were 'no longer on speaking terms' but had not been friendly even before the court case and there was clear 'animosity' between them.

'Julie has a strongly held sense of grievance regarding the way in which she feels she has been treated by her brothers since childhood,' said the judge.

He pointed to letters which Julie had written to various members of the family, including one to her sister Virginia in which she spoke of her feelings about her father's will.

She wrote: 'To be extremely blunt, given the value of the farm - when dad died, but particularly now - we three have been extremely badly done to.

'You can call it the outcome of a male-dominated farming tradition, bloody mindedness, or simply male chauvinism - whatever it was, and with no disrespect to dad, it really doesn't wash nowadays.'

Judge Andrew Sutcliffe KC said the brothers had been 'unjustly enriched' by her years of work in getting the land removed from the green belt so it could be sold to developers to build a 250-home estate and it was right that she should share in the windfall

In a 2014 letter to her mother, Julie also wrote of the girls having a 'personal' and 'moral' stake in the farm and deserving to be recognised.

'Because we all had a hand in the success of the farm in its early years - working long hours from a very early age, every day, all year round,' she wrote.

'Working before school and after school, and working all through our teenage years. This forced labour, so to speak, wasn't just the odd bit of lawn mowing, it was hard, manual work, often involving heavy lifting, often for long hours.

'This work wasn't done out of choice, or even paid for. We had no say in the matter. It affected our schoolwork. It affected our social life. It affected our development as individuals.

'It goes without saying that subsequently learning that father was not going to treat all of his five children equally - leaving the farm to only the two boys and only providing the girls with monetary concession of a minor proportion - was yet another heavy and psychological blow.'

Julie sued her mother and two brothers, claiming unsuccessfully that she had been promised an equal share of the proceeds of sale if she managed to have the land removed from the Green Belt.

The judge said there was no documentary evidence to show that such promises were in fact made and the first time Julie even mentioned them was in a letter in 2020.

But she also sued for 'unjust enrichment,' claiming that they had benefited hugely from her work and that she never intended to do it 'for nowt.'

Ruling in her favour on that point, the judge said: 'I accept Julie's evidence that at no time did she tell either of her brothers or Shirley that she would work on this project for nothing, without expectation of any reward.

'On the contrary, from the time when the issue was first raised by Julie with Shirley, Andrew and Robert in 2004, Julie was clear that she saw the possibility of developing part of the farm as a way she and her sisters could benefit.

'When the matter was raised again in earnest by Julie in 2008, her separate discussions with all three of them left them in no doubt that she expected to benefit from the sale proceeds if the land was sold for development.

'Shirley, Andrew and Robert obtained the benefit of Julie's services, at Julie's expense, in circumstances where they had notice of the services, they knew that Julie expected a reward for her services, and they could have rejected the benefit, but did not.

'They were enriched by Julie's services in circumstances which were unjust because they knew she was not providing those services gratuitously and they made no attempt to reward her for them.

'In the circumstances, Andrew and Robert have been enriched by Julie's services and such enrichment was unjust.

'The position of Shirley is less clear owing to the fact that since December 2016 she has not held any beneficial interest in the Netherton Moor land due to the declaration of trust which she signed in favour of Andrew and Robert.

'However, what is clear is that Andrew and Robert freely accepted Julie's services, and their enrichment was unjust.'

The judge awarded Julie a payment of £652,000 from her brothers, representing a 7.5 per cent share of the uplift in value of the land from its original value of £300,000 to the £9m it sold for.

The case returned to court last week to decide who pays the lawyers' bills for the case, but the judge reserved his judgment until a later date.

Murder hornet 'relative' is invading the US: Species native to Asia spotted in America for the first time is a threat to the agriculture industry

A relative of the murder hornet, which terrorized the US in 2021, has been spotted for the first time in the nation, and it could be detrimental to agriculture.

The yellow-legged hornet, native to South Asia, was identified in Georgia, where officials are urging residents to look for the invasive species that could 'potentially threaten' honey production, native species, farms and human lives.

The hornet can be identified by its yellow-tipped legs and dark abdomen, which have yellow bands that widen toward the insect's rear. 

The alert came after a Savannah-based beekeeper discovered the southeast Asian hornet alive on his property Tuesday.

Georgia state agriculture officials and the US Department of Agriculture are on the lookout for a newly arrived species of 'murder hornet' ""” pictured above ""” which they believe could 'potentially threaten' honey production, native species, local farms and even human lives

The all-points bulletin, issued by Georgia's Agriculture Commissioner this Tuesday, followed a tip from one Savannah, Georgia-based beekeeper who first discovered the southeast Asian hornet alive on his property. Georgia's Department of Agriculture wants the pests 'eradicated'

The yellow-legged hornet (Vespa velutina), pictured above, is a cousin of the Asian giant hornet, often described in the press as the 'murder hornet' due to its savage attacks on bee colonies. But reports from Europe suggest the hornet has killed humans and could kill again

Georgia's Agriculture Commissioner described the hornet as an existential threat to 'our state's number one industry ""” agriculture.' But local scientists said it could also pose a threat to humans.

'There are reports in Europe of people having died from encountering this wasp and being stung,' entomologist, Brian T. Forschler of the University of Georgia, told local ABC affiliate WJCL this week. 

But these newly invading murder hornets, he emphasized, 'seem to specialize in feeding on honey bees, which is a concern for that industry.' 

As pollinators, honey bees are crucial to Georgia's $75 billion-per-year agriculture industry, helping farmers grow staples, including watermelons, blueberries and the state's famous Georgia peaches. 

Nationwide, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) calculated in 2018 that bee pollination alone adds approximately $15 billion to US crops' value, alongside the efforts of farmers, farm equipment, fertilizers, and other factors.

'About one-third of the food eaten by Americans comes from crops pollinated by honey bees,' according to the FDA, 'including apples, melons, cranberries, pumpkins, squash, broccoli, and almonds.'

As pollinators, honey bees serve a crucial part of Georgia's $75 billion-per-year agriculture industry, helping farmers grow staples including watermelons, blueberries and the state's famous Georgia peaches

Scientists describe the yellow-legged hornet as a 'social wasp species' capable of forming nests that house, on average, 6,000 worker hornets. Their egg-shaped, paper nests are often found in trees or elsewhere above ground.  

While native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, the invasive yellow-legged hornet into parts of the Middle East and Asia, as well as most of Europe, where it has occasionally taken human lives.

Georgia's Department of Agriculture said that the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), tasked with protecting local animal and plant life from invasive species, assists state officials in their eradication efforts.  

'APHIS is providing technical expertise, technology, and outreach support as well as analyzing the hornet's DNA to determine if it is related to European populations of this species,' the agency said in a press statement.

Academic researchers with the University of Georgia also work with these state and federal agencies in their hunt for murder hornets. 

'Together, we are developing an operational plan to trap, track, and eradicate the yellow-legged hornet in Georgia,' GDA said. 

'APHIS and GDA will set out traps and survey for this pest to determine if additional yellow-legged hornets are in the area.'

Back in 2021, Washington state officials said that while eradicating the first Asian giant hornet nest of the season, the hornets attacked them. The Asian giant hornet is a cousin species to the yellow-legged hornet now menacing Georgia 

Washington State Department of Agriculture managing entomologist Sven-Erik Spichiger said in 2021 that groups of Asian giant hornets were becoming 'more aggressive' than those in 2020

Over the past few years, the yellow-legged hornet's cousin, the original murder hornet, has troubled wildlife and agricultural officials across the US and Canada, with particularly active cases in Washington state.

In 2021, Washington State Department of Agriculture managing entomologist Sven-Erik Spichiger said at a press conference that the murder hornets in the Pacific Northwest were becoming 'more aggressive' than those identified in 2020. 

'A few of us who working tightly in the area were approached by the hornets, and they did attempt to sting us this time,' Spichiger said. 

Bee researchers at the University of California San Diego have experimented with exploiting the Asian giant hornets' pheromones to create traps for the insect, but it is unclear if similar tactics may work on the yellow-legged hornet. 

For now, Georgia state officials are turning to eagle-eyed citizens for help apprehending the killer insect.

'I want to thank the beekeeper who reported his sighting to us and our partners at the University of Georgia and USDA's Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service for working swiftly to confirm its identity,' Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper said. 

The Deputy Administrator of the USDA APHIS quarantine program, Mark Davidson, praised the collaborative effort between state and federal agencies alongside the scientific community but also encouraged Georgians to get involved themselves. 

'The public can also play a critical role by reporting potential sightings of the hornet to help eradicate this pest,' Davidson said.

Here's what the yellow-legged hornet looks like: Workers can be about half the size of a Northern Giant Hornet, typically about 1.5 inches (3.5 cm) in length.

The new murder hornet can be easily mistaken for the Northern Giant Hornet, although its name suggests it differs primarily in its mostly or partially yellow legs. The hornet's body and head colors vary.

The USDA maintains a photo gallery of innocent 'murder hornet' lookalikes that can be accessed by searching www.aphis.usda.gov for 'yellow-legged hornet.'

And the Georgia Department of Agriculture has a form to report potential sightings.

Residents with questions can email  yellow.legged.hornet@agr.georgia.gov.

REVEALED: America's food deserts - the 76 counties in the US that don't have a SINGLE grocery store

There are 76 counties across America that do not have a single grocery store - leaving families without access to affordable or nutritious food.

According to the most recent data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), 34 of these so-called 'food deserts' are in the Midwest and Great Plains.

The data, which is gathered alongside the census, shows that states such as Texas, Kansas, Nebraska and North Dakota contain some of the highest numbers of counties that lack a local store. 

Convenience stores are not included in the data, but it takes into account supermarkets, grocery stores and delicatessen-style establishments.  

These food deserts mainly impact low-income and rural communities. Shuttered stores mean people have little or no access to fresh, healthy produce, forcing them to buy packaged and highly processed foods. 

Texas has the most food desert counties with 11, while Nebraska has nine, Kansas has seven, Georgia has seven and North Dakota has six

The rural county of Loving in Texas does not have a grocery store, making it more difficult for families to access affordable or nutritious food

When it comes to food deserts, there is a clear state divide. Texas has the most food desert counties with 11, while Nebraska has nine, Kansas has seven, Georgia has seven and North Dakota has six.

Alpine county in California, for example, is the only one in the state without a grocery store - and the same goes for Rich county in Utah. 

Every county in Florida has a grocery store - although Glades has just one remaining.

Texas is the second largest state in the country after Alaska, and is largely rural - meaning it is more likely to have areas with poorer access to stores.

The USDA defines low access to healthy food as being 'far from a supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery store.'

The classification varies for different kinds of areas - where 'far' is defined as more than one mile for urban locations and more than 10 miles in rural spots. 

By this measure, there are an estimated 18.8 million people across the country who struggle to get to a grocery store - some 6.1 percent of the population.  

Many of the areas left behind are rural locations with limited transport options - and where retailers fear household incomes would not be able to support a viable food outlet.  

In many rural towns, which might once have been home to thriving businesses, a local grocery store is a thing of the past.

There is a clear state divide when it comes to counties without any grocery stores 

 34 of the so-called 'food deserts' across the country are in the Midwest and Great Plains

Rial Carver, program leader for the Rural Grocery Initiative at Kansas State University, told NPR that farming communities have been losing population for decades, making it harder for businesses to stay afloat. 

'As small towns get smaller, that means fewer sales coming in the door for our grocery store,' Carver said. 

The Rural Grocery Initiative found that between 2008 and 2018, 105 grocery stores closed in rural Kansas - and no new stores have opened in half of those places.

It is in stark contrast to other rural towns which have been inundated with budget stores. 

A small town in eastern Kentucky has an unusual claim to fame: with a population of just 1,424, it has six dollar stores, most of them built in the past few years.

Olive Hill, a quiet hamlet situated on Tygarts Creek in the Appalachian foothills, has two Family Dollar locations and four Dollar General stores in and immediately surrounding the town. 

According to a 2022 study, dollar stores have been the fastest-growing food retailers by share of household expenditure over the past decade, with growth in rural areas more than doubling.

The US dollar store market is dominated by two major companies, Dollar General and Dollar Tree, which also owns Family Dollar.

Together, the chains operate more than 35,000 stores nationwide, which is more than the combined total number of McDonald's and Walmart locations across the US.

But critics fear that the convenience and affordability of food at dollar stores is offset by health concerns about their food offerings, which skew toward high-calorie, ultra-processed packaged foods.

The growth of dollar stores in recent years has been boosted by historic inflation and the subsequent shifts in consumer spending

Many smaller locations are also collapsing under the pressure from billion-dollar chains such as Walmart and Amazon. 

Kroger and Albertsons, two of the country's largest supermarkets, are on the precipice of a highly-contested merger.

The possible formation of this mega chain has angered both food security advocates and grocery union representatives. 

'These independent, small town stores don't have as much buying power as some of the larger chains that you'll find in urban areas,' Carver told NPR.  

Lack of access to a local store only exacerbates increasing concerns around food insecurity across the country. 

A quarter of US adults are struggling to afford a square meal, according to a study released in March. 

As unrelenting inflation and the end of pandemic benefits squeezes millions of household budgets, increasing numbers of households are being forced to turn to food banks and credit cards in order to make ends meet. 

18.8 million people struggle to get to a grocery store - some 6.1 percent of the population

The largest US grocery chain, Kroger, is in talks to merge with its biggest rival Albertsons in a combination that would create a supermarket titan

A March study showed that a quarter of US adults are struggling to afford a square meal

A survey by the Urban Institute found that 24.6 percent of respondents were food insecure at the end of 2022, meaning they could not always put enough food on the table, compared to only 20 percent at the end of 2021.

Yet some communities, which have been left stranded by bigger companies, are battling back against closing stores. 

The Circle C Market is run by the Cody-Kilgore school district in Cody, Nebraska - a town with a population of just 167.  

Teacher and store manager Liz Ravenscroft told NPR: 'We are vital to the community. The next closest grocery store is 40 miles to the east, and the other closest grocery store is an hour to the west.'

The store got started in 2008 with the help of several national organizations and a grant from the USDA, which offers help for communities to scale up local and regional food systems and strengthen their economies.

Would YOU try it? Study confirms cabbages grown in compost made from human POO are safe to eat

In the 2015 blockbuster film The Martian, Matt Damon manages to survive on Mars after using his own faeces as fertiliser to grow potatoes.

Such a thing may seem far-fetched - or even unnecessary here on Earth - but a new study has found that cabbages grown in compost made from human poo are safe to eat.

The discovery could be a game-changer, because although it may seem like existing fertilisers are just fine, to tackle the climate crisis, biodiversity loss and pollution, humanity will need to move to a more recyclable existence.

This is why scientists are questioning the merit of having the nutrient-rich fertiliser that is human drifting into our oceans and landfills, when it could easily be put back into soils.

Breakthrough: A new study has found that cabbages grown in compost made from human poo are safe to eat. It was carried out by experts at the University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart. It follows past research by Federation University Australia which found that biosolids produced from human wastewater can increase wheat yields between 55 and 65 per cent (pictured)

Composting rather than flushing it would bring down water use, while adding it to land also reduces the need for synthetic fertilisers, which can wash away from fields into rivers and lakes and requires fossil fuels to make. 

One way of making it, known as the Haber-Bosch process, leads to around 1.8 per cent of global CO2 emissions. 

So human fertiliser certainly has its benefits, as long as there is no risk that harmful microbes or traces from pharmaceuticals could end up in crops, which the University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart, has now confirmed is not the case.

HOW HUMAN WASTE IS A NUTRIENT-RICH FERTILISER

Most nutrients needed for plant growth occur in human urine and faeces, with nitrogen and potassium in urine - along with trace amounts of metals such as boron, zinc, and iron - and phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and organic carbon in poo.

So human fertiliser certainly has its benefits, as long as there is no risk that harmful microbes or traces from pharmaceuticals could end up in crops, which has now been confirmed is not the case according to research by the University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart.  

Study author Franziska HÃ¤fner said: 'Here we show that products derived from recycling human urine and faeces are viable and safe nitrogen fertilisers for cabbage cultivation. 

'The fertilisers from nitrified human urine gave similar yields as a conventional fertiliser product, and did not show any risk regarding transmission of pathogens or pharmaceuticals.

'The combined application of nitrified urine fertilisers and faecal compost led to slightly lower crop yields, but may increase soil carbon content in the long term, promoting climate-resilient food production.'

Most nutrients needed for plant growth occur in human urine and faeces, with nitrogen and potassium in urine - along with trace amounts of metals such as boron, zinc, and iron - and phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and organic carbon in poo. 

For their study, PhD student HÃ¤fner and her colleagues compared a crop yield of white cabbage grown between June and October 2019 at the Leibniz Institute of Vegetable and Ornamental Crops.

The soil was enriched with four recycled fertilisers, applied gradually over the growing season, with commercially available organic vinasse used as the benchmark to compare the human urine and faeces to.

Also tested were two so-called 'nitrified urine fertilisers' (NUFs), modern products synthetised from human urine that has been collected separately from faeces, in which nitrogen-bearing compounds are converted by microbes into valuable ammonium and nitrate. 

Finally, faecal compost recycled from dry toilets was used, both with and without NUFs mixed in.

The marketable yield, defined as the parts of the cabbages that can be sold, ranged from 35 to 72 metric tons per hectare. 

It was highest for plots fertilised by the NUFs and vinasse, and lowest for those fertilised by faecal compost alone. 

Somewhere in the middle was the faecal compost combined with NUFs.

The researchers say their results suggest that soils fertilised with NUFs are as productive as those supplied with the widely-used commercial vinasse.

In the study they also screened for the presence of 310 chemicals in the faecal compost, from pharmaceuticals to rubber additives, flame retardants, UV filters, corrosion inhibitors, and insect repellants. 

Just 6.5 per cent of these were present above the limit of detection in the compost, albeit at low concentrations, including 11 pharmaceuticals. 

Among the latter, only the painkiller ibuprofen and the anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug carbamazepine were detectable in the edible parts of the cabbages, at low concentrations. 

It means that that more than half a million cabbage heads would need to be eaten to accumulate a dose equivalent to one carbamazepine pill, the researchers said.

'In general, the risk for human health of pharmaceutical compounds entering the food system by means of faecal compost use, seems low,' they concluded in their study. 

Lead author Dr Ariane Krause, a scientist at the Leibniz Institute of Vegetable and Ornamental Crops in GroÃŸbeeren in Germany, said: 'Our study results demonstrate that nitrified urine fertilisers such as Aurin and CROP have a huge potential as fertiliser in agriculture. They argue for a greater use of these recycled products in the future.'

She added: 'If correctly prepared and quality-controlled, up to 25 per cent of conventional synthetic mineral fertilisers in Germany could be replaced by recycling fertilisers from human urine and faeces. 

'Combined with an agricultural transition involving the reduction of livestock farming and plant cultivation for fodder, even less synthetic fertiliser would be necessary, resulting for example in lower consumption of fossil natural gas.'

The research has been published in the journal Frontiers. 

HOW DOES EATING MEAT AND DAIRY PRODUCTS HURT THE ENVIRONMENT? 



Eating meat, eggs and dairy products hurts the environment in a number of different ways.

Cows, pigs and other farm animals release huge amounts of methane into the atmosphere. While there is less methane in the atmosphere than other greenhouse gases, it is around 25 times more effective than carbon dioxide at trapping heat.

Raising livestock also means converting forests into agricultural land, meaning CO2-absorbing trees are being cut down, further adding to climate change. More trees are cut down to convert land for crop growing, as around a third of all grain produced in the world is used to feed animals raised for human consumption. 

Factory farms and crop growing also requires massive amounts of water, with 542 litres of water being used to produce just a single chicken breast.

As well as this, the nitrogen-based fertiliser used on crops adds to nitrous oxide emissions. Nitrous oxide is around 300 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere. These fertilisers can also end up in rivers, further adding to pollution.

Overall, studies have shown that going vegetarian can reduce your carbon emissions from food by half. Going vegan can reduce this further still.

Born and raised in the farming business, Colby Marshall thought he had seen it all. But what he discovered stashed in a timbered ravine at the Silvies Valley Ranch in deep-rural Oregon absolutely horrified him.

In 2019, Marshall, the property's then-vice president of operations, was working outside the small farming community of Burns, more than 180 miles west of Boise.

He had received a disturbing call about a Hereford bull found dead at the bottom of a steep gorge. But when he arrived, it wasn't the death that shocked him. After all, there's nothing strange about cattle dying in the wild.

Rather, it was the state of the carcass that sent a chill down his spine.

The reproductive organs and tongue were gone, seemingly removed by an extremely sharp blade, leaving none of the marks of a natural predator.

'It was fascinating and scary all at the same time,' Marshall told DailyMail.com. 'There were no signs of injury or sickness. The bull was just lying there. It was the weirdest damn thing.'

Inexplicably, there was no blood on the wounds or on the ground.

There were no scavengers to take advantage of the easy feast. It was as clinical as an operating room and as ominous as a horror movie.

What's more, the vegetation around the bull's remains also appeared untouched with no visible tracks nearby.

'It was as if these animals had just walked along, fallen over, and then had these items cut off of them,' Marshall remembered.

And then things got weirder still. As he was inspecting the animal, Marshall got a call about a second deceased bull found just a few hundred yards away. The next day, he found more, spread out across the 140,000-acre ranch.

In total, five animals were butchered - all with the same surgical precision.

Marshall called the police. Before long, three federal agencies were investigating the case. The ranch even offered a $25,000 reward, but no credible tips ever emerged.

No suspects were ever identified.

If this case was the only one of its kind that would be terrifying enough. But it's not.

There's a long and unnerving history of mysterious, unsolved cattle killings distinguished by the extraction of soft-tissue organs, likes udders, eyes, ears, sex organs and tongues dating to the 1800s in the United States, and even further back in history around the world.

Now, these strange killings are back in the headlines, after the discovery of a rash of cattle mutilations in east-central Texas.

And as authorities find themselves grasping aimlessly for answers, DailyMail.com has searched for explanations, and uncovered theories ranging from the ordinary to the occult - and even the extraterrestrial.

ANIMAL MASSACRES: THE 'GREATEST UNSOLVED CRIME SPREE IN HISTORY'

There have been sporadic reports of livestock mutilations involving sheep, cows and horses dating back centuries.

But one of the first known incidents occurred in the early 1890s, when panic ensued near Columbus, Ohio, after ten cows were found 'cut to pieces alive and mutilated in every conceivable manner' according to research by University of Pennsylvania.

Those fears were quashed when a man was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he was allegedly caught with dismembered cow parts and confessed.

But that wasn't the end of Ohio's cow killings: In 1966, a local dairy farmer claimed several of her cows had been 'expertly butchered in part and the bodies were bloodless.' That same year, farmers in Pennsylvania reported 'inexplicable deaths in which cattle carcasses were left drained of blood with parts of their hides removed.'

None of these cases were ever solved. But it was a more recent spike of cases in the U.S. during the 1970s that arguably received the most attention.

In 1975 alone, thousands of cattle mutilations were reported just in the state of Colorado.

In 2013, rancher Lyn Mitchell of Henry County, Missouri concluded that she could not rule out aliens after she lost several animals over a span of two years

Bloodless cattle killings were also reported in 23 states, including Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, Texas, Oklahoma, Montana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and California.

The Denver Post reported at the time that panic among farmers was so intense, that the U.S. Bureau of Land Management was forced to cancel aerial land surveys, because spooked ranchers were shooting at helicopters that they believed could be carrying the serial cattle killers.

By the end of the decade, more than 10,000 cases of cattle mutilation had been recorded, mostly at small-scale ranchers in the West and Midwest. The rash of incidents and millions of dollars in livestock losses were so alarming that the FBI launched an investigation in 1979.

By 1980, the agency, citing veterinarians and other animal experts, had concluded that common predators, such as coyotes, were to blame. But that explanation was not enough for many farmers, who argued that the carcasses showed no signs of typical wildlife attacks.

'I've been around cattle all my life and I can sure tell whether it's been done by a coyote or a sharp instrument,' the Sheriff of Colorado's Elbert County George A. Yarnell told The New York Times at the time.

And sure enough, the official government explanation for the mutilation phenomenon has not satisfied those searching for definitive answers.

Indeed, Chris O'Brien, author of 'Stalking the Herd: Unraveling the Cattle Mutilation Mystery,' says the animal massacres are 'the greatest unsolved crime spree in history.'

'WE'VE GOT A UFO SITUATION'""¦ 'A MASSIVE CONSPIRACY' OR IS IT CULTS?

Following the wave of mutilations in the U.S. and Canada in the 1970s, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police claimed to have circumstantial evidence that religious cults killed the cattle as part of a ritual.

Meanwhile, the Iowa Department of Criminal Investigations determined Satanists were to blame. Their report, however, did not explain how the slaughters occurred without leaving any trace of blood or tracks.

By 1980, the agency, citing veterinarians and other animal experts, had concluded that common predators, such as coyotes, were to blame. But that explanation was not enough for many farmers, who argued that the carcasses showed no signs of typical wildlife attacks.

In both cases, law enforcement findings were vague and did not name any suspects or result in arrests.

Joseph Laycock, associate professor of religious studies at Texas State University, told DailyMail.com that it's unlikely Satanists are to blame because the vast majority don't practice animal sacrifice and most of them actually condemn the practice.

'There is always the possibility of teenage delinquents harming animals in the name of Satan. But I don't think that's what's happening in this case. Teenagers would probably have left tracks or other obvious evidence,' he said.

Yet various religious groups in the U.S. do practice animal sacrifice, even though no specific group has ever been linked to any of these cattle mutilation cases.

Santeria, an Afro-Cuban folk religion with some elements of Catholicism, is popular in the Caribbean as well as in places like Miami and New Orleans, and its believers are known to sacrifice goats and chickens. However, they usually just buy the animals, Laycock explained.

'There may be certain forms of folk magic that call for things like cow tongues,' he added. 'But cow tongues can be purchased very cheaply.'

The lack of concrete answers throughout the years has given way to theories involving aliens and even the federal government.

'Either we've got a UFO situation, or we've got a massive, massive conspiracy which is enormously well funded,' former North Montana senator Harrison Schmidt said in 1975.

Filmmaker and author Linda Moulton Howe, who won an Emmy with her 1980 documentary 'A Strange Harvest,' which examined over 1,000 animal mutilation cases, concluded extraterrestrials were likely to blame.

One of the cases she looked at was the infamous 1967 death of a horse in Alamosa, Colorado, found partially skinned and with its brain, lungs, heart, and thyroid cleanly cut out.

After the animal was discovered, local superior court judge Charles Bennett claimed he saw three orange rings in the sky flying in a triangular formation at fast speeds within 24 hours of the horse's death. And two sheriff's deputies claimed they were followed around by a floating orange globe.

Many were convinced by the space invader hypothesis, with tabloids featuring headlines like, 'Flying saucers killed my horse!'

In 2013, rancher Lyn Mitchell of Henry County, Missouri concluded that she could not rule out aliens after she lost several animals over a span of two years.

'We couldn't see any signs of trauma, and it doesn't appear that there was any type of wild animal, such coyotes, that were involved,' Robert Hills, Henry County Sheriff's Chief Deputy told reporters at the time.

'Something happened to these cows and it's not something that you see every day""¦ so something else is going on,' Mitchell concluded.

TEXAS POLICE PUZZLED BY CASES OF DEAD, MUTILATED COWS

Last week, the Madison County, Texas sheriff's offices said they were investigating the case of a cow found dead with her tongue removed.

Authorities said the 6-year-old longhorn-cross cow was discovered lying on its side with a 'straight, clean cut, with apparent precision' removing the hide around the exposed side of its mouth.

'It was noted there were no signs of struggle and the grass around the cow was undisturbed. No footprints or tire tracks were noted in the area,' the Madison County sheriff's office posted on Facebook.

Five other cows in nearby Robertson and Brazos counties - about an hour's drive north of Houston - were also partially skinned, according to officials there.

'One side of the [cow's] face was cut away,' Robertson County sheriff Gerald Yezak told DailyMail.com. 'I mean completely removed from the muzzle to just below the eye, towards the base of the ear, and then down along the jawbone, back to the muzzle.'

Two of them, however, also had circular cuts 'made with the same precision' to remove the anus and external genitalia.

In 1975 alone, thousands of cattle mutilations were reported just in the state of Colorado.

Madison County officials have not responded to DailyMail.com requests for additional information and haven't posted any additional updates about the case to their Facebook page.

Colby Marshall, the former Oregon rancher, horrified by the precision butchering of animals in 2019, was not shocked by the lack of information. But after years of thinking about the mystery himself, he has developed his own theory.

Marshall suspects that whoever is killing these animals first injects them with a toxin to immobilize them and then bleeds them to death.

'I think they pull the tongue out and stick gauge needles in the bottom of the tongue where the arteries are,' he told DailyMail.com. 'Then from there, they can cut away the organs or the skin or the muscle tissue or whatever it is.'

'I think it's some group of people that are harvesting these organs,' he concluded. 'That reason could be medical or spiritual. The organs could be thought to be an aphrodisiac.'

As of now, Marshall's theory ranks among the many that have come before - some plausible, other outrageous, yet none of them confirmed or outright rejected.

The Texas cattle mutilations are just latest the latest in a long history of these vile acts and, unfortunately, unlikely to be the last until authorities determine who or what is behind them.

Police are called to allotment stand-off as furious villagers block access to field amid plans to divide it up into hundreds of plots

Angry villagers have blockaded access to a field that is set to become the home of up to 700 allotments - prompting police to visit the scene.

Locals from Abbots Leigh, immediately on the other side of the Clifton Suspension Bridge from Bristol, are up in arms over plans by a developer to build hundreds of plots, along with an 80-capacity car park, beside Leigh Woods.

Roots Allotments wants to divide up the field and has controversially tried to use a certificate of lawfulness to get the green light for the works instead of planning permission - which would give North Somerset Council less say over the proposals.

Workers appeared on the land today accompanied by private security guards to install fences around what could become the site of the community garden - followed by angry residents, who blocked roads to stop them getting in or out.

Police were then sent out after receiving calls regarding people 'blocking access to private land', with two cars arriving at the scene to talk to workers and protesters.

Police were called to Leigh Woods at Abbots Leigh, just outside Bristol, after residents turned up to protest what they said were unauthorised works

Workers and security staff from Roots Allotments turned up on site early on Tuesday to put in fencing around a site that could host up to 700 plots

Local residents could be seen remonstrating with security staff as they began putting fencing up at the site of the potential Roots Allotments site

William Gay, co-founder of Roots Allotments, said the fence works were allowed as part of a 'general permitted development order' - despite the company having no permission to develop the site on a wider basis.

He told Bristol Live: 'A new boundary fence is being installed on the land. This is permitted development through part 2, class A of the General Permitted Development Order. No other works are currently planned to take place on this field.'

North Somerset Council said it was aware of the workers on the site - adding that it was sending officers to assess whether the work was lawful.

The authority said: 'Officers from our planning enforcement team will visit the site to inspect the work and will assess whether a breach of planning control has taken place.'

It's the latest chapter in a saga has dragged on for the last 18 months after Roots - which already operates in Dudley, Croydon, Bath and Wolverhampton under a subscription model - announced its plans to come to Bristol in April last year.

Roots is a private venture that offers allotments on a subscription model, with prices ranging from £9.99 to £49.99 per month depending on the size of plot. Subscriptions come with access to tools, seeds and extra support.

Last November it announced Abbots Leigh as its preferred site for Bristol - prompting pushback from locals, who said the 700-plot development was too big for the village, which has a population of just 799, according to the 2011 census.

But in April, Roots - whose slogan is 'good vibes only' - began working on the site without warning, prompting the first interventions by locals and calls to police.

Dragons' Den star Deborah Meaden - a committed environmentalist - even got involved to question Roots' choice of a 'biodiversity rich meadow' for its allotment site.

One day later, the council ordered them to stop working on the site while it considered Roots' application for the 'certificate of lawfulness' - a means of confirming that a plot of land or a building is already designated for a certain use.

Roots sought to get the green light via the certificate as an alternative to planning permission - but it would give the council less say in how the land is used. 

Councillors voted down the application at the end of the summer and told Roots to apply for full planning permission instead so they could consider the impact of the 80-capacity car park on local traffic.

After the bid was refused, Roots wrote in an open letter to the objectors: 'Congratulations for stopping (for now) 600 people having access to an outdoor space where they could grow their own food, connect with other liked minded (sic) individuals and ultimately improve their mental and physical health.

'It is with deep dismay that we witness so much fake news and fact spinning about our organisation when there are so many positive ripple effects that can happen when a group of humans get together over the common ground of growing and nature.'

A Land Rover that is said to belong to a local resident is parked in front of an access gate leading onto the field, blocking workers from getting in or out

Staff arrived in vans towing trailers carrying the fences - despite the fact North Somerset Council has not issued a ruling on whether the allotments can go ahead

Roots Allotments' approach to the project has been challenged by locals and even Dragons' Den star Deborah Meaden, who questioned its use of 'biodiversity rich meadows' for plots

The company has since submitted a certificate of lawfulness application to create the allotments without the car park, for which a decision is due imminently.

But Abbots Leigh Parish Council has objected to the latest bid, writing: 'The vast majority of the users of the site will be travelling from Bristol and will inevitably be coming by car. 

'These allotments are not being developed for the benefit of the residents of Abbots Leigh or the immediate local community.'

Residents took to social media to express their anger with the firm for attempting to 'ride roughshod' over planning laws.

One wrote: 'Is this what ""good vibes"" look like?' while another said: 'Why can't you just abide by the council's decision and proceed through the proper channels?'  

An Avon and Somerset Police spokesperson told MailOnline with regards to Tuesday's protest: 'We have received multiple calls this morning (Tuesday 17 October) relating to a number of people blocking access on private land in Abbots Leigh.

'Officers attended at approximately 8.35am and no criminal offences were identified. The informant was told this was a civil matter.

'Words of advice were given to people at the scene before officers resumed patrols shortly before 9am.'

Roots says it is striving to address a nationwide shortage of allotments amid significant demand for plots from would-be gardeners.

A recent study conducted by Greenpeace UK found that almost 175,000 people were on waiting lists for local authority plots.

The group's Daniela Montalto said: 'The Government must support councils to act as well as take seriously its own role in creating systemic and lasting change to the food system.'

Clarkson's Farm star Kaleb Cooper has said he 'pays himself 50p an hour' as he highlighted difficulties within farming on Friday. 

The farmer, 24, who rose to fame on the TV show with Jeremy Clarkson, has since set out on his own venture and purchased eight calves. 

Speaking in a recent interview, he explained the costs of feeding the animals and that he must take a low wage in order to eventually make a profit on them.  

Kaleb told the Perfomance People podcast: 'When I'm working for myself, when I'm feeding my calves, I bought eight calves, it's a little bit of a new business idea that I'm doing.

'And then you feed them on milk - which costs me about £200 a calf - and then selling them at nine months, trying to get a profit, trying to see if it will work you know.'

Working hard: Clarkson's Farm star Kaleb Cooper has said he 'pays himself 50p an hour' as he highlighted difficulties within farming on Friday

He added: 'But, I worked out the other day how much my hourly rate is. I pay myself 50p an hour so then I can make money. But if I put myself at £10 an hour I don't make money, I lose money on the calves.'

Kaleb stars as one half of the unlikely double act that's been a big part of the reason Clarkson's Farm has been such a hit on Amazon Prime Video. 

The show which follows Jeremy's attempts to manage his own 1,000-acre plot after his previous farmer retired, recently broke viewing records. 

The season 2 premiere of the farming show was watched by 4.3M viewers according to Barb, the official audience research group.

The figures made it Amazon's highest rated show since the company began reporting viewing figures in November 2021, beating smash hit The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, which launched on the platform last year with 3.2M viewers.

CLARKSON'S FARM SERIES TWO: The Reviews  

THE GUARDIAN  

'Infectiously funny'

Rating:

'It would be too much to say Jeremy Clarkson is complex, or an enigma. He does not contain multitudes. But he does have the disarming ability to present different versions of himself. At one end of the Clarkson spectrum is the Right-wing bully columnist, at the other is the presenter of Clarkson's Farm, a perfectly agreeable celebrity-out-of-their-depth reality show. It's something the man's many, not-incorrect detractors might not have thought him capable of: harmless fun'

INDEPENDENT 

'Jeremy is a terrifically articulate and charismatic advocate for rural issues'

Rating:

'Those with a low Clarkson-tolerance will struggle with Clarkson's Farm. It is filled with Clarksonisms and blokey pomposity... But what Clarkson understands - has always understood, from the early days of Top Gear - is that there is a sweet spot of confected reality, somewhere between Keeping Up with the Kardashians and the News at Ten' 

STUFF 

 'The UK's favourite acerbic antediluvians still makes addictive television'

 'Clarkson's Farm continues to delight, showcasing a softer side to the now 62-year-old, while still proving that he is just as irascible, irrepressible and irresponsible as ever... Throw in some adroitly and humorously chosen classic soundtrack cuts (featuring everyone from The Who to Simon and Garfunkel) and, love him or hate him, you can't help but be captivated by Clarkson's attempts to transform his farm into something that's both profitable and sustainable'

The photographs form a poignant slideshow of an idyllic rural childhood. There's Leonard Eadon curled up as a newborn, sleeping on the chest of his beaming father Andy.

There's Leonard ""” Len to those he knew ""” on a tractor for the first time as a two-year-old. Surfing in Cornwall, playing the drums, sitting next to his beloved granny ""” the pictures document a life brimming with love and everyday happiness.

But tragically 22-year-old Leonard, a popular young farmer, lost his life to suicide last year. The pictures are shared on the website his parents Andy, 61, and Lynda, 63, constructed in his memory.

Since Leonard died, the couple, farmers themselves near Napton-on-the-Hill in Warwickshire, have thrown themselves into campaigning about mental health.

'We only had one child,' says Andy. 'Unfortunately we lost him. All our efforts went into leaving a legacy for him through the farm. Now, the only legacy we can leave for our son is making a difference regarding mental health.

Last year 22-year-old Leonard Eadon (right), a popular young farmer, lost his life to suicide

Since Leonard died, his parents, Andy, 61, and Lynda, 63, pictured, who are farmers themselves near Napton-on-the-Hill in Warwickshire, have thrown themselves into campaigning about mental health

'There isn't a minute of the day that we aren't thinking about him.'

From the beginning, Leonard adored country life. 'He got involved pretty much since he fell out of the pram,' says Andy. As he grew up, Leonard developed a pragmatic, can-do outlook, fixing vehicles, welding and dealing with livestock.

'We never put any pressure on him,' says Lynda. 'It wasn't a foregone conclusion, but Leonard loved the farm. It was what he wanted to do.'

With this in mind, Leonard attended Harper Adams University, a specialist provider of higher education for the agricultural and rural sector.

'He was a very bright lad,' adds Lynda. 'But he was a typical boy ""” he did exactly the amount of work he needed to.'

Leonard secured a 2:1 in his degree in rural enterprise and land management, and his parents valued having their adult son making decisions by their side.

'Just before we lost him I was enjoying our scenario so much,' says Andy. 'Leonard was bringing a new outlook and dynamism to the farm.'

He pauses. 'I haven't just lost a son, I've lost my best friend. We bounced ideas off each other all day long.'

'He was our life,' adds Lynda, overwhelmed by tears as she speaks. 'The absolute apple of our eye. If he wasn't here, we would talk on the phone every day.'

During the early hours of New Year's Day 2022, Andy and Lynda were in bed but with half an ear listening for Leonard's return.

'I saw his headlights as he pulled in, so I leaned out of our bedroom window and wished him a happy New Year,' says Andy.

It was four in the morning but Leonard went upstairs for a quick chat. 'He seemed on top form,' continues Andy. 'He'd had a cracking evening.'

Lynda says: 'He was texting the girl he'd been out with to make sure she got home safely when he got a call from some friends asking for a lift. I asked him if he was sure but he went back out to help.'

Alongside farming, Andy and Lynda have run an ultrasound scanning business for more than 30 years, looking for pregnancies in other farmers' sheep.

They went out scanning early on New Year's Day, working miles away from their farm ""” but the police rang them mid-morning and asked them to go home.

When they got back, they were told Leonard had taken his life. It was completely out of the blue. 'He didn't have a history of mental health issues,' says Lynda. 'He was doing what he wanted to do. He had the whole world in front of him.'

'We only had one child,' says Andy (Left) . 'Unfortunately we lost him. All our efforts went into leaving a legacy for him through the farm. Now, the only legacy we can leave for our son is making a difference regarding mental health'

Leonard was well respected within the close-knit farming community and, by all accounts, notably generous and gregarious.

'He was larger than life,' says Lynda. 'He loved playing his drums. He always had a big, golden smile. He was very well liked, with lots of friends.'

Andy picks up at the memory of his son, smiling sadly through his tears. 'He had a wicked sense of humour, even as a child,' he says.

'At nursery school a teacher brought a snowman inside on a tray. The following day it had melted and she asked the class what they thought had happened to the snowman. As quick as lightning, Leonard at the back of the class said, 'Heart attack'.

'As he grew up he was there for everybody else,' adds Andy. 'The students at Harper Adams ""” especially the girls ""” said if there was a problem, you went to Leonard. That's what shocked the community. Nobody expected he could do something like this.

'When he wasn't socialising, he was on YouTube finding out information. Just before we lost him, I needed a new clutch in my vehicle and he said, 'Don't pay for that, Dad, I'll do it'. He was a very talented mechanic.'

Although Leonard didn't outwardly express any concerns, tragically his death reflects the fact that mental health is one of the countryside's biggest hidden problems.

Farming is an uncertain industry and some studies have found that farmers are at higher risk than most people of mental ill health and suicide. 'The biggest problem is too much time working on your own,' says Andy. 'It gives you too much time to think.'

A campaign by the Farm Safety Foundation is calling for more action to support the mental health of those joining the industry.

Research it conducted, involving 450 farmers aged under 40 across the UK, found that 94 per cent saw poor mental health as one of the biggest problems facing the industry today.

This is compared with 84 per cent three years ago, according to Stephanie Berkeley, a mental health first aider at the charity and author of The Little Book Of Minding Your Head, a guide to understanding mental health.

'Levels of mental health in young farmers have been deteriorating year-on-year. Farmers are very good at looking after their land, livestock and machinery . . . they're not great at looking after themselves. Urgent action is needed to support their mental health,' she adds.

Andy says: 'If I do nothing else with my life, I want to see these numbers come down. If we don't change it there will be more families lost and more parents like us struggling.'

This is a problem across age groups. Calls to rural support help-lines have risen or become more complex over the past three years, explains Stephanie Berkeley.

In March last year, the Samaritans' Real People, Real Stories campaign found that men in rural areas were less likely than those in urban areas to seek support if they were struggling.

Paul McDonald, executive director of external affairs at Samaritans, said: 'Mental health challenges and suicide are complex, going beyond where you live or your profession, but these can be factors.'

There are 'several unique stressors' in farming, all of them out of farmers' control, says Stephanie Berkeley, 'such as international trade agreements and the spiralling costs of fertilisers and fuel. And, of course, they are even more vulnerable than many of us to issues caused by Covid and the war in Ukraine.'

Young farmers may be especially vulnerable now, she points out, because they have lived through the pandemic, which was disproportionately hard on young people, and the challenging aspects of the job might feel even more difficult than usual.

It's not just within farming that men are feeling the strain. The statistics of male suicide are devastating and little has changed since the mid-1990s. In 2021, 74 per cent of all suicides in England and Wales were men ""” 4,129 sons, brothers, boyfriends, husbands and fathers.

There had been a steady overall reduction in suicides in the UK until 2018, when there was a significant rise in the rate ""” the first rise since 2013. The Office for National Statistics reported that this was driven largely by an increase in male suicide.

According to Stephen Buckley, head of information at Mind, among the factors that could contribute to poorer mental health and higher suicide rates in men are 'unhelpful and inaccurate societal assumptions about gender and mental health [that] can prevent men from showing their emotions, talking about their feelings or asking for help ""” meaning that problems could go undetected and get worse'.

Joy Hibbins, founder of the charity Suicide Crisis, adds that, for young men in particular, there is additional pressure to achieve an 'ideal of manhood', exacerbated by images on social media.

'They feel under pressure to have achieved things by a certain age, be like their peers and even look a particular way,' she says.

'As part of this, they feel a pressure to appear 'strong' ""” but actually what we really want is for men to be able to feel vulnerable and seek help.'

One problem, suggests Stephen Buckley, is that 'many men feel like support services aren't for them, or that seeking help might be seen as a sign of weakness. They may also just be unaware of how they can access help.'

Joy Hibbins's experience is that 'men do seek help, but they may need a particular type tailored to their specific needs'.

She adds: 'Taking the first step can feel very hard ""” many men said they wouldn't have felt able to walk into a drop-in crisis centre or A&E, or talk to a doctor.

'We've noticed that many men who contact us send a text or email at first. It's easier to take that first step in writing. Then, after sending a few more texts or emails and reading our replies, they feel able to come in and see us at our centre in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.'

Dr John Barry, a chartered psychologist, researcher and founder of The Centre for Male Psychology, an independent body promoting research into men's mental health, says in most countries, men are between two and four times more likely to die by suicide than women.

'The typical explanation given is that this is down to traditional masculinity ""” men hold back from talking about their problems because they don't want to appear weak,' says Dr John Barry, who is also an honorary lecturer in psychology at the Faculty of Brain Sciences at University College London.

'But these attributes characteristically attributed to men and boys don't really explain the problem and indeed, some evidence suggests they can be good for mental health.'

Andy and Lynda's tireless campaigning has raised funds for three charities ""” the Farm Safety Foundation, The Farming Community Network and Papyrus, the national charity for the prevention of young suicides

Last year, Dr John Barry conducted a survey of 2,000 men in Germany and 2,000 men in the UK, looking at how their view of masculinity related to their mental wellbeing.

His findings, to be published shortly, showed that men who think masculinity makes them behave badly tend to have worse mental wellbeing than those who see it as making them behave in a responsible way.

In terms of treatment, like other experts, Dr John Barry believes men need a different approach.

'Although men die by suicide more than women, they seek out therapy less than women do, which indicates there might be something about traditional talking therapies that puts men off,' he says.

'In general, women are happy to talk about their problems but men want to fix the problem itself ""” they're more action-orientated. If men believe therapy is all about talking about feelings, they might not engage.'

Last November, Dr John Barry and consultant clinical psychologist Martin Seager authored guidance for dealing with men in therapy.

Published by the British Psychological Society, these set out that talking therapy is not the only option and that the relative absence of male therapists is an important consideration.

Dr John Barry believes many men might benefit from talking in a group setting or while walking or working on a car engine, because these situations provide a level of activity and community.

He says the first step towards reducing the higher rate of male suicide should be a wider recognition that men are more vulnerable to dying this way.

Yet for Andy and Lynda there was nothing to suggest that anything was wrong.

'We had no idea Leonard was struggling,' says Lynda, 'That's the shocking thing. A few things had happened in the preceding months ""” very little things, like a tyre blowing out on a dual carriageway. I think they built up.'

Attending university during the pandemic also presented challenges. Lynda adds: 'One of the things that upset him was that he never had a proper graduation. The university has since held the graduation and he wasn't there.'

She adds: 'We talked to him virtually every day when he was at university and we weren't aware of anything.

'Whatever happened in the early hours of New Year's Day ""” and we'll never know ""” it was one more little incident that overtook his mind.'

'I'm convinced it was a split-second moment of time when he didn't think. He was at the age when young lads have a lot of pressure on them and one thing was one thing too many.'

Andy adds: 'Leonard and I had a conversation in November because somebody he knew had taken his life. He said, 'Dad, I don't know how people can do that.' He seemed totally fine but something triggered a moment of madness.'

Leonard's wide friendship circle was deeply shocked by his death.

'The nearest he got to having a brother was a neighbouring farmer,' says Andy. 'If he wasn't here, then he was round there. They were so close. He couldn't believe that Leonard hadn't said anything.

'Leonard's friends at uni were the same. It was a total shock to everyone.'

Andy and Lynda's tireless campaigning has raised funds for three charities ""” the Farm Safety Foundation, The Farming Community Network and Papyrus, the national charity for the prevention of young suicides.

They are passionate about getting more information into universities and agricultural colleges about mental health and farm safety, and have visited the House of Commons to lobby for this.

They have also created wallet-sized cards with a 'Five-a-Day' mental health challenge, reminding people to talk openly. So far, more than 18,000 cards have been printed and distributed.

This summer, Andy and Lynda are planning a tractor relay ""” Len's Light ""” carrying a beacon and travelling from John O'Groats to Land's End, with young farmers across the country invited to join.

'The message we want to come down the country with is that nobody in the rural community should feel alone,' says Andy.

With breathtaking courage, he adds: 'We lost Leonard at an early age but he left a mark. His life wasn't in vain. I couldn't be more proud of what's coming to fruition from his loss.

'We hope that by using our voices we can stop other families going through the grief we have, because nothing prepares you for this.'

Clarkson's Farm star Kaleb Cooper has opened up about working with Jeremy Clarkson on the hit Prime Video show.

The farmer, 24, explained how difficult it is to teach the 62-year-old about running a farm and compared it to being a 'babysitter'.

Speaking to The Times, he said: 'When I first met Jeremy, I thought, ""Who's this muppet?"" Then I realised he was deadly serious about farming, which made me anxious. I thought he was just going to fiddle about for a few days, then bugger off. 

'Being his farm manager is like being a babysitter. If you think that teaching young kids is hard, you try teaching a 62-year-old who never listens.'

Kaleb added that Jeremy needs to learn that he is the boss, but that they do have a good relationship.

Struggle: Clarkson's Farm star Kaleb Cooper has opened up about working with Jeremy Clarkson on the hit Amazon Prime show 

'Babysitter': The farmer, 24, explained how difficult it is to teach the 62-year-old about running a farm and compared it to being a 'babysitter'

He said: 'I know people see us argue a lot on telly, but we do genuinely get on. In farming you need a good relationship with the people you're working with or the whole thing falls apart. I just wish he'd get it into his head that I'm the boss. If he doesn't like that, he can bugger off back to the kitchen where he's more useful.'

It comes after Kaleb revealed he 'pays himself 50p an hour' as he highlighted difficulties within farming. 

Kaleb, who rose to fame on the TV show with Jeremy, has since set out on his own venture and purchased eight calves. 

Speaking in a recent interview, he explained the costs of feeding the animals and that he must take a low wage in order to eventually make a profit on them.

He added: 'But, I worked out the other day how much my hourly rate is. I pay myself 50p an hour so then I can make money. But if I put myself at £10 an hour I don't make money, I lose money on the calves.'

Fears farmers will be ravaged by another mouse plague that destroyed millions of dollars' worth of crops in 2021

Mice have been spotted streaming across roads in parts of NSW, concerning farmers and researchers as rodent numbers surge in other parts of the country.

NSW Farmers president Xavier Martin said he observed mice 'swarming all over the road' near Coonabarabran in the Warrumbungle Shire.

'The worst of it was probably at least half a kilometre long,' Mr Martin told AAP.

'I came into some big patches where there were hundreds of mice running backwards and forwards in different directions looking for food.

'Members are telling me they're seeing mice again all the way from Queensland down to the Victorian border and out west towards Adelaide.'

Mice have been spotted streaming across roads in parts of NSW, concerning farmers and researchers as rodent numbers surge in other parts of the country (pictured, dead mice during a previous mice plague in Queensland in May, 2022)

'We've got mice at the moment damaging our sorghum crop, and no doubt damaging other farmers' summer crops and fodder,' he said.

'They're getting into hay sheds and we've just got to hope we can get on top of them, and not let them develop like they did two years ago.'

He urged farmers to use chew cards to record mice numbers.

NSW Farmers president Xavier Martin said he observed mice 'swarming all over the road' near Coonabarabran in the Warrumbungle Shire (pictured, residents using traps to capture mice during a plague in May, 2022) 

CSIRO research officer Steve Henry said reports of mice swarming were a cause for concern.

'When you see them running over the road like that, that means they're at peak population in the paddocks,' Mr Henry said.

CSIRO researchers have been trapping mice across the country over the past few months, with numbers on the rise in the south of Western Australia, and on the Yorke and Eyre peninsulas in South Australia, as well as the central west and north of NSW.

Mr Henry urged farmers to stay on top of their baiting program so mice numbers did not return to 2021 levels.

Farmers estimate the 2021 mouse plague caused millions of dollars worth of damage to crops and infrastructure.

Market traders across Britain are being forced to hike their prices after seeing wholesale costs soar by as much as 166% amid the vegetable supply chain crisis. 

Poor weather conditions in Morocco and Spain have hit trading routes hard, resulting in supermarket shelves being left empty and Aldi, Morrisons, Tesco and Asda introducing limits on purchases of certain veg. 

The items seeing the most shortages are cucumbers, peppers, tomatoes, lettuces and other everyday greens. And even home-grown turnips are in low supply after Environment Secretary Therese Coffey suggested them as a suitable alternative. 

The shortages have seen shoppers flock to their local greengrocers and market stalls, who have remained fully stocked. However the spiralling wholesale costs mean they are either making very little profit - if any at all - or passing the increases on to the customers, who in turn are buying far fewer produce. 

One market stall owner in Swanage, Dorset said she was 'embarrassed' by how expensive she was forced to sell red peppers for - at £1.85 a pop - joking that people will need to take out a mortgage just to buy one. 

Brixton market seller, Tracey, has no choice but to sell single peppers for £1.50 - a 375 per cent increase from previous prices

Meanwhile in Brixton, south London, market stall holders said they have 'never seen things so bad', as they struggle to make a profit due to cash-strapped shoppers purchasing little more than an onion at a time.

Tracey has run her Brixton market stall for over 30 years and said she is getting up at 4am and closing at 6pm with nothing to take home.

The market-veteran claimed it is not a food shortage, but a price issue and blames shortages on supermarkets refusing to pay the increased costs.

Tracey said she would usually expect a higher cost for a couple of items around this time of year, but seeing the prices soar across all fruit and veg is unprecedented.

A crate of 20 tomatoes has gone from £6 to £21. Ginger palettes have flown from £14 to £60. Orange peppers, aubergine and Iceberg lettuce now cost around £20 for a box of 10, setting customers back around £2 as a result.

Broccoli has gone from £6 to £18 a 10-item box. Around £8 for 14 cucumbers has turned to £16. Huge wholesale sums have made fruit and vegetables unaffordable for many.

Tracey has no choice but to sell single peppers for £1.50, usually shoppers could get three for £1.20 - a 375 per cent increase.

Like peppers, aubergines and lettuces, one broccoli now sets customers back £2.

Tracey (pictured) said she is getting up at 4am and closing at 6pm with nothing to take home

Standing behind her high-quality and well-stocked array of veg, she said: 'I make no profit now. For certain items I bring in I only get from the customer what I've just paid. And that's just so I can have it on the stall so people don't go elsewhere.

'And that's not one or two lines, that's 10 lines. All I'm doing is paying out, and getting my money back, and that's getting up at four o'clock in the morning. Not earning nothing of it.

'I close at six o'clock at night. Never has it ever, ever, ever been this bad. Never over the whole of fruit and veg. It's not so much the fruit, it's the veg, the greens.

'We're not affected by the shortage, we're affected by the price. We're paying £21 for a box of tomatoes, the supermarkets aren't going to pay that are they?

'We pay £28 for a box of orange peppers, they're not going to pay that either are they? It's not a food shortage, it's the fact supermarkets aren't willing to pay farmers the price.'

Jaaul Safi, selling fruit and vegetables at Brixton Foods, said he is no longer selling cucumbers because they are so expensive at £1 each.

The food salesman said upset customers were questioning how they could get the money to buy fruit and veg. He said they would arrive to buy vegetables and leave with just an onion.

Shoppers are now charged £3 for three tomatoes in Brixton Foods.

He said: 'Prices are too high. It's very expensive now, everything is going up too much. It's affecting business too much, customers have too many problems now, they come in crying 'where do I get the money? How can I have this?'

'Price everything is. The market is dead now. They can't buy it, they can't afford it. Everyone comes to the market to buy their food.

'We try to get enough profits that at least we get something. Cucumbers are £1 each now, but we don't sell them now since last week. Because it's been very hard to get it as well.'

Khalid Mahmut works at KM Meat Fish Grocery on the market and said he was feeling the pinch on fresh fish as well as veg.

He said: 'The prices? It's definitely affecting everybody. I think it's gone up by 25 per cent.

Jaaul Safi (pictured) said he is no longer selling cucumbers because they are too expensive

'Day by day we're more affected. Now look at the cucumber, tomato, they're all very expensive and the customer can't afford it.' 

Elsewhere, Bridget Eveleigh, 67, has been in the fruit and veg business for 55 years and runs a market stall at four different locations in Dorset. Today she was at Swanage.

She said she has been paying 'phenomenal prices' for items like cucumber, pepper and tomatoes which have doubled in price.

She said she has been too embarrassed to pass on the price hike of red peppers to her customers which she isn't making any money on at all.

She said: 'We're not being affected by supply like supermarkets are because we buy on the open markets.

'Supermarkets have supply issues because they agree a contract months ahead so they can keep on a set price.

'But what's happened is Spain has had exceptionally bad weather for the last 50 days which has affected growing - it's been colder there than it has here.

'We get a lot from Morocco and they have had storms and it's been bitterly cold.

'And there have been no crossings from North Africa to mainland Spain for several days because of the weather and the French have been on strike so even if it gets there there have been issues getting it across. Basically everything has been affected by extremes of weather.

Khalid Mahmut said the price increases were 'definitely affecting everybody'

'The last three weeks we have been paying phenomenal prices. So where a supermarket would charge 60p for a cucumber, we have been paying £1.28.

'Now that has become unsustainable for the growers and they're having to break their contracts with supermarkets.

'Tomatoes we are paying £24 a box, normally it would be half that. It's not just tomatoes - icebergs, celery, cucumbers.

'Red peppers today we paid £26 a box and there's only 14 in a box, that's £1.85 per pepper. I have hidden the peppers because I am so embarrassed by how expensive they are.'

Her assistant Geoff Peerless has been joking with their customers about needing to take out a mortgage to buy a pepper.

Bridget added: 'I haven't bought yellow or orange because they were £30 a box (£2.14 each).

'We are selling them at what they cost us, we haven't really been making any money for the past three weeks.

'I won't buy Portuguese cabbage because it's too expensive at the moment - it's £30 a box, which is £2 a cabbage, it's normally half that.

'Normally we would buy British spring cabbage but all the cabbages here were wiped out by the cold spell we had around Christmas.

'That affected cauliflowers too. We have cauliflowers £24 for a box of 11 (£2.18 each) but those are French because the English ones were all wrecked by the weather. Normally we would pay 80p per English cauliflower.

'I have never known it be as difficult as it is now. I think this is the worst it will be, when the English season kicks in and the weather gets better in Spain things will improve.

'The customers have been quite good about the prices going up.'

Bridget said the supermarket shortage has definitely brought more customers to them.

A crate of 20 tomatoes has gone from £6 to £21. Ginger palettes have flown from £14 to £60

She said: 'At Dorchester market on Wednesday we served people we have never seen before, I'd say it was about 30% up and today we are busier than usual because people can't get it in supermarkets.

'I hope this will bring attention to the skewed way supermarkets work. It should be about supply and demand but that's not the case in supermarkets. The grower is the one that suffers. It takes eight months to grow peppers.

'I've been a grower before so I know how much hard work it is and how little return you get. Energy prices have also had an impact because all the greenhouses are heated.

'There is going to be a global shortage if this continues.'

Elsewhere, stall holders in Newcastle claim there has been an unprecedented surge in the cost of tomatoes and lettuce, causing them to make a loss of profit.

Some market owners claim vegetables have tripled in value, with the price of a box of peppers increased from £9 to a staggering £24 - an increase of 166%.

Business owners say they have made the tough decision to stop stocking tomatoes and lettuce during the crisis because of the sky high prices.

Darron Marchant, 44, the owner of Monument Fruiters market said: 'I can't get a hold of tomatoes, lettuce and cabbage.

'They're available but the prices are extortionate and we can't afford to order them in.

'Before the crisis, peppers cost £9 but now they're £24. Broccoli was £5 for a box but now it's £18, a cabbage was £4.80 but now it's £14.50.

'We haven't put any salad vegetables out because we can't afford it.

'You have to make a living in this climate and it's impossible. It's really stressful for grocers.

'It's also hard to make sure I have enough stock and I now have to get up at 3am to get stock.

A higher cost for a couple of items around this time of year is expected, but seeing the prices soar across all fruit and veg is unprecedented, Tracey said

'I've had to put my prices up. I charge more for bananas, cherries and strawberries but a few pence.

'The only good thing about the shortage is more customers come to us if they can't get it in the supermarket.

'Our stuff is also better quality and cheaper, for example, we sell three avocados for £1 whereas in Aldi one is 79p.'

Khan Ayoubi, 30, the manager of Heaton Halal Superstore said: 'Because of the shortage the prices have tripled.

'Take tomatoes for example, it used to be £4 for a box and it's now £17. We have had to increase our prices, we used to charge £1.49 for tomatoes but now charge £3.99.

'We didn't want to put our prices up but we have to, we've been forced into it to cover the costs. It's a very worrying time for us.'

Meanwhile, independent greengrocers across the city of Cambridge have seen a huge surge in customers.

TJ Cicek, 40, took the brave decision to open up his veg shop Harvest on Mill Road in Cambridge in the middle of the pandemic in December 2020.

Two years on, he said it's hard to tell what a normal season is after so much turmoil. However this week his customers are all after his tomatoes and peppers.

Running the shop with his wife Maisie on Friday, he said: 'Over the past five or six days we've had an increase in footfall for tomatoes and peppers.

'This hasn't impacted our profits though. Overall people are still buying less because of the cost of living crisis but because supermarkets don't have the produce so we are selling more.

'Because of the price increases though, it makes us look expensive when we get almost no profit from them anymore.

'Bell peppers we used to sell for 79p with a good profit margin. Now they are £1.79 with a small margin and we can't afford any losses.

Tracey who is battling with the costs has now run her Brixton stall for more than 30 years

'We would buy them in for £10 a box, now they are £26.50 per box.

'Why? Maybe wholesalers are taking advantage of the shortages, or maybe they are short themselves.

'It's true that Harvest is going strong because I do 12 hour shifts seven days a week.

'Opening was challenging, we were crazy to do it but the community here supports individual businesses.'

He said between the increase in prices for veg and the energy bill price hikes, money has been tight: 'Our energy bill has doubled since we opened. Our annual bill was £12,000 and it is now £28,000. Despite this, I think we're going to be fine.'

Kevin Smith, 64, manages a veg stall at Cambridge Market in Market Square called G&M Fruit and Veg.

When speaking this morning he had a queue of customers going around the corner of his stall to buy his veg, clutching bags of tomatoes and lettuce.

Kevin, who has worked on the market for five years, said: 'There's been a slight increase in trade, people are coming more to buy our stuff this week rather than buying their groceries at supermarkets.

'One customer said their local Tesco has been really poor and they'd rather buy here with me.

'The prices are what we've really noticed going up. Sometimes we have to explain to customers what the situation is if they ask.

'A box of tomatoes used to be £9, now it's £22. There's nothing we can do. We don't have a problem getting the stock but we have to pay the price.'

It comes after Tesco stores ran out of turnips after the Government advised Brits to stock up on the root vegetable amid ongoing shortages of lettuce, cucumber and other everyday greens. 

Environment Secretary Therese Coffey suggested turnips as a suitable alternative while other items - including tomatoes and peppers - remain in short supply due to poor weather in Spain and Morocco. 

But just hours after the MP offered her advice in the House of Commons, turnips were out of stock on Tesco's website, with the supermarket instead suggesting swedes. 

Tesco shopper Louis Henwood said he was met with a message saying: 'This product is currently out of stock'.

Other supermarkets such as Morrisons and Asda also do not provide turnips when searched - instead offering up swedes as well.

Meanwhile a tray for turnips in a Tesco in Ely, Cambridgeshire, was pictured empty on Friday. 

It comes as Brits have been rushing to their local greengrocers, who have remained fully stocked despite the shortages.

Thomas Hagon, 39, from Reg The Veg green grocers in Clifton, Bristol, claimed 'the produce is there for supermarkets to purchase but higher prices have turned the chains off'.

Meanwhile, Baz Dawson, owner of Fresh and Fruity, in Preston, revealed his salad stocks have not been directly affected because he buys locally, as he urged people to head to their local market stalls.

And Paul Semple, 43, manager at Lloyds Greengrocer, in Bristol, said his footfall is up 10 per cent, with new customers telling him they 'can't believe how stocked up' his shop is. 

It comes as the likes of Aldi, Morrisons, Asda and Tesco have limited sales of tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers as frosty weather in Spain and Morocco has hit imports - with customers in all four stores given limits to how much produce they can buy. 

But despite an increase in cost price, Mr Hagon claims greengrocers have been able to remain stocked up, and says he has fresh tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers because 'customers are happy to pay extra for them'.

He predicted supermarkets will be forced to increase prices in the near future - after Environment Secretary Therese Coffey warned the crisis could last for another month.

Meanwhile, some restaurants struggling to cope with the shortages have been forced to remove tomato-dependent items such as pizza and pasta from their menus.

Mr Hagon said Reg The Veg had a period of low stock a few weeks ago when supermarkets were selling the vegetables at a lower price.

But since the wholesale price has reportedly nearly doubled, averaging at £15 before and now as much as £30, Mr Hagon said supermarkets 'won't pay it', while greengrocers, like Reg The Veg, will.

He said: 'We had shortages due to availability and low numbers about three weeks ago and supermarkets were still pumping out vegetables at low prices.

'It's got to the point where now supermarkets can't buy it at the right price as it's increased so much.

'It is available they just won't pay the money for it.

'Whereas we can, and we can then supply our customers and pass on the slight increase in price.

'We've still had to increase our own prices in some areas - cherry vine tomatoes are now £9.99 a kilo which is around double the normal price.

'We do say to customers that these peppers or tomatoes for example can be quite expensive but they're happy to pay that.

'Of course, nationally it's very difficult because of the volumes that supermarkets get in, but if they're quoted £25 or £30 pounds for a wholesale shipment, and they wont pay for it.'

Why are there shortages of fruit and veg in the UK? Rising prices, heating costs and bad weather abroad are all blamed

What is causing the shortages? 

Cold weather in Spain and Morocco has drastically hit the availability of vegetables in British markets along with soaring energy prices.



The supply problems are blamed on bad weather and high energy costs making greenhouses more costly to heat.

Some critics have cited red tape on post-Brexit imports from the EU as an issue.

Tim O'Malley, of major importer Nationwide Produce, said volatile growing conditions had seen wholesale spot prices for fresh produce lines soar by as much as 300 per cent.

Growers in Spain and elsewhere on the Continent are reportedly sending produce to European supermarkets rather than to the UK because they are more willing to pay the higher prices.

High energy prices - linked to Russia's invasion of Ukraine - are also a factor because it has become more expensive to heat greenhouses.

Which fruit and veg are affected?

 The problem started with tomatoes but has since widened to peppers, cucumbers, lettuce, salad bags, broccoli, cauliflower and raspberries.

Is Brexit to blame? 

While some critics have cited red tape on imports from Europe, industry expert Mr O'Malley said the single biggest factor behind the crisis was 'Mother Nature'.

He said: 'I can honestly say that in the 40 years I've been in this trade, I've never seen such high spot prices across such a broad range of products for such a prolonged period of time.'

He added: 'It's not about Brexit - it's about different buying models'. 

Farming minister Mark Spencer said at the NFU conference yesterday: 'What has driven some of this is a frost in Morocco and Spain in November and December. 

'This can damage a lot of the salad and brassica crops, which we have traditionally relied on at this time of year so that has created a gap in the market.

'It's very difficult for UK producers to grow cauliflowers, for example over winter. They are not resistant to frost. It's not possible to grow cauliflowers in January in the United Kingdom unless you grow them in a greenhouse.'

Why are European supermarkets not suffering from shortages?

Experts say that it is because of the way that British supermarkets buy produce compared to those on the continent.

Tim O'Malley says retailers in the UK tend to agree prices once or twice a year so they and shoppers can get certainty on price.

This tends to be a winter deal for produce from Spain and Morocco and a summer deal for UK produce.

Mr O'Malley says that in Europe they tend to agree monthly prices, meaning that supermarkets find it easier to buy when prices change.



Adam Leyland, Editor-in-Chief of The Grocer, said that UK supermarkets are 'in denial' and need to be more nimble to avoid shortages like the current one.

What are the other factors? 

Travel disruption including ferry cancellations have also caused disruption.

There has been strong winds disrupting ferries from Morocco and flooding in the country. 

Frost has also slowed growth and damaged crops. 

How long will it last? 

Phil Pearson, group development director at APS Produce said delays are likely to continue until, 'the end of April into May.'

Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, which represents UK supermarkets, said: 'Difficult weather conditions in the south of Europe and northern Africa have disrupted harvest for some fruit and vegetables including tomatoes and peppers.

'While disruption is expected to last a few weeks, supermarkets are adept at managing supply chain issues and are working with farmers to ensure that customers are able to access a wide range of fresh produce.'

One of his colleagues said there were queues stretching out the door on Sunday after customers scrambled for tomatoes and peppers.

She initially wasn't sure why but then realised it may have been down to the supermarket shortage. 

Mr Hagon said he isn't sure what the solution to the problem is, but that it will probably result in supermarkets having to charge more.

He said conditions on the continent have left prices at an 'exceptionally high' rate.

He added: 'I don't know what the solution is to it, they'll just have to charge more - some fruit or veg hasn't gone up for a decade or more.

'When there's more competition from other European countries that supply produce it'll bring prices down - It's always high at this time of the year, it's just exceptionally high at the moment.

'We've seen the cold weather in Morocco. They've got snow - it's crazy.

'We've got used to eating what we want to eat all year round so when things go a bit short it can be a bit of a shock.'

Other greengrocers have also found themselves with no choice but to double their prices.

Paul Semple, 43, of Lloyds Green Grocers in Bristol, said: 'Tomatoes are hard to get, courgette, cucumbers all hard to get hold of.

'They're twice the price, that's how scarce they are.

'It's always hard to get produce this time a year but this year we're nearly at £10 a kilo for tomatoes when we rarely go above £5.

'We're still getting the gear, just prices are up and very expensive.'

Another fruit and veg trader urged people to head to their local market stalls for fresh groceries.

Baz Dawson, owner of Fresh and Fruity, in Preston, revealed his salad stocks have not been directly affected during the national shortage because he buys locally.

The Preston Market trader said that while big supermarkets will now struggle to get hold of their usual cheaper items from abroad, he will continue to buy from farmers in Lancashire and the surrounding areas.

Four of the UK's leading supermarkets - Tesco, Aldi, Asda and Morrisons - have put limitations in place on the amount of certain items customers can buy.

The problem started with tomatoes but has since widened to peppers, cucumbers, lettuce, salad bags, broccoli, cauliflower and raspberries.

Tesco and Aldi have introduced limits of three per customer on sales of tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers. Asda is limiting customers to three on sales of lettuce, salad bags, broccoli, cauliflowers and raspberry punnets, along with tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers. Morrisons has set a limit of two on cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce and peppers.

Mr Dawson says it is the international transportation that has got the supermarkets in a pickle, with fewer places for them to buy their goods.

But because traders like him keep things local, they are not worried about stocks lasting. 

He says every day can be different when it comes to buying locally and because of that, he is less worried he'll face what the supermarkets are currently dealing with.

Mr Dawson said: 'We only deal with top end fresh fruits, veg and salads. There's currently such a national shortage on salads and foreign vegetables.

'We go to the wholesalers and buy either direct or off the farmer or the wholesaler to cut costs, but to stick with the quality. 

'With it being such a struggle nationally, the supermarkets will struggle but with us going direct to the wholesalers, we can still get hold of limited salad stock.

'Most of our vegetables are grown and cut within a ten mile radius during certain seasons of the year. Even for us, when we're in the depths of winter we sometimes have to go for the cheaper produce too.

'Supermarkets have not got the stock of salads in now whatsoever but here we do have, from the wholesaler. 

'Because they haven't got it in the supermarket, like they didn't when the pandemic hit, they come to us in the market to buy fresh produce and salad. We keep going, like we did two years ago.'

Fluctuating stocks can occur daily in the market trade, Mr Dawson says, but having already dealt with it since the day he began selling, he says the fear of low stocks of certain items is less of a fear.

In the winter months the UK imports around 95 per cent of its tomatoes and 90 per cent of its lettuces, mostly from Spain and northern Africa. The British Retail Consortium said disruption was expected to last a few weeks.

Retailers have stressed that buying limits are temporary until supplies improve in the coming days or weeks, helped by the UK moving into its growing season.

It comes after the Environment Secretary suggested yesterday that Brits could consider eating turnips to ease the national vegetable shortage. 

Farmers also warned of a shortage of leeks that is likely to hamper St David's Day celebrations in Wales next week.

Therese Coffey told MPs the 'temporary' shortages were caused by 'very unusual weather' but were expected to end in another four weeks.

Ms Coffey said that consumers might want to turn to British 'specialisms' at this time of year to support domestic farmers.

She added: 'I am led to believe by my officials... we anticipate the situation will last about another two to four weeks.

'Even if we cannot control the weather it is important that we try and make sure the supply continues to not be frustrated in quite the way it has been due to these unusual weather incidents.'

Salad fans told to buy Micro Tom plant that can produce 6,000 cherry tomatoes in a year 

Salad fans are being urged to start growing a super plant that can yield thousands of tomatoes in case the fruit and veg shortage continues into summer.

The Micro Tom is a small plant that has been known to produce a staggering 6,000 cherry tomatoes in a single year.

In contrast, people can only expect to harvest 200 tomatoes from a regular plant.

Greenfingered Joy and Michael Michaud are encouraging growers to get hold of hanging baskets and start planting seeds now to enjoy a steady supply of tomatoes from June through to November.

Last year, Joy, from West Bexington, Dorset, kept a tally of the number she was picking and all her plants produced 5,000 to 6,000 tomatoes each.

She said they 'couldn't eat them fast enough' and had to give away bags of toms to neighbours to save them from the compost heap.

Joy, 64, said: 'We recommend that people enjoy the winter vegetables during this shortage and get planting to ensure a supply of delicious tomatoes in summer.

'If people can get hold of hanging baskets and polytunnels that will be the perfect environment to grow them in through March and April.

'Homegrown tomatoes always taste better than shop bought ones and this way people can make sure they have plenty to eat.

'Last year I was struggling to count the number I was picking off our Micro Tomato plants.

'Every plant we had produced around 6,000 tomatoes each. We couldn't believe it, they are miracle plants.

'I set an initial target of 1,000 tomatoes a plant but we quickly passed that and I set another one at 5,000.

'That is thousands more than you could expect to get from a normal tomato plant. It's just an incredible variety.

'While the tomatoes are small they're very tasty - they're little balls of flavour.'

Joy and Michael run Sea Spring Seeds and grow and sell seeds for 150 types of chilli.

Ms Coffey agreed with Tory MP Selaine Saxby who suggested eating seasonal vegetables could solve the issue. 

Ms Saxby said: 'We should be eating more seasonally and supporting our own British farmers', adding that if shoppers did so, 'a lot of these problems would be avoided'.

Ms Coffey said: 'It's important to make sure that we cherish the specialisms that we have in this country. 

'A lot of people would be eating turnips right now rather than thinking necessarily about... lettuce and tomatoes and similar, but I'm conscious that consumers want a year-round choice and that is what our supermarkets, food producers and growers around the world are trying to satisfy.'

Labour's environment spokesman Jim McMahon questioned suggestions that food shortages were entirely caused by external forces, claiming ministers could have done more to support farmers with access to 'the energy-intensive support scheme', and increased quotas on labour to help with workforce shortages.

Conservative former minister Sir Desmond Swayne ridiculed suggestions that Brexit was responsible for the shortages. 

He told the Commons: 'If only I had been told before I voted for Brexit that it was going to cause frosts in Morocco, I could have made a different decision, couldn't I?'

Asked about the turnip suggestion, a No 10 spokesman said: 'We don't believe it's for us to tell people what they should or shouldn't buy.' 

He added: 'What the Secretary of State was doing was setting out the importance of celebrating the produce that we grow here in the UK.'

Ms Coffey drew further criticism for suggesting people struggling to afford food bills could consider working more hours.

She said: 'One of the best ways to boost their incomes is not only to get into work if they're not in work already, but potentially to work some more hours.'

After the debate, Labour's Rachael Maskell accused Ms Coffey of 'shifting blame for food poverty on to people because they are on low wages and are poor'.

Budget supermarket food is seeing average annual price rises of an astonishing 21.5 per cent.

A Which? study found the poorest homes were the worst hit.

Some products have seen huge increases, such as tins of Growers Harvest sliced carrots up 63 per cent at Tesco to 33p, and packs of pork sausages at Asda up 58 per cent to £1.27. Budget Creamfields French brie also saw a 96.6 per cent rise at Tesco to £1.57.

Farmers are warning of an 'extraordinary' shortage of leeks which threatens St David's Day celebrations in Wales next week.

British producers of the much-loved seasonal vegetable, as well as onions, cauliflower and broccoli, have had to write off crops due to a lack of rain and deep frosts.

Supermarkets including Aldi Morrisons, Asda and Tesco have limited sales of vegetables, but Therese Coffey suggested people could use turnips as a substitute

Leek yields were down by as much as 30 per cent following the 'most difficult growing season ever'

Some supermarkets have already run out of leeks, while the ones that do reach the shelves are often of poor quality and stunted - bad news for anyone planning to serve up traditional dishes such as a Welsh cawl or Wrexham bake on March 1.

Leek Growers Association chairman Tim Casey said yields were down by as much as 30 per cent following the 'most difficult growing season ever'. He added: 'We are predicting the supply of home-grown leeks will be exhausted by April, with no British leeks in the shops during May and June.'

Reputedly introduced to Wales by the Phoenicians when they were trading for tin in the British Isles, the leek has long been associated with the Welsh Saint David.

In 640AD, according to legend, the Briton King Cadwaladr and his men wore leeks in their hats to distinguish themselves in battle against invading Saxons. The leek has remained a national symbol ever since.

Revealed: The dog breeds that really ARE man's best friend - so is YOURS on the list?

They're often described as man's best friend, having been loyal pets for up to 40,000 years.

But a new study suggests that when it comes to getting on with humans, not all dog breeds are equal.

Researchers from the University of Helsinki have revealed the dog breeds with the highest and lowest levels of human sociability.

Their findings suggest that bull type terriers, teacup dogs and golden retrievers are officially 'man's best friends'.

In contrast, livestock guardian dogs, Asian primitive breeds and primitive sighthounds are least enamoured in our company.

In the study, the team set out to investigate the personality differences between dog breeds.

'The breed of the dog is the most important determinant underlying personality differences,' said Dr Milla Salonen, lead author of the study.

'All dogs are individuals, and all breeds have different traits, but the breeds differ in what kind of personality most dogs within each breed have.'

The team collected an enormous behavioural survey dataset containing information on 11,000 dogs across 300 different breeds. 

These were were then categorised into 52 groups.

The least friendly dog breeds 









The data revealed a strong link between breed and seven personality traits.

These were insecurity, training focus, aggressiveness/dominance, energy, dog sociability, human sociability, and perseverance.'

In terms of human sociability, bull type terriers topped the list, followed by teacup dogs, Golden Retrievers, Jack Russell Terriers and Dachshunds.

At the other end of the scale, livestock guardian dogs, Asian primitive breeds, primitive sighthounds and Northern hunting spitzes were found to be the least sociable with humans.

Aside from breed, several other factors were also found to influence a dog's sociability with humans.

Female dogs were found to score more highly than male dogs, while human sociability decreased with age.

Based on the findings, the researchers suggest that regardless of the breed, dog owners should try to familiarise their pets with humans from an early age.

'Our findings indicate that new owners should familiarize their puppies as much as possible with unfamiliar people, places and animals,' Dr Salonen said.

'Of course, socialization must always be done on the puppy's terms, which means that the puppy must not be forced into frightening situations.'

The study comes shortly after research revealed that owners with good relationships with their dog actually have the same personality as them.

These doting dog parents match with their pup on levels of warmth, enjoyment of outdoor exercise and selflessness with possessions.

Researchers from the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany reviewed 29 published papers on dog-owner relationships. 

This revealed that strong bonds were also fostered when the dog was actually more open, agreeable and neurotic than their human.

Queen Maxima of the Netherlands was effortlessly chic in a retro-print midi-dress as she attended the FMO Future of Finance Conference in Amsterdam today before heading to a police network 'Roze in Blauw' (Pink in Blue) celebration as part of Diversity Day.

The royal, 52, showed off her autumnal wardrobe as she sported the patterned burgundy, orange and white frock, accentuated by its silky fabric and flowy sleeves. 

The mother-of-three teamed her ensemble with scarlet heels and a handy cherry clutch. 

She even made sure her ornate beaded earrings matched the colour scheme and styled her blonde tresses into a sleek windswept blowout. 

Maxima opted for a make-up look which accentuated her eyes, finishing off with a dusky pink lipstick, before wrapping a rainbow flag around herself.

The conference kicked off yesterday, and today features talks on issues around a responsible finance digital ecosystem, food system transformation and lessons from financial institutions.

Queen Maxima was pictured smiling up a storm at the event, and was at one point seen speaking on stage. 

The royal is clearly passionate about finance as she was in 2009 appointed the UN Secretary-General's Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development (UNSGSA), a role which sees her advise the Secretary-General and push for support of low-income groups and SMEs around the world. 

The bi-annual conference has been around for 13 years has each time seen more than 400 professionals from some 60 countries attend.

It comes as the European monarch looked elegant as she made a working visit to the 1931 Congress Center in Den Bosch last week. 

She was sophisticated in a navy tailored jumpsuit at the opening of the UNLimited festival of the Association of Universities.

As honorary president of the MIND Us Foundation, Maxima has a special interest in the mental well-being of students. 

The royal oozed confidence as she made her way into the venue, teaming her outfit with bright red stilettos.

She completed her ensemble with a matching leather handbag and drop earrings. 

During the two-day festival, more than five hundred participants will exchange knowledge and experience. 

The event will show how universities work towards better education and research to make an even bigger impact on their region. 

Queen Maxima also looked confident as she took to the stage to give a speech. 

The royal had also recently showcased her sartorial flair during a trip to Amsterdam.

Maxima, together with State Secretary Van Ooijen of Health, Welfare and Sport, visited initiatives that reduce loneliness in a community centre based in the heart of the Netherlands.

The visit was intended to promote Loneliness Awareness Week, encouraging people to create supportive communities through conversations with family, friends or colleagues about loneliness.

She re-wore a printed pussy bow blouse and green cactus leather midi skirt, both by Natan.

She added a bold flash of colour, accessorising with her trusty Gianvito Rossi cobalt blue court shoes. In her hand, she carried a small clutch bag, which appeared to be made from the same fabric as her skirt.

'Sexist' farmer 'told Bristol student to take her top off' - then university lecturer dismissed behaviour as 'typical', report claims

A 'sexist' farmer who allegedly told a veterinary student at the University of Bristol to take her top off had his behaviour dismissed by a lecturer, who described it as 'typical' for farmers, it has been claimed. 

Veterinary science students at the university reported the farmer to a lecturer after a serious of incidences during a mandatory lambing placement as part of their studies. The placement is usually their first and is arranged through the university. 

The sexist and inappropriate behaviour allegedly included the farmer telling one student to 'take your top off' so she could paint one of his lodges, according to The Bristol Tab. 

Another student, placed in the same area, alleged the farmer sent inappropriate TikTok videos including one of women dancing in short skirts. The video was allegedly sent with a message that read: 'This is what I want to see in my shed then on Saturday night x'. 

According to the report, the farmer allegedly referred to students as his 'gate b****' and 'cherub slag', and said his friends were going to come and visit them in the middle of the night in the lambing shed. 

The students claimed they were told to spend the day cleaning the farmer's living area, even though cleaners were employed to carry out the task. They had been promised a 'treat' beforehand. 

Veterinary science students at the University of Bristol reported the farmer to a lecturer after the incident during a mandatory lambing placement as part of their studie

He allegedly told the students: 'You are women, you like cleaning'. 

One student claimed to have been left alone in the countryside in the early hours of the morning because the farmer forgot to pick her up. She also claimed he forgot to feed them. 

'I would cry so much, calling my dad in tears', she said. 

The students claimed they felt uneasy about the placement before it began after the farmer allegedly sent them messages asking if they would arrive early, writing he would 'definitely make it worth [their] while'. 

One student told the Tab that even when the farmer was not there, they were 'constantly on edge that he would arrive.' 

After the placement, which took placed in Easter 2022, had ended, messages were allegedly sent continuously by the farmer. 

However, when the students returned to the university and complained to a senior member of staff, they were allegedly told: 'It's just typical for farmers to act like this'. 

The lecturer also allegedly said the placement 'must have been an admin error' and that the farm was 'not meant to be on the list'. 

When asked if the farm would be removed from the approved placements list, the lecturer allegedly said they did not think it was necessary and that they 'might contact the family ahead of next year and give them some tips on how to be a bit more welcoming'. 

Despite the complaint, two students were allegedly sent to the same farm this year. 

Professor Sheena Warman, deputy head of the Vet School at the University of Bristol, told the Tab: 'I am extremely concerned to hear about the experiences of these students and I'm very sorry they were disappointed by the feedback from their lecturer when this was raised with them afterwards.

'The behaviour and attitudes they have described during their placement are completely unacceptable. I have met with the students to assure them that their concerns are being taken seriously and to apologise for the distress this has caused. 

'We are now looking into this as a matter of urgency and have taken the farm in question off our placements list while we investigate.'

MailOnline has contacted the University of Bristol for comment.

Robot kills factory worker: Man is crushed to death when machine fails to differentiate between human and a box of vegetables

A man was crushed to death by a robot in South Korea after it failed to differentiate him from a box of vegetables.

The victim, a robotics company worker in his 40s, was inspecting the machine's sensor at a distribution centre for agricultural produce in South Gyeongsang in the early hours of this morning.

The machine, which was lifting boxes of peppers onto a pallet, grabbed the man with its arm and pushed him against the conveyer belt, crushing his face and chest.

The robot appears to have malfunctioned and identified the man as a box, police sources said.

The victim was transferred to the hospital but died later, according to the South Korean Yonhap news agency.

Police are now preparing to launch an investigation into the site's safety managers for possible negligence in duties. 

An official from the Donggoseong Export Agricultural Complex, which owns the plant, called for a 'precise and safe' system to be established in a statement after the incident. 

The victim had reportedly filled in to conduct tests originally planned for November 6. 

They were pushed back two days due to reported problems with the robot's sensor. 

In March, a South Korean man in his 50s suffered serious injuries after getting trapped by a robot while working at an automobile parts manufacturing plant.

And last July, footage emerged of a chess-playing android breaking a child's finger during a match in Russia.

The robot grabbed the seven-year-old boy's finger at the Moscow Open because it was confused by his quick movements, Russian media outlets reported.

Sergey Lazarev, vice-president of the Russian Chess Federation, said the child had violated 'certain safety rules' by making a move too soon. 

A chess-playing robot (pictured) broke a child's finger during an international tournament in Moscow last July, with the incident being captured in CCTV footage 

Christopher Atkeson, a robotics expert at Carnegie Mellon University, told MailOnline: 'Robots have limited sensing and thus limited awareness of what is going on around them.

'I suspect the chess robot did not have ears, and that its vision system was blind to anything other than chess boards and pieces.'

Nuclear weapons tests are blamed for radioactive pigs in Germany and Austria

Nuclear weapons tests are to blame for radioactive wild boar in Germany and Austria, a new study has found.

It was previously assumed that the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 was to blame for the radioactive pigs, but researchers from Austria's Vienna University of Technology have now attributed the contaminated pigs to nuclear weapons testing.

The testing of weapons took place in the decades following The Second World War, but soil in the areas where the boars roam in the forests of Germany and Austria is still contaminated.

It is estimated that over two million wild boar roam Germany and Austria, frequently wreaking havoc on the local wildlife, destroying crops and causing thousands of car accidents each year across central Europe.

But the pigs are largely protected from hunters due to their radioactivity, causing them to be unsafe for human consumption.

Until recently, it was assumed that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster was to blame for the high caesium (chemical element Cs) levels in the animals.

If the radioactive levels were because of the 1986 powerplant disaster, researchers said, the caesium levels would have diminished significantly by now.

In the study published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, Researchers pinned the specific reasoning for the radioactive pigs on the discovery that the pigs would have tested positive for radioactive element caesium-137 if Chernobyl was to blame.

Instead they found that the animals were rich in caesium-135 - a radioactive element far more common in nuclear weapons than power plants.

'The team observed that 88 per cent of the 48 meat samples exceeded German regulatory limits for radioactive cesium in food,' the report said.

'For the samples with elevated levels, the researchers calculated the ratios of cesium-135 to cesium-137, and found that nuclear weapons testing supplied between 10 and 68 per cent of the contamination.'

The team concluded that nuclear weapons testing after the Second World War was 'an underappreciated source of radioactive cesium to German soil' and thus affected the pigs.

It is estimated that over two million wild boar roam Germany and Austria, frequently wreaking havoc on the local wildlife, destroying crops and causing thousands of car accidents each year across central Europe (file image)

The team also blamed the phenomenon on underground mushrooms and deer truffles.

The fungi are eaten almost exclusively by the wild boar and not by any other animals.

The nuclear ceasium creaked slowly through the soil and eventually reached the truffles, explaining the reason for the time delay in contaminating the pigs, the researchers said.

'Contamination from both sources have been taken up by the wild boars' food, such as underground truffles, contributing to their persistent radioactivity,' the team said.

Parts of Europe could be hit by their hottest ever temperatures next week after meteorologists issued a dire warning that the blistering heat could reaching 48C - threatening people, livestock and crops.

The continent is already in the grip of a sweltering heatwave 'Cerberus' - named after the three-headed dog that guards the gates of Hades (hell) in Greek mythology - which has pushed the mercury into the high 40s after a weather system from the Sahara moved into southern Europe.

The anticyclone, which has pushed north in recent days, has caused life-threatening wildfires in Croatia, while tourists and locals trapped in the boiling temperatures have struggled to cope as the mercury gets set to rise above 45C in Spain, Italy, Greece and Turkey by the end of next week.

Rescue workers had to transport tourists from the Acropolis citadel in Athens to ambulances on Thursday as temperatures soared. It follows reports of the death of a 44-year-old street painter in Lodi, Italy and the tragic drowning of two children in Manfredonia on Tuesday, both believed to be seeking relief from the heat.

Ominously, experts are saying the next torturous bout of extreme heat, which will be named 'Charon' - after the boatman who carries the souls of the dead to Hades in Greek mythology - is set to come only days later and this time records could be broken.

The hellish conditions brought by Cerberus and Charon are perhaps fitting as, aside from their roles in Greek mythology, the phenomena's namesakes were both described in Inferno, the first part of Dante's Divine Comedy which depicts a journey through the nine circles of hell.

Land temperatures - how hot the ground is to touch - in Spain reached upwards of 60C in parts of southern Spain on Thursday, with the European Space Agency warning next week could break continental records.

Forecasters are warning the all-time temperature record of 48.8C, which was set in Italy in August 2021, could be threatened with the mercury set to reach those heights once again on the Italian islands of Sicily and Sardinia. 

'Italy, Spain, France, Germany and Poland are all facing a major heatwave with temperatures expected to climb to 48 Celsius on the islands of Sicily and Sardinia - potentially the hottest temperatures ever recorded in Europe,' it said. 

Meanwhile in Britain, temperatures are expected to cool through to the weekend. Cerberus is not expected to have any effect on the UK, and the Met Office does not anticipate a heatwave will reach the UK this summer.

Health ministry officials have issued red alert warnings for ten major cities in Italy, including Florence and Rome. A red alert warning means that the heat is so intense that it poses a health risk to the whole population - not just vulnerable groups like the elderly and very young children.

'Heat is a silent killer. So this is the main concern that people's lives are at risk,' said climate scientist Hannah Cloke, a professor at England's Reading University.

'Certainly, we should immediately stop pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,' Cloke added, warning that some changes to the climate were already locked in.

On Tuesday, the unrelenting heatwave - set to last for two weeks - claimed its first life after a 44-year-old road sign worker collapsed due to the heat in the Italian city of Lodi, southeast Milan, as temperatures soared to above 40C. The man, who has not been named, later died in hospital.

'We are facing an unbearable heatwave,' Italian politician Nicola Fratoianni said. 'Dying from the heat is unthinkable - we should be taking measures to avoid tragedies like this in the hottest hours of the day.' 

Italian authorities have now urged people not to drink alcohol or travel unnecessarily to reduce risk.

British tourists have been struggling with the unrelenting heat this week, with some holidaymakers fainting in Rome as temperatures soared above 40C. 

And the unforgiving heat is set to intensify in the coming days. In the northeastern Spanish city of Zaragoza, temperatures will soar to 46C on Tuesday. 

In Greece and Turkey - popular tourist hotspots for Britons - temperatures are set to rise to a sweltering 45C tomorrow and are unlikely to drop below 40C in many areas for the next week. 

Greece's national weather service EMY on July 10 said a six-day heatwave would grip Greece starting July 12. 

Temperatures are also expected to reach 42C on Saturday in Cyprus.

But Italy is bearing the brunt of the heatwave, with Sicily and Sardinia set to see 48.8C temperatures, according to the BBC. In Rome, temperatures are set to soar to 41C next week.

Carlo Cacciamani, head of Italy's national meteorological and climatology agency, said the unusually hot weather hitting the country is because the Cerberus anticyclone has pushed out a colder weather system from the Azores which usually influences summer weather in Italy. 

'This is happening more frequently and means we see temperatures around 40C instead of the normal 30-31C,' Cacciamani told The Times. 

In Greece, authorities banned access to nature reserves and forests to reduce the risk of wildfires, while municipalities were opening air-conditioned areas in public buildings for people to shelter from the heat.

Sun shades will also be installed in Athens at the Acropolis amid reports of tourists fainting at the popular World Heritage Site. 

The Red Cross will also be on site handing out free water to visitors after crowds sweltered in the heat as they queued up to visit the Parthenon, part of the ancient citadel known as the Acropolis.

Union representatives for staff working at the site have argued they should be paid more for working in the sweltering conditions, as Greece's culture minister, Linda Mendoni, vowed to introduce special precautionary measures to protect tourists.

Scientists have relentlessly warned of the damaging effects of climate change. As well as withering crops, melting glaciers and raising the risk of wildfires, higher-than-normal temperatures also cause health problems ranging from heatstroke and dehydration to cardiovascular stress.

Why is the Cerberus anticyclone causing temperatures to soar in Europe? 

An anticyclone named Cerberus is causing temperatures to exceed 40C across much of the Mediterranean this week.

The anticyclone - a high pressure weather system - began in the Sahara desert before expanding into Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. 

Cerberus then expanded northwards towards southern Europe where it is bringing sweltering temperatures.



'How many more summers will we have to go through before we begin to convince ourselves of the fact that the rise in temperatures may not be a sporadic extraordinary event at all, but rather an irreversible process that has in fact already begun,' Italian immunologist Mauro Minelli told the Leggo newspaper. 

The Red Cross has urged people to check on the most vulnerable during the high temperatures, such as children and older people. 

It also called on people to stay hydrated and to watch for signs of heatstroke, which can include vomiting and fainting.

Meanwhile, Greece's agriculture ministry issued restrictions on the transportation and working hours of animals such as horses and donkeys offering rides in tourist areas during the heat wave. 

Working animals won't be allowed to work between noon and 5pm on days where temperatures are between 35-39C in the shade, while they won't be allowed to work at any time of the day when temperatures exceed that range.

Scientists have said climate change combined with the emergence this year of the El Nino weather pattern, which warms the surface waters in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean, have fuelled record-breaking temperatures. 

'The world just had the hottest week on record, according to preliminary data,' the WMO said in a statement, after climate change and the early stages of the El Nino weather pattern drove the warmest June on record. 

This year has already seen a drought in Spain and fierce heatwaves in China as well the United States.

Temperatures are breaking records both on land and in the oceans, with 'potentially devastating impacts on ecosystems and the environment', the WMO said.

'We are in uncharted territory and we can expect more records to fall as El Nino develops further and these impacts will extend into 2024,' said Christopher Hewitt, WMO Director of Climate Services. 'This is worrying news for the planet.'

El Nino is a naturally occurring pattern that drives increased heat worldwide, as well as drought in some parts of the world and heavy rains elsewhere. 

Europe is fastest warming continent on planet, experts say

Europe's climate monitoring service Copernicus has revealed that last week was likely to be the hottest since records began in 1940. 

And scientists at Copernicus have warned that Europe has been warming twice as much as the global average since the 1980s, with far-reaching impacts on the continent's ecosystems and socio-economic fabric. 

Last summer was marked by extreme heat, drought and wildfires across Europe - and the rate at which glaciers melted was 'unprecedented', Copernicus said in its report. 

European countries - including Britain, France, Italy, Portugal and Spain - saw their warmest summer on record last year.  

And worryingly Europe was around 2.3C above the pre-industrial average used as a baseline for the Paris Agreement on climate change last year.

UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres has said 'the situation we are witnessing now is the demonstration that climate change is out of control'.

Research published on Monday found that more than 61,000 people died due to the heat during Europe's record-breaking summer last year.

The majority of deaths were in people over the age of 80 and about 63 percent of those who died due to the heat were women, according to the research published in the journal Nature Medicine.

The world has warmed an average of nearly 1.2C since the mid-1800s, unleashing extreme weather including more intense heatwaves, more severe droughts and storms made fiercer by rising seas.

Oceans absorb most of the heat generated by planet-warming gases, causing heatwaves that harm aquatic life, altering weather patterns and disrupting crucial planet-regulating systems.

In June, global sea surface temperatures hit unprecedented levels. Antarctic sea ice reached its lowest extent for the month since satellite observations began, at 17 per cent below average, breaking the previous June record by a substantial margin.

While sea surface temperatures normally recede relatively quickly from annual peaks, this year they stayed high, with scientists warning that this underscores an underappreciated but grave impact of climate change.

'If the oceans are warming considerably, that has a knock-on effect on the atmosphere, on sea ice and ice worldwide,' said Michael Sparrow, chief of World Climate Research Programme at the WMO.

'There's a lot of concerns from the scientific community and a lot of catch-up from the scientific community trying to understand the incredible changes that we're seeing at the moment.'

El Nino is a naturally occurring pattern that drives increased heat worldwide, as well as drought in some parts of the world and heavy rains elsewhere.

But Mr Sparrow said its effects would likely be felt more acutely later in the year. 'El Nino hasn't really got going yet,' he said.

A wolf and two of her three cubs which featured in last night's Planet Earth III were discovered dead just after filming for the series finished.

The show's filmmakers and researchers had achieved a first in managing to film inside the den of the mammals in the Cerrado grassland in Brazil.

But two pups and their mother Nhorinha were later found to have died after drowning in a ditch in nearby farmland, reported the Mirror.

The BBC One documentary showed how the red-coloured wolves have lost half of their habitat to farmers who burn the land to grow crops.

Among these wolves' other distinctive features is their diet of fruit and particularly long legs.

The Cerrado is being destroyed at twice the speed of the Amazon rainforest relative to its size.

Planet Earth III producer and director Kiri Cashell said that the deaths were not isolated incidents as filmmakers discovered from tracking collars that several others had been killed.

She added that the entire population of maned wolves in the Cerrado could be wiped out in just thirty years, a scenario which Sir David Attenborough explained on the programme could collapse the whole ecosystem.

Conservationists remain hopeful that a solution can be found to save the habitat.

Scientists say gases we exhale simply by BREATHING contribute to 0.013% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions

Whether it's eating less meat or cycling instead of driving, humans can do many things to help prevent climate change.

Unfortunately, breathing less isn't one of them. 

That might be a problem, as a new study claims the gases in air exhaled from human lungs may contribute in a small way to global warming.

Methane and nitrous oxide in the air we exhale makes up to 0.013 per cent of the UK's total greenhouse gas emissions, scientists say. 

And that's not even accounting for the gas we release from burps and farts, or emissions that come from our skin without us noticing. 

Whether it's eating less meat or cycling instead of driving, humans can do many things to help prevent climate change. Unfortunately, breathing less isn't one of them (stock image) 

Composition of exhaled human breath 

- Nitrogen (N) - 78%

- Oxygen (O2)* - 17%

- Carbon dioxide (CO2) - 4%

- Other gases including methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) - 1%

*Exhaled human breath contains oxygen, but just less oxygen than the air we inhaled

The new study was led by Dr Nicholas Cowan, an atmospheric physicist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Edinburgh. 

'Exhaled human breath can contain small, elevated concentrations of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), both of which contribute to global warming,' Dr Cowan and colleagues say. 

'We would urge caution in the assumption that emissions from humans are negligible.'

As most of us remember from science classes at school, humans breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. 

When we inhale, air enters the lungs, and oxygen from that air moves to the blood, while carbon dioxide (CO2), a waste gas, moves from the blood to the lungs and is breathed out. 

With plants, it is the other way round; plants use CO2 to create oxygen as a by-product (the process known as photosynthesis). 

Every person breathes out CO2 when they exhale, but in their new study, the researchers focused on methane and nitrous oxide.

These two are both powerful greenhouse gases, but because they're breathed out in much smaller quantities, their contribution to global warming may have been overlooked.

Potential causes of death due to climate change include flooding, extreme weather, wildfires. Pictured, a bushfire in Australia 

What's more, plants essentially soak up all the CO2 that's emitted in human breath, so 'CO2 contribution in human breath to climate change is essentially zero,' Dr Cowan told MailOnline. 

The same cannot be said for methane and nitrous oxide, as plants don't use these gases in photosynthesis. 

For the study, the researchers investigated emissions of methane and nitrous oxide in human breath from 104 adult volunteers from the UK population.

Participants were required to take in a deep breath and hold it for five seconds, then exhale into a sealable plastic bag.

A total of 328 breath samples were collected and every participant had details recorded such as age, sex and dietary preference. 

After analysing the samples, researchers found nitrous oxide was emitted by every participant, but methane was found in the breath of only 31 per cent of participants.

Researchers say those who do not exhale methane in their breath are still likely to 'release the gas in flatus' - in other words, by farting. 

Interestingly, people with methane in their exhaled breath were more likely to be female and above the age of 30, but researchers aren't sure why. 

Concentrations of the two gases in the overall samples let the researchers estimate the proportion of the UK's emissions are from our breath - 0.05 per cent for methane and 0.1 per cent for nitrous oxide.

Dr Cowan stresses that each of these percentages relate specifically to these respective gases, not all of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions as a whole. 

Researchers didn't manage to find any link between gases in the breath and diets - although meat eaters are known to fuel the climate crisis in other ways. 

The experts stress that their study only looked at greenhouse gases in breath, and so it does not provide an overall estimate of a person's emissions footprint. 

In experiments, all participants breathed out carbon dioxide (left). Nitrous oxide (right) was also emitted by every participant, but methane (centre) was found in the breath of only 31 per cent of participants

According to the authors, emissions of methane and nitrous oxide are 'generally ignored in most environmental monitoring' as they're considered negligible. 

However, further study of human emissions of these gases - not just from our breath - could reveal more about 'the impacts of an ageing population and shifting diets,' the team say.

Inside the human body, methane gas is produced by microorganisms called methanogens, which colonise our digestive tract.

The methane crosses into the blood and is carried to the lungs where it can be exhaled in breath.

Meanwhile, bacteria in the gut and oral cavity turns nitrates in food and water to nitrous oxide, which also escapes in human breath. 

The study has been published in the journal PLOS One. 

How do greenhouse gases like methane and CO2 warm up the planet?

Methane is a colourless, odourless flammable gas, and the main constituent of natural gas.

Methane is a greenhouse gas, and the second biggest cause of climate change after carbon dioxide.

Both gases trap heat in the atmosphere, similar to the glass roof of a greenhouse.

During the day, the sun shines through the atmosphere and Earth's surface warms up in the sunlight.

At night, the Earth's surface cools, releasing heat back into the air, but some of the heat is trapped by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

Too much of these gases can cause Earth's atmosphere to trap more and more heat, causing the planet to warm up.

Methane has more than 80 times the heat-trapping potency of carbon dioxide over the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere.

However this does decrease over time, as it breaks down over the course of about a decade.

It is emitted during the production and transport of coal, natural gas and oil, as well as from livestock and decaying organic waste at landfill sites.

Bloodthirsty vampire bats have been spotted just 30 miles outside of Texas and scientists fear the rabies-riddled creatures will invade the US in the next five years

Swarms of tiny, bloodthirsty vampire bats are spreading their wings further northward toward the US-Mexican border. 

Scientists led by a team at Virginia Tech have said they expect an 'invasion of vampire bats to US soil between five and 20 years in the future,' with sightings now just 30 miles outside Texas.

Colonies of the two-inch-long creatures have long plagued cattle ranches south of the border, parasitically extracting blood from livestock. 

The bats cost Mexican ranchers over $46.7 million per year due to the deaths of rabies-infected animals, according to a 2020 report by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Researchers believe warming temperatures make North America more hospitable to the bloodthirsty creatures.

Past reports by the USDA estimate that the entry of vampire bats into south Texas could drain between $7 to $9 million out of the local livestock industry in terms of rabies deaths alone. 

But the bats could also cost lives as rabies-infected specimens climb up the continent, spreading the fatal disease.

'It's a difficult situation that we'd like to address as soon as possible, so vigilance is crucial,' a spokesperson for the Texas Farm Bureau, Gary Joiner, told Wired.

'This bat species causes a lot of concern in agriculture due to its ability to transmit diseases, injure livestock, and cause infections,' Joiner said. 

'Rabies is the most obvious issue because of livestock welfare and potential to infect humans.' 

While human deaths from rabies are currently rare in the United States, killing only one to three people a year according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), those deaths are increasingly caused by infected bats. 

Although vampire bats rarely bite people, the creatures will strike when threatened, and their expanding habitat means more chances of hostile interactions.

According to Luis Escobar, an assistant professor of wildlife conservation at Virginia Tech who has tracked the bats' advancement northward, efforts to vaccinate the bats themselves from rabies could backfire. 

'Rabies can reduce populations of bats from 10 to 80 percent,' Escobar said. 'Imagine if we had too many vampire bats because we didn't have this virus.'

A 79-square-mile area of Los Angeles County has been put under quarantine after 20 invasive fruit flies from China were detected in one neighborhood. 

Some wildlife managers have experimented with a rabies vaccine gel that wild-caught bats then distribute themselves back at their roosts, where the social species groom one another.

But Escobar worries that the technique risks exploding vampire bat populations.

'We don't know what the ecological effects of disrupting the circulation of this virus in bats are going to be,' he said.

Instead, researchers, as well as USDA representatives, suggest ranchers might want to follow the lead of their Mexican and Colombian counterparts and vaccinate their livestock and pets. 

And local governments may want to vaccinate wild animals that vampire bats prey on.

'Landowners will want to consider whether or not to vaccinate their animals,' said Mike Bodenchuk, director of the USDA's Wildlife Services division in Texas, while trying to tamp down exaggerated fears. 

'They're not going to come across the border by the millions,' he noted. 'It's going to be a slow trickle for a while.' 

This vampire bat species, Desmodus rotundus, tends to thrive in hot and humid regions where temperatures don't fall below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Late last month, Escobar at Virginia Tech and a team of international conservation scientists published the results of their examination of 120 years of climate records, seasonal vampire bat captures, and other data, like cattle rabies deaths logged by the Regional Information System for the Epidemiological Surveillance of Rabies.

The researchers found that the bat's 'geographic range has significantly shifted its distribution northward,' as they wrote in the journal Ecography, 'a natural invasion into northern Mexico at an average rate of 9.76 km per year [6.06 miles per year].' 

Escobar and his coauthors added that their large database analysis matches prior work that used DNA evidence to chart the bat migrations. 

'Genetic assessments have demonstrated that D. rotundus from Mexico is expanding its range northward rapidly,' they noted. '[but] disagreements between previous modeling efforts have shown that further study is still warranted.'

Fed up San Francisco residents are now lining sidewalks with barricades and 2,000lb planters made from steel tanks to feed livestock to prevent homeless people from setting up encampments

A group of fed-up San Francisco residents cobbled together $25,000 to buy garden planters, typically used to feed livestock, to line streets in the city's troubled Mission District in order deter homeless people from setting up camps there. 

The use of the planters was first reported in mid-June and now those behind the installation say that they are seeing mixed-results in Democrat-run city, reports the San Francisco Standard. 

Many said that the planters are merely just moving people along and that homeless camps spring up where the planters end. 

The move to install 29 steel tubs came after residents began to complain about homeless people setting fires on the streets around Van Ness Avenue. 

Recent statistics show that there are around 4,000 people sleeping rough on the streets of the City by the Bay. City officials are still working to expand the capacity of homeless shelters.

Many said that the planters are merely just moving people along and that homeless camps spring up where the planters end

One of those who was sleeping in the area where the planters were installed told the Standard that she is on the waiting list for a shelter that will take her and her two dogs.

Linda Vasquez, who says that she became homeless in the June 2023 after being evicted from her apartment, told the website: 'I understand if they get mad or upset. I make a mess, but I clean up. If you want me to go inside somewhere, then find me a place.'

While a person who lives in a home on Van Ness Avenue said that the planters did their job in moving people off of his block. 

'There are a lot of menacing-looking people wandering around. The chances of something happening are probably low. ""¦ But it's just, what if?,' John Yandell said. 

The owner of SF Planters, Cody Cunnington, said that he originally started his business to cater for those seeking use to the steel drums in their yards but now works with communities seeking to deter homeless people. 

Cunnington said that planters are typically installed just after the city performs cleaning on a specific street. Planters have been seen in the downtown section of the city. 

'The demand has been so high,' Cunnington said. His large planters sell for $750. 

In June, around 50 Mission District residents raised the money needed for 40 of the planters, reported ABC San Francisco. 

'I figure there's 40 of these tubs out here with plants, the effort and the energy has got to make the world a better place.. Everybody has to have a place to live, but personally I don't believe the street or sidewalk is a place to live,' resident Ron Poznicek told the station. 



A study released in June from the University of California, San Francisco found that the majority of homeless people in the state were struggling with poor health, trauma and deep poverty before they lose their housing

A homeless activist, Jennifer Freidenbach, who works with Coalition on Homelessness, told ABC that she would prefer to see residents put their energy into fighting for more available housing rather than planters.

A homeless person however, named Travis, told the station: 'People are tired of the camping out situation. It's a blight on the city. People don't want to see it going home every day.' 

In the Clinton Park section of the city, boulders were installed in 2022 to deter homeless people from gathering. 

A GoFundMe page that has been set up by Harrison Street residents in order to pay for the planters makes no reference to the fact that they will be used to deter homeless people.  

The page describes the plan as a 'beautification project.' 

Homelessness is a national crisis, and all too pervasive in California, where an estimated 171,000 people ""” or 30 percent of all homeless people in the U.S. ""” are homeless. 

Political leaders are divided over how to address the crisis, with some, including Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, favoring tent encampment sweeps and a tough-love approach toward those with mental health and addiction issues. 

'People are homeless because their rent is too high. And their options are too few. And they have no cushion,' said Dr. Margot Kushel, lead investigator and director of UCSF's Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative. 

'And it really makes you wonder how different things would look if we could solve that underlying problem.' 

A study released in June from the University of California, San Francisco found that the majority of homeless people in the state were struggling with poor health, trauma and deep poverty before they lose their housing.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom revealed details of his plan to borrow $4.6 billion for 10,000 new treatment beds in June

That plan would include an overhaul of a voter-approved law from 2004 that imposed a tax on millionaires to fund mental health services

Also in June, Newsom revealed details of his plan to borrow $4.6 billion for 10,000 new treatment beds as well as community-based housing for people with severe mental health and substance use disorders. 

That plan would include an overhaul of a voter-approved law from 2004 that imposed a tax on millionaires to fund mental health services. 

Dr. Mark Ghaly, secretary of the state's health and human services agency, said he hopes the expansion will fill a critical need in services.

But Dr. Kushel, the study's lead investigator, said most people who are homeless and struggling with behavioral health impairments do not require intensive, in-patient treatment. Rather, she said, they need housing paired with 'really robust services' and she hopes the state gets the balance right.

'The root of the problem is housing, and if we want people to recover, to heal, it's really impossible to do that when they're homeless,' she said.

Newsom's plan must first pass the state Legislature this year. If it does, it would go to voters in March 2024.

River Wye slapped with health status downgrade amid heavy pollution

The River Wye's health status has been downgraded after experiencing declines of important species due to pollution from intensive farming.

Conservationists are concerned at Natural England's updated status of unfavourable-declining and said without urgent help and appropriate management, the river will never achieve a favourable or recovering condition.

Classified as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, the Wye begins in Wales and runs along the border with England to the Severn Estuary.

It is home to numerous intensive chicken units and livestock farms on either side of the border which, combined with sewage pollution, has caused phosphate-fuelled algal blooms, The Wildlife Trusts said.

Algal blooms consume so much oxygen in the river that other forms of life struggle to survive.

Natural England last assessed the Wye and its tributary the River Lugg in 2010 and on seven units of assessment found one to be favourable, with the rest unfavourable-recovering.

It said that because of the decline in salmon and crayfish all assessment units must now be ranked as unfavourable-declining.

Joan Edwards, director of public affairs at The Wildlife Trusts, said: 'That the Wye is in even worse condition now will come as no surprise to the people that love and live near it.

'But this new admission represents a shocking failure by the agencies and authorities in Wales and England that are supposed to protect this once beautiful river.

'Wider research shows that farm pollution is the main cause of its decline - that's why the authorities must enforce the law wherever the causes of pollution are clear.

'It's time to prevent more chicken sheds from being built and ensure that all farmers are rewarded for nature-friendly, cleaner food production methods.'

The group is calling for a moratorium on any new extended intensive livestock production units in the Wye catchment, publication of all water data held by Natural Resources Wales, the Environment Agency and local authorities, and for farmers working more sustainably to reduce pollution to be rewarded.

Jamie Audsley, chief executive of Herefordshire Wildlife Trust, said: 'Current approaches have failed to keep the River Wye in a healthy condition.

'What we now need to see is a cross-government plan to bring the Wye back into a favourable condition.

'The Wye should be a river where salmon and otters thrive and people can safely swim.

'The plan will need to involve governments, regulators, farm businesses and others, and ensure a consistent approach across England and Wales.'

Environment Secretary Therese Coffey met with farmers, conservationists and local officials in the Wye catchment on Tuesday to discuss the pollution.

She said she wants to double the funding available for slurry infrastructure and for a scheme offering one-to-one advice to farmers on how to reduce water and air pollution, as well as grow the Environment Agency's agricultural regulation workforce and pay farmers to work sustainably.

After chairing a roundtable discussion, she said: 'The River Wye is clearly struggling and it is vital that we turn the tide on its decline.

'As I set out in our Plan for Water, we need local plans catchment by catchment, community by community, to tackle issues that are affecting water quality.

'Bringing people together from the local communities, it is clear we have a common goal.

'We do all need to work together at a greater pace and with purpose to actively support our farmers and food producers to produce food sustainably and reduce pollution.

'With the River Wye rising in Wales, it is important to work with the Welsh Government on this issue and I welcome them joining my roundtable today.'

A farmer has shown the simple but little-known way to tell if a watermelon is ripe before buying it. 

The hack resurfaced on Facebook after a woman met the watermelon farmer who spilled the secret. 

He said the key is to check the space between the dark green and light green lines on the rind of the fruit using two fingers.

'I asked him what was the secret to finding a good watermelon, he said to make sure the dark green lines are two fingers width APART,' the online post read.

The woman decided to put the theory to the test after purchasing a whole watermelon - and it worked. 

A farmer revealed how to tell if a watermelon is ripe. He said to ensure the the dark green lines are two fingers width apart (pictured)

'When we got watermelons yesterday, I put that to the test and cut the watermelon up. IT WAS DELICIOUS,' the post continued. 

'Glad to know a simple way of finding a good watermelon. I thought I'd pass the info along to our friends!!'

Another common way to tell if a watermelon is ripe is the slap it on the side and check if a deep 'hollow' sound is heard. 

The post shared to the Delicious Recipes Facebook page was liked more than 8,800 times and received hundreds of comments as well as 3,000 shares. 

A second image shared online showed just how ripe the watermelon was. The 'mind blowing' tip resurfaced on Facebook earlier this week and was liked more than 8,800 times

Many thanked the woman for sharing what she learnt and others said they 'always struggle picking a good watermelon'. 

'Awesome! I will test it!' one person wrote, another said: 'I will definitely remember this when purchasing for my husband.' 

Another added: 'Good to know!' 

A fourth who tried the trick confirmed it worked and wrote: 'We got the best watermelon Friday from using the two finger rule!!'

Watermelon is high in vitamins A and C, and can provide an array of health benefits such as a hydration boost.

Last year the reason as to why Red Tip bananas contain wax at the end of the fruit was revealed.

The red wax indicates the bananas are grown using the Ecoganic farming method without the use of harsh chemicals and supposedly reducing the impact on the environment.

The revelation has come as a surprise for many, with research showing that while 85 per cent of Australians are aware of red tip bananas, only four per cent know what the red wax indicates.

Last year the reason as to why Red Tip bananas contain wax at the end of the fruit was revealed. The red wax on Red Tip bananas indicate the fruit are grown using the 'Ecoganic farming' method without the use of harsh chemicals while also reducing the impact on the environment

The Ecoganic farming method established in 1998 by Frank and Dianne Sciacca, uses the natural ecosystem to sustainably grow sweet and creamy bananas.

'When you see the red wax tip on bananas, you can know that they have been farmed in harmony with nature. Nature has developed over hundreds of thousands of years to keep things in balance,' Frank said.

'Rather than rely on chemicals, we choose to harness everything nature gives us to grow our bananas slowly and with respect,' Frank continued. 

'This respect shows up in the product and you can taste the difference.'

Traditional farming uses chemicals that sterilise the soil and kill insects, which then leaves the crop dependent on synthetic fertilisers for its source of nutrition. 

What is Ecoganic farming?

'Ecoganic' is a natural, holistic, sustainable approach to farming that protects the environment and creates healthier, better tasting produce, without relying on chemicals

'Ecoganic farming' is an ecological production and management system that enhances biodiversity, biological cycles and activity, and ecosystem balance through reduced farming inputs that are continuously monitored

The vision 'farms with nature' and respects the importance of the environment 

This way to farming results in healthier product that doesn't damage the soil

Keir Starmer is accused of 'old-school Labour raid on aspiration' amid claims he is poised to close inheritance tax loopholes to raise £4bn for spending splurge - while Tories look at slashing death duties

Keir Starmer was accused of an 'old-school Labour raid on aspiration' today amid claims he is poised to target inheritance tax to raise £4billion for a spending splurge.

Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves is looking at building a warchest for an incoming Starmer government by closing tax 'loopholes'.  

Options being examined include ending the IHT exemption for agricultural land, and curbing reliefs on shares in unlisted businesses.

But the move could open a clear dividing line with the Tories amid speculation that Rishi Sunak will pledge to cut or even abolish IHT in his election manifesto.

Labour is holding off announcing its proposals until much closer to a poll, amid fears that ministers would either steal or find ways of attacking them.

Questions are increasingly being raised about Sir Keir's plans for government, with polls consistently showing a double-digit lead for his party.

The IFS estimates that IHT revenues will surge far more than thought as a proportion of GDP 

The revenue raised by IHT has been rising sharply over recent years

The number of estates that end up paying IHT vary hugely across the country, as this IFS chart shows

But shadow frontbenchers have been shying away from fleshing out ideas, insisting that the dire state of the Treasury's finances mean there is limited room for manoeuvre.

Sir Keir has used the tough fiscal landscape as cover to drop previous flagship pledges such as scrapping tuition fees. 

Tony Blair has urged Labour not to get carried away with big 'tax and spend' commitments.  

The mooted tweaks to IHT, together with scrapping or reducing relief on people selling business assets, would be expected to bring in more than £4billion. 

'Rachel's team has built up a war chest of money that can be found by closing down some of the existing loopholes in the tax system that overwhelmingly benefit just a tiny number of people,' a source told The Times. 

'The big question is when to deploy it.' 

But a senior Tory source said: 'This looks like an old-school Labour tax raid on aspiration, savings, British farming and small businesses. 

'Despite the Blairite tribute act, Starmer and Reeves are just old tax and spend Labour.' 

Another Tory source added: 'With a war in Europe and food security at the front of everyone's minds, launching a tax raid on family farms is beyond stupid.

'Labour should park the class war and back British farming.'

Inheritance tax is charged at 40 per cent on estates worth more than £325,000, with an extra £175,000 allowance towards a main residence if it is passed on to children or grandchildren. 

A married couple can share their allowance, meaning most parents can pass on £1million to their children without any tax being paid. The figures for the last tax year show just 3.73 per cent of UK deaths resulted in an inheritance tax charge. 

However, around a third of people believe that their estate will pass the threshold.

Much of the inheritable wealth in London comes through housing 

This IFS chart shows how changes to the treatment of IHT could radically increase how much it brings in for the Treasury  

And the revenue raised by IHT has been rising sharply over recent years. 

A report this week estimated that the annual amount brought in by IHT will go from £7billion to £15billion over the next decade.

As each generation amasses more wealth, those who inherit will have to pay more to the Treasury, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said.

The number of people affected by the tax will also grow.

In a decade, one in eight (12 per cent) are set to have inheritance tax due when either they or their partner dies.

The research suggested that the growth in the size of inheritances will be much stronger than official forecasts suggest, increasing the tax take for the Government.

There is a dramatic variation between different parts of the country. Nearly a quarter of people (23 per cent) in London are in line to pay the tax in a decade - twice the national average and five times higher than in the North East.

The IFS found the wealthiest 1 per cent of society - those with estates of £2.1million or more - would get half the benefit of scrapping inheritance tax, saving them £1million on average.

Next year, the wealthiest fifth of parents will bequeath an average of £380,000 per child, and pay inheritance tax of around 10 per cent of this amount. By contrast, the least wealthy fifth of parents will leave less than £2,000 per child.

The report also found a huge difference in wealth. By the age of 50 to 54, children of the richest fifth of parents have accumulated an average of £830,000, while children of the least wealthy fifth only have an average of £180,000, it said.

There are claims that Downing Street is considering announcing an intention of reducing or even scrapping the duty, potentially for inclusion in the next election manifesto. 

In a poll answered by 3,203 This is Money readers, 48 per cent supported abolishing inheritance tax, while 28 per cent said the threshold should be raised and 12 per cent supported cutting the rate. Just 2 per cent said it was fair and should be left alone. 

Neil Davy, of campaign group Family Business UK, said: 'Business property relief - now known as business relief - was specifically designed to facilitate the handing of a family business from one generation to the next without creating a significant inheritance tax charge.

'It is gives business owners the confidence to invest and plan for their businesses to continue trading and providing employment after their death.'

He said that without BPR, many family businesses would need to be 'sold, liquidated or broken up in order to raise the necessary cash to pay the charge'.

This would have clear knock-on effects on jobs and investment, he added.

Questions are increasingly being raised about Sir Keir's plans for government, with polls consistently showing a double-digit lead for his party

The cost of vegetables for Christmas dinner has soared by up to 60 per cent in one year with carrots, potatoes, parsnips and brussels sprouts all hit by soaring inflation.

Prices have risen by an average of 7 per cent over the past year across 208 lines of parsnips, carrots, potatoes and brussels sprouts at Aldi, Lidl, Co-op and Waitrose.

Data from retail research firm Assosia revealed annual price rises of at least 10 per cent on more than a third of products, while 24 increased by more than 20 per cent.

The analysis of supermarket prices revealed in trade journal The Grocer also found the cost of some vegetables had risen by more than a tenth in just the past month.

Soaring production costs and poor weather affecting growing conditions were said to be partly behind the increases, as well as low supermarket returns for many crops.

It comes amid concerns over shortages with one expert warning empty supermarket shelves could become 'business as usual' and the 'new normal' for shoppers.

Meanwhile, separate data by consumer group Which? found a family should expect to pay anywhere between £33.80 at Aldi and £52.68 at Waitrose for Christmas dinner this year, after experts examined the prices of 12 popular festive foods. 

Further data from Interactive Investor found the cost of Christmas dinner with turkey, all the trimmings and a few extras will be 11 per cent higher than last year - up to £89.05 this year from £80.11 last December. The figure in 2021 was £69.22. 



As for the figures in The Grocer, the biggest rise across all winter vegetables was Sainsbury's Taste the Difference New Potatoes line, which went up by 60 per cent in a year from £1.85/kg to £2.95/kg. Sainsbury's told MailOnline that the product is no longer available, although it is still listed on their website albeit 'out of stock'.

Carrots made up the next highest rises were in carrots - with Tesco's own label loose carrots up from 7p to 10p per item, an increase of 43 per cent.

Asda Crunchy and Sweet Carrots (500g) rose by 40 per cent from 25p to 35p; while Aldi's Nature's Pick Carrots (500g) increased by 38 per cent from 24p to 33p.

Meanwhile Tesco red potatoes (2.5kg) went up by 37 per cent from £1.35 to £1.85, and Asda's British Fluffy and Golden Baking Potatoes increased by 36 per cent from £1.25 to £1.70.

Other big risers were Asda Creamy & Flavoursome Sweet Potatoes by 35 per cent from 89p to £1.20; and Tesco Carrots (both 1kg) by 33 per cent from 45p to 60p.

Completing the top ten were Sainsbury's Carrots and Aldi Nature's Pick Carrots (both 1kg), which also both increased by 33 per cent from 45p to 60p.

The research also looked at prices that have risen significantly in the past month - including Lidl's Oaklands Chantenay Carrots (500g) which have gone up by 38 per cent from 45p to 62p.

Others included Sainsbury's Carrots (500g), the retailer's Stamford Street Co carrots (1kg), Waitrose Essential Carrots and Co-op Loose Carrots which have all gone up by 25 per cent since the end of October.

The data follows research out last week that showed UK families are paying £605 more for their food than they did two years ago.

Experts from the universities of Bournemouth, Exeter and Sheffield said climate change was the main reason for the high prices.

They said rising costs due to extreme weather had kept food inflation high throughout 2022 and 2023 even as energy prices decreased.

Recent flooding in the UK left cereal, potato and other crops rotting underwater, farmers have said, while extreme heat and drought in Spain has damaged olive harvests and pushed up the price of olive oil by around 50 per cent.

Other staple products such as sugar, rice and tomatoes have been impacted by extreme weather, with food inflation rising to around 20 per cent this spring.

Last month, data from Kantar showed grocery price inflation had fallen to single digits for the first time in 16 months.

Prices across grocers were 9.7 per cent higher than a year ago over the four weeks to October 29, down from the previous month's 11 per cent, the analysts said.

It was the eighth consecutive decline in the rate of price rises since the figure peaked at 17.5 per cent in March, and the first time the figure had fallen below 10 per cent since July last year.

However, despite the milestone, consumers are only seeing year-on-year price falls in a limited number of categories, including butter, dried pasta and milk, according to its data.

Last week, Lea Valley Growers Association secretary Lee Stiles warned empty shelves would 'seem to be the new business as usual for UK supermarkets'.

Tim O'Malley, managing director of Nationwide Produce, told The Grocer last month that potato supplies were falling and prices were rising due to flooding.

A Waitrose spokeswoman told MailOnline today: 'While no supplier is immune to inflation, we're working hard to keep prices low - without compromising on taste and quality, or support for British famers. 

'We've also got options for every budget, for example, our Essential frozen British brussels sprouts cost just 70p.'

Christmas dinner in crisis? Warning shortages of broccoli and cauliflower could leave Brits without festive veg after unprecedented wet weather

Britons are being warned they could be left without their favourite Christmas vegetables because of broccoli and cauliflower shortages. 

Relentless wet weather and storms in October have been blamed for flooding farms, delaying causing huge crop losses and delaying the harvesting process.

Experts say Britons could be faced with empty shelves in time for the festive period after a tough few weeks. 

'There won't be enough broccoli to supply the Christmas dinner demand,' Lincolnshire farmer Martin Tate, who manages some 18,000 acres of land, told LBC. 

'Cauliflower is still a problem, and you can expect to see empty trays over the next few weeks.'

Meanwhile there have also been warnings that the size of Brussels sprouts could be smaller too.  

Chris Gedney, CEO of T H Clements, one of the country's largest suppliers of Brussels sprouts with 11,000 acres in Lincolnshire and 1,000 in Cornwall said the larger ones tend to fall in the water and rot during downpours.

Fred Searle, editor of Fresh Produce Journal, warned the shortage could even continue for months beyond Christmas.

He said the British potato harvest has been hit hard by heavy rain and flooding this autumn which has led to large losses of crops. 

Cornish farmer Philip Pryor produces around 15 tonnes of potatoes every year across nearly 1300 acres - but he also said recent wet conditions have made it challenging to get crops out of the ground. 

'Obviously we are sifting the potatoes out of the soil and when it's wet the soil just doesn't separate the same,' he told BBC Radio 4's Farming Today podcast. 

'The level of earth is still stuck to the potato. These potatoes will not store very well, we've got to get rid of these now, we have no choice.'

The potatoes should be harvested and stored by now, but soggy conditions have prevented that. 

The potato rainfall comes after one of the wettest ever July months, as well as an August and October full of rainfall this year.

The National Farming Union said the weather is increasingly causing issues with more investment needed in water management, according to the BBC. 

It comes after it was revealed that the cost of vegetables for Christmas dinner has soared by up to 60 per cent in one year with carrots, potatoes, parsnips and brussels sprouts all hit by soaring inflation.

Prices have risen by an average of seven per cent over the past year across 208 lines of parsnips, carrots, potatoes and brussels sprouts at Aldi, Lidl, Co-op and Waitrose.

Data from retail research firm Assosia revealed annual price rises of at least 10 per cent on more than a third of products, while 24 increased by more than 20 per cent.

The analysis of supermarket prices revealed in trade journal The Grocer also found the cost of some vegetables had risen by more than a tenth in just the past month.



Soaring production costs and poor weather affecting growing conditions were said to be partly behind the increases, as well as low supermarket returns for many crops.

A Waitrose spokeswoman told MailOnline: 'While no supplier is immune to inflation, we're working hard to keep prices low - without compromising on taste and quality, or support for British famers. 

'We've also got options for every budget, for example, our Essential frozen British brussels sprouts cost just 70p.'

Officials in Texas have issued mandatory evacuation orders and urged people to flee their homes after a 1,200 acre wildfire broke out on Friday. 

The major fire, which covered an area of 900 football fields on Friday night, has been named the Game Preserve Fire and originally erupted on Friday afternoon in Walker County, Texas, in a wooded area along Lost Indian Camp Road. 

In the last update issued by officials, they said the fire had engulfed 1,200 acres of land and had been contained by ten percent.  

Just hours previously, the fire was estimated to be spread out across 100 acres, before growing to 500 acres, and then 1,000 acres - prompting officials to ask those living nearby to flee.

Those living on Pinedale Road near the fire have been told they must evacuate their homes, which appear to be mostly ranches.  

It remains unclear at this time as to what caused the fire or if anyone has been injured

The major fire currently covering an area of 900 football fields and started on Friday afternoon 

Crews are monitoring the fire throughout the evening with more crews expected to be on the scene tomorrow 

Images and video shared on social media show thick dark plumes of smoke leeching up into the air as the fire burns. 

Footage taken from the air shows just how large the wildfire has managed to stretch to in such a short time.

Neighbors told Fox26 that homes have been burned and livestock evacuated from the area. 

Local man Andy Walker spoke to ABC13 while in the middle of evacuating on Pinedale Road. 

He said: 'It's spooky. There is ambers and ashes everywhere, if you stop your truck you'll have ashes all over your truck.'

Walker said that he was getting ready to move his cattle and that he was not taking any chances. 

On social media, the Walker County Office of Emergency Management said: 'Our amazing community - please help me have organized chaos, questions about donations and assistance needs to be directed to one place. 

'For your own safety please do not just show up without contacting me. This is a dangerous fire.'

The latest update from the Texas Forest Service said: 'The fire in Walker County is an estimated 1,200 acres and 10% contained. 

'Dozers continue to build containment line. Firefighters will patrol the area tonight. Aviation and additional crews will be on scene tomorrow to assist with response.'

We're on Pinedale Road where mostly everyone has evacuated. A few people we spoke with said they're going to wait to see if things get worse.

An earlier update had said that the behavior of the fire was 'high to extreme'.

In a notice shared on social media the Walker County Office of Emergency Management said: 'Major fire on Lost Indian Camp Road off FM247. 

'FM247 is closed both lanes from Pinedale to FM2989. Evacuation recommended everything within 3 miles of Lost Indian Camp Road. Air attack is dropping water.

It remains unclear at this time as to what caused the fire or if anyone has been injured. 

One local man shared a TikTok of his reaction after first seeing the smoke rising into the sky. 

In the video, the man says: 'No s**t. F***ing full on goddamn wildfire going on right here in Huntsville.

'And we're just sitting back here. I was just driving and I seen smoke everywhere.'

The man then pans his camera around to show thick plumes of smoking lingering in the air above him, some distance from the actual fire which can be seen smoldering in the distance. 

Other footage shared online by Lovelady Volunteer Fire Department shows air teams dropping water on the inferno.

Videos shared by the department also show a number of fire crews driving down one road towards the flames. 

The camera pans around to reveal that the whole wooded area surrounding the road is engulfed in flames.  

According to a statement issued by Governor Greg Abbott, the state is currently experiencing triple-digit temperatures, with more than 98 percent of the state experiencing drought. 

The Walker County government website stated it issued a burn ban all the way back on July 31, which restricts most outdoor ignitions.

The reported burn area is located 83 miles outside of downtown Houston.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott also announced that he had directed the Texas A&M Forest Service to open the Austin Airtanker base at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport to assist in wildfire suppression. 

Governor Abbott said in a statement: 'Texas has activated the Austin Airtanker Base to further assist our brave firefighters and emergency response personnel throughout the state and protect Texans from these wildfires. 

'Additional resources through this airtanker base will provide even greater support to state and local officials as they swiftly respond.

'With triple-digit heat forecasted for this Labor Day weekend, I urge Texans to remain weather-aware and limit any activities that may cause sparks or flames that could lead to accidental fires.' 

The base will serve as a reload station for aircraft coming and going to the wildfires. 

It comes after a summer of hell for wildfires which has saw dozens of people lose their lives on the Hawaiian island of Maui and the east coast of the country being swamped in thick smog from fires in Canada. 

Most recently, fires ran riot over the idyllic island of Maui and have so far claimed the lives of at least 115 people. 

The incident on Maui is the deadliest wildfire in the U.S. in more than a century. 

So far, the names of 50 people have been publicly released and five others have been identified but their identities withheld because next of kin haven´t been reached. The rest have yet to be identified.

In June, more than 120 million Americans were placed under 'very unhealthy' air quality alerts after smoke from fires in Canada made it over the border. 

At one point there was five cities in the US that made up the ten worst places for air quality on Earth.

Is the key to anti-aging in YOUR backyard? Common weed shows promise in early study

An invasive weed common in American backyards could help stave off signs of visible aging, a new study suggests.

The spiky fruit of the cocklebur plant was found to reduce damage caused by UV rays and speed up wound healing in lab studies on human cells.

Extracts from the fruit also appeared to boost the production of collagen, a feature common among many high-end skincare products that promise to preserve skin elasticity and prevent wrinkles.

Cocklebur, or Xanthium strumarium, is native to parts of Europe, Asia, and North America, primarily inhabiting open, often moist places such as river banks in agricultural land and other areas. 

It is used widely in traditional Chinese and Native American medicine to treat a wide range of maladies from stuffy nose and headaches to arthritis and tuberculosis. 

Compounds in cocklebur's spiky fruits reduced damage from UVB exposure - rays that can cause sunburn, darkening and thickening of the outer layer of the skin - and sped up wound healing in laboratory tests using cells and tissues

The seeds of cocklebur fruit contain a chemical called carboxyatractyloside, which can poison and kill livestock when eaten. 

In humans, eating the prickly plant can cause mild symptoms including unpleasant taste and nausea or more severe symptoms like abdominal pain, vomiting, low blood sugar, seizures, and severe liver injury.

Despite the risks that come with ingesting parts of the plant, its fruit and leaves have been fixtures in traditional medicine for a long time.  

The researchers at Myongji University in South Korea said their findings suggest extracts from the fruit could be an attractive ingredient for topical skin creams and other cosmetics.

Eunsu Song, a doctoral candidate at Myongji University who conducted the research said: ""˜We found that cocklebur fruit has the potential to protect the skin and help enhance production of collagen.

""˜It will likely show a synergistic effect if it is mixed with other effective compounds, such as hyaluronic acid or retinoic acid, against ageing.'

TikTok's latest anti-aging hack: users tape their faces to prevent wrinkles 



The latest TikTok beauty hack to go viral involves taping your face to iron out wrinkles. Doctors warn that while it may give immediate results, the wrinkles will return in a few minutes ""” or at best a few hours.

The researchers studied the molecular properties of cocklebur fruit extracts and isolated particular compounds that could provide some antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.

Then they conducted laboratory experiments in cells and on a 3D tissue model with properties similar to human skin to study how these compounds affect collagen production, wound healing and damage from UVB radiation - the type that causes skin aging, sunburns and skin cancers. 

Their findings were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society For Biochemistry And Molecular Biology in Seattle.

Native Americans have traditionally used cocklebur leaves to brew as a tea to help treat a wide range of conditions including kidney diseases, arthritis, and tuberculosis.

The plant was also once used to treat malaria, rabies, and leprosy.

The researchers found that fruits grown in South Korea had slightly higher antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and greater wound-healing activity than those grown in China. And they reinforced the fact that the plant can be deadly to animals and cause some nausea and discomfort in humans.

Ms Song said: ""˜In its burrs, cocklebur fruit also has a toxic constituent, carboxyatractyloside, which can damage the liver.

""˜Cocklebur showed a potential as a cosmetic agent by increasing collagen synthesis; however, it showed negative results with higher concentrations.'

Scientists have warned that a virus dubbed 'Zombie deer disease' could potentially spread to humans after the first-ever case was detected in Yellowstone National Park last month.

The fatal brain virus, which leaves animals confused, drooling, and unafraid of humans may someday infect people, as cautioned by some authorities.

The alarm was raised after a deer carcass tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD) in Yellowstone National Park in northwest Wyoming in November.

Dr. Cory Anderson told The Guardian: 'The BSE (mad cow) outbreak in Britain provided an example of how, overnight, things can get chaotic when a spillover event occurs, say, from livestock to people.'

In recent years, the virus spread to more than 31 US states, two Canadian provinces and even South Korea, according to the US Geological Survey.

The alarm was raised after a deer carcass tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD) in Yellowstone National Park in northwest Wyoming in November 

The infected buck's corpse was tracked down to a peninsula along Yellowstone Lake's southern edge, via a GPS collar outfitted last March for a population dynamics study

'We're talking about the potential of something similar occurring,' said Anderson, the program co-director at the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.

He added: 'No one is saying that it's definitely going to happen, but it's important for people to be prepared.'

According to Anderson, whose study focused on the pathways of CWD transmission, the disease is 'invariably fatal, incurable, and highly contagious,' he said. 

'Baked into the worry is that we don't have an effective easy way to eradicate it, neither from the animals it infects nor the environment it contaminates.' 

CWD is a prion-transmitted disease, similar to 'Mad Cow,' which can cause weight loss, loss of coordination and other eventually fatal neurological symptoms in deer and related species. 

The US National Park Service said last month: 'There is currently no evidence that CWD can infect humans or domestic animal species.' 

But the federal agency cautioned game hunters in particular, 'it is recommended that tissues from CWD-infected animals not be consumed.'

CWD has spread to over 31 US states, two Canadian provinces and South Korea, according to the US Geological Survey 

Samples from the body of the infected mule deer tested positive for CWD over multiple rounds conducted by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department's (WGFD) Wildlife Health Laboratory.

Typical testing of live and dead animals involves sampling a creature's nervous system tissue, either from the central nervous system, like the spinal cord, or peripheral systems, like the retropharyngeal lymph nodes and the tonsils.

Studies have proved that the disease posed a risk to non-human primates including monkeys, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

'These studies raise concerns that there may also be a risk to people,' the agency said. 'Since 1997, the World Health Organization has recommended that it is important to keep the agents of all known prion diseases from entering the human food chain.' 

Park officials at Yellowstone said they are working with WGFD to monitor the park's deer and other hooved species, both dead and alive, to assess better how far CWD has spread through the national park. 

Yellowstone National Park officials said that the discovery has prompted them to revise the park's 2021 CWD surveillance plan ""” with a new protocol version expected sometime next year.

CWD was first detected in mule deer in Wyoming in 1985 along the state's southeastern region 

The disease's arrival in Yellowstone marks the end of a decades-long spread westward across the state, reaching the national park's location in Wyoming's northwest corner

Researchers in Illinois believe that the amount of clay found in soil affects the spread of 'zombie deer disease.' The disease, formally called chronic wasting disease (CWD), causes holes in the brain. According to the Illinois group's study, a high amount of clay in the soil can help stop the illness.

Park spokesperson Morgan Warthin said Yellowstone also plans to increase its collaborative efforts with WGFD to identify which areas of the park are at increased risk from the disease.

CWD was first detected in mule deer in Wyoming in 1985 along the state's southeastern region.

The following year, the fatal brain disease was discovered in Wyoming elk, according to WGFD. 

The disease's arrival in Yellowstone marks the end of a decades-long spread westward across the state, reaching the national park's location in Wyoming's northwest corner.

Wyoming game officials had been tracking the mule deer buck from March 2023 until October 2023, when its GPS tag indicated it had likely died. 

Their search for its body took them to a landmass between the south and southeastern arms of Yellowstone Lake, known as the Promontory.

North of the park, Montana state wildlife regulators are also assisting in the effort and monitoring game caught by their state's local hunters.

A spokesperson for Region 3 of  Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks, Morgan Jacobsen, told the Daily Montanan that many CWD cases have not yet been detected in the state's hunting districts bordering Yellowstone. 

Jacobsen described the news as a 'data point of interest,' but not one that would radically change Montana's own CWD surveillance plans.

'We're going to continue our monitoring and communication with the park and continue to work with hunters as the primary management tool for CWD in Montana,' Jacobsen said.

A wealthy landowner's sons have vowed to fight a court ruling ordering them to share part of a £9million windfall from the sale of their parents' farm with their sister.

Julie Mate, 62, won £652,500 after suing her siblings for a share of the spoils generated from selling their late father's farmland to a property developer.

Their farm on Netherton Moor, near Huddersfield, is in the process of being transformed into 250 homes overlooking the West Yorkshire countryside.

Properties have been marketed by developers Persimmon for up to £370,000.

Ms Mate took her brothers, Andrew and Robert, to court after complaining of being left with 'nowt' when their father Donald died in 1992.

Andrew (left) and Robert Mate (right) were sued by their sister, who wanted a share of the family fortune 

 Julie Mate complained that she and her two sisters - who were each left a £12,000 legacy which was later swapped for a cottage - were snubbed despite years of graft on the family farm 

His property portfolio and land were left to his sons and wife Shirley - who later also gave her share to the boys.

Ms Mate complained that she and her two sisters - who were each left a £12,000 legacy which was later swapped for a cottage - were snubbed despite years of graft.

The mother of two, who lives in Shropshire, did not challenge the will.

But she this month secured a £652,000 payout from her brothers' fortune after a judge found it was her work which saw the value of part of the land rocket from £300,000 to £9million - making them both rich.

Today, Andrew and Robert revealed their intention to appeal - and slammed the suggestion their father left their sisters with nothing.

Robert, 65, who lives in his late father's farmhouse, said: 'She was left a cottage and £21,000. The girls have got all the property from dad and myself built and paid for.

'It's loads of lies but I'm not feeding the story. I'm not interested. I'm saying nothing.'

Andrew, 60, who lives among four acres of land bought after Donald's death, confirmed: 'We are appealing.'

Julie said she had worked alongside her brothers on the land, sacrificing her social and school life to help out as a child, and dreamed of helping to run the farm as an adult.

But she said she was ostracised, with Robert telling her 'you're not coming back' when she left for university, while she says Andrew treated her like 'a silly woman'.

Judge Andrew Sutcliffe KC said the brothers had been 'unjustly enriched' by her years of work in getting the land removed from the green belt so it could be sold to developers to build a 250-home estate and it was right that she should share in the windfall.

The grade II listed farmhouse at Fold Farm in Netherton, West Yorkshire 

The housing development is so large that the estate can be seen from one-and-a-half miles away across the valley.

Persimmon's blurb says of the development: 'For a full range of shops, entertainment and leisure facilities, it's easy to get into Huddersfield from Castle View. It will feel like the best of both worlds living here - village life with the back-up of a busy market town.

'For a change of scenery and a family day out, the Peak District National Park is a short drive directly south of your new home here.'

The court heard that the siblings' parents, Donald and Shirley, now 89, had been partners in a milk bottling and retail business run from Fold Farm in Netherton. 

A 19-home luxury development is currently underway with homes there priced at up to £900,000.

In evidence, Julie told the judge that all five brothers and sisters had worked 'long hours' on the farm as children, feeding livestock, bottling milk and helping out with the milk round.

She said she had wanted to have a full role as an adult, but that Robert and Andrew had made it clear she was not wanted there and, as a result, she did not return and become involved in the business after university.

From her childhood, she did not have a good relationship with the boys, she said, pointing to incidents when a 17-year-old Andrew had driven a Land Rover at her in the farmyard and when Robert, then 23, put his hands around her throat and said 'you're not coming back' - meaning she was not to return to the farm after her studies.

'Although Robert and Andrew denied or did not recall these incidents, I accept that they occurred,' said the judge in his ruling on the case.

Fold Farm in Netherton, near Huddersfield, which was at the centre of the family dispute 

Julie went on to study animal science at university and worked as an agricultural journalist and a senior executive in dairy companies and farming organisations.

She now lives in North Shropshire with her partner Tom Biggins, where she runs a herd of red deer, farming venison for Waitrose and M&S.

When their father died, he left his share of the 140-acre farm to his wife Shirley and the sons, with his daughters - Julie, Gillian Robson and Virginia Boothroyd - sharing only £36,000 between them.

A cottage was later left to the sisters in lieu of the payments because of insufficient funds.

Prior to Donald's death, Julie also received about £21,000 from her parents as a deposit for a flat.

Her sisters were also handed £20,000.

The judge said Julie was unhappy with the terms of the will and felt like it gave the daughters only 'token recognition' for their work.

By the beginning of the 2000s, the farm was beginning to struggle and Julie started to look into ways of making money from the land in order to realise some gains in which 'us girls' could also share, Julie claimed.

She said that, from 2007 at the latest and encouraged by her mother, she had started looking into the potential for redevelopment of 40 acres of farmland, known as Netherton Moor.

She deployed a planning consultant and worked on the project between 2008 and late 2015, claiming she relied on promises made to her by her mother that if she secured its allocation for housing, the proceeds would be shared equally in the family.

Judge Andrew Sutcliffe KC said the brothers had been 'unjustly enriched' by her years of work in getting the land removed from the green belt so it could be sold to developers to build a 250-home estate and it was right that she should share in the windfall

After the land was identified as suitable for housing by the local council in 2012, Julie called her brother Andrew to update him about what was going on.

But it resulted in an angry exchange, during which, in response to her saying she had done the work 'on behalf of the girls,' Andrew asked Julie: 'What's it got to do with you?'

'She described it as 'his typical rant,' which she understood to mean ''push off, you silly woman'',' said the judge.

In 2016, Shirley executed a deed of trust, handing her beneficial interest in the land to her two sons.

In 2020, Julie launched her High Court bid for a share of the spoils, which her mother Shirley did not contest, but her two brothers fiercely fought through a two-week trial last year.

In his ruling, the judge said Julie and her brothers were 'no longer on speaking terms' but had not been friendly even before the court case and there was clear 'animosity' between them.

Julie sued her mother and two brothers, claiming unsuccessfully that she had been promised an equal share of the proceeds of sale if she managed to have the land removed from the Green Belt.

The judge said there was no documentary evidence to show that such promises were in fact made and the first time Julie even mentioned them was in a letter in 2020.

But she also sued for 'unjust enrichment,' claiming that they had benefited hugely from her work and that she never intended to do it 'for nowt.'

Ruling in her favour on that point, the judge said: 'I accept Julie's evidence that at no time did she tell either of her brothers or Shirley that she would work on this project for nothing, without expectation of any reward.

'On the contrary, from the time when the issue was first raised by Julie with Shirley, Andrew and Robert in 2004, Julie was clear that she saw the possibility of developing part of the farm as a way she and her sisters could benefit.

'When the matter was raised again in earnest by Julie in 2008, her separate discussions with all three of them left them in no doubt that she expected to benefit from the sale proceeds if the land was sold for development.

'Shirley, Andrew and Robert obtained the benefit of Julie's services, at Julie's expense, in circumstances where they had notice of the services, they knew that Julie expected a reward for her services, and they could have rejected the benefit, but did not.

'They were enriched by Julie's services in circumstances which were unjust because they knew she was not providing those services gratuitously and they made no attempt to reward her for them.

'In the circumstances, Andrew and Robert have been enriched by Julie's services and such enrichment was unjust.'

The judge awarded Julie a payment of £652,000 from her brothers, representing a 7.5 per cent share of the uplift in value of the land from its original value of £300,000 to the £9m it sold for.

Rise of the super-fungi: Researchers find drug-resistant fungus strains are thriving in even the most remote regions of Earth - and they could be the next pandemic threat

A drug-resistant super fungus capable of making millions sick has been discovered in one of the most remote corners of the earth - raising fears of a widespread disease outbreak.  

Canadian researchers identified a common type of fungus thousands of meters above sea level in a mountainous region in southwest China that had evolved to become resistant to common medicines used to treat infections.

Fungi can become resistant to treatment after extended bouts of exposure to drugs or fungicides used for agricultural practices, though the samples collected in China were far removed from farmlands and human activity. 

As treatment-resistant fungi become more common, experts are worried that they could be the source of the next global pandemic. 

The fact that the fungal samples collected in more remote areas of the valley showed the same level of antifungal resistance as those samples taken from areas where fungicides are more commonly used indicates that a wider spread of harder-to-treat fungi is likely to occur

Lead researcher Jianping Xu, from McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, discovered the drug-resistant strain of Aspergillus fumigatus in the Three Parallel Rivers region in southern China, nestled within the eastern Himalayas. 

The type of fungus is a common mold that releases airborne spores called conidia so readily that humans unknowingly inhale hundreds of them every day without getting sick.

But the discovery of a thriving drug-resistant variation could spell danger for humans, according to Dr Xu, whose work also pertains to pandemic preparedness.

Fungal infections caused by Candida auris are becoming more prevalent in the US and Europe. 

In fact, infections rose more than eightfold in the US from 2017 to 2021, from 171 annual cases to 1,420. The mortality rate for C. auris infection ranges from 30 to 60 percent in people who have weakened immune systems.

Experts fear that an aggressive fungus could be the source of another global pandemic. 

Relatively few species of fungi are believed to cause infections in humans, but with an ever-warming global climate making the environment more hospitable to pathogens and fungicide overuse in agriculture, the threat of fungal disease in humans looms a bit larger. 

The team from McMaster University ventured to the remote Three Parallel Rivers region in Yunnan, a unique geographical area nestled amid glacial peaks and mountains extending more than 4.2 million acres.

Now public health officials in Nevada say they have detected a cluster that has no links to hospitals. The development adds to wider heightened fears about fungi outbreaks, following hit show The Last of Us. 

They sampled 331 strains of A. fumigatus across nearly 2,000 soil samples and found that nearly seven percent were resistant to common antifungal infection treatments itraconazole and voriconazole.

Dr Xu said: ""˜Seven percent may seem like only a small number, but these drug-resistant strains are capable of propagating very quickly and taking over local and regional populations of this species.

""˜There is a need for increased surveillance of drug resistance in the environment across diverse geographic regions.'

The findings were published in the journal mSphere. 

Some 4.8 million people globally have a type of lung disease that comes from an allergy to Aspergillus.

Most types of the aspergillus species are harmless, but inhaling A. fumigatus spores can lead to severe aspergillosis infection in immunocompromised individuals or people with underlying lung disease. An estimated three to four million people worldwide are sickened by aspergillosis every year.

Dr Xu said: ""˜This fungus is highly ubiquitous ""” it's around us all the time. It is estimated that we all inhale hundreds of spores of this species every day.

""˜It can be very dangerous ""” it can lead to lung removal or even death ""” and now, increasingly, many of these infections will be impacted by drug resistance.'

The fact that the fungal samples collected in more remote areas of the valley showed the same level of antifungal resistance as those samples taken from areas where fungicides are more commonly used indicates that a wider spread of harder-to-treat fungi is likely to occur.

The authors of the study pointed out that drug-resistant fungi can spread from agricultural fields to non-agricultural areas readily through human influence such as travel and trade, as well as through weather and runoff.

The outlook for Aspergillus is murkier, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not track it in the same way. But serious aspergillus infections are estimated to cause roughly 14,000 hospitalizations annually.

Unlike Candida auris, which is primarily detected in hospitals, people can contract treatment-resistant aspergillus from their home flowerbeds.

An April 2022 study published in the journal Nature Microbiology tested this by collecting lung samples from infected people in the UK and Ireland and matched some of them to drug-resistant strains in nearby environments.

Farming experts say Australia's first all-electric ute is unsuitable for farms and agricultural work after energy minister was slammed for 'showing off' the Chinese made vehicle

Questions have been raised about Australia's first electric ute amid claims the vehicle is not suitable for farmers and agricultural work.

Chinese manufacturer LDV's eT60 has been hailed as Australia's first pure electric dual cab ute and the first of its kind.

Selling for $92,990 plus on-road costs, the dual-cab, two-wheel drive ute has a 330-kilometre range on a single charge and one-tonne towing capacity. 

While federal ministers Catherine King and Chris Bowen have been quick to jump on the eT60 bandwagon, the public reaction so far has been divided due to the ute's limited range of 330km after a charge and whopping price tag.

Farming expert and research engineer for Farming Ahead magazine Ben White welcomed the arrival of the eT60 in Australia but believes its limitations may make it unsuitable for farms.

'We want to be able to drive through the paddocks, we want to be able to check stock, we want to be able to carry loads to and from town, so it comes back to that equivalence and being able to do that job we need it to do,' he told the ABC.

'We do big kilometres in Australia, probably more than anyone would do in Europe or the US, and range anxiety is a real thing.

'There is a bit of anxiety and planning that builds into that, and that's OK, but once the range grows to 700 or 800km, that will dissipate.'

Australian Automotive Dealer Association chief executive James Voortman agreed the ute's limited range and massive price tag make it less attractive for farmers.

'There's the issue of distance and also the issue that a lot do have quite rugged terrain they have to negotiate on their properties, so the fact it's not a 4WD could work against them,' he told news.com.au.

'A lot of farmers do have very capable 4WDs [already] so it's something farmers do have to take into account when they are making a decision about whether to make the move to an electric vehicle.

Experts say the ute's current limitations and whopping price tag make it unsuitable for farms and agricultural work

Similar concerns were raised when LDV Australia recently spruiked the eT60 on its Facebook page.

'Useless for weeks of bush work,' one man commented.

Another added: '330km range, pathetic. Imagine running a maintenance company with workers spending most of their day recharging the car.'

LDV states on its website the eT60 is aimed at large corporations, government and fleet businesses and private early adopters committed to emission reductions targets.

'LDV Automotive is proud to have launched Australia's first electric ute into the market,' a spokesman told Daily Mail Australia.

'This first LDV eT60 is designed for those with specific customer applications who've committed to reducing their emissions.

'The electrification of Australia's automotive market is a journey, with learnings from each model resulting in changes and improvements to future models.

The vehicle is currently being showcased across Australia by Solar Citizens, a community organisation committed to renewable energy and transport.

The organisation is leading calls for the federal government to overhaul vehicle emissions standards laws to create more choice in the EV market and unlock a supply of affordable electric vehicles, particularly in regional areas. 

The dual-cab, two-wheel drive ute has a 330-kilometre range on a single charge and is priced at almost $93,000

Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development minister Catherine King is excited about the future of electric vehicle after checking out the eT60 at a recent roadshow event in regional Victoria.

'Only 10 months ago the now deputy opposition leader told us there were no electric utes anywhere in the world,' she said.

Thanks Solar Citzens for bringing your ute to Ballarat and showing the regions that there are EVs for us too.

The Albanese government wants 89 per cent of new car sales in Australia to be electric vehicles by 2030.

Energy Minister Chris Bowen recently came under fire for 'showing off' the Chinese-made electric ute

He was pictured inside an LDV eT60 electric alongside Transgrid CEO Brett Redman, after the company announced it would be trialling the $90,000 vehicle in its fleet.

'The whole thing is about, 'oh, we're bringing Aussie manufacturing back', and in the next breath, they say, 'Here's a $90,000 ute made in China',' 2GB breakfast host Ben Fordham said.

'I can't see that many people lining up and saying, 'I'm going to spend $90,000 on an electric ute made in China when I get a Ford Ranger or a Toyota Hilux for $50,000'.'

The managing editor of Drive.com, Trent Nikolic said that while the ute has a range of about 330km, in reality, for many tradies it would only be about 150km given how much they load up their vehicles with gear.

'I think it's less about the price at the moment, which is ridiculous and more about the capability

'LDV quotes the range of that vehicle as 330km. If that battery were in a car, it would be about 500, because the ute is about three tonnes.

'Then if you go anywhere near the vehicle's tow rating or load capacity, you halve it [the vehicle's range].

'They don't work for people in rural areas out of the urban fringe, people who tow a lot of weight or people who live on farms.

'The commercial sector, utes, trucks, busses and things like that, they're the worst- case scenario to put forward an argument for electric vehicles.



'Vehicles that are constantly on the road and are rarely parked up and left idle, they're no good for electric vehicles at all.

Fordham said the pitch for electric vehicles would be more suited to those living and working in the city as Aussies in rural areas require a vehicle that can travel long distances without needing to be recharged.

'There's no way in the world that Anthony Albanese and Chris Bowen will be able to meet their target of 89 per cent of new car sales being electric by 2030.'

Mr Nikolic agreed and forecasts that Australia will have a 30 per cent uptake of electric vehicles by 2030 because they're not suitable for many carbuyers.

'You've got to have the money to buy one first, you've got to have the ability to charge it at home and you've got to ideally not be relying on public charging infrastructure at the moment, because there's not enough of it yet.

Mr Nikolic also questioned why electric vehicle battery packs weren't being manufactured in Australia.

'Whenever I say to electric vehicle evangelists, 'What about the stuff we're digging out of the ground to make the battery packs?', their first reframe is, 'Oh yeah, lithium is common, it's everywhere'. Second one is 'we've got a lot of it in Australia'.'

'My response to that is, 'Why aren't we building battery packs here?' The battery pack is the most expensive component of an electric vehicle. There's no reason we couldn't be building that here.'

Stunning photos shows California superbloom: Unprecedented winter storms sees abundance of wildflowers springs up - with officials warning people to stay away

California's prolonged, wet winter has resulted in a beautiful burst of spring wildflowers carpeting the landscape of the Golden State.

The state was battered this winter by at least a dozen atmospheric rivers - long plumes of moisture from the Pacific Ocean - as well as powerful storms fueled by arctic air that produced blizzard conditions in mountainous areas. 

The wintry weather flooded homes, triggered power outages and brought much-needed rain to drought-parched agriculture, though in some cases, more water than the crops could withstand.

But now, California's normally arid desert sands have become awash with color thanks to a rare 'super bloom' of poppies caused by the massive amounts of rainfall.

Rain-fed wildflowers that lay dormant for years have suddenly sprouted - creating a spectacular display that has drawn record crowds and led to traffic jams on rural roads. 

The super bloom of wild flowers, as a result of extremely heavy winter rainfall, has resulted in the hillside being completely covered in bright orange poppies over the last two weeks

A 'super bloom' is a term for when a mass amount of desert plants bloom at one time.

In California, that happens about once in a decade in a given area and it hadn't happened for some time given the state's recent drought. 

'The superbloom is really a cultural phenomenon, where people decide that there are enough flowers here, right now, that we'll call it a superbloom,' Daniel Winkler, a research ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, Southwest Biological Science Center, told the Los Angeles Times. 

Locals call those who come to view the tiny wildflowers from their cars 'flower peepers.' 

But some focal points for flower tourism, including Lake Elsinore with its golden poppies, are telling visitors to stay away this year after they were harmed by crowds in 2019 that trampled over the flowers.

The beautiful and overwhelming bloom of the wild flowers has attracted tens of thousands of flower-crazed tourists

Over the past two weeks the green hills transformed slowly but surely into poppy fields 

The poppies stretch across the mountains, crop up alongside highways, and transform rolling hills of green into captivating golden slopes

Tourists arrive in the area early in an attempt to beat the crowds 

In February, Lake Elsinore Mayor Natasha Johnson told a press conference where she recounted the chaos of 2019.

'The flowers were beautiful; the scene was a nightmare,' Johnson said.

The poppies are blooming but the canyon where they grow and parking areas are now completely off-limits.

Poppies are found throughout California in spring and summer, but usually not as extensively as the blankets of gold that in 2019 covered slopes near Lake Elsinore, a city of 71,000 in Riverside County about 60 miles southeast of Los Angeles.

The focus of the excessive attention was Walker Canyon, a natural area with a hiking trail located just off heavily traveled Interstate 15.

'Back in 2019 numerous safety incidents occurred on the trail and on our roadways,' Johnson said. 'Tens of thousands of people, as many as 100,000 in a weekend ""” Disneyland-sized crowds ""” seeking to experience nature trampled the very habitat that they placed so high in regard and sought to enjoy.'

People illegally parked their cars along the freeway and neighborhoods were so gridlocked that parts of the city were essentially severed, affecting emergency services and the ability of residents to go to stores and work, Johnson said.

People waited for hours in queues to see the canyon and many were unprepared for the hike, resulting in injuries.

California Highway Patrol Lt. Craig Palmer said the agency has already begun saturation patrols of the area, and that freeway shoulders are only for use in emergency situations.

Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco warned that there will be zero tolerance for parking violations and the result could be a citation, a vehicle being towed or worse.

'It is a misdemeanor infraction, and you're subject to arrest and booking into jail,' Bianco said.

The mayor said Lake Elsinore usually welcomes visitors but the 2019 phenomenon came at a cost that was too high for residents.

Thousands of others have left their vehicles to traipse across the desert and analyze the array of delicate yellow, orange, purple and magenta blooms up close.

'It's really hard as a naturalist to enjoy the places that are overrun with tourists and Instagram models and people that are not used to being out in these places,' Joan Dudney, assistant professor at the department of environmental studies at UC Santa Barbara said.

She noted how visitors are too often 'out there for the spectacle' and 'haven't yet developed a connection with these natural spaces.' 

Beekeepers are particularly hopeful that the superbloom could provide ample forage for bees and potentially translate into a good year for honey. 

Among the blooms are desert sunflowers, lilies and dandelions, poppies, sand verbena, lupine, dune evening primrose, Canterbury bells, monkeyflower, Phacelia and Cryptanth. 

Officials say in addition to traffic problems, people are leaving trails and trampling the flowers

'Landfill in the sky': Millions of tons of plastic waste are being incinerated for energy... and then labelled as 'green'!

Millions of tonnes of plastic waste are being incinerated to generate electricity and branded 'green energy'.

These power plants produce on average more carbon dioxide (CO2) than the gas-fired equivalents - and the worst generate even more than those fuelled by coal, research has revealed.

Critics say burning plastic, a lot of which is collected by councils from households, adds to global warming, and have branded the practice 'landfill in the sky'.

Figures show the UK's 57 incinerators emitted more than 14million tonnes of CO2 last year, with about half of this coming from burning plastics, much of which could have been recycled.

The other half is from materials such as paper, wood and food waste, which can be described as renewable because trees and crops are planted to replace them.

Critics say burning plastic, a lot of which is collected by councils from households, adds to global warming, and have branded the practice 'landfill in the sky'

But many waste companies still imply in their public statements that all the electricity produced by incinerators, including from burning plastic, is 'green'. The amount of waste incinerated in the UK has more than doubled in less than a decade, from 6.7million tonnes in 2014 to 15.3million tonnes last year. Recycling has flatlined over the same period.

A further 50 incinerators -which do not incur the £102 per tonne tax paid on landfill and are often the cheapest option for waste disposal - are planned for the UK.

Waste firm Grundon, which owns the Lakeside incinerator near Heathrow, says on its website that the plant 'generates 37 megawatts of sustainable power, enough to provide green electricity to 56,000 homes'.

But analysis of its Environment Agency submission by the website Open Democracy shows that almost half of this comes from burning plastic and other fossil fuel-based waste, and only about 17MW of the electricity exported to the National Grid could be considered renewable.

Tory MP Dr Andrew Murrison said: 'Burning waste is simply consigning it to the great landfill in the sky. We should not greenwash incineration by rebadging it as 'energy from waste'

And the Allington incinerator in Kent emitted 1,195 grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt hour of electricity (g/kWh) exported to the Grid last year, according to analysis of its annual performance report submitted to the Environment Agency. That meant it produced more CO2 than coal plants, which emitted about 960g/kWh, and three times as carbon intensive as gas plants, at 360g/kWh.

Plastic can be removed before being burnt in incinerators by installing sorting machines, but waste companies in the UK have declined to invest in them. They are, however, used in Norway, Netherlands and Spain, where they remove more than 80 per cent of the plastic.

This also helps tackle the problem of households failing to recycle properly.

Tory MP Dr Andrew Murrison, who has campaigned for new incinerators to be blocked, said: 'Burning waste is simply consigning it to the great landfill in the sky. We should not greenwash incineration by rebadging it as 'energy from waste'.'

Piers Forster, a professor of physical climate change, called on incinerator operators 'to be more honest and transparent about the carbon intensity of their operations'.

When Jacob Hayler, executive director of trade body the Environmental Services Association, was asked if his members had made misleading claims, he said the waste industry was 'committed to try to decarbonise everything by 2040'.

EXCLUSIVE: Sharecropper's daughter: There were no limits for Anna Mae Bullock (aka Tina Turner) once she left the 'city' of Nutbush, where she grew up picking cotton, studying in a one-room schoolhouse and singing her heart out in the Baptist church choir

A dusty patch of land marks the spot where her modest family home once stood and where she spent her earliest years.

Surrounding it are the fields where she endured backbreaking days picking cotton as a child, when she was not studying at her desk in a one-room wooden schoolhouse during the segregation era.

The cotton fields are still there. But the youngster left them far behind to reach for the stars""¦ and international adoration as the undisputed Queen of Rock ""˜n' Roll.

For this is the tiny community of Nutbush, deep in the gently undulating landscape of rural southwest Tennessee, roughly 50 miles from Memphis. And the girl was sharecropper's daughter Anna Mae Bullock, later better known as Tina Turner, who passed away on Wednesday aged 83 at her palatial $76million home in Switzerland.

It's the town she and first husband Ike made famous with their classic 1973 hit Nutbush City Limits, with its lyrics about the ""˜one-horse town' where ""˜saltpork and molasses/is all you can get in jail'.

Tina Turner, who died on Wednesday, grew up in Nutbush, Tennessee, and made the tiny unincorporated community a household name with her 1973 classic Nutbush City Limits

The yearbook from Tina's senior year, 1958, shows her ambitions even then

Nutbush's only store closed years ago, but nailed prominently to the front is a washed-out visitors' sign in faded blue and red paint noting the town's most famous resident

It's 4,790 miles from Turner's simple early wooden home to the astonishing lakeside compound in KÃ¼snacht near Zurich, where she lived her final years with second husband Erwin Bach.

Even the good folk of Nutbush could be forgiven for admitting it might as well be a million.

Standing beneath a sign proclaiming their favorite daughter, local Rosa Quick, 68, told DailyMail.com: ""˜She died in a mansion in Switzerland and she came from here. Ain't that something.'

Blink and you might miss the place while heading along Tennessee State Route 19. Although as you get within a few miles there is a clue to its status, with a green road sign proudly announcing that section is now the Tina Turner Highway.

Nutbush was never a city, so never actually had city limits

Get into the center of Nutbush and the community's one-time store sits forlornly on the main route. Sadly, it shut years ago robbing the community of an informal focal point and essential service. The sagging building is now dilapidated, its white paint peeling and woodwork disintegrating.

But nailed prominently to the front is a washed-out visitors' sign in faded blue and red paint asserting: Welcome to Nutbush, Tennessee. Birthplace of Tina Turner. The singer's name is bracketed by jolly musical notes.

Well, Turner was born in hospital in nearby Brownsville. Yet who can blame the signwriter for getting carried away.

Indeed, Nutbush has its charm and virtues as DailyMail.com discovered when we visited hours after it was announced the music icon has died after battling a ""˜long illness'.

Time has moved on since Turner's opening lines in the song - 'A church house, gin house/a schoolhouse, outhouse' - described the community she knew while growing up in the 1940s.

The white-painted schoolhouse is no longer there, although there is still one of the Baptist churches where young Anna Mae was a star performer in the choir. There is also a gin house, which some visiting fans of the legendary singer have been disappointed to learn is nothing to do with an alcoholic tipple.

In fact, the gin house still dominates the small unincorporated community of just a few hundred people - the ""˜city limits' part of Turner's song title being something of a misnomer.

The gin in this case refers to a cotton gin, the machine that separate cotton fibers from the cotton seeds. And the cotton crop still dominates Nutbush.

Young Anna Mae was forced to pick cotton like other neighborhood children because her father Floyd Richard Bullock was one of the area's dozens of small sharecroppers, farmers who gave part of their cotton crops for rent. The family home was about half a mile from the gin factory.

Rosa Quick is still amazed that Tina grew up in a small home in Nutbush and died in a lakeside compound in Switzerland. 'Ain't that something,' she said. Quick is pictured inside the local cotton gin

""˜We all admire Tina here. She really was Simply The Best,' said long-time Nutbush resident Maudie Solomon, 96 

The Tina Turner Museum is located in the one-room Flagg Grove schoolhouse where Tina got her early education. It was built by her great uncle in 1889

Children were used to pick cotton throughout the south right up to the 1960s. Tina Turner remembered her daysat work: ""˜I hated the cotton field,' she said. 'There were those hairy worms crawling, the spiders'

Now, the small-scale farmer is largely gone, with larger enterprises producing more raw cotton than ever for the Nutbush Gin Company to process in a frenzy of 24-hour non-stop activity for three months during the Tennessee harvest that starts early fall.

The company's several buildings occupy a large site opposite the shuttered store. Inside the main office, manager Quick told us: ""˜It's well known around here that Tina Turner picked cotton as a kid.

""˜We all did that. I did it myself as a child even though I'm younger than she was and mechanization was starting to eliminate hand picking in the 1960s.'

Without referring to the hot backbreaking nature of the work for a child, Rosa gave an insight into her own experience and one she would have shared with the star-to-be.

She also revealed, without a hint of complaint, the astonishingly young age that children even relatively recently were expected to toil in the fields.

""˜I was six or seven when I started cotton picking,' she said. ""˜And I had an itty-bitty sack that I had to fill. And I would pick my 50lbs a day and I would get an extra dollar for that.

""˜That's all I could pick, but my two sisters were older than me and they had the long cotton sacks. And they had to pick 100lbs. And besides getting paid by the farmer, our mother would give us an extra dollar.'

Rosa added: ""˜We would get a week out of school to pick cotton, all the kids had to do that. The families had to pick cotton. That's what people did.

""˜This was a tradition around here, the kids had to get into the fields and help out with the cotton harvest. No complaining.'

Ike and Tina Turner's Nutbush City Limits only reached number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 when it was released in 1973 but went on to become a classic

The lyrics to Nutbush City Limits talk of everyday life in the tiny town which is some 50 miles northeast of Memphis

Ironically, Turner credited her experiences in the cotton fields for pressuring her to strive for success. She told a PBS interviewer in 2007: ""˜I hated the cotton field. There were those hairy worms crawling, the spiders.'

And in 1992 she said of cotton picking: ""˜I dreaded those times. That's the only thing that made me change my life. I knew I couldn't do that.'

Cotton picking's association with slavery may also have been a factor. Her great-great-grandfather Logan Currie was enslaved in the area.

Quick said of Turner: ""˜I was very sad to hear of her death. She deserved everything good that happened to her. I went to see her in concert in Memphis in the 1990s and she was awesome. And those legs, wow, just the prettiest legs.

""˜We have people drop by wanting to know about her life here. I don't know if she ever came back, I imagine there would have been a fanfare if she did, so I guess not.'

Other lines in Turner's musical ode to her first hometown also indicate a time where some things have vanished while others remain. Her verses of ""˜You go t'the store on Fridays/You go to the church on Sundays' would be impossible now.

But her last verse is pure nostalgia and could apply today: Nutbush city limits/Little old town in Tennessee/It's called a quiet, little old community/A one-horse town/You have to watch/What you're puttin' down in old Nutbush/They call it Nutbush.

As for ""˜Twenty-five was the speed limit/Motorcycles not allowed in it'""¦ time has caught up - there isn't a speed limit sigh although it's probably 45mph.

Long-time Nutbush resident Maudie Solomon, a sprightly 96 years old, said of the late 12-time Grammy award winner: ""˜We all admire Tina here. She really was Simply The Best.

""˜She was wonderful to watch. Nutbush is so proud of her and mourns her passing. She seemed happy and she was beautiful, a beautiful smile, gorgeous legs; she just was everything. It seemed after she moved to Europe, things were great for her.'

Solomon, who moved to Nutbush 50 years ago, said she believes the Private Dancer singer did not return to the community once she became ultra famous. But she did visit the small city of Ripley seven miles away to see a family she worked for as a domestic while a teen.

""˜They were the Henderson family I understand, who were to do with her early life,' said Solomon. ""˜I believe she arrived in a big limo. I think we would have known if she'd come back here.'

Nutbush consists of a small collection of houses scattered around State Route 19 and rural side roads, with the gin company as the focal point.

""˜The community is definitely less populated than it used to be,' said Solomon. ""˜People have moved out and the young people don't stay. There's nothing for them here.'

The What's Love Got to Do With It singer, real name Anna Mae Bullock, died on Wednesday at the age of 83 in her Switzerland home, following an unspecified illness

Tina relocated to Europe to be with her second husband, German music producer Erwin Bach

Tina lived in a magnificent compound on the overlooking Lake Zurich in KÃ¼snacht, Switzerland,

Tina's childhood home in Nutbush is long gone. All that's left is a dusty patch of land

King Charles - when he was still Prince of Wales - affixed a handwritten note to a letter he sent Tina in 1986 to thank her for her role in a Prince's Trust concert. It is now in the Tina Turner Museum in Nutbush

Turner sang regularly at the Woodlawn Baptist Church, about four miles from the center of Nutbush, where her grandparents Alex and Roxanna Bullock were deacon and deaconess.

It was established in 1866 and the current brick building where Tina honed her voice was constructed in 1928. She also sang at the Spring Hill Baptist Church, which no longer exists.

Born in 1939, Turner's childhood in Nutbush was turbulent. Her father and mother, Zelma, relocated to Knoxville, Tennessee during World War II leaving her and her two sisters to live with the Bullock grandparents.

After the war, the sisters moved to Knoxville before the parents and children returned to Nutbush where Tina attended Flagg Grove Elementary School until the eighth grade.

Her mother fled her abusive marriage when Turner was 11 and her father married another woman and moved to Detroit in 1952. The three sisters went to live with their maternal grandmother in Brownsville.

When she was 16, Anna Mae went to live with her mom in St Louis where she hooked up with Ike Turner, who would become her first husband, help launch her phenomenal career - and eventually drag her down in an abusive relationship that ended in divorce.

However, Turner had learned resilience that saw her relaunch to superstardom from 1983 onwards. And her childhood schooling in Nutbush also undoubtedly helped to shape her determination.

The old schoolhouse may be gone from Nutbush, but it hasn't disappeared. It was moved intact in 2012 to become an exhibit and museum at the West Tennessee Delta Heritage Center in Brownsville.

Inside, are two rows of basic wooden desks and seats where Turner would have sat to study. The tiny building catered for up to 60 children, split into two groups with the highest grades on one side and the lowest on the other. All students had to chop wood to feed the potbelly stove.

There is a letter among the exhibits in the school that reveals how far one young student - hater of cotton fields but lover of music - was to travel in life.

It is from King Charles III, when he was Prince Charles and married to Princess Diana. Written in 1986, the typewritten segment says: ""˜I want to thank you most warmly for your great kindness in agreeing to take part in the Prince's Trust 10th Birthday concert the other day. We both enjoyed the occasion enormously.

""˜I now find that I am gradually becoming something of an expert on the rock scene and can occasionally impress those who are considerably younger than me with my knowledge of some of the pop groups!

""˜Such a concert as the one in which you participated will make an immense difference to the work of the Trust and to the number of young people we can help throughout the country. I am indebted to you for your generosity and send my gratitude and very best wishes.'

The newly crowned monarch then writes by hand: ""˜It was a great (underlined) pleasure to meet you after the concert and enclose photograph of the children! Yours most sincerely Charles'.

To borrow from local resident Rosa Quick, for a share-cropper's daughter from Nutbush, Tennessee""¦ ain't that something.

Will ANYONE stop these eco-clowns? Just Stop Oil throw orange powder over award-winning sustainable garden at the Chelsea Flower Show as Animal Rising drag frightened lambs away from their mothers on the King's Sandringham estate

Eco-fanatics caused outrage yesterday by kidnapping three lambs from a royal farm and attacking the Chelsea Flower Show.

They were warned their stunts, which raised animal welfare fears and caused costly damage, would destroy any public sympathy they had.

The incidents are the latest in a series that includes a paint attack on the World Snooker Championships and a bid to sabotage the Grand National.

Parliament might now have to bring in stronger punishments, according to Tory veteran Peter Bone.

The MP said: 'When a very, very tiny minority is ruining the lives of other people, action needs to be taken. If this were to continue and the current laws are not strong enough, the Government will have to introduce new laws. 

Three Just Stop Oil activists vandalised a show garden at Chelsea Flower Show

A woman dampened the protest by grabbing a hose pipe and drenching the three intruders until she was stopped by a security guard

'We are not talking about peaceful protest. This completely ruins the lives of the vast majority of people. We just can't carry on like this.'

Yesterday's chaos began with three Animal Rising activists presenting themselves to Slough Police after announcing they had taken three lambs from Appleton Farm on the royal Sandringham estate in Norfolk.

They included Rose Patterson, 33, who was previously arrested on suspicion of leading the group's plot to sabotage the Grand National, as uncovered by The Mail on Sunday.

The three activists said they rescued the lambs - dubbed Sammy, Sunny and Sooty - late on Wednesday night to save them from slaughter.

After concerns were raised that the animals - whose location is unknown - would be distressed after being separated from their mothers, the group claimed taking the ewes as well was not possible. They said they 'hid' the lambs before handing themselves in.

An hour later three Just Stop Oil activists vandalised a show garden at Chelsea Flower Show.

Charity co-ordinator Stephanie Golder, 35, retired landscape engineer Naomi Goddard, 58, and disability support worker Rosa Hicks, 28, threw orange powder paint from their handbags across the flowers and hard landscaping of the RBC Brewin Dolphin garden.

Goddard was heard to shout: 'Humanity is failing. Everything that you hold dear is in peril. The flower gardens that you treasure.

'The buildings that you adore. Our traditions. What is the point of a garden if you can't feed yourself?'

A woman dampened the protest by grabbing a hose pipe and drenching the three intruders until she was stopped by a security guard.

Another bystander could be heard shouting at the protesters that they were 'prats'. The trio were arrested by police on suspicion of causing criminal damage to the garden which was showcasing sustainability.

Gareth Wilson, its award-winning designer, said: 'These people are absolute morons who have failed to do their homework. 

'The Royal Horticultural Society is massively - probably more than any other organisation of its kind - moving heaven and earth to push for sustainability. It just won't accept your design if it is not sustainable.

'If they were doing this protest outside an oil refinery or a company that was using oil or polluting the atmosphere, or pouring oil into rivers I would have a little bit of sympathy.

'But these morons have come into a sustainable showground. They are working against their own cause.'

Naomi Goddard (pictured left) was heard to shout: 'Humanity is failing. Everything that you hold dear is in peril. The flower gardens that you treasure. The buildings that you adore. Our traditions. What is the point of a garden if you can't feed yourself?'

Mr Wilson said the mainly recyclable display had been permanently damaged by the orange 'biodegradable cornstarch'.

Tory MP Greg Smith, chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on farming, said of the Sandringham incident: 'You can't dress it up as protest, or campaigning, or being some sort of cuddly group of do-gooders. Those involved need to face the consequences under the law.'

Paul Scully, Tory MP for Sutton and Cheam, accused the flower show activists of 'losing yet more public support for their cause'.

He added: 'As green an event as can be, attended by some of the most environmentally aware people, yet Just Stop Oil target gardens which have taken months of hard work and nature to prepare. This needs action by Met Police.'

Conservative Party chairman Greg Hands, the MP for Chelsea and Fulham, said: 'This is an appalling attack by Just Stop Oil on the Chelsea Flower Show, literally Britain's greenest event. This is utterly contemptible.'

Trying to justify her actions, Golder, who lives in Southend, said: 'I disrupted the Chelsea Flower Show to ask the visitors, exhibitors and the RHS to pick a side. To stand for good over evil, life over death, right over wrong.

'To stand with the young and the billions of people in the global south whose lives are being cut short by climate collapse.

'If you love gardens or growing food, you must join in civil resistance against new oil and gas.'

Golder, who works for the Alexandra Rose Charity which helps low-income families to buy fruit and vegetables, was arrested last April as part of a targeted Just Stop Oil disruption that led to two petrol stations on the M25 being temporarily shut.

Stronger powers to allow officers to crack down on protests are going through parliament.

Usual suspects at centre of garden gang 

Hosed down: A visitor at the Chelsea Flower Show gives the eco-zealots a shower after they invade a sustainable garden

1 - The flood expert: A landscape architect from Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, 58-year-old Naomi Goddard claimed she was risking losing her job, despite being described by the protest group as retired.

She somehow connected her counter-productive protest with the flooding of her hometown in recent years, telling Yorkshire Live it has 'flooded on five occasions over the last eight years. 

Soiled sewage-stuffed flood water, pouring into folks' properties, school rooms, and places of work and destroying rigorously tended gardens'.

However, she did not see fit to mention that the area has experienced repeated flooding for centuries.

2 - The serial activist: Stephanie Golder, a 35-year-old charity project co-ordinator from Southend, Essex, has been involved in numerous Just Stop Oil protests and acted as the group's spokesman following the sentencing of Dartford Crossing climbers Morgan Trowland and Marcus Decker earlier this year.

She was arrested last April as part of a targeted Just Stop Oil disruption that led to two petrol stations on the M25 being temporarily shut. At the time, the activist bemoaned that she was 'sick and tired of being treated like a criminal.' She works for the Alexandra Rose Charity and, rather ironically, claims to 'spend as much time as possible in her garden growing food and flowers'.

3 - The psychologist: Rosa Hicks, a 28-year-old disability support worker from London and the youngest of the three arrested, Hicks recently graduated from the University of Manchester with a degree in psychology - after taking a year out to fly to Australia to study abroad.

She describes herself as passionate about social justice and was previously an activist for Extinction Rebellion.

According to her LinkedIn profile she has been involved with efforts to help refugees with 'therapeutic gardening'. She attended the well-regarded Peter Symonds sixth-form College in Winchester.

Lambs snatched from their mothers 'must be terrified'

By Sabrina Miller

Farmers, countryside campaigners and MPs last night condemned the 'traumatising' stunt pulled off by militant vegans after they took three lambs from the King's Sandringham Estate.

The three animal rights zealots trespassed on Appleton Farm in Norfolk and bundled the lambs into a van - separating them from their distressed mothers.

Rose Paterson, 33, Rosa Sharkey, 23, and Sarah Foy, 23, filmed themselves 'rescuing' the lambs and spiriting them away.

The group claim that the young animals are being cared for in a dedicated sancutary with specialist staff but did not reveal its location.

Sheep farming specialists lambasted the group's reckless antics and urged Animal Rising to return the sheep to their mothers.

In an Instagram video Rose Patterson (left), 33, said: 'We just rescued three beautiful lambs from a field in Sandringham. We'll be taking them to a life of freedom otherwise they would have been sent to slaughter shortly for people to eat them. We don't think that's right or fair for these beautiful animals'

Nicola Noble of the National Sheep Association said: 'The mothers have likely spent the last 24 hours scouring the field for their lambs, bleating endlessly with no hope of finding them.

'These animals would no doubt have been terrified as they were chased and manhandled by complete strangers.'

'Being bundled into the back of a dark van would have been highly distressing for the sheep involved - not to mention the risk of potential disease contamination. The lambs, I imagine, will be endlessly bleating, hopelessly calling out in search for their mothers.'

Gareth Wyn Jones, 56, a sheep farmer with over five decades of experience, said that the protesters were likely to have terrified the lambs. He added: 'These people are absolutely bonkers. 

'It's distressing for these animals to be handled wrongly by amateur strangers. They must have chased the sheep around in order to catch them - stressing them out. And taking lambs away from their mothers is incredibly cruel.

'Animal Rising have been flaunting this all over social media as well. They need to be made an example of.'

The trio handed themselves into police in Slough. Norfolk Police have confirmed they are investigating an alleged theft and have said that three women remain in custody. 

In an Instagram video Rose Patterson, 33, said: 'We just rescued three beautiful lambs from a field in Sandringham. We'll be taking them to a life of freedom otherwise they would have been sent to slaughter shortly for people to eat them. We don't think that's right or fair for these beautiful animals.'

Last night MPs and campaigners joined the criticism. Former farms minister George Eustice said: 'Actions of this sort are highly irresponsible and possibly very bad for the welfare of young lambs who should not be separated from their mothers.'

Mo Metcalf Fisher of the Countryside Alliance, condemned the 'selfish' stunt and urged the Government to prosecute. 

He added: 'Amateurs with no real understanding of livestock care risk causing considerable distress to any animal they seek to steal.'

The rustlers dedicated to disruption 

On video: The militants and the lambs they have torn away from their mothers

1 - The rebellion regular: Rose Patterson is a full-time animal rights activist and no stranger to causing disruption.

The 33-year-old was last month accused of being the ringleader of planned disruption at the Grand National. The plot to ruin the race was exposed by a Mail on Sunday investigation. 

Some 118 activists were arrested after they tried to storm perimeter fences. Patterson was arrested in Greater Manchester before the race began.

She completed a degree in photographic arts at Westminster University in 2015, before two years later studying for a masters in animal welfare science, ethics and law at Winchester University. 

She has been a full-time 'action team co-ordinator' for Animal Rebellion (now Animal Rising) since 2020.

2 - The property queen: Sara Foy's parental home is a detached house in Ripley, Derbyshire but two years ago, despite being only 23, she managed to buy her own home in Alfreton in the same county for £100,000. 

Away from the property ladder, she seems to be becoming deeply involved in animal activism.

3 - Climate crusader: Rosa Sharkey says she has dedicated herself to 'climate and animal activism' for years. Sharkey, 23, was a speaker at the VegFest conference in Brighton last month. 

Until a couple of years ago she was living in a £600,000 Lake District barn conversion but was appalled by the 'decimation of a once-wild landscape by animal agriculture and the climate crisis', which she claims is 'killing people in our communities'.

Pecking order! Diners at Michelin Star restaurant in California will be served lab-grown CHICKEN for the first time tonight as part of $150 tasting course

Many foodies refuse to order chicken because of its 'lack of originality' - but that won't be a problem for diners at a luxury California restaurant tonight.

The Michelin-starred Bar Crenn in San Francisco will serve poultry that was grown in a laboratory as part of its sold-out $150-a-head tasting course.

One of the six courses will be man-made chicken 'coated in a recedo negro tempura batter, drizzled with burnt chili aioli, and garnished with edible flowers'. 

Cultivated meat is made by taking a sample of cells from livestock like chickens and cows and growing them in a lab. 

Selling it became legal last month, and the Bar Crenn will become only the second restaurant to have served it in the US after tonight.

The dish at Bar Crenn is described as: ""˜UPSIDE Chicken coated in a recedo negro tempura batter, drizzled with burnt chili aioli, and garnished with edible flowers'.

Bar Crenn is a restaurant by French chef Dominique Crenn, 58, who is famous for being the only woman in the U.S. to achieve three Michelin stars

The man-made meat on the menu tonight was made by UPSIDE Foods, one of the two USDA-approved manufacturers of cultivated meat.

Amy Chen, chief operating officer at UPSIDE Foods, told Food & Wine: 'It was important to be able to showcase the chicken, and to recognize that this is a whole-cut piece of chicken.'

Type of fat in breast milk might hold cure for cerebral palsy

 

Researchers at Duke University found that the fatty molecule helps create new cells that make white matter, a network of nerve fibers that connect different areas of the brain. 

'[The recipe] really fit into that broader story about sustainability and artisanship and stewardship. Everything about it is just exquisite.'

The cruelty-free meat alternative is created by taking a sample of stem cells, the building blocks of muscle and other organs, from an animal.

The cells are placed in petri dishes with amino acids and carbohydrates to help the muscle cells multiply and grow. 

Once enough muscle fibers have grown, the result is a protein that resembles real meat.

Bar Crenn is a restaurant by French chef Dominique Crenn, 58, who is famous for being the only woman in the U.S. to achieve three Michelin stars. 

Ms Crenn, who has starred on the cooking show Iron Chef, created dishes with UPSIDE's alternative chicken after taking meat off her menu in 2018.

Going forward, the restaurant will offer lab-grown meat during the first weekend of every month as part of its six-course tasting menu. 

In January, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared engineered animal products safe for human consumption.

So far, Singapore is the only other country with approved lab-grown meats for sale.

The European Union, Israel, and other countries are working on regulatory frameworks for cultivated meat but have not yet approved a product for human consumption. 

Cultivated meats could be coming to a high-end restaurant near you this year. Pictured: Founder of UPSIDE Foods Uma Valeti peers into one of the cultivators where lab-grown meats are manufactured

Serving the food in restaurants could turn the tide for engineered meat's popularity.

A 2022 study published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology, for example, found that 35 percent of meat eaters and 55 percent of vegetarians would be too disgusted to try cultivated meat.

Last month, China Chilcano in Washington, DC became the first restaurant to sell US and Singapore-based GOOD Meat's chicken in a dish called 'Anticuchos de Poll'. 

The restaurant, run by Chef Jose Andres, served their first GOOD Meat dish exclusively to the family of the late Willem van Eelen, who was considered the ""˜godfather of cultivated meat'. 

Mr Andres told Reuters he wants to sell cultivated meat because of its environmental benefits.

'We can see in what is happening all around us, in every country around the globe, that our planet is in crisis,' he said. 

After gaining the USDA's approval for sale in June, UPSIDE Foods posted on its Instagram account: 'This is a historic, world-changing, moment and brings our vision of a more human, sustainable future one giant bite closer to reality'.

'Plant-based burger' may not sound like the most appealing dish on a menu board.

But a new study suggests restaurants can sell them by the bucket load - by giving them more appetizing, descriptive names. 

Using names like 'Juicy American' or 'smoky Aussie' for vegan burgers can make people choose them over the real meat equivalents, experts in Australia found. 

Plant-based food companies and restaurants may need to get more creative if they want to encourage meat-lovers to reduce their intake and help save the planet. 

Cutting down on animal products can improve our health but also that of the planet, as livestock farming at scale destroys habitats and pumps out CO2 and methane.

More appealing names for vegan food can entice meat-eaters 

- 'Juicy American burger'

- 'Juicy smoky American burger'

- 'Delicious Aussie burger'

- 'Aussie sausages and buttery mash'

- 'Scrumptious succulent Aussie parmigiana' 

'Altering the names of plant-based meals on restaurant menus significantly increases the food's appeal,' said study author Danyelle Greene at University of Queensland.

'A simple change such as renaming a ""vegan burger"" to a ""Juicy American burger"" could increase plant-based orders and encourage meat-eaters to give vegan options a go.' 

The researchers say environmentally friendly meals that are rich in plant matter tend to be described in restaurants with unappealing names.

In comparison, language used in the top 100 most profitable US restaurants to describe meat-heavy meals are more likely to be described as 'American', 'tasty' or 'juicy', a 2017 paper found. 

For their new study, the experts wanted to find out if using appealing meal names could persuade people to order more plant-based meals in restaurants. 

From an initial online survey of 537 participants, they identified a range of alternative names for classic Australian pub dishes, such as burgers, lasange and parmigiana.

In a study, a vegan diet was found to be the most environmentally-friendly option

The second part of study involved a simulated restaurant experiment where 312 participants ordered one of four meals based off the name assigned to each - either appealing or unappealing.

The meals were not specifically labelled as vegan or vegetarian (unless these were included in the original names of the dishes), although each meal had a detailed ingredients list. 

As expected, having descriptive adjectives in the names of dishes made people more inclined to order them, whether the dishes were plant-based or not.

For example, 'juicy Aussie burger' was more enticing than simply 'beef burger' or 'vegan burger', while 'tasty Italian vegetable lasagne' was better than just 'vegetable lasagne'.

Finally, the third part of the included 898 participants, all separated into different groups of meat eaters, who were surveyed on how the appealing names affected their choices. 

Overall, researchers found that dish names that highlight food flavour, texture, and place of origin can positively influence the appeal of plant-based meals.

Crucially, meat-eaters opted for the vegan food with a descriptive name when the name for the meat version was more boring.  

But this wasn't the case across all groups of meat eaters; for example, 'uncompromising meat eaters' were less likely to opt for the vegan option despite a name change. 

Researchers found appealing meal names (in comparison to basic names) increased the perceived affective appeal of meals

The team admit that the effect is stronger among meat-eater groups that identify as environmentally or health-oriented. 

But this group is increasingly making up a bigger and bigger proportion of people who eat meat, so the authors hope their findings could have an effect in the real world.  

'We conclude that using appealing names for plant-based dishes on restaurant menus may represent a cost-effective way to entice specific market segments of consumers to choose plant-based rather than meat-based dishes when dining,' they say. 

'With food contributing nearly 25 per cent to global emissions, changing meal choices for even the smallest of market segments can make a meaningful contribution to climate change mitigation.'

The new study has been published in Elsevier journal Food Quality and Preference. 

FOLLOWING A VEGAN DIET LEADS TO WEAKER BONES: 2021 STUDY

Following a meat and dairy-free vegan diet can weaken your bones and increase your risk of painful fractures, a study has warned.

Researchers from the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) compared the bone health of 36 vegans and 36 non-vegans by means of ultrasound.

They found that the vegans tended to have poorer bone health - due to an apparent deficiency in key nutrients that are typically gained from animal-based products.

'People are turning to a vegan diet not only due to compassion for animals and awareness of environmental problems but also for health benefits,' said BfR president Andreas Hensel.

'Scientific evidence suggests that a vegan or vegetarian diet may protect against many chronic diseases, for example diabetes and cardiovascular disease, or cancer.'

'However, a vegan diet was found to be associated with lower bone mineral density, which is associated with higher fracture risk, compared to omnivores.'

In the study. the researchers led by BfR food safety expert Juliane Menzel took ultrasound measurements of the heel bone of 72 participants, half of whom followed vegan diets and half of whom did not.

The team found that, on average, those who followed a vegan diet had lower ultrasound values ""” and therefore poorer bone health.

By taking samples of the participants' blood and urine, the researchers were also able to identify 12 so-called 'biomarkers' that play a role in bone maintenance.

The findings revealed that, in combination, vitamins A and B6, lysine, leucine, omega-3 fatty acids, selenoprotein P, iodine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, calcium, magnesium and Î±-Klotho protein were positively associated with good bone health.

Lysine is an amino acid found in meat, fish, dairy, eggs ""” and some plants such as soy ""” that the body cannot produce on its own.

Vitamin A, meanwhile, is found in eggs and dark leafy vegetables, while vitamin B6 is found in meat and fish as well as chick peas and some fruits.

In contrast, those participants with more healthy bones had lower concentrations of a hormone known as FGF23, whose main role is the regulation of phosphate concentration in plasma.



The full findings of the study were published in the journal Nutrients.

Exploding population of 'super hogs' could spill over to the US from Canada and cause 'an ecological train wreck'

Canada's exploding population of 'super pigs' could spill over into the US, and experts fear the migration will cause 'an ecological train wreck.'

The feral hogs are crossbreeds that combine the survival skills of wild Eurasian boar with domestic swine's size and high fertility, making them 'the most invasive animal on the planet.'

Wild pigs can devastate agriculture and spread diseases to hog farms, like African swine fever, which is deadly to both domestic and feral animals - it does not transmit to humans.

Canadian researchers helping to solve the problem have documented at least 62,000 wild pig sightings, with one just 18 miles from Minnesota.

The feral hogs are crossbreeds that combine the survival skills of wild Eurasian boar with domestic swine's size and high fertility, making them 'super pigs'

Ruth Aschim, a PhD student at the University of Saskatchewan (USask), said: 'Wild pigs are ecological train wrecks. 

'They are prolific breeders, making them a highly successful invasive species.

'Wild pigs can cause soil erosion, degrade water quality, destroy crops, and prey on small mammals, amphibians and birds.'

Pigs are not native to North America but were brought from Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s to diversify Canadian livestock production. 

Others were imported as 'penned games' for shooting.

The hybrid wild pigs have rapidly multiplied and spread, making them Canada's most prolific invasive mammal.

And they typically weigh between 120 and 250 pounds.

Wild pigs typically weigh between 120 and 250 pounds. They have around six piglets per litter per year

The wild boars are roaming Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba - and only eradication in Alberta is possible, researchers said, due to a sow having six piglets in a litter and raising two litters in a year.

Ryan Brook, a professor at the University of Saskatchewan and one of Canada's leading authorities on the problem, said that 65 percent or more of a wild pig population could be killed yearly and will still increase.

Canada's pig problem dates back to the 1980s when officials encouraged farmers to raise wild boar. 

When the market collapsed in 2001, some farmers took vengeance by cutting fences and letting the animals free into the wild. 

And while many believed the invasive species would eventually die off, the pigs adapted to be the ultimate survivors of Canadian winters.

They can endure frigid temperatures and breed in any season, living in 'pigloos' burrowed into the snow.

'Nobody should be surprised when pigs start walking across that border if they haven't already,' Brook said. 'The question is: What will be done about it?'

Brook said Montana has been the most serious about keeping wild pigs out. It banned raising and transporting wild pigs within the state.

'The only path forward is you have to be really aggressive and use all the tools in the toolbox,' Brook said.

Biden's food advisers could soon urge Americans not to eat chicken nuggets, white bread, and breakfast cereals - as processed foods become target of new diet advice

The Biden Administration could warn Americans against eating chicken nuggets, white bread, and breakfast cereals as part of the biggest shake-up of food advice in decades.

Since the 1970s, the federal government has recommended people avoid foods high in sodium, sugar, and saturated fat and eat more vitamins, minerals, fiber, and protein.

But a mountain of research in recent years has shown that consuming ultra-processed foods - those packed with artificial flavors, dyes, additives, and ingredients - can cause a slew of chronic conditions.

For the first time, the expert panel that shapes what food Americans eat will examine the science of obesity and ultra-processed foods for its next set of regulations in 2025.

It could see them recommend against staples in the American diet like chicken nuggets, sweetened breakfast cereals, and boxed mac and cheese.

DailyMail.com has found that snacks, quick meals, and even salad kits could have up to 120 hard-to-pronounce ingredients, making them ultra-processed

Mountains of studies show eating too many processed foods dramatically raises the risk of early death, dementia, and heart disease

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) publishes the Dietary Guidelines for Americans every five years.

The committee is examining whether eating ultra-processed foods influences 'growth, size, body composition, risk of overweight and obesity, and weight loss and maintenance.' 

It is also asking if these foods raise the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, cognitive decline, and early death.  

These guidelines determine which foods are part of the National School Lunch Program, which serves 30 million US children. 

Currently, ultra-processed foods like pizza, Lunchables, and Cheez-Its can be found on school lunch menus across the country. 

This is because while they are loaded with additives, they technically meet government standards for fat, protein, sodium, and whole grains. 

These regulations also determine which foods are provided as part of government assistance programs and on military bases.  

Many foods that are generally considered healthy, like whole-grain bread and salad kits, are still considered processed

Federal diet guidance was first published in 1977 by the US Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs as the Dietary Goals for the United States. 

The top goals included 'to avoid overweight,' 'increase the consumption of complex carbohydrates and ""naturally occurring"" sugars,' and 'limit the intake of sodium by reducing the intake of salt to about 5 grams a day.' 

In 1980, this was changed to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which described seven principles for a healthy diet and recommended limiting sugar, fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium.  

WHAT ARE ULTRA-PROCESSED FOODS? 

Ultra-processed foods are high in added fat, sugar and salt, low in protein and fiber and contain artificial colorings, sweeteners and preservatives.

The term covers food that contains ingredients that a person wouldn't add when cooking at home ""” such as chemicals, colorings and preservatives.

Microwave meals, ice cream, sausages, deep-fried chicken and ketchup are some of the best-loved examples.

They are different from processed foods, which are processed to make them last longer or enhance their taste, such as cured meat, cheese and fresh bread.

Ultra-processed foods, such as sausages, cereals, biscuits and fizzy drinks, are formulations made mostly or entirely from substances derived from foods and additives.

They contain little or no unprocessed or minimally processed foods, such as fruit, vegetables, seeds and eggs.

The foods are usually packed with sugars, oils, fats and salt, as well as additives, such as preservatives, antioxidants, and stabilizers.

Ultra-processed foods are often presented as ready-to-consume, taste good and are cheap.

Source: Open Food Fact  

Ultra-processed foods have gone through multiple levels of processing and are usually full of extra hard-to-pronounce fats, colors and preservatives. They target reward systems in the brain, similar to those triggered by tobacco products and illicit drugs.

Microwave meals, snack mixes, and ice cream are common examples.

These foods have become ubiquitous in the American diet.  

A 2022 study from Northeastern University's Network Science Institute, for example, estimated that 73 percent of the United States food supply is ultra-processed. 

And a study published in Frontiers in Nutrition found that more than 60 percent of US caloric intake comes from these foods. 

Mountains of research has shown that these foods can have detrimental health effects. 

A 2019 clinical trial by the National Institutes of Health found that when participants were fed a diet of ultra-processed foods, they consumed 500 extra calories per day and gained weight much faster than when they mostly are unprocessed foods.  

A 2022 study published in the journal Neurology found that a 10 percent increase in ultra-processed food consumption could raise the risk of dementia.

Additionally, a large cohort study in France showed that the same increase in ultra-processed foods led to an increased risk of breast cancer. 

A global comparative study published in Obesity Reviews showed that an increase in sales per capita of ultra-processed food and drink was associated with higher body mass index (BMI). 

And a pair of studies from researchers in Spain and France found an association between consuming ultra-processed foods and an increased risk of early death. 

The USDA's considerations have already caused backlash from the food industry. More than a dozen food industry trade and lobbying groups have written letters to the government, urging leaders to be cautious about ultra-processed food recommendations. 

In September, the Institute of Food Technologists wrote that food processing helps 'preserve food for longer and improve shelf life, which minimizes food waste, is more affordable for consumers since they waste less, and ensures food and nutrition security when fresh foods may not be available or accessible.'

And a letter from the American Frozen Food Institute stated that the USDA committee 'should not proceed with recommendations about level of food processing as part of dietary recommendations.'

At least six other countries have issued guidance urging people to cut back on ultra-processed foods. In May, Mexico warned citizens to 'avoid ultra-processed foods such as processed meats and sausages, chips, crackers, cookies, sweet bread, and boxed cereals.'

In August, researchers in Britain claimed the country is facing 'a tidal wave of harm' from ultra-processed food. 

The USDA's list of considerations says that updated questions will be available when the committee formally starts reviewing the guidelines.

Mining magnate Gina Rinehart has called for a nuclear-powered Australia to replace 'bird-killing wind generators and massive solar panel stretches'.

The nation's richest woman demanded the country shift towards a nuclear future when she gave a rare speech at the Australian Bush summit in Perth on Monday.

In a 12-minute blast at government policy, she demanded an end to the red tape tying up farmers and businesses in rural Australia.

But she used her closing remarks about the huge cost for farmers to commit to zero emissions to switch the focus from green renewables to adopting nuclear power.

She warned the consequences of the costly changeover could cause widespread food shortages and retail prices to surge even higher. 

'Let's not upset many farmers with bird-killing wind-generated generators and massive solar panels stretches,' she said.

'Bring on clean, safe nuclear energy please, Australia.'

Mining magnate Gina Rinehart has called for a nuclear-powered Australia to replace 'bird-killing wind generators and massive solar panel stretches'

Mrs Rinehart laid out a list of demands to the government which she said would improve life in the Outback and 'try to put some smiles on your faces'.

She sent her strongest message about the expensive bill farmers were facing to meet zero emission CO2 targets.

Her Hancock Agriculture business runs 14 farm properties in Western Australia with 12,000 head of Wagyu beef cattle, one of the largest herds in the country. 

'Agriculture usually doesn't have the financial resources that the mining industry has and this is a big thing we I think we are overlooking,' she said.

'It just doesn't have the resources - unless of course you've got, you know, a mining company in your back pocket.

'You've actually got to add up the expense of these net-zero policies on farmers.

'Just look at acquiring electric vehicles alone,' she added.

'Be they for lawn mowers motorbikes utes, four wheel drives, tractors, harvesters, trucks, bulldozers, graders, front end loaders...

'It's going to cost a fortune that farmers and pastoralists don't have without a mining company in the back pocket. They just don't have this money to be able to invest.'

She said the bill to switch to solar was vast for outlying estates and required huge battery back-ups for when the sun was not shining.

Mrs Rinehart said her company's research had put the cost at around $650,000 for rural properties to be equipped with solar power and the required battery backup.

'What they forget is that we're not attached,' she said. 'We're five hours out by road from Broome. There's no mains just to switch on. 

'You've got to have massive investment in massive batteries to be able to cater for when the sun doesn't shine. And that was forgotten about.

'It's just not doable.'

She called for a cap of $200,000 to be spent by farmers on the transition to zero emissions, with the government picking up the rest of the cost.

In a 12-minute blast at government policy, Gina Rinehart demanded an end to the red tape tying up farmers and businesses in rural Australia

'Most farmers and others in agriculture cannot afford Net Zero,' she said. 'They will have to leave agriculture. 

'With the consequence that Aussies in the towns will see huge food price increases and fresh food shortages. This is the mess that has to be gone into.'

She said her father Lang Hancock had pioneered the mining revolution in Australia which transformed life for those 'above the 26th parallel' in the nation's north.

And she insisted that she had remained close to her father despite the row over his marriage to third wife Rose Porteous which split the family.

More details of the row emerged in Perth Supreme Court on Monday, just 800m away from where Mrs Rinehart was delivering her speech.

A court case over mining rights involving Mrs Rinehart and her family heard she had tried to get Ms Porteous deported during the row.

'It's saddening that media likes to ignore the good if you're successful and not a socialist,' she said.

'Even in the last few days, ignoring the tight bond this West Australian family had for decades.

'Such as referring to some correspondence when I was very concerned about our family company over a few years. 

'Sadly, rightly so.

The bill to switch to solar was vast for outlying estates and required huge battery back-ups for when the sun was not shining is simply too high, said Gina Rinehart

'Without adding the truth that Dad and I had again become very close pre his sad departure in 1992 and I admire his moral and courageous stand in his final weeks.'

She added: 'My father throughout his whole life was a huge lover of the bush and our country. 

'He made himself unpopular at times, standing up for what he could see were its best interests. 

'He made a huge and exceptional contribution to our north, our state and our country.'

And she used her relationship with her father to support her call for nuclear power and tried to dispel fears about the possible risks involved. 

'Growing up on stations, the family unit is close and trusting, as ours certainly was which used to be well known in Western Australia,' she said.

'We drove for a long time together in up north looking at the cattle looking at the windmills. I was there to open the gates.'

She quoted a story about American physicist Edward Teller that her father told her on one of those trips.

She said he found the radiation from standing next to a nuclear power plant for a year was only a little more than what a man would get from sleeping with his wife. 

But if he slept with two wives, he'd actually get more radiation from them than the nuclear power plant. 

'Please remember Dr Teller had scientifically fact checked this,' she added with a grin.

Mrs Rinehart had earlier called for the elderly and students to be allowed to work more hours without losing pension or welfare benefits and reducing paperwork and legal restrictions.

'Just imagine the smiles when we can finally fill those jobs in the bush and see hospitals and health centres hours and effectiveness improved,' she said.

Gina Rinehart sent her strongest message about the expensive bill farmers were facing to meet zero emission CO2 targets

She also wanted more money spent on services in mining areas which generated high income.

'Frankly, we should have the best equipped and most luxurious hospitals in Newman, Dampier, Port Hedland and other mining towns thanks to the revenue we create in the Pilbara and similarly in other mining areas,' she said.

'And ditto, 24 hour 365 days a year airstrips so the better equipped and fastest Royal Flying Doctor planes can always arrive.

'Us and our people in the outback would then be more safe.'

Why the menacing threat of China's spy balloon is just the latest proof that the People's Republic's insidious creep into the US is so much more than conspiratorial hot air: A major probe by TOM LEONARD

What could a giant balloon over a Montana nuclear weapons base, a corn mill on 300 acres of prime North Dakota farmland, a wind farm in a windless stretch of Texas, a popular social media platform, and a nondescript office building in downtown Manhattan possibly have in common?

The answer is causing growing alarm among US politicians and officials - for it's China.

Now, after the eyes of millions of Americans turned to the skies - tracking a suspected Chinese spy balloon drifting over the country for days - hard experience has taught America to assume the worst when it comes to Beijing.

Fears of growing Chinese Communist government surveillance of Americans are no longer the stuff of spy movies and conspiracy theories.

The threat is real. And whether it's unusual purchases of agricultural land near military installations, clandestine police stations, suspicious algorithms, or balloons, they all in one form or another pose a potential risk to America's national security.

COMMUNIST EYES IN THE SKIES

Beijing will no doubt complain bitterly if U.S. politicians, experts and ordinary citizens get their demand to shoot down the suspected high-altitude surveillance tool floating over America.

China has rejected accusations it is a spy balloon, claiming it was actually a 'civilian airship' used mainly for weather research. But that explanation was quickly knocked down by the Pentagon. 'The fact is, we know that it's a surveillance balloon,' said a spokesman.

Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor aircraft were scrambled to 66,000 feet after the balloon was detected in US airspace and they were apparently ready to blow it out of the sky.

President Joe Biden reportedly wanted to do just that until he backed off on the 'strong' recommendations of defense officials, who warned of collateral damage caused by falling debris.

However, when it drifted over the South Carolina coast, the balloon was intercepted by a fighter jet that knocked it out the sky with a missile on Saturday. 

The US - which has described the spy balloon as 'unacceptable and irresponsible' - has also challenged Chinese claims that it deviated from its planned course because of winds and has only 'limited self-steering capability'.

A Pentagon spokesman countered: 'The balloon is maneuverable, clearly it's violated US air space, and again we've communicated that fact to the [People's Republic of China].' That's why the balloon's flight path over the super-sensitive Malmstrom Air Force Base, one of the bases that houses America's intercontinental ballistic missile arsenal, raised concern.

Malmstrom AFB, known as America's 'doomsday' base, maintains 150 Minuteman III ICBs across 13,800 square miles of central Montana, making it the biggest complex of nuclear arms in the western hemisphere.

Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor aircraft were scrambled to 66,000 feet after the balloon was detected in US airspace and they were apparently ready to blow it out of the sky.

 

However, sitting nearly smack down in the middle of Montana, 200 miles from Canada, it is curious - to say the least - that a wayward balloon would just so happen to pass directly over it.

The military says the balloon would only have been capable of capturing images of limited intelligence value and nothing that would not have been visible to Chinese satellites, but that has done little to calm nerves.

In response to the incident, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken cancelled a weekend visit to China, offering to reschedule under different 'conditions.' Blinken would have been the first Biden administration cabinet secretary to visit China and the first secretary of state to go there in five years.

Whether or not the balloin was intended to spy or disrupt the Blinken visit remains to be proven, but those tasked with America's national security are understandably reluctant to take anything China says at face value. 

DC AGREES ON ONE THING - CHINA IS NOT A FRIEND

US suspicions over Chinese government 'infiltration' - shared by both Republicans and Democrats - are hardly surprising given that China's autocratic premier Xi Jinping has increasingly demanded the country's businesses conform to the aims of the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Chinese corporations are left in little doubt by the Beijing regime that they exist principally to further government goals rather than make profits.

Last month, Florida governor Ron DeSantis announced that he intended to ban big and 'aggressive' Chinese land purchases in his state.

'You don't want them buying farmland, controlling our food supply. You don't want them near military bases,' he said. 'But do you want them building a resort in Florida either? I don't.'

Now, Gov DeSantis has regularly warned about China. Last year, he sounded the alarm shortly after a report showed Chinese real estate investors spent more than $6 billion in the US in a year - more than investors from any other foreign country. And sunny Florida appears to be their favorite - accounting for nearly a quarter of all similar purchases in the US.

DeSantis is hardly a lone voice. In December, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer cheered the Biden administration's move to block CCP-backed technology company, YMTC, from purchasing critical technology from U.S. businesses.

'The entanglements of these companies with the CCP and the Chinese military are too treacherous,' he declared. The question for American policymakers today is: How 'entangled' are we? 

 

LAND GRABS WITH 'CURIOUS NEIGHBORS'

Major land purchases by Chinese entities now rarely pass off without controversy - particularly when there appears to be a military dimension.

According to the US Department of Agriculture, Chinese ownership of American farmland has soared 20-fold in a decade from $81 million in 2010 to $1.8 billion in 2020. And several Chinese firms have in recent years bought or tried to buy large plots of land near US armed forces bases.

In November 2021, the city of Grand Forks in North Dakota announced that Fufeng Group, headquartered in Shandong, China, wanted to build a corn mill there on a vast muddy stretch of land.

The company had identified a 370-acre plot that just happened to be only 12 miles from Grand Forks Air Force Base, which in turn just happens to be home to some of America's key intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.

The base hosts the 319th Reconnaissance Wing which operates the RQ-4 Global Hawk, a high-altitude, remotely piloted surveillance plane, and will also house a crucial new space communications center.

The information that flows through this facility form 'the backbone of all U.S. military communications across the globe,' according to South Dakota Congressman Dusty Johnson.

A coincidence or something else?

A letter sent to the Biden Administration by Johnson and 50 other Republicans warned of Fufeng Group's 'close links to the Chinese Communist Party.' In fact, the president of Fufeng, Li Xuechun, is allegedly an active member of the CCP.

'By law, Chinese businesses are required to bow to the demands of the Chinese Communist Party - a regime that hates us and wants to overtake the United States at every opportunity,' said Senator Marco Rubio, Vice Chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, summing up these land purchase fears. 'We shouldn't treat this as a regular real estate deal.'

On Tuesday, after more than a year of debate, the U.S. Air Force warned that the 'project presents a significant threat to national security.'

In a sharp about-face, the mayor of Grand Forks said he'll do what he can to block construction. Just a few years ago, Mayor Brandon Bochenski was celebrating the investment. But times have changed.

There have been other such moves and the fact that Chinese-owned companies get major financial backing from Beijing (which, say observers, rarely approves anything without an ulterior motive) has convinced analysts they're part of a strategy.

In 2016, a Houston-based subsidiary of China's Xinjiang Guanghui Industry Investment Group paid an estimated $110 million for some 140,000 acres in Val Verde County, Texas.

The company's owner, Chinese billionaire Sun Guangxin - another member of the Chinese Communist Party and former People's Liberation Army officer - said he wanted to build the Blue Hills Wind Farm on part of the land so he could have access to the state's electricity grid.

Skeptics were struck that not only was there little wind in this part of the state but - as in Grand Forks, N.D. - about the only other thing of note in Val Verde was an important military base. Laughlin Air Force Base is the largest pilot training center in the US Air Force.

In 2020, Texas congressman and former CIA officer Will Hurd, who has talked of the 'new Cold War against China', called on the federal government to halt the wind farm plan on national security grounds.

The case prompted Texas lawmakers to pass a new law, the Lone Star Infrastructure Protection Act - which became law in 2021 - banning companies and other entities 'owned or controlled' by China, Russia, North Korea and Iran from making deals involving critical infrastructure in the state.

BEIJING'S INSIDIOUS INVOLVMENT

One of the most elusive aspects of this Beijing-sponsored challenge to America is that it is cloaked in a veneer of legitimacy. But as lawmakers have observed, in Communist China all businesses answer to the state. That reality has cast suspicion over any Chinese infiltration of a critical American industry - like food production.

In California, Democrat legislators led a recent attempt to block foreign buyers from snapping up any more of its precious farmland. The state grows a third of America's vegetables, and two-thirds of all its fruit and nuts.

The bill - which didn't specifically mention China although it was clearly the main target - was passed by the California legislature only to be blocked by California governor Gavin Newsom.

Sen Melissa Hurtado (Dem), who introduced it, warned: 'Food can, and is, being used as a weapon like we are seeing in Ukraine.'

The outcry over Chinese ownership of major US pork producer Smithfield is a case in point.

The company, whose products can usually be found in any American supermarket, was bought in 2013 by the conglomerate WH Group, based in Hong Kong. It was the biggest ever takeover of a US company by a Chinese one and triggered a congressional hearing.

Despite experts' warnings that the US might ultimately regret the $4.7 billion deal and it gave a Chinese too much control over America's pork industry, it was allowed to go through. When food supplies became a major headache during the pandemic, Smithfield - based in Virginia - was accused of ramping up its exports of meat to China to record levels at the expense of feeding Americans.

In some parts of the US, the arrival of a Chinese company is enough to provoke horror even if its intentions appear entirely benign.

Semcorp, a Shanghai-based tech company which the biggest producer of a key component of lithium-ion batteries, promised to invest $1 billion in a new factory that would create 1,200 jobs in Sidney, Ohio.

The state has been hit particularly hard by job losses but local people who complained at it being a Chinese company won loud applause at a public meeting last spring to consider tax breaks for the company. 'They are not our friends,' said a resident. 'Think of your grandchildren and great-grandchildren when you have to explain you approved this to a company from China.'

Despite the objections, the project is going ahead.

CHINESE POLICE STATION IN THE BIG APPLE

In a testament to the brazenness of the autocratic Beijing regime, even their police are now operating secretly in the US.

Weeks ago, it emerged that the FBI is actively cracking down on a US-wide network of covert Chinese police stations. These very unofficial outposts - including one in Manhattan's Chinatown that was raided by the FBI last fall - are reportedly collecting intelligence, investigating crimes and generally keeping watch on Chinese abroad.

In October, DailyMail.com visited this NYC office of the CCP, located above a ramen shop and next to an acupuncturist. Locals said the location was closed and rarely opened.

The Chinese government promotes these locations as resources for Chinese nationals and say the program has 'persuaded' 230,000 Chinese citizens to return home since April 2021. But human rights organizations claim these stations are guided by a much more sinister purpose - an intimidation campaign.

'Nothing seems to be too impressive or too harsh,' Harth said. 'That's a clear message to anyone seeking to leave China, or already left China: that you're not safe anywhere.'

These secret cop shops - which reportedly also operate in 100 locations throughout Europe and in Japan - make no attempt to work with local law enforcement and have no diplomatic status. It is unclear who works at these facilities.

In October, DailyMail.com visited this NYC office of the CCP, located above a ramen shop and next to an acupuncturist. Locals said the location was closed and rarely opened.

But even Chinese state news media reporting has alluded to the true purposes of these offices, according to the New York Times. Articles have described the outposts as intelligence collection apparatus.

Many of those reports have reportedly since been deleted.

OMINOUS ONLINE CONCERN

Finally, China is also accused of threatening US national security in the digital world. Bipartisan concern has focused on TikTok, the wildly popular social media platform that is used relentlessly by more than two-thirds of US teenagers.

Brendan Carr, the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), has led the charge against TikTok. He welcomed Congress last month approving a bill to ban the social media app it from devices issued to federal employees. Half of all states already banned it from their government devices and a bipartisan bill was introduced in Congress last month to scrub it completely in the U.S.

Mr Carr told DailyMail.com that TikTok was a 'very significant threat' to the US.

Despite initials denials, TikTok has been found to have used the app to spy on US reporters writing about the platform and allowed the Beijing regime's propaganda arm to covertly criticize US politicians ahead of last year's midterm elections.

Mr Carr also noted that China has set out to dominate the world in artificial intelligence. 'And whenever we use TikTok, we're improving China's AI,' he said. 'That could be used for very malign purposes down the road.'

'There's plenty of reasons to be concerned on TikTok on the national security front which is why we've seen bipartisan consensus,' he said.

Chinese penetration of the US - both physical and cyber - is diverse and growing. While some of the holdings of Chinese companies in America are undoubtedly innocent, the fact that Beijing puppet-masters may be pulling the strings is a glaring cause for concern.

Right now, Republicans and Democrats in Washington, DC, seem to be aware of the national security threat posed - the question is whether the country can counter it.

Aerospace giant Airbus has revealed designs for a futuristic three-deck space station with cozy living quarters and even a greenhouse.

The 26ft-wide concept is billed as being more spacious than existing stations and could be launched within the next decade.

Designed for a four-person crew, the 'LOOP' module hosts three floors including a habitation deck and a science deck that are connected by a central tunnel.

The final floor is set to be a centrifuge that creates Earth-like gravitational conditions - reducing the stress of weightlessness on the human body.

A three-storey column will mark the centre of the station's structure, acting as a greenhouse for growing crops.

AIRBUS SPACE STATION: KEY FACTS 

This is an extension of what is currently available on the International Space Station (ISS), where astronauts have grown vegetables such as radishes for dinner. 

Airbus' plans are designed to be compatible with the upcoming generation of super-heavy launchers - set to be the tallest and most powerful rockets to one day take humans to space.

Among these is SpaceX's Starship, which yesterday exploded during its maiden orbital test flight. 

The vehicle is central to Elon Musk's vision of one day landing humans on Mars. 

Airbus' 'LOOP' design also comes at a time when the ISS continues to be used well beyond its initial 15-year lifetime.

The iconic observatory has acted as the largest modular space station for 35 years and is expected to deorbit in 2030. 

In a statement, Airbus said: 'Coupling an extensive experience in human spaceflight with the ingenuity and innovative spirit of its teams, Airbus is ready to take the next step towards the Space Station of the future: With the Airbus LOOP, a multi-purpose orbital module.'  

The aerospace giant also said that the module could be used for 'commercial or institutional' purposes in future as well as a post-ISS use.

The LOOP module is designed to host four people but can accommodate eight at a time 

The aerospace giant also said that the module could be used for 'commercial or institutional' purposes in future

Although it is designed to host four people, the station could temporarily host eight astronauts at a time.

It will also be completely operational once in orbit and protected thanks to its rigid outer shell.

Airbus added: 'The Airbus LOOP is designed to make long-term stays in Space comfortable and enjoyable for its inhabitants, while supporting efficient and sustainable operations at the same time. 

'It builds on everything that has been learnt over the decades and fully exploits the potential of tomorrow's technologies in order to best support humanity's future in Space: In Low-Earth or Lunar Orbit, or on long-term missions to Mars.'

EXPLAINED: THE $100 BILLION INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION SITS 250 MILES ABOVE THE EARTH

The International Space Station (ISS) is a $100 billion (£80 billion) science and engineering laboratory that orbits 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.

It has been permanently staffed by rotating crews of astronauts and cosmonauts since November 2000. 

Crews have come mainly from the US and Russia, but the Japanese space agency JAXA and European space agency ESA have also sent astronauts. 

The International Space Station has been continuously occupied for more than 20 years and has been expended with multiple new modules added and upgrades to systems 

Research conducted aboard the ISS often requires one or more of the unusual conditions present in low Earth orbit, such as low-gravity or oxygen.

ISS studies have investigated human research, space medicine, life sciences, physical sciences, astronomy and meteorology.

The US space agency, NASA, spends about $3 billion (£2.4 billion) a year on the space station program, with the remaining funding coming from international partners, including Europe, Russia and Japan.

So far 244 individuals from 19 countries have visited the station, and among them eight private citizens who spent up to $50 million for their visit.

There is an ongoing debate about the future of the station beyond 2025, when it is thought some of the original structure will reach 'end of life'.

Russia, a major partner in the station, plans to launch its own orbital platform around then, with Axiom Space, a private firm, planning to send its own modules for purely commercial use to the station at the same time. 

NASA, ESA, JAXA and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) are working together to build a space station in orbit around the moon, and Russia and China are working on a similar project, that would also include a base on the surface.

The effects of global warming on wildlife and human health, like the threat of expanding regions of unlivable 'wet bulb' temperatures, have been well publicized by now. And some may not live long enough to see the true impact. 

But these lesser known effects, as agriculture adapts to the temperature changes well under way, have already been happening right under consumers noses as they roll their snifter glasses or aerate their wine.

But it's not all doom and gloom for wineries: an Oxford University team has discovered that global warming is at least improving the wine quality in Bordeaux

But it's not all doom and gloom for wineries: an Oxford University team has discovered that global warming is at least improving the wine quality in Bordeaux.

An analysis of 50 years' worth of wine scores from the celebrated French wine region revealed that recent years with warmer summers and wetter winters has resulted in better vintages.

And these conditions are expected to become more common, thanks to climate change.

'Generally, we are seeing a trend across the world that with greater warming, wines are getting stronger,' said Andrew Wood, lead author.

'The trend, whether that's driven by the preferences of wine critics or the general population, is that people generally prefer stronger wines which age for longer and give you richer, more intense flavors, higher sweetness, and lower acidity,' Wood said.

Another distinct trend over the past decade has been that the regions thought of as 'wine country' have shifted northward, as temperatures heat up, starting at the equator, forcing whole vineyards to move. 

Of all alcoholic drinks, wine will be the most sensitive to climate change, with the grapes used already carefully scrutinized for acidity, sugar levels and chemical make-up, maturity, and dozens of soil composition and microbiological effects that contribute to what experts call 'terroir.' 

But the hops used in beer, the sugar cane in rum, and many other key crops for alcohol production will feel the impact as well.

This year, researchers at the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague made the alarming discovery that beer hop yields were likely to become less 'hoppy,' and therefore less bitter as rising temperatures altered the growing season.

The team collected data on beer hop yield and 'alpha' content between 1971 and 2018 from 90 percent of the European beer hop growing regions in Germany, Czechia and Slovenia.

The hops, which gives beer its unique reedy flavor, contain compounds called 'alpha acids' that contribute to its bitter aroma and overall quality.

Their report, published in Nature this Tuesday, discovered that compared to before 1994, hops now start ripening 20 days earlier ""” shifting the critical ripening period and reducing their alpha acid content.

Analysis also reveals that hop production has declined by almost 0.22 tons per hectare per year, and the alpha bitter content has decreased by about 0.6 percent.

By combining past data with climate models, the researchers estimate that beer hops yield could be reduced by up to 18 percent, and alpha acid content could be reduced by up to 31 percent, by 2050.

The Caribbean sugarcane crops upon which classic kinds of rum depend could be swallowed up by rising sea levels and choked out by heat-resistant weeds

But the risks of climate change for some higher proof spirits can be much more dire that flavor. 

The Caribbean sugarcane crops upon which many classic kinds of rum depend could be swallowed up by rising oceans and choked out by heat-resistant weeds.

Last month, a study led by French chemical engineers at Toulouse University's 'Laboratoire de GÃ©nie Chimique' reported that 'weeds such as Rottboellia cochinchinensis, Ipomea plebeia and Digitaria sanguinalis are expected to increase under high-temperature conditions.'

Ironically, evaporating and overused fresh water will also plague the sugarcane crops, the researchers noted, compounding the industries troubles from shrinking plantation sizes and rising sea levels.

More land-locked spirits face their own challenges as well. 

'Look at the big brands who are sourcing commodity grains,' spirits industry reporter Brian Freedman told PBS NewsHour, 'Climate change is wreaking havoc with that.' 

Freedman wrote a book on the topic, entitled 'Crushed: How a Changing Climate Is Altering the Way We Drink,' and found that the wild upheavals of climate uncertainty ""” from floods, to droughts, to new invasive pest species ""” magnifies problems for both farms and the alcohol producers who depend on them.   

'If there's floods at a commodity grain farm in Saskatchewan, the big brands can maybe absorb that pricing a little bit,' Freedman said. 'But when you're making millions and millions of bottles, what does that do to the bottom line?' 

'These are still businesses,' he said. 

The risk of more dramatic and intense storms, as the earth's overheated atmosphere roils to a boil, is hard to quantify. For example, in June 2018, one whisky and bourbon warehouse at the 1792 Barton Distillery in Bardstown, Kentucky was ravaged by a freak twister

The alcohol beat reporter also pointed out the hard-to-quantify risk of more dramatic and intense storms, as the earth's overheated atmosphere roils to a boil. 

On June 22, 2018 in Bardstown, Kentucky, one whisky and bourbon warehouse, Warehouse 30 at the 1792 Barton Distillery, was ravaged by a freak twister.

'This whiskey was effectively knocked over by this rogue tornado,' Freedman said.

The result of the increasing number of accidents of this kind has been 5-figure novelty bottles of high-priced 'tornado surviving whiskeys.' 

But, if there's one thing the whole alcohol industry is focused on, it is water scarcity and their role in making the problem worse. 

Diageo PLC, whose brands include Guinness, Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff, and Captain Morgan rum, said that even their efforts at sustainable water use feel inefficient and leave the industry unprotected for the unexpected.

'You could be with the most efficient brewery or distillery in the world,' Alexander told TIME magazine. 'But it's still not going to mitigate your risk if there's a drought.'

A slaughtered Longhorn at a college frat house that had been branded with profanity and sliced open is at the center of a police investigation.

The steer was found at the FarmHouse Fraternity house near the campus of Oklahoma State University in Stillwater Friday morning ahead of football championship game against the University of Texas-- whose mascot is a Longhorn. 

""˜F**k FH' was carved onto the cow's side and its stomach had been sliced open according to station KFOR.

The animal had been killed in the last 24 hours and was not killed on the lawn of the frat house, the outlet reported. 

Police are combing through surveillance video on Greek Row, reported ocolly.com, and speaking to area cattle owners as cows are not allowed within city limits.

The FarmHouse Fraternity says its members were not involved



Investigators believe the already dead Longhorn was dropped off overnight by what appeared to be a truck or trailer, based on tire tracks.

OSU's football team is set to play against the Texas Longhorns Saturday in Dallas for the Big 12 Championship game-- which this year includes a half time show headlined by rapper Nelly. 

The fraternity denied that its members were involved in a statement obtained by local station KOCO.

'No FarmHouse member was involved in this incident and we do not condone cruelty or defacing of livestock in any manner,' the statement revealed.

They added that they called police as soon as they found the slain cattle.

'Oklahoma State University is appalled at the disturbing display of animal cruelty that occurred overnight at an off-campus location near a fraternity house,' the school said in a statement.

'Oklahoma State expects all students to adhere to university codes of conduct, and appropriate action will be taken based on the outcome of the investigation.'

It's unclear if the Longhorn's slaying is related to the football game.

Woman robbed of right arm in horrifying farming accident 20 years ago gets brain-powered bionic arm (and it's so good she can now use a screwdriver!)

Remarkable video shows a woman using a bionic arm so sensitive it can pick up a screwdriver and coins ""” using just the power of her thoughts.

The Swedish woman, known only as Karin, suffered a devastating farming accident 20 years ago that robbed her of her right arm. 

Over the last two decades she has suffered excruciating phantom limb pain, leaving her feeling like she 'constantly had [her] hand in a meat grinder'. 

Karin also found conventional prostheses uncomfortable and unreliable.

In hope of creating an alternative that can be fully attached to a stump and a provide better range of motion, a team of engineers and surgeons from Sweden, Australia, Italy and the US developed an improved prosthetic limb. 

The woman, known only as Karin, (pictured) suffered a devastating farming accident twenty years ago that robbed her of her right arm. Over the last two decades she has suffered excruciating phantom limb pain, leaving her feeling like she 'constantly had [her] hand in a meat grinder'

But a team of engineers and surgeons from Sweden , Australia, Italy and the US developed a prosthetic limb and permanently attached it to her bone via surgery. Electrodes implanted into her nerves and muscles enable the device to connect with her nervous system

Prior to surgery, Karin (pictured) said she found conventional prostheses uncomfortable, unreliable and of little help in daily life. She added: 'It felt like I constantly had my hand in a meat grinder, which created a high level of stress and I had to take high doses of various painkillers. 'For me, this research has meant a lot, as it has given me a better life'

Two titanium prongs were permanently inserted into her bone to act as the joining point between her arm and the prosthesis. 

This type of surgery ""” called osseointegration ""” is key to the new bionic tech, which was developed by Prensilia, an Italian prosthetics firm. 

It replaces the need for a socket to attach an amputee's limb to their prosthetic, which can be uncomfortable, ill-fitting and difficult to put on and remove. 

Next, electrodes were implanted into her severed nerves and arm muscles and hooked up to the arm.

As a result, the gadget can pick up signals made by her motor commands ""” the biological process that triggers the body's movements.

Actions ""” such as picking up a glass or closing a suitcase zip ""” are then played out in real-time, with the goal of making day-to-day life easier for amputees.

Karin's surgery took place 'years' ago but is only now being paraded by experts.

Speaking of her phantom limb pain, a phenomenon that has baffled doctors, she said: 'It felt like I constantly had my hand in a meat grinder, which created a high level of stress and I had to take high doses of various painkillers. 

'For me, this research has meant a lot, as it has given me a better life.'

As it stands, the NHS does not fund the use of the advanced bionic arm attached to Karin.

However, NHS England announced last November that dozens of amputees would now have access to similar bionic arms which can mimic real hand movements. 

Previously, prosthetics given on the NHS were basic models, with limited open and close motions. Others were cosmetic with no practical function.

Experts said the bionic arms ""” estimated to cost between £25,000 and £80,000 ""” can be used by those as young as nine. 

Eligible patients must have enough residual upper arm muscles to send signals that create intuitive movements. 

The device converts electrical impulses from the muscles in the upper arm into movement powered by motors in bionic arm, enabling a user to hold a glass or close a suitcase. But key to the new bionic technology developed by Prensilia, an Italian prosthetics company, is osseointegration

But the robotic hand used by Karin features unique motor and sensory components that allowed the user to carry out 80 per cent of every day activities, the researchers claim. During the surgery, Karin's nerves and muscles in the remaining part of her arm were re-arranged to provide a source of motor control information to the prosthesis

Professor Max Ortiz Catalan, who led the research, said: 'Karin was the first person with below-elbow amputation who received this new concept of a highly integrated bionic hand that can be used independently and reliably in daily life'

Professor Max Ortiz Catalan, of the Bionics Institute in Australia, said: 'Karin was the first person with below-elbow amputation who received this new concept of a highly integrated bionic hand that can be used independently and reliably in daily life.'

'The fact she has been able to use her prosthesis comfortably and effectively in daily activities for years is a promising testament to the potential life-changing capabilities of this novel technology for individuals facing limb loss.'

Meanwhile, Professor Rickard BrÃ¥nemark, an associate professor at Gothenburg University, who led the surgery, said Karin's results 'mark an important milestone for the field of advanced extremity reconstructions as a whole'.

A university graduate who was inspired to start dairy farming by Jeremy Clarkson was caught drunk at the wheel of his BMW at 2am when he was out celebrating the launch of his new business.

Jack Allwood was stopped by the police when they saw him 'driving all over he road' in his BMW.

The 24 year old had downed four pints of lager that night in celebration of launching his new 'healthy' milkshake business, Mootrition, the next day.

He was planning to supply different flavoured milkshakes made fresh from his cows at his family's farm in Huntington village, near the cathedral city of Chester.

But after he was caught drink driving at one and a half times the alcohol limit in his 320i - which has a price range of £39,605 to £58,925 - he delayed the launch.

Jack Allwood had downed four pints of lager to celebrate the launch of his new business Mootrition when he was caught drunk at the wheel

Allwood, whose family have farmed at Huntington Hall Farm for four generations and for over 100 years, had just gone public about his new business

Allwood was fined £400 at Chester magistrates court after he pleaded guilty to driving with excess alcohol.

He will pay a victim surcharge of £280 and has been banned from driving for 14 months.   

Allwood, whose family have farmed at Huntington Hall Farm for four generations and for over 100 years, had just gone public about his new business.

Inspired by watching Jeremy Clarkson's Farm on TV, the graduate wanted to follow in his footsteps and improve the marketing of the industry.

He told Cheshire Live: 'I personally think that milk is looked upon poorly and the health benefits haven't been marketed well since I've been alive.

'The only positive image I have seen in terms of marketing of farmers and farming in my life is Clarkson's Farm on TV and he's not even a farmer. 

'I just want to see if I can build a brand and a successful business and educate people as to how milk is produced.'

After studying agriculture at university, Allwood planned to follow in his family's footsteps and begin dairy farming

But at 2.20am on August 31, officers in an unmarked vehicle caught up with Allwood in his BMW on Sandy Lane in Chester, three miles from the farm.

Prosecutor Laura Davig said: 'They received information of a black BMW series 3 which was described as driving all over the road. 

'Officers requested the defendant to pull over which he did. Officers spoke with the defendant and noticed that he smelt of intoxicants. 

'He was asked if he had been drinking, he said that he had consumed around four pints earlier in the evening.

'Due to this, a roadside breath test was requested which the defendant failed. 

'He was arrested and conveyed to the custody suite where an evidential breath test was taken. The defendant has no previous convictions.'

Tests showed Allwood had 48 micrograms of alcohol in 100 milliliters of breath, the legal limit being 35mg.

In mitigation, defence lawyer Michael Gray said: 'This is the first time that Mr Allwood has been before the court, or ever been in trouble in his life.. He comes from a farming background. 

'You can see that he has studied agriculture at university. He has just started up a business in agriculture now. 

'Which means that as he tried to get it off the ground he has set himself back.

'He is going to be off the road. Much of what he does involves driving around the farms and the locality.

'In relation to this incident itself, on the day he had some drinks, he had something to eat, and that was it. 

'He had not intended to drive anywhere. He got a call from a friend in Chester who was in distress, so he decided to go and help.

'He didn't think at all about how much he had in terms of drink and he felt fine driving. He does not accept driving around all over the road. 

'He was looking for his friend and trying to get the attention of his friend who he had come to help.

'He knows that he is going to be disqualified. There are going to be repercussions for his business but these are issues that he will have to overcome.

'He apologises for what has taken place. He thought he was OK to drive, he clearly was not.'

Allwood was offered a place on a drink drive awareness course which will reduce his ban by a quarter.

JP Francis Geekie warned him not to risk driving while disqualified and added: 'I know how tempting that must be working on a farm, do not get on the road. 

'If you get caught, even for a very short distance, particularly if you have an accident, it's highly likely that you will go to prison.'

They came at breakfast time to murder Theo Bekker, smashing an iron bar stolen from his own farmyard into his skull before slitting his throat so he bled to death.

His four teenage attackers then tied up his wife, Marlinda, and put a plastic bag over her head before she slipped into unconsciousness. Mercifully, she survived.

In South Africa, where the murder rate is soaring, the killing of 79-year-old Mr Bekker on July 30 still had the capacity to horrify. This week at the Afrikaans Dutch Reformed church half a mile from the Bekkers' cream-coloured farmhouse, Minister Johan Bouwer told the Mail: 'The couple came here to Sunday services. Marlinda was a regular every week; Theo would attend if he was not busy on the farm.

'At a memorial service for him, the church was packed, with white Afrikaans farming families and black people from the area who paid their last respects to him.'

Bouwer's wife, Rietha, added: 'We have been terrified by Theo's murder. Sometimes we Afrikaners feel like running from South Africa. But it is the only country we know, where we were born.'

Julius Sello Malema during the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) 10th Anniversary at FNB Stadium in Johannesburg on July 29

The farm of Theo and Marlinda Bekker near the town of Grootvlei some 100km south of Johannesburg, South Africa

Marlinda and Theo Bekker: Theo was bludgeoned to death while Marlinda miraculously survived the attack 

Twenty-four hours before Mr Bekker's killing, the nation's most controversial politician, Julius Malema, had chanted an anthem entitled 'Kill the Boer' ""” a term for white farmers ""” at a rally of 90,000 followers.

High above the dancing crowd in Johannesburg's black township of Soweto, Malema was raised on an electric platform like a king.

Sporting his signature red beret, the self-proclaimed 'freedom fighter' mimicked the sound of a sub-machine gun ""” 'Pah, pah, brrr!' ""” as he shouted out his race-baiting song calling for the death of his white countrymen.

This ugly rally marked the 10th anniversary of the founding of Malema's party, Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). It declares itself Marxist-Leninist, wants to seize private property without compensation ""” particularly farms such as Theo Bekker's ""” just as Malema's hero, Robert Mugabe, did in neighbouring Zimbabwe.

It demands the nationalisation of the banks and gold mines, and promises to enforce state control along the lines of communist Cuba. Terrifyingly, it could get its way. The EFF is the fastest-growing party in South Africa and Malema, who was raised by a single mother in a black township, the nation's most forceful political leader.

After next year's elections, he could become Vice President. In vast swathes of the country ""” twice the size of France and with a population approaching 60 million ""” support for Malema, particularly among young blacks, is soaring.

It outstrips that for the ruling African National Congress (ANC), where Malema cut his political teeth as Youth League Leader before forming his breakaway party.

The Democratic Alliance (DA), a leading opposition party popular among the middle class, has robustly condemned Malema's anthem. Agriculture spokesperson Noko Masipa said last week: 'The Theo Bekker murder, coupled with Julius Malema's incitement to 'Kill the Boer', has raised serious red flags. We must not turn a blind eye to the dangerous rhetoric aimed at one particular group [whites] of our society.'

The hideous 'Kill the Boer' rant has also been denounced by the world's richest man, South African-born Elon Musk, who claimed Malema is orchestrating 'white genocide' and should be stopped from singing it.

South Africa's ANC President, Cyril Ramaphosa, has remained silent, while the country's human rights court has ruled that any rendition of 'Kill the Boer' is not a hate crime.

No matter that the killings of white farmers have reached epic proportions. In the past 20 years there has been a farm attack every two days and a murder every five days, with whites of Afrikaans or English descent mainly targeted.

According to figures given to the Mail, there have been 42 murders on farms this year ""” more than one a week. Some of these atrocities were praised on social-media sites popular with young blacks.

Dr Theo De Jager, who runs a farmers' rights organisation, says the small town of Grootvlei, an hour's drive from Johannesburg, where the Bekkers raised cattle, is a hotspot for crimes committed by jobless black South Africans facing poverty and hunger.

Chillingly, the country is increasingly riven by race, 29 years after the detested apartheid system ended. Apartheid segregated black and white people by law, forcing them to live separately. The cruel, racist government suppressed the job and education prospects of those with darker skins.

Negotiations with the ruling white minority Nationalist Party to introduce a non-racial democracy were led by Nelson Mandela, who had spent 27 years in jail before his release in 1990.

In 1994, he became the first elected president of the African National Congress (ANC) when it formed a new government in the 'rainbow nation'.

Jacques Broodryk says that farm attacks and farm murders are not helped when politicians like Julius Male sing the song 'Kill the Boer, Kill the Farmer'

Under Mandela, the country's annual GDP growth initially reached an impressive six per cent. However, the ANC soon imposed a ruthless black empowerment programme that put paid to that.

White state workers ""” from energy experts and nurses to transport planners ""” were ordered to re-apply for their jobs. Few got them back again.

Andrew Kenny, a respected South African commentator, said recently: 'The ANC has been a disaster, especially for ordinary black people whom it has impoverished while making a tiny ANC elite fabulously rich.

'After apartheid, our electricity provided the world's cheapest energy; freight trains carried our ore (from the mines) to the ports; there was a good passenger network for workers. The ANC wrecked it with looting, corruption and a plethora of racist policies.'

The result has been economic collapse and mass exodus. A fifth of whites ""” both Afrikaans and English speakers ""” have left since the ANC came to power.

Emigration among the entrepreneurial Indian-descended community is high, too.

Meanwhile, the middle class have abandoned the ANC-controlled cities of Johannesburg and Pretoria in the north ""” now plagued by no-go areas, ransacked shops, gang warfare and other crime fuelled by unemployment.

They have settled in the Western Cape, the only part of South Africa that is run by the moderate Democratic Alliance.

The speed of the country's descent has been devastating. Today, only 12 per cent of South Africans of working age pay income tax, while a third survive on £15-a-month state handouts.

World Bank analysts say a staggering 42 per cent of the adult population ""” the majority black ""” is unemployed.

'Afternoon Angels' feed hundreds of people everyday as the cost of living means many people survive by walking from soup kitchen to soup kitchen in search of a meal

Busisiwe Toni, 21, and her boyfriend collect their meals from the soup kitchen. She says she will be voting for the EFF and hopes that if they come to power, her dream of becoming a lawyer might happen.

Among 16- to 24-year-olds, the hardest hit by this economic ruin, six in ten are jobless. South Africa needs a growth rate of six per cent to provide enough work for these increasingly angry young people. Yet the International Monetary Fund predicts it will be just 0.3 per cent this year ""” far below that of Rwanda and Nigeria.

The United Nations recently warned that the young jobless tally posed 'a ticking time bomb'.

Amid the deprivation and poverty, it is the so-called 'Born Free' generation ""” those too young to remember the horrors of apartheid ""” who are turning to Julius Malema's fanatical EFF, promising him their vote at next May's critical national elections.

I found plenty of his supporters at Afternoon Angels, a food bank in the black township of Gugulethu, seven miles from central Cape Town. It houses tens of thousands of impoverished people in row upon row of metal huts which line the potholed roads.

In a 100-strong queue waiting for a liver and rice meal was Busisiwe Tonisi, 21, with four of her female friends. She passed her high school matriculation with a high maths mark, but has never worked. 'I dream of being a lawyer but I haven't the money to study. I am desperate. I will vote EFF because the ANC hasn't helped us black South Africans. Most of us here back Julius Malema.'

Also waiting was Aphelele Mapupu, 19, a talented portrait artist who has perfect English in a country that has 12 official languages. He dropped out of school in his mid-teens and now lives in a ramshackle shed near the food bank with four of his brothers and their extended family.

When he takes me there, the backyard is littered with empty lager cans alongside a cannabis plant growing in the sunshine.

As we chat about the fortunes of his beloved Chelsea FC, he says: 'I have tried for work, but the bosses make excuses because I left before exams. I will vote EFF. It is the politics of desperation. We are hungry every day.'

So, what will firebrand Julius Malema offer Aphelele and other 'Born Free' South Africans?

The EFF leader says he plans to transform the country into a new Cuba, which he describes ""” astonishingly ""” as a successful socialist state.

A rather different view of the Communist-run Caribbean island came recently from Dr Christopher Sabatini, senior fellow for Latin America at London think tank Chatham House, who described Cuba as an 'economic basket case'.

In an interview on South Africa's Biz News, Dr Sabatini warned that 100,000 Cubans have fled their homeland this year because of poverty or malnutrition. The average wage of state workers is £17 a month ""” enough to buy one Gouda cheese. And hospitals are so short of money that patients have to bring their own bed sheets.

All this, of course, is likely to pass Malema by. As an MP, he boasted of his power earlier this year in a bizarre rant at the national parliament, where EFF has 10 per cent of the seats. 'I've got you by the scrotum,' he boasted. 'I am in charge. There is nothing you can do . . . even all of you combined. You can scream anyhow you want ""” black opposition, white opposition. I want that to sink in.'

And this may be the unpalatable truth. National polling for next year's elections predict the ruling ANC will make a weak showing as South Africans lose hope in the party. It is expected to survive in government only by forging a coalition with Malema's EFF, despite its pledge to destroy South African capitalism.

Malema, a millionaire many times over, makes his chanting supporters ""” who call themselves comrades ""” wear red overalls to show solidarity with the 'oppressed' working classes.

He sent his son to an expensive private school, in a country where state-educated black children have the world's lowest literacy rate. He lives with his designer-clad wife in one of the few safe parts of Johannesburg, a leafy suburb called Sandton.

And while he swears by public transport, he travels in Range Rovers and Mercedes and wears a Breitling watch that's worth a small fortune.

A South African journalist who obtained a list of Malema's credit card purchases revealed it included finery from Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Lacoste and Emporio Armani. Last week Malema sidestepped the Mail's request for an interview. He was busy ""” appearing in a magistrates court, where he faced charges of firing shots from a rifle on stage at a 2018 rally.

Farmer Sulie Piti sits in his mothers house in the township of Khayelitsha. He is a member of the ANC and says while he tries his best to better the conditions in the township, unemployment is creating conditions where more and more people are looking to support the EFF in next years elections

A video produced in court by prosecutors showed the weapon in his hands at the event. His lawyers insisted the video may have been faked.

As a result, Malema pleaded not guilty and the magistrate delayed a decision on the case until next month.

His fate is of little interest to one group of South Africans, the 'poor whites' who feel the brunt of the new racial divide.

Near Johannesburg, in the former gold-mining town of Krugersdorp, some 200 families live in a shanty camp next to a steaming rubbish tip and a slag heap left from the pit days.

In the depths of squalor, these forgotten people ""” predominantly Afrikaans ""” were once privileged on account of their skin colour. One of them, Driekie Wiese, 54, was a nurse at the local hospital, like her mother had been before her.

She had a good life and a brick house before the end of apartheid. 'I loved my job. I earned an income and was respected. Then came 1994,' she lisps through missing teeth.

Her nursing post was filled by a black South African and Driekie now makes money selling metal tins from the nearby tip and cleaning houses for £2 a day.

Her neighbour, schoolboy Morne Mulder, 16, fears for his prospects as a white Afrikaner. 'My dad worked in the mines. But it is closed now,' he says. 'Only a few people in this camp earn money by fixing cars, cleaning or panel beating . . . anything for a few rand to eat.

'I am not ashamed to tell you that we live in utter poverty.'

Driekie Wiese (left) and Morne Mulder, are pictured outside Morne's shack in the township of Munsieville, some 30km west of Johannesburg. Driekie is a trained nurse who lost her job when the ANC came into power

Meanwhile, Theo Bekker's farm remains locked up. After recovering in hospital from her ordeal, his widow, Marlinda, has moved to live with her son in the north of the country. It is unlikely she will ever return to the church and community she loved.

As her husband was bludgeoned to death, she recognised two of the four attackers as local black farm workers. After murdering her husband, and nearly killing her, they stole three firearms from the safe and escaped in Marlinda's Peugeot car.

They rolled it off the road two hours later, and the police found them as they tried to escape. The group, aged 16 to 19, will face assault, murder and gun theft charges in court later this year.

A few days after the Bekker atrocity, another farming couple were assaulted, 50 miles from the coastal city of Durban in the early morning.

Their attackers chanted the words from Malema's song after breaking into Tim and Amanda Platt's home.

Amanda says: 'One of them shouted, 'Kill the Boer' as he hit me. They were ruthless, but we fought back. Then they fled.'

Amanda was attacked with a bolt cutter, pieces of lead piping, and stabbed with a spear, says Jacques Broodyk, security head of the Afrikaans' civil rights organisation, AfriForum, which has mobilised 11,000 neighbourhood-watch volunteers to protect farms.

Mr Broodyk calls Malema a 'radical maniac' who sings 'Kill the Boer' deliberately to stir up racial hatred among his young supporters.

He ""” like many other South Africans ""” fears for his country if the extremist politician is voted to power next year, as looks increasingly likely.

Menu calorie labels rolled out in 2018 will prevent 45,000 obesity and cancer deaths and save $2.8BILLION in healthcare costs, study claims

Adding calorie totals to the labels of major US restaurants will save American lives and saved billions of dollars, a study suggests.

In May 2018, the US Department of Agriculture began requiring all chains with 20 locations or more to list the number of calories on their menus.

With an estimated 20 percent of all US meals being eaten at a restaurant, researchers believe the labeling change reduced the average amount of calories consumed per meal by 20 to 60.

The Tufts University team believes this contributed towards dropping the average American's weight by a pound per year. Over time, they think the change will prevent 28,000 obesity deaths and 16,700 from cancer over the next lifetime.

Tufts researchers built a model that finds that regulations that forced chain restaurants with more than 20 locations to put calorie figures on their menus has significantly reduced obesity rates ""” and helped prevent cancer cases as a result (file photo)

More than a dozen cancers are linked to obesity, and dropping rates of the condition can help bring down cancer rates too.

America is currently suffering an obesity crisis, with more than 40 percent of the population too fat. 

In-turn, this saves the nation as a whole millions in health care costs and keeps people in work, where they can continue to contribute to the economy.

Researchers estimate savings of $3billion long-term from this simple menu change alone. 

Tufts researchers say it is responsible for two in five cancer cases, including colorectal cancers appearing more in young people.

'It's important for us to continue to show consumers, policymakers, and industry how small changes can lead to big benefits,' Dr Mengxi Du, lead author of the study and nutritionist at Tufts, near Boston, said.

'Our population-level view suggests that these labels can be associated with substantial health gains and cancer-related healthcare cost savings that could be doubled with additional industry response.

'Such as by replacing high-calorie menu items with lower-calorie options or reformulating recipes.' 

Researchers speculate that presenting calories on menus forced many restaurants to scale down calories on their most unhealthy items.

Clearly displaying calorie markers on foods before a person orders can also spur them into choosing healthier options. 

Many nutritionists recommend against eating at restaurants, as food is more likely to contain excess salt, sugar and trans-fats.

It is also harder for a person to know what exactly is in their food because many menus do not come with full lists of ingredients.

However, dining out still accounts for a large portion of the US diet. A 2019 survey found that 56 percent of Americans eat out between two or three times a week.

American get around 20 percent of their calories from restaurant meals. 

The nine foods dietitians say are hampering your weight loss goals

 

Dried fruit may seem like a healthy option, but are easy to binge, and salads are too easy to get wrong

The Tufts research team built a model assuming 20 to 60 pounds would be dropped from every meal a person eats at a restaurant because of the labels. 

Over a year, this accounts for around a pound of weight loss. 

They believe the change in weight will prevent cases of obesity from forming. As a result, this will mean less of the 13 obesity-related cancers forming over time.

These include colorectal cancer, which experts have warned is rising among people under 65 ""” the age where the disease usually develops.

'From this research, we can see how labeling policies that effectively encourage consumers to make healthier dietary decisions are a form of cancer prevention""”they reduce an individual's chances of being obese and getting an obesity-associated cancer, while improving quality of life,' Dr Fang Fang Zhang, a cancer epidemiologist at Tufts, said.

'These policies don't require a lot of spend, especially when compared to cancer screening costs, but provide a lot of benefits.' 

Researchers believe the change in menu-labeling is most helpful for young people aged 20 to 44, who still have a long time to avoid lifestyle behaviors that put them at risk of cancer.

Reducing obesity rates can also prevent deaths from other diseases related to the condition, such as heart disease, diabetes and Alzheimer's.

Overall, the change could save around $3billion over the course of a lifetime.

But, it is unclear how much can actually be drawn from these numbers. There is little research on whether calorie labels effect consumer behavior.

The study assumes that restaurant eaters are making decisions based on calorie labels, if they are even looking at them at all.

It is also hard to tell whether businesses have adjusted their offerings in lieu of the new regulations five years ago.

'Whatever this is, it took my wife': Widower shares his heartbreak and shock after wife, 31, was killed by a rare FUNGUS that is growing across the US

A mother-of-one has died from a rare fungus that is spreading rapidly across the US.

Sonya Cruz, 31, from Kenosha, Wisconsin, died on July 5 from blastomycosis ""” an illness caused by the fungus blastomyces, which is mainly found in soil in wooded areas.

The rarity of the condition ""” with only one or two cases per 100,000 population per year in some states ""” meant she died after doctors initially failed to recognize the infection.

Her family are now trying to raise awareness of the infection, which can kill up to 78 percent of sufferers, in the hope others will not have to go through their heartbreak.

Mrs Cruz's husband, John Cruz, told Fox 6: 'My life. They took my life away from me. I'm not saying the hospital or whoever. Whatever this is, took my wife.'

The fungus is the same one that infected over 100 workers at a Michigan paper mill back in spring.

Deaths by blastomycosis infections are increasing, according to the Minnesota department of health. 

In 2021, it reported 82 cases of the infection. Most years, nine percent of people with blastomycosis die from the infection, but in 2021, 23 percent of patients died.

According to Morgan Hughes, Mrs Cruz's sister, a telecom company is digging around Mrs Cruz's home to install an underground cable.

Ms Hughes said the Wisconsin health department has opened up an investigation into her sister's death.

On June 16, Mrs Cruz went to the emergency room at St Katherine's hospital in Kenosha, Wisconsin, complaining of difficulty breathing. 

Doctors diagnosed her with pneumonia and sent her home with antibiotics.

A week and a half later, things had not improved and she went to her primary care physician.

She was admitted to St Katherine's where staff gave her more antibiotics and fluids. Two days later, she went into respiratory failure.

Mrs Cruz was put on a ventilator and sedated. She was given medication to keep her heart going because her blood pressure was slowly declining.

Doctors did a bronchoscopy and biopsy of her lungs, which came back as positive for blastomycosis.

Surveillance conducted in 2021 showed the hotspots for fungal infections across the US

Mr Cruz had never heard of the illness until his wife caught it.

He said: 'I can walk out here and swallow a bullet, not literally a bullet, but a bullet of that.

'I think this is something that needs to be shared around the world.'

Blastomyces tends to reside in moist soil, rotting wood and leaves. If the ground is disturbed, the spores can be thrown up into the air.

Scientists warn fungal infections are devastating crops on a hotter planet



The expert warns of a 'devastating' impact on wheat, rice, corn, soy beans, potatoes and other crops.

If the spores are inhaled, they can travel down to the lungs and cause a fungal infection. 

Symptoms include cough, fever, chills, muscle aches, joint pain, and chest pain.

It is not spread from person to person, but it can spread within an individual to other parts of the body like the skin or bones. 

The fungus can be deadly if not caught early. 

Mrs Cruz was given antifungal treatment but she sadly died after being in the hospital for just over a week.

The family set up a GoFundMe for Mrs Cruz, which said: 'We lost a ray of sunshine in this world. ""TeTe"" ""SoSo"" meant the world to so many around her. 

'She was and is surrounded by love with family, friends, her children and amazing husband, John.

'Myself, John and the family are asking if you can contribute to this fund, so we can celebrate her life in the way we feel she deserves.'

Dr Bruce Klein, from the University of Wisconsin Medical School, has studied the infection for almost 40 years.

He said reported cases in Wisconsin are uncommon and the infection is under-reported.

'That's probably only a fraction of the true occurrence of infection, because we know that at least half of the cases can have mild or asymptomatic illness,' Dr Klein said.

However, the Wisconsin department of health said it has the highest rate of blastomycosis in the US.

Between 2011 and 2020, the department reported 1,412 cases ""” averaging 116 per year.

Some 61 percent of those patients were hospitalized while 124 died, giving a death rate of 11 percent.

Popular baby foods STILL contain toxic metals like lead, arsenic and cadmium linked to host of health issues, watchdog finds - and these products are the biggest offenders

Several baby food products contain higher levels of toxic metals now than they did five years ago, despite pressure on the industry to strip out the harmful contaminants.

An investigation by a consumer watchdog looked at 14 popular baby foods and compared levels of lead, arsenic and cadmium in seven of them to results from 2018. Products were chosen based on high levels of metals in the past.

Results showed that levels increased in three products, Gerber's Chicken Rice Dinner and Turkey Rice Dinner flavors, and Hot Kid Baby Mum-Mum Teething Wafers. 

Levels stayed the same in one product, Beech-Nut baby food sweet potato flavor.

Gerber Chicken and Rice and Gerber Turkey and Rice both had higher amounts of metals than they did in Consumer Reports' 2018 findings

The rice-based Mum-Mum Teething Wafers from Hot Kid also had higher levels of metals than they did five years ago

Three of the highest-risk foods from this year, which include purees from Gerber and Beech-Nut, all contained sweet potatoes. 

A spokesperson for Gerber told Consumer Reports: 'We work with our farmers to prioritize growing locations for optimal climate and soil conditions, approve fields before crops are planted based on soil testing and rotate crops.'

'Additionally, we're continuing to invest in new research to help inform future improvements. For example, we're working with public land-grant universities to conduct on-farm research to identify soil and varietal variables that may reduce uptake of heavy metals from the soil by carrots and sweet potatoes.'

Rice is also a primary ingredient in many teething puffs, which kids can consume in large amounts to help with pain. 

Many of these foods absorb high amounts of metals like lead from the soil as they grow. Higher levels can also be found close to highways or small airports, both places where leaded gasoline have been used in the past, Consumer Reports wrote. 

Earth's Best Organic Sunny Days Bars improved dramatically since 2018, as more than 90 percent of lead was eliminated from the product

Additionally, areas where arsenic pesticides have been used may leave those foods at higher risk of picking that metal up.  

'Because heavy metals are so pervasive in foods - and because they tend to accumulate in the body - small exposures from multiple foods can add up,' said Eric Boring, a chemist with Consumer Reports who oversaw testing. 

'Feeding your child amounts close to the daily serving limits leaves little room for exposure to heavy metals from other foods.'

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warns that young children exposed to lead can suffer hampered development to their brain and nervous system.

Around 2.5 percent of children under the age of five have been exposed to dangerous levels of lead, experts believe.

As a result, they may have slowed growth, learning, behavior, hearing and speech issues.

In addition, arsenic, which was in several products, is a carcinogen that raises the risk of bladder, lung, and skin cancers. 

It has also been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and higher chances of infant mortality.

The lawsuit claimed the product deceived customers with allegations of being an all-natural product.

Last year, a report by Healthy Babies tested 168 different baby foods for toxic metals.

Toxic metals such as lead, arsenic, cadmium and mercury were found in 159 of them - or 95 percent.

For a majority of these products, 88 percent, there are no enforceable guidelines for these toxic metals.

In 2018, products made with rice, sweet potatoes, and carrots posed the biggest risks of heavy metals. This year's results suggested that sweet potatoes and rice were the worst. 

But three products actually improved between 2018 and 2023.

Parents were advised to let kids have just one serving of Earth's Best Organic's Sunny Days Snack Bars in 2018, for example. 

This year, they were the lowest-risk food on the list, increasing to a limit of 4.5 servings per day. 

Consumer Reports wrote that lead levels in this product dropped 91 percent. 

Two flavors of Happy Baby Organics Superfood Puffs- Apple and Broccoli and Purple Carrot and Blueberry- had slight improvements from one serving to 1.5 servings.

A study published last year by researchers at Florida State University found that lead poisoning has robbed Americans of 2.6 IQ points each on average, usually from gasoline.

In January, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended limits to the amount of lead in baby food. 

The agency said that lead prevalence should be limited to 10 parts per billion (ppb) in fruits, some vegetables and yogurt, and 20ppb in root vegetables - which include carrots, beets and potatoes - and dry cereal.

Lead is toxic to kids starting at about 10 mcg/dl. According to the CDC, no safe level of lead has been identified in kids.

Revenge is sweet: Experts hope toxin found in SUGAR cane will turn tide on drug-resistant superbugs ""” calling it the 'most promising antibiotic in decades'

A toxin found in sugar that wipes out superbugs has been dubbed the 'most exciting antibiotic candidate' in decades.

Albicidin is a toxin produced by the plant pathogen that causes the devastating leaf scald disease in sugar cane. Researchers found albicidin was effective against six antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a new laboratory study.

Scientists hope it will give them a new weapon to fight superbugs, which are estimated to contribute to around seven million deaths a year. Experts have warned they should be taken as seriously as global warming.

The antibiotic - called albicidin - is made by the plant pathogen which causes the devastating leaf scald disease in sugar cane, bacterial disease which can ruin crops

Dr Dmitry Ghilarov, head of the research group examining albicidin at the John Innes Centre in Norwich, UK, said: 'We believe this is one of the most exciting new antibiotic candidates in many years.

'It has extremely high effectiveness in small concentrations and is highly potent against pathogenic bacteria - even those resistant to the widely used antibiotics.'

Scientists create super-influenza vaccine that can fight 20 strains and uses Covid mRNA technology 

 

Scientists have created a super-vaccine that can fight every known strain of flu and uses the same technology used in Covid shots. 

Albicidin is used by the pathogen Xanthomonas albilineans to spread throughout the plant, withering the leaves and rendering crops unusable.

The development of albicidin as an antibiotic has been slow because scientists could not work out exactly how it engaged with its target in plants - the bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase.

Albicidin prevents a process which enables cells to function properly.

Gyrase, a bacterial enzyme, binds to DNA and twists it into a coil in a process called supercoiling, which is crucial for cells to operate.

During supercoiling, the DNA becomes temporarily broken.

Albicidin prevents the rejoining of the DNA by changing shape and effectively blocking the way.

Now scientists have this added structural understanding of how albicidin works, they hope to use it to modify the antibiotic and make it more effective against drug-resistant bacteria.

In the latest study, scientists used a powerful microscope to discover that albicidin takes an L-shape, blocking the gyrase from rejoining the broken DNA, like 'a spanner thrown between two gears'.

The way albicidin interacts is sufficiently different from existing antibiotics, which will likely work against many of the current antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Through laboratory tests, the scientists found it to be effective against some of the most dangerous bacterial infections often contracted in hospitals, including salmonella, E. coli and pneumonia.

Those three antibiotic-resistant bugs are estimated to kill more than 50,000 Americans every year.

When antibiotics are taken unnecessarily, bacteria can develop the ability to defeat them and gradually become drug-resistant.

Dr Ghilarov said: 'It seems by the nature of the interaction, albicidin targets a really essential part of the enzyme and it's hard for bacteria to evolve resistance to that.

'Now that we have a structural understanding, we can look to further exploit this binding pocket and make more modifications to albicidin to improve its efficacy and pharmacological properties.'

Now the researchers will seek funding for human clinical trials, which they hope will lead to creating a new class of antibiotics. 

The findings were published in the journal Nature Catalysis.

Figures estimate that superbugs will kill 10 million people each year by 2050, with patients succumbing to once-harmless bugs.

Around 700,000 people already die yearly due to drug-resistant infections, including tuberculosis (TB), HIV and malaria across the world. 

Concerns have repeatedly been raised that medicine will be taken back to the 'dark ages' if antibiotics are rendered ineffective in the coming years.

In addition to existing drugs becoming less effective, only one or two new antibiotics have been developed in the last 30 years.

In 2019, the WHO warned antibiotics are 'running out' as a report found a 'serious lack' of new drugs in the development pipeline.

Without antibiotics, C-sections, cancer treatments and hip replacements will become incredibly 'risky', it was said at the time.

'Threatening' feral cows in New Mexico will be gunned down by shooters in helicopters because they 'pose a significant threat to public safety'

A helicopter with a shooter will fly over a portion of the vast Gila Wilderness in southwestern New Mexico next week, searching for feral cows to kill.

US Forest Service managers approved the plan Thursday to protect sensitive spots in the nation's first designated wilderness area. 

The move sets the stage for legal challenges over how to handle unbranded livestock and other stray cows as drought deepens in the West.

The Gila National Forest issued the decision amid pressure from environmental groups who raised concerns about nearly 150 cattle whose hooves and mouths are damaging streams and rivers. 

Ranchers, meanwhile, have criticized the plan to shoot cows from a helicopter as animal cruelty. They said the action violates federal regulations and will be problematic when carcasses are left to rot.

A helicopter with a shooter will fly over a portion of the vast Gila Wilderness in southwestern New Mexico next week, searching for feral cows to kill 

A section of the Gila Wilderness will be closed to the public starting Monday. A helicopter will launch Thursday, with shooters spending four days looking for feral cattle in rugged areas that include the Gila River.

Forest Supervisor Camille Howes said the decision was difficult but necessary.

'The feral cattle in the Gila Wilderness have been aggressive towards wilderness visitors, graze year-round, and trample stream banks and springs, causing erosion and sedimentation,' she said in a statement.

Ranching industry groups and other rural advocates are concerned that the action taken in New Mexico could set a precedent as more grazing parcels become vacant across the West.

Ranchers say fewer people are maintaining fences and gone are the rural neighbors who used to help corral wayward cows. 

Some have left the business because of worsening drought, making water scarce for cattle, and skyrocketing costs for feed and other supplies.

The New Mexico Cattle Growers´ Association estimates roughly 90 grazing parcels are vacant in New Mexico and Arizona. 

Increased use of public lands - including hunting and hiking - also has resulted in knocked-down fences, the association said. Elk, too, are to blame for damaging fences meant to keep cows in check.

Tom Paterson, chair of the association's wildlife committee, said the group has tried to find a solution that wouldn't involve shooting feral cattle. 

He pointed to a recent directive issued by the New Mexico Livestock Board that allows neighboring permittees to gather and herd the cattle out.

With snow on the ground, access is limited. Paterson said federal official are not giving enough time to see if the directive will work. 

His organization also has accused the US Forest Service of skirting its own regulations that call for a roundup first, and shooting as the last resort.

'Easy is not an exception to their own rules. Frustration is not an exception to the rules,' he said. 'Our society should be better than this. We can be more creative and do it a better way where you´re not wasting an economic resource.'

Environmentalists in dozens of lawsuits filed in courts around the West over the years have argued that cattle ruin the land and water by trampling stream banks. They applauded the Forest Service's decision.

'We can expect immediate results - clean water, a healthy river and restored wildlife habitat,' said Todd Schulke, co-founder of the Center for Biological Diversity.

The position marks a shift from the environmental community's stance on shooting other wildlife - from a fight over protecting bison at the Grand Canyon to annual complaints about the actions of the US Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services, an agency often vilified for killing birds, coyotes, wolves, mountain lions and other animals.

Just last month, environmentalists sued in Montana over a program aimed at managing grizzly bears.

In 2021, conservation groups settled another lawsuit over Wildlife Services' practices in Idaho. Environmental groups there and elsewhere have long claimed that the agency's predator-control activities violate environmental laws.

But in New Mexico, the Center for Biological Diversity contends that water quality issues will only worsen if feral cattle aren't removed. 

The group estimates that 50 to 150 cows graze, unauthorized, in the Gila Wilderness, a remote stretch that spans more than 870 square miles and is home to endangered Mexican gray wolves, elk, deer and other wildlife.

The National Cattlemen's Beef Association had asked the Forest Service to hold off on lethal action for a year after the New Mexico Cattle Growers' Association had reached an agreement with federal officials following last year's operation. The New Mexico group is expected to challenge the latest decision.

According to the Forest Service, the feral cattle problem dates back a half-century, when a cattle operation went out of business and subsequent grazing permits were suspended. Hundreds of unauthorized cattle have been removed over the years.

In 2022, a Forest Service contractor killed 65 cows in an aerial gunning operation similar to the one planned for next week.

Photos shared by ranchers of the 2022 operation showed dead cattle upside down in the Gila River. Federal officials said those carcasses were pulled out of the water.

A survey done 90 days later found that no carcasses remained. Scavenging birds and other animals consumed them, officials said. The upcoming operation will cover about 160 square miles.

In New Mexico, the Center for Biological Diversity contends that water quality issues will only worsen if feral cattle aren't removed

No carcasses are to be left in or adjacent to waterways or springs - or near designated hiking trails or known, culturally sensitive areas.

The work, namely noise from the helicopter, also can't interrupt the breeding season for the Mexican spotted owl, the southwestern willow flycatcher and other endangered species. 

The aerial gunning operation is expected to be complete before April, when the season begins for Mexican gray wolves to have pups.

Environmentalists used to point to the removal of livestock carcasses as a preventative measure to limit conflict between wolves and ranchers. 

However, federal officials stated in documents that were released this week that there's no scientific research or observational data to suggest that once wolves scavenge on a livestock carcass, they become habituated to cattle.

What a difference a few months can make. A little less than a year after being 'cancelled' for a published attack on Meghan Markle, Jeremy Clarkson has agreed to sign a megabucks new deal with Amazon.

For decades Clarkson was the country's pre-eminent motoring journalist thanks to Top Gear, but he was notably all at sea when trying his hand as a farmer on Clarkson's Farm.

The show, which began in 2021, has been a huge global hit as viewers have adored watching him swear, struggle and mostly fail on Diddly Squat Farm in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire.

The second series, which started streaming in February, was Prime Video's most watched original show in the UK ""” by a mile. It easily beat the very expensive The Lord Of The Rings: The Rings Of Power drama.

Now I'm told Amazon want another three series ""” and Clarkson and his team want to keep on making them.

For decades Clarkson was the country's pre-eminent motoring journalist thanks to Top Gear, but he was notably all at sea when trying his hand as a farmer on Clarkson's Farm 

The forthcoming series is going to be all about pigs. Kaleb Cooper, (right) the young farming contractor who has become a star, said recently that Clarkson is 'annoyingly' good as a pig farmer

Clarkson's latest book - Diddly Squat: Pigs Might Fly - came out last month and was an instant bestseller

Nothing is signed yet. However, the expectation is that a deal ""” thought to be worth at least $250 million ""” will be announced when the third series starts streaming in March or April next year.

At this point it's not clear whether Clarkson will carry on with The Grand Tour, also on Prime Video, or with Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? for ITV.

Friends of the presenter say they would not be surprised if, at 63, he decided to concentrate solely on Clarkson's Farm from now on. Filming runs from March to October.

The forthcoming series is going to be all about pigs. Kaleb Cooper, the young farming contractor who has become a star, said recently that Clarkson is 'annoyingly' good as a pig farmer: 'I can't say too much because I'll be told off, but Jeremy's bought some pigs this year. And, annoyingly, he's a really good pig farmer.'

Clarkson's latest book ""” Diddly Squat: Pigs Might Fly ""” came out last month and was an instant bestseller.

But he wrote himself into trouble last December, with a newspaper column about the Duchess of Sussex in which he professed to hate her 'on a cellular level' and said that he dreamed of her being paraded naked while a crowd threw excrement at her ""” a reference to a scene in TV's Game Of Thrones.

He posted a lengthy apology on Instagram saying he had 'completely messed up' in the article, which is the most complained about in the history of Press regulator IPSO. He also sent an email to Prince Harry to express his profound apologies.

Clarkson filmed a final special of The Grand Tour in Botswana this summer with James May and Richard Hammond and it is due to go out next year.

Effervescent TV presenter Claudia Winkleman says the secret of her success is an ability to nap anywhere.

She told the How To Fail podcast: 'I'm a sleep fanatic, I nap all the time. In fact I had all my family round for lunch and had a nap while they were all there in the room - and there were ten of us.

'I was like: 'Guys', I've got to have some shut-eye.' Laid on the sofa, had a little sleep.'

Di star's 'beautiful' ghost scenes 

Actress Elizabeth Debicki - Princess Diana in The Crown - has spoken for the first time about the experience of depicting her as a 'ghost' who appears to both Prince Charles and The Queen.

Debicki describes the scenes between her and Dominic West, playing Prince Charles, as 'beautiful'. She said: 'We didn't do any rehearsal. We kind of just opened our hearts up because it's so easy to understand what the Charles character is feeling, because for anyone who's lost anyone you know, the second you lose them, the only thing you would do - you would give anything for - is to talk to them one more time.

Actress Elizabeth Debicki - Princess Diana in The Crown - has spoken for the first time about the experience of depicting her as a 'ghost'

'I think what's beautiful is that it's an imagined Diana who has the freedom to say the things she's always wanted to say to Charles, which is: 'I have loved you so much'. I'm really glad that I got to say that in that character.'

Writer Peter Morgan has said that the Diana in these scenes is not a ghost but a visualisation in the minds of her family.

Mathematician Hannah Fry will be trying to keep Ian Hislop and Paul Merton under control in Have I Got News For You next Friday. She's been on the panel five times previously and remarks drily: 'When I studied maths at university this is not how I expected it would turn out.'

She was part of a revival of Tomorrow's World in 2017 but says due to gloom about the fate of the planet - over climate change and AI - it will never come back.

'There was a point when everyone was excited about what was around the corner, but now I think people are scared about what lies ahead.'

Janelle Monae says she has been dreaming of having tea with iconic Jazz Age dancer Josephine Baker - after taking magic mushrooms. 'It was amazing,' she declares.

And no wonder Baker has been on her mind, as a super-hot TV biopic of the dancer, titled De La Resistance, is now all systems go after the lifting of the writers' and actors' strikes, with Monae playing Baker.

Janelle Monae (pictured) says she has been dreaming of having tea with iconic Jazz Age dancer Josephine Baker - after taking magic mushrooms

The studio A24 is backing the series, which will concentrate on Baker's role spying for the French Resistance during WWII. The film is being produced by Monae's company, Wondaland. It's based on a book, The Flame Of Resistance, which came out in 2022. You'll recognise Monae from the movies Hidden Figures, Moonlight and Knives Out 2.

Non-binary Monae, who goes by 'they' or 'she', has an android alter ego who she calls upon in her music career. Her 2023 album The Age Of Pleasure has just been nominated for a Grammy.

She's been nominated for ten Grammys since releasing her first album in 2003, but she's not been so successful in the UK since her No. 1 single We Are Young in 2012. The Age Of Pleasure spent just one week in the charts at No. 49 and her last successful single reached No. 74... in 2018.

Uh-oh""¦ Brace for a horror show 

Dozens of behind-the-scenes and on-screen employees of This Morning have now been interviewed by barrister Jane Mulcahy KC, who is compiling a report on the allegedly 'toxic culture' of the show for ITV.

Departed hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield have spoken to her, as has Eamonn Holmes, who was once on the sofa on a Friday and is now an outspoken critic of the show.

'Person X' the young colleague with whom Schofield had an 'unwise but not illegal' relationship, is also understood to have cooperated.

Departed hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield have spoken to barrister Jane Mulcahy KC, who is compiling a report on the allegedly 'toxic culture' of the show for ITV

I'm told that Mulcahy has shown an interest in two issues in particular.

One is the 'Holly bubble' which saw presenters Holly and Phil (pictured) having very little to do with any of the crew or staff and thus being unaware of problems faced by the rank and file.

The other issue is what is being called 'the cult of Frizell'.

This refers to current boss Martin Frizell, under whose stewardship Schofield was unimpeachable and unchallenged. Frizell, formerly an on-screen talent himself, is currently in the challenging position of supporting his wife, former TV presenter Fiona Phillips, who is struggling with Alzheimer's disease aged only 62.

In September, executive Vivek Sharma was hired to work on the show as Frizell's deputy, arriving from Steph's Packed Lunch on Channel 4, which has since been axed.

Those who read the tea leaves say that the report is going to be 'a horror show' for ITV and there are claims that some of those who were previously there will be 'relieved' to be away from it.

Holly quit last month after an alleged plot to kidnap her was uncovered. A spokesman for ITV declines to comment and sources close to Holly say that her decision to leave was nothing to do with the report.

It is expected to come out shortly before Christmas.

Vanessa Kirby is said to be the best thing about Ridley Scott's long and uneven film Napoleon - and she got the gig after the first choice for Josephine, Jodie Comer, dropped out in order to star in the play Prima Facie.

Now Kirby has been subbed in again after Alicia Vikander dropped out of survival thriller Eden, which is being made in Australia with leading man Jude Law.

The film is a tale of lust and madness in the Galapagos Islands and is being directed by Ron Howard.

'Never forget': Dame Helen's Holocaust plea 

Helen Mirren, who played Israeli premier Golda Meir in Golda, released last month, has been reflecting on her deep connection to Israel in the wake of the terror attacks and war in the country.

Mirren faced controversy for her portrayal, some of it centred on the rather obvious use of prosthetics to enhance her physical resemblance to Meir, who led the country in 1973 during the Yom Kippur war.

Helen Mirren, who played Israeli premier Golda Meir in Golda, released last month, has been reflecting on her deep connection to Israel in the wake of the terror attacks and war in the country

Mirren said: 'I've historically not had a deep profound understanding of Israel, but I've always had a connection with Israel. I don't know, I've always had a sort of instinctive feeling about Israel.'

She added that she remembered Meir's election as a 'very important moment', as it was the first time she had known a woman leading a country.

And she said: 'One of the reasons that I've always supported Israel and felt for Israel is the Holocaust and my growing awareness - as a child growing up in London, post-war England - of what had actually happened.

'It was so, so devastating and I still can't quite grasp it, you know, it's ungraspable. And the fact that it was very shortly before I was born ""” in my parents' lifetime.

'It was so monstrous, so inconceivably inhuman that I've always felt that we must never forget.'

Director Guy Nattiv said: 'Waking up on October 7 and seeing the exact thing that happened to us in 1973 - times ten - I was gutted as was everyone else on our crew. When we did this research for this movie, we met with every single general from 1973. And all the people who wrote books. Everyone told us: 'Listen, it was a debacle, but it will never happen again'.

'And there you go, it happened again, even worse. I feel that this movie... it has double meaning now.'

After more than 100 days of strike, the actors are now unleashed, which means that campaigning for awards season, leading up to the Oscars, is suddenly in full swing.

This week we've had Annette Bening and Jodie Foster beating the drum for Nyad, Leonardo DiCaprio breaking into his hectic schedule of partying to promote Killers of the Flower Moon, Bradley Cooper and Carey Mulligan trumpeting the Bernstein biopic Maestro and premieres for four huge movies: The Color Purple, Saltburn, Napoleon and May December. Plus Oppenheimer's Chris Nolan has been giving interviews and Zac Efron and Jeremy Allen White have been making the rounds for wrestling picture The Iron Claw.

Meanwhile, some projects are very fast out of the gate post-strike. One priority for Netflix is the second season of Tim Burton's Wednesday, a sensational hit last year.

It's going to be filmed in Ireland (last time, it was Romania) from April and is set to have more horror than series one. There will also be more of the relationship between Wednesday Addams, played by Jenna Ortega and her mother Morticia (Catherine Zeta-Jones).

New venomous species with eight legs and 'scalloped pincers' is discovered in California

Scientists have discovered a brand-new, venomous species of scorpion in the California desert.

Now named the 'Tulare Basin scorpion,' the new species has been found across hundreds of miles of formidable desert northwest of Los Angeles. 

First photographed amid industrial roadside trash, the 2.1-inch-long scorpion has survived harsh, toxic conditions amid petroleum extraction and chemically intensive agriculture throughout central California's San Joaquin Desert.

The creature's heartiness for these arid, desert wastes, however, is no indication of its lethality: one arachnid biologist who studied the new scorpion told DailyMail.com that its sting was like 'getting pricked by a cactus.' 

But, 'they were in a very unusual location,' according to the research intern at the California Academy of Sciences, who first made contact with the citizen-scientist that discovered this unusual scorpion.

Scientists have secured 29 specimens of a brand new species of venomous scorpion, one with uniquely thick 'scalloped' claws, after a dedicated civilian researcher first discovered one out in California's San Joaquin Desert. 'They were in a very unusual location,' one researcher said

The scorpion's unique 'heavily scalloped pincers' vary in shape between male and females of the species and its orange-yellow bodies appear to tan in the desert sun

'I was quite excited to collect them as they were some of the first new species I had found,' that intern, evolutionary biology student Prakrit Jain at UC Berkeley, told local news site SFGATE.

Jain got the tip from a fellow user of the social media app iNaturalist, an amatuer reptile-hunter named Brian Hind, who was baffled by the creatures unusual claws.

Jain, along with another young citizen-scientist Harper Forbes, and an assistant curator for California Academy for Sciences, arachnologist Lauren Esposito, set to work tracking down more examples of the Tulare Basin scorpion.

Armed with black lights, the team searched rough desert terrain from Kern County to Fresno for specimens of the new species

Armed with black lights, the team searched the rough desert terrain from Kern County to Fresno for more specimens of the new species.

The scorpion, whose formal name is now Paruroctonus tulare, proved to be one of several related scorpions who have adapted to very specific, semi-moist, or mesic, regions of the California desert.

The scorpion's unique 'heavily scalloped pincers' vary in shape between male and females of the species and its orange-yellow bodies appear to tan in the desert sun.

'Individuals from both the southeastern and southwestern localities are generally darker and more orange,' Jain, Esposito and their co-authors wrote in their new journal article on the creature, published late last November in ZooKeys.

The coloration, they wrote, was 'fairly variable, ranging from lighter yellows and tans to darker oranges and browns.' 

Despite this visible differences, the eight-legged, striped and smooth-bodies scorpions only vary by 'fewer than four single nucleotide polymorphisms,' they said.

While venomous, the Tulare Basin scorpion is not sufficiently dangerous to be a threat to humans, Esposito told DailyMail.com.

'The venom has very little effect on humans,' Esposito wrote via email. 

'At worst, it would be similar to a mild bee sting but it's unlikely to be much different from getting pricked by a cactus.' 

The scorpion, first photographed amid industrial trash, has survived harsh conditions amid petroleum extraction and chemically intensive agriculture in central California

The team argues that the species should 'receive endangered or critically endangered species status, at least at the state level,' a process that involves coming to the aid of local plants too

The scorpion's coloration, the researchers wrote, was 'fairly variable, ranging from lighter yellows and tans to darker oranges and browns.' Despite these visible differences, the striped scorpions only vary by 'fewer than four single nucleotide polymorphisms,' genetically

In fact, the scorpion faces a 'number of imminent threats to its survival,' with most of them being 'anthropogenic' or man-made, the researchers said.

Australians are warned to remain on high alert as funnel-web spider season approaches - with the deadly critters expected to sweep through the land like a plague 

Cattle grazing appears to be one of the human activities that currently threatens the scorpion, researchers suspect, because it has spread non-native plants choking out the native herb species that younger Tulare Basin scorpions depend on.

'Juveniles appear to rely on them,' the researchers wrote, 'and there is the potential for soil impaction that could impact the construction or maintenance of burrows in soft clay soil.'

The team argues that the species should 'receive endangered or critically endangered species status, at least at the state level,' a process that will involve coming to the aid of the local plants too.

'The most important step towards the conservation of [the Tulare Basin scorpion] is the preservation of alkali-sink plant communities by protecting the remaining high-quality habitat, controlling invasive species, limiting cattle grazing, restoring abandoned land, and combating the causes and effects of climate change,' the researchers wrote. 

Esposito said she was 'hopeful' and that the new scorpion discovery was a 'great example of gathering sufficient data about one thing that can potentially preserve habitat for many, many other things.'

The founder of a computer app that uses AI to teach maths to children fears computer programmers are among many workers under threat from artificial intelligence.

Large language models that can simultaneously process information and give human-like responses are threatening to upend the labour market, even outdoing the changes unleashed by the internet during the 1990s. 

Mohamad Jebara, the co-founder of online learning platform Mathspace, said even entry-level IT coding jobs could go as AI became more advanced.

'AI programs are able to code, which could remove entry level computer programming jobs,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Jebara, a former financial markets derivatives trader turned tech entrepreneur, said entry-level legal jobs, often done by university law students, could also be replaced by AI.

'Document review and legal research can be replaced by AI, as well as contract reviews and preparing legal documents,' he said.

New-generation artificial intelligence has the potential to replace white-collar workers from highly paid doctors and management consultants to home tutors, experts say.

Overseas backpackers on farms could also be replaced as AI enables robots to plant seeds and harvest crops.

'AI can manage farms more efficiently, using drones and robots for tasks like planting and harvesting,' Mr Jebara said.

AI could also replace customer service jobs, including those who take calls.

'Many companies are already improving their online communication with customers through AI powered chat,' Mr Jebara said.

AI could also lead to driverless vehicles, which would negate the need for bus or taxi drivers.

'The development of autonomous vehicles will remove the need for drivers of vehicles like trains, buses, trucks and taxis, even drones and other air transport vehicles,' Mr Jebara said.

Online banking has already led to banks closing branches, from the city centre to regional areas.

But Mr Jebara said AI would accelerate that.

'Online banking and automation are reducing the need for physical bank branches and staff,' he said.

Manufacturing jobs are also regarded as being under threat as AI led to even more automation on the production line.

'Especially those involved in repetitive tasks will likely be replaced by machines,' he said.

Mohamad Jebara, the co-founder of online learning platform Mathspace, said even entry-level IT coding jobs could go as AI becomes more advanced

Mathspace uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to provide interactive online lessons for children.

While it won't replace the classroom teacher, it could replace the tutor if enough kids benefit from a chatbot puppy called Milo who can help them solve equations and know how advanced they are.

'When students have follow-up questions with Milo, their engagement increases,' Mr Jebara said.

'It's no longer a one-sided interaction, and it will continue to improve to be more conversational.

'While AI can't single-handedly resolve the teacher shortage crisis or ever replace teachers, Mathspace serves as a vital tool, bridging the gap created by the dwindling numbers of maths-trained educators, and enhancing their impact in the classroom.'

Mathspace was co-founded by Mr Jebara, Chris Velis and Alvin Savoy in 2010 and is used by 3,432 schools in Australia and another 3,557 schools overseas.

JOBS UNDER THREAT FROM A.I.

Mohamad Jebara fears that computer programmers are among the list of workers most at risk of being replaced by artificial intelligence.

Below is a rundown of some the other professions:

1. Entry-level IT coding jobs

2. Entry-level legal jobs often done by law graduates

3. Farm work

4. Customer service jobs including call-centres

5. Bus and taxi drivers

7. Manufacturing jobs

8. Banking

On a rainy morning in May, I was getting the kids ready for school. My husband Chris had got up before dawn for a BBC Radio 4 project, so I was surprised when he returned at the moment of peak chaos ""” missing uniform, unbrushed teeth (including my own) and unfinished breakfast.

What happened next surprised me even more: Chris had with him a producer, Lucy, who thrust a microphone towards me as he presented me, Lyra, six, and Sasha, three, with a box containing five baby chickens.

This was unexpected because though we had discussed getting a couple of chickens to scratch around the garden, we had come to the conclusion that now was not the right time. And, to be honest, I was never convinced anyway.

With just 15 minutes before everyone had to leave the house, I was less than impressed. But my daughters thought all their Christmases had come at once. They were mesmerised by their new 'pets', tiny cartoonish bundles of fluff.

If you know my husband, Chris van Tulleken, a doctor who presents science and health-related documentaries on radio and TV, you'll have guessed these chicks were part of an experiment. And Chris's preferred method of scientific investigation is to experiment on himself, his twin brother, Xand, and, occasionally, his family.

Earlier this year, after writing a book, Ultra-Processed People, he made me cut out all ultra-processed food from our family diet.

Chris and Dinah Van Tulleken (pictured) tried raising five chickens to make their children think more deeply about the food they eat 

READ MORE: What it's REALLY like being married to a healthy eating fanatic -Dr Chris van Tulleken banned ready meals, tuts at his wife's favourite Pret sandwich - and then he came for her peanut butter

Now, ominously, he was recording a new Radio 4 documentary and podcast, called Fed: Planet Chicken, about our global addiction to poultry. In order to understand the supply chain, Chris felt he needed to set up a mini-industrial broiler farm ""” in our home.

Most people get pet chickens for eggs and ""” as I would learn ""” because they are amazing birds. But not Chris. Ours were not laying breeds; they were what's called broilers, ie, birds mainly bred to eat, and they weren't destined to live long. We couldn't name them, I insisted. How could we slaughter a chicken with a name?

Too late. Lyra and Sasha declared 'Nugget' and 'Layla' (Lay-la geddit?) were the names of two Ross 308s ""” a popular breed for meat production because they've been bred for incredible growth and reach full size in just five weeks.

Foxy (a bad omen) and Heihei (from the Disney film Moana) were both Hubbards, a slower-growing breed usually reared on free-range or organic farms. And then there was Fawkes, named after the phoenix in Harry Potter.

He was a strange little creature, called a Cou-Nu or Naked Neck: black with no feathers on his neck. The Cou-Nu is from Transylvania and is also slow-growing, for free-range systems. Despite his mangy appearance, as I held Fawkes, there was something very charming about this bird. I started to imagine that perhaps we wouldn't kill them and could somehow accommodate them in our lives, but Chris quickly put a stop to this train of thought.

It wouldn't be easy to keep them, even if we wanted to, he told me. The Ross 308s (Nugget and Layla) grow so fast that if you keep them for much longer than five weeks, they become so heavy they are often unable able to walk and die of heart failure. Almost every chicken you buy that isn't free range (your chicken soup, sandwich, nuggets, curry and so on) will have had a lifespan that's not much longer than a house fly.

Yes, free-range chickens can live for many years, but that wasn't the point of the experiment. The point was to rear chickens for us to eat.

Dinah says the chicks grew at an astonishing pace, especially Nugget and Layla

Chris wanted to see how the different breeds grew before they appeared on our table ""” and for all of us to think about where the meat we eat comes from. He explained all this to the children, but for some reason the chicks' impending doom didn't seem to bother them.

That fateful morning, I told Chris in no uncertain terms that he would need to be the one to look after them. 'Sure, sure,' he said and promptly took the kids to school, leaving me holding the chickens.

I don't want pets. Life is chaotic enough. We have a cat, but he arrived as a stray and is pretty self-sufficient, supplementing his dry kibble with rats, mice and, infuriatingly, small garden birds.

But the chickens will be no trouble, argued Chris. They'll be free range, once they're big enough to leave the warmth of our study in two weeks' time. I looked at the carpet ""” already liberally splattered with chicken faeces ""” and sighed.

The chicks grew at an astonishing pace, especially Nugget and Layla, the turbocharged Ross 308s. After a couple of days ""” seized by childhood memories of Blue Peter ""” I gathered up some boxes to make a cardboard Cluckingham Palace, complete with straw bedding and chicken feed in china bowls.

Somehow, I was swept along with this ridiculous project. I was still grappling with our new diet (almost) free of ultra-processed food, which requires me to cook from scratch after a day as this paper's fashion editor, but this felt different.

It wasn't that Chris was unwilling to feed or care for the birds, I found I wanted to do it. The chicks had a good place to live, but they lacked a mother. So I took on the role.

It wasn't glamorous ""” they get easily constipated, so I learned how to 'unplug' them by hand. After dinner, I set aside all the scraps and chopped them up to supplement the chicks' feed. In bed at night, I would delve into online forums learning about their diet, behaviour, diseases ""” just as I did when the children were young. I became obsessed.

When I got home from work, Nugget, Layla, Foxy and Heihei would snuggle in my lap, but Fawkes sat on my head or my shoulder and put his cheek against mine, looking into my eye. Poor Winston the cat was completely ignored and sat in a crouch outside the door, waiting for us to make a mistake and leave it open.

Chris, meanwhile, was out investigating the world of industrial chicken farming, visiting breeders who produced hundreds of thousands of chickens every couple of months.

He came home confused. It didn't seem as if the chickens in these systems were being abused, but they weren't allowed to live out their chicken-ness either. Ours had passions, mainly for foraging. It turns out our carpet is infested with clothes moth larvae and Fawkes would patrol its edge and dig them out.

After two weeks, we felt we were doing an excellent job. Then, one morning, Heihei couldn't walk. Our local vet in East London had never treated a chicken. Chris spoke to farmers, who said bluntly that no one treats lame chicks ""” this is a common occurrence and they just dispatch the affected chicken by breaking its neck. Quick and painless.

So we asked the vet to put Heihei down and buried her under a tree. While the farms that Chris was visiting had death rates of a few per cent over the short lives of the chickens, we had just lost a fifth of our stock.

You have to be robust to be a chicken owner: as the saying goes, if you have livestock, you'll have deadstock. Still, I was gutted.

In the kitchen, our appetite for chicken disappeared. Out on the farms, Chris was learning some disturbing truths about chicken production. Most, to be fair, is produced to slightly above the legal minimum standards. But unless it's free-range, all fresh, raw meat in the shops will come from animals that have lived their entire, short lives indoors.

More worrying, Chris would say, is chicken that you buy ready-processed or cooked ""” your chicken pie or chicken shop wings. It's all but impossible to find out where this meat comes from or how it's been produced. Plus, processed food suppliers can buy chicken from many countries, which can have very different welfare standards to the UK.

Back at home, our remaining chicks were ready to go outside. We built a fox-proof coop ""” made by a company called Omlet ""” that had an attached fox-proof run. It was time they were properly introduced to Winston the cat.

By now, the four of them combined were bigger than he was. As we put them on the lawn, he went into a predator crouch, but they were unfazed. Nugget gave his ear a peck. That night, Winston slept on the top of their coop and from then on became their protector.

The differences between the breeds were becoming obvious. Nugget was around twice the size of Fawkes and spent a lot of time resting.

Dinah says she's no longer eat her favourite Pret sandwich, the chicken caesar baguette

He had the equivalent of a bodybuilder's muscles on a toddler's skeleton. Not immobile but definitely less inclined to roam and noticeably greedier. He fell in the pond twice trying to eat tadpoles. The irrepressible Fawkes stalked the house and garden as if he owned the place. When I worked in the kitchen, they all sat next to me or on my lap in a little bundle.

We settled into a routine. I would get up at 6am to let them out and they'd roam until we left the house for the day. Then it was back in their run until the evening. At weekends, they were out and we pretty much lived in the garden to keep them safe.

Then disaster. Having let them out early one morning, I looked out of Lyra's bedroom window and saw a flash of orange tail ""” a fox leaping over the garden fence.

When I ran downstairs, Nugget was missing. Not a feather in sight. Had I not seen the fox I would have sworn he'd escaped or fallen in the pond again.

I blamed myself. I must have let them out too early (I thought foxes were mainly nocturnal). It was a strange sort of guilt because he only had another couple of weeks to live before he was scheduled to die at Chris's hand, but now we'd lost 40 per cent of the flock. If anyone compared us to an industrial operation, we were a disgrace.

From then on, we were super careful. I felt bad because keeping the chickens safe meant restrictions. They were only allowed out when we were in the garden or they joined us in the house. Could we really say they were now having a better life than they would in a large barn?

The fox hadn't forgotten its meal: with the remaining birds still less than six weeks old, I was in the kitchen one afternoon, with the door to the garden open, when I heard a kerfuffle and looked up to see a fox standing in the doorway with Fawkes in its mouth. I screamed. It dropped Fawkes and ran. Layla had disappeared.

I locked our one remaining bird (Foxy) away and got Chris to look at Fawkes. He had puncture wounds and seemed to have a broken wing and leg. There was no question of what had to be done.

The law requires that if an animal needs to be put down, you must act as soon as possible. Chris, bravely, did what needed to be done instantly and painlessly, but he was shaken. I was distraught. Fawkes had been our (my) favourite, properly one of the family. We had let him down.

Chickens hate to be alone, so Foxy was rehomed with a flock at a nearby school. In a way, we were relieved. Six-year-old Lyra voiced what we were all feeling: 'I'm glad the fox ate them Mum, because I didn't want to.'

So what have I learned from our life with chickens?

Well, I used to enjoy chicken caesar baguettes from Pret and katsu curry from Wagamama, but now I won't buy them. It has taken a while, but we prefer to eat fresh chicken, cooked at home. It's expensive ""” even small, organic chickens cost up to £25 ""” so we don't eat it often.

And chicken poses a strange dilemma for the ethical consumer, Chris discovered. The short-lived birds on industrial farms have less enjoyable lives, but are actually better for the environment as they cause less pollution. We've decided the best solution for us is to eat better chicken, less often.

The house felt empty that first night without any chickens, even with two boisterous girls. The cat was miserable and slept alone in the coop. I'm not a crier, but I wept.

Chris's experiment had worked. It forced us all to think about where our food comes from, how it lived... and how it dies.

Whether it's oat, soy, almond or rice, we've never had more choices when it comes to pouring milk on cereal or ordering a latte this World Milk Day. 

But if you tend to opt for a plant-based alternative to cow's milk, keep in mind that some are better for the environment than others. 

According to a University of Oxford study, almond milk is the best vegan option if you want to reduce your greenhouse gas emissions, while rice milk is the worst.  

However, animal milks are by far the most damaging to the planet overall, the study found, largely due to cows being huge greenhouse gas emitters. 

Scientists say livestock farming on the current scale generates huge amounts of greenhouse gases and is pushing our planet into a climate crisis. 

Almond milk is the best vegan option if you want to reduce your greenhouse gas emissions (black bar chart), while rice milk is the worst. However, the picture becomes more complicated when we look at land and water use too

The study, led by Joseph Poore at the University of Oxford, looked at carbon emissions, land use and water use involved in the production of dairy milk and several vegan alternatives.

Rice: 0.3

Soy: 0.2 

Oat: 0.19

Almond: 0.18

Dairy milk, a staple of the breakfast table for generations, by far has the highest emissions - around 1.41lbs (0.64kg) for every 200ml glass, the research found. 

After dairy milk, rice milk was shown to have the highest emissions (around 0.66lbs / 0.3kg), followed by soy milk, oat milk and lastly almond milk.

However, the picture becomes more complicated when taking into account both land and water use too - two metrics that are important to consider when looking at sustainable food choices.

The research found almond milk has a fairly high water use - 74 litres per 200ml glass - largely because almond trees need a lot to grow.

Rice milk also has sizeable water use - 54 litres per glass - because the rice plant is semi-aquatic and needs constant irrigation, while the water use of soy and oat was low. 

The results also show that all four of the vegan milk alternatives have very low land use compared to dairy milk, which was by far and away the least eco-friendly choice. 

Land use of dairy milk stands at a hefty 1.7 square metres per 200ml glass, while the others were around 0.1 or less.  

From oat and soy to almond, rice and even coconut, there's never been more vegan-friendly alternatives to animal milk - but are they good for the planet?

So what does all this mean when we're at the supermarket deciding what milk to get, wanting to do our bit to help the planet?

According to Jena Williams, a dietitian at Bastyr University in Kenmore, Washington who wasn't involved with the study, any plant-based milk is a responsible option as long as we make efforts to recycle the packaging it comes in.

Animal-based diets risk the health of the planet, research shows  

'Plant-based milk has a smaller impact on water and land as well as carbon emissions when compared to dairy milk,' said Williams.

'Overall, soy, oat, hemp, and pea milks are more eco-friendly choices than almond or rice milk.

To help strengthen your environmental decisions, choose plant-based milks that come in a recyclable container to help reduce waste and try to purchase organic plant-based milks.

'This ensures ingredients are grown without pesticides that can harm soil and pollute water and air.' 

The Oxford study's results corroborate information from the 'food carbon footprint calculator', an online tool that gives hundreds of food items a traffic light-style 'carbon rating'. 

It ranks each item by CO2 equivalent (CO2e), a unit of measurement that scientists use to standardise the climate effects of various greenhouse gases. 

No vegan milk has a carbon footprint that comes anything close to that of the real thing, according to the tool. 

A 200g glass of sheep's milk has a 'very high' carbon footprint of 1680g CO2e - more than 10 times that of the same serving of soy milk (156g CO2e), for example. 

Soy milk, said to be the most nutritious substitute to animal milk, is made by boiling a mixture of ground up soy beans after they have been soaked to soften them.

It quite closely matches the nutritional values of regular cow's milk, according to Meagan Bridges Durkin, a nutrition specialist at the University of Virginia.

'Soy milk has gotten a bad rap lately, as other alternative forms have come onto the market, people are maybe trying to find reasons not to drink soy milk,' she said.

'Soy milk is a really good alternative and the best thing is that, from a nutrition standpoint, it's as close to cow's milk as you're going to get in terms of protein, vitamin C and calcium.' 

Milk substitutes, with the exception of soya, typically do not match the protein content of cow's milk, Professor Ian Givens at the University of Reading warned last year. 

Teenagers are especially at risk of developing health problems if they drink these trendy alternatives, as they may be missing out on essential nutrients. 

World Milk Day: Scientists confirm glass bottles preserve flavour more effectively than trendy paper cartons 

For decades in Britain, milk has been delivered in glass pint bottles in the wee hours by the cheery milkman.

But soaring costs and the pressure to switch to alternative packaging could replace this valued tradition once and for all.

More and more the public are tending to go to the supermarket to buy their milk, where it's available in paperboard cartons and even soft plastic bags. 

In experiments in the US, glass and plastic were found to be the best for preserving flavour and freshness of milk (file photo)

However, a new study shows milk's packaging really does influence its flavour - and that the milkman's glass is best if you want to fully appreciate it. 

Scientists found trendy paperboard cartons - which are increasingly being used for packaging vegan milk substitutes - don't preserve its freshness or flavour as well as glass. 

'Milk's taste can be impacted by the exchange of the packaging's compounds into the milk and by the packaging absorbing food flavours and aromas from the surrounding refrigeration environment,' said lead author Mary-Anne Drake at North Carolina State University.

Regardless of the huge strides scientists have made towards reaching the elusive goal, immortality remains a pipedream.

But one researcher in the anti-ageing field believe we could get there ""” or at least extend human lives beyond the current biological boundaries ""” without any miracle pill or injection.

Dr Alex Zhavoronkov, head of biotech company Insilico Medicine, says human clones could offer the answer to eternal life.

Theoretically, the sci-fi concept of growing bodies in labs would provide people with 'spare' vital organs when theirs begin to fail in order to extend their life.

Animals ""” most notably Dolly the sheep in 1996 ""” have already been cloned as part of scientific experiments to develop genetically modified livestock.

Dr Alex Zhavoronkov, head of Hong Kong-based biotech company Insilico Medicine, believes clones will become available to humans within the lifetime of young people and will provide 'spare' organs for when they become unwell

Dolly the sheep (pictured) was the first successful animal clone, using cells taken from the udder of a six-year-old sheep, after nearly 300 attempts by researchers at The Roslin Institute, which is part of the University of Edinburgh

And plants have undergone the same process ""” simply through taking a cutting ""” for thousands of years.

Academics hunting for immortality think the same feat is possible in humans, too.

Dr Zhavoronkov, whose Hong Kong-based firm develops drugs to treat age-related illnesses, believes the technique will become available to humans within the lifetime of today's kids.

It will provide 'spare' vital organs, such as the heart, liver or lungs, for people when they inevitably become unwell.

Such body parts would be harvested from their clone and transplanted.

Blood plasma infusions doubles lifespan of rat, raising hopes for anti-ageing therapy available to humans 

A lab rat has lived to the record age of four-years-old after receiving injections of blood plasma taken from younger rodents, scientists have revealed.

Scientists hope the findings will lead to a similar treatment being rolled out to people within the next 20 years.

Rats usually live for just two to three years, on average, but Sima, the rat in the study, surpassed the previous longest lifespan by one-and-a-half months.

The study involved giving rates infusions of a purified and concentrated form of blood plasma, called E5, taken from younger animals to see whether it prolonged their lives.

Results so far suggest that those who received a placebo infusion lived 34 to 38 months, while those who received the plasma infusions lived 38 to 47 months.

Dr Harold Katcherr, chief scientific officer at Yuvan Research, which led the study, told The Guardian: 'The real point of our experiments is not so much to extend lifespan, but to extend youthspan, to rejuvenate people, to make their golden years really potentially golden years, instead of years of pain and decrepitude.

'But the fact is, if you manage to do that, you also manage to lengthen life and that's not a bad side-effect.' 

Plasma, which makes up around 55 per cent of blood, is a yellow-coloured liquid that carries platelets, red blood cells and white blood cells around the body.

Studies suggest that the treatment reinvigorates organs and tissues in animals and extend life by slowing the ageing of the liver, heart and brain. 

However, the same result is yet to be spotted in humans.

Dr Katcher said if larger animal trials show the same results, the approach could be tested in humans.

But the therapy requires the same amount or more plasma than that already in the body - meaning it could be collected at pigs in abattoirs. 

However, the idea of human clones ""” which Dr Zhavoronkov believes will eventually become as accessible as a car or iPhone ""” is hugely controversial.

This is due to the scientific difficulties, such as a high rate of death and bodily deformities among cloned animals.

There are also ethical concerns about creating a human genetically identical to another person who currently exists, or has previously. 

This could conflict with long-standing religious and societal values about human dignity and infringe on the principles of individual freedom, identity and autonomy, according to the US National Human Genome Research Institute.

Others fear the system could be abused by supporters of eugenics.

But Dr Zhavoronkov, who was born in Latvia but now works in Hong Kong, believes creating 'many' clones of people is the most likely method for boosting life expectancy among people.

He told MailOnline: 'Cloning, in my opinion, is the only way to make a dramatic leap in life extension and turn longevity into an engineering problem.'

Scientists would need to develop a way of successfully cloning humans and disabling their cognitive functions so they could only be used for organs, he noted. 

Dr Zhavoronkov said: 'If someone figures out a way to get around the ethical and regulatory problems, the technology will be available to a select few at the beginning.

'But just like with the iPhone or cars, it should not be too expensive and you may be able to get a new body from time to time as a regular consumer.'

'You would have spare parts for a very long time,' Dr Zhavoronkov added, suggesting that they would be stored in specialist labs or factories.

If a person was hit by an illness, such as kidney disease, then they would receive the healthy organ from their clone, under the system.

All vital organs deteriorate with age and can be hit by illness, which can be fatal, so replacing them can, in theory, keep people alive for longer.

Dr Zhavoronkov said: 'Transplantology has already advanced to the extent that you can transplant virtually anything.

'If there is no rejection, since it is a perfect clone, you can have a perfect body and just focus on the longevity of your brain.'

However, organ transplants ""” which have been carried out since the 1950s ""” do carry an array of risks, including infection, blood clots and nerve damage in the short-term. 

In the longer term, the body can reject the new organ ""” caused by an overreaction of the immune system.

Dr Zhavoronkov is confident there will be 'significant advances in longevity science within the next decade'.

But he noted that it would take 'at least' 15 to 20 years to grow an adult clone, from which organs could be harvested from.

'So for today's 80-year-olds, [their] chances of rejuvenation are pretty slim ""” their probability of dying of any cause is very high and increases with age,' Dr Zhavoronkov said.

People who are in their eighties or older 'have virtually no chance to live past 122' ""” the current record set by Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997 after spending her whole life in Arles, southern France, he said. 

The Office for National Statistics predicts the life expectancy of men born in 2070 in the UK will reach the age of 85 on average, while women will be nearly 88 when they die

Ms Calment, who smoked cigarettes and drank alcohol every day, sparked debate among scientists about what upper age limit is for humans.

However, there has since been speculation that her actual age at death was 99. 

WHO WAS JEANNE CALMENT?

Jeanne Louise Calment holds the Guinness World Record for being the oldest person ever.

Born on February 21, 1875, she is reported to have lived to the age of 122 years and 164 days.

She passed away in a nursing home in Arles, in the south of France, on August 4, 1997.

Her unparalleled longevity has been the subject of numerous studies, both before and after her death.

She stunned doctors by continuing to smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol every day.

Jeanne enjoyed good health for the majority of her life, having even taken up fencing as a hobby at the age of 85.

Ms Calment also claimed to have met the artist Vincent van Gogh, to whom she sold painting canvasses in her father's shop as a teenager.

'He was ugly as sin, had a vile temper and smelled of booze,' she said. 

Those who are in their twenties today 'have a real chance of living many times longer than previously thought possible' due to the possibility of a scientific breakthrough in this field, Dr Zhavoronkov said.

However, the 'jury is still out' on those who are middle aged due to uncertainties around the speed of breakthroughs and the rules around how they are used, he said. 

Dr Zhavoronkov also pointed to pharmacological interventions ""” taking drugs ""” as a potential way to boost lifespan.

Promising studies suggest organ transplant, diabetes and blood pressure drugs may all have anti-ageing effects.

Ongoing research, by the US National Institute of Aging, logs how drugs affect the lifespan of mice.

Results have shown that 'reasonably safe drugs' such as rapamycin, developed as an immunosuppressant for organ transplant patients, and type 2 diabetes drug acarbose increase longevity in mice, Dr Zhavoronkov said.

And separate analysis suggests PDE-5 inhibitors, which are used to treat people with high blood pressure, reduce the risk of age-related diseases, he said.

However, Dr Zhavoronkov believes medication will 'only help us achieve moderate life extension'.

He said: 'The real breakthroughs will come from regenerative medicine.

'The ability to replace the old tissues and organs is likely to provide people with a much greater longevity runway than pharmacology.' 

Dr Zhavoronkov added: 'We should not really set a limit on human life expectancy.'

Reproductive cloning, which was used to duplicate animals like Dolly and would likely be the method used to clone humans, involves removing cells, such as a skin cell, from the entity that is being cloned.

The DNA from these cells are transferred into an egg cell that has had its DNA removed.

Dolly the sheep was the first successful animal clone, using cells taken from the udder of a six-year-old sheep, by researchers at The Roslin Institute, which is part of the University of Edinburgh.

But human cloning has remained elusive, despite disproven claims from some researchers that they have achieved it.

QUESTION: Is mistletoe grown commercially or harvested from wild sources?

Mistletoe is usually a by-product of traditional apple orchards in Hereford and Worcestershire. However, with the decline in some of those orchards due to agricultural change, there is increased interest in strategic mistletoe harvesting and marketing.

Viscum album is the traditional white-berried mistletoe of northern Europe. Mistletoe is a hemiparasite, with its own leaves and own photosynthesis.

It can be managed as part of a healthy orchard without trouble, but where these become neglected, it can destroy its host.

Berry bliss: You can grow mistletoe

Mistletoe can be grown commercially and for conservation purposes. For instance, colonies have been planted at sites including Kew Gardens, Chelsea Physic Garden and Lambeth Palace.

You can grow your own mistletoe from mistletoe berries. One option is to cut into the bark of the tree to create a flap under which to rub a berry mush.

Mistletoe can germinate just by basting the mush on a gnarly area of an old apple tree. It can take five years to appear in any quantity and then must be managed. You can buy mistletoe growing kits. These usually contain 50 berries with a recording form to keep track of each planting.

These are so-called plastiglomerates, a type of rock precursor that forms when molten plastic debris, such as fragments of bottles, bags and other plastic items, come into contact with natural materials such as sand, shells, rocks and wood on beaches.

The plastic melts and fuses with the natural materials, creating a new composite material that incorporates both plastic and natural components.

The term 'plastiglomerate' was coined by a team of researchers led by geologist Dr Patricia Corcoran.

Plastiglomerate was discovered in 2006 by Charles Moore, a sea captain and oceanographer at Algalita Marine Research and Education in California. Moore was surveying plastic washed up on Kamilo Beach, a remote, polluted stretch of sand on Hawaii's Big Island.

The formation of plastiglomerates is a result of human activities, particularly the improper disposal of plastic waste. These materials can have long-lasting environmental impacts, as they become incorporated into coastal ecosystems and geological formations.

Further to the earlier answer, voice pipes were used to powerful dramatic effect in the 1953 film The Cruel Sea, when Captain Ericson (Jack Hawkins) hears the screams of men trapped in his burning, sinking ship through the voice pipes, and then imagines that he hears them again on board his new ship in harbour.

The summer holidays are nearly here which would normally mean there's never been a better time to fire up the barbeque and line it with beef burgers. 

But a new study shows you might want to swap them for meat-free alternatives if you want to do your bit to save the planet.

University of Oxford experts say eating just 100g of meat per day - less than a single burger - creates four times more greenhouse gases compared with a vegan diet.

The researchers now want to see prompt policy action from government and organisations to trigger 'dietary shifts away from animal-based foods'. 

Previous studies have already suggested there are personal health benefits from ditching a meat diet, including reduced risk of heart disease.  

Even low meat diets reduce environmental impact by about 30 per cent across most environmental measures compared to high meat eaters

Replacing red meat in our diet with plant-based alternatives is thought to improve human health and planetary health

 

The new study was led by experts from the Livestock, Environment and People (LEAP) project at the University of Oxford, which is working to understand the 'health, environmental, social and economic effects of meat and dairy production'. 

'Our dietary choices have a big impact on the planet,' said lead author Peter Scarborough, professor of population health at Oxford's Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences and LEAP project investigator. 

'Our results, which use data from over 38,000 farms in over 100 countries, show that high meat diets have the biggest impact for many important environmental indicators, including climate change and biodiversity loss. 

'Cutting down the amount of meat and dairy in your diet can make a big difference to your dietary footprint.' 

Scientists have long been vocal about the huge carbon footprint of humanity's love for meat, fish and dairy, especially beef.

Animal agriculture contributes to global warming because of the methane, nitrous oxide and carbon emissions of livestock and their supply chains. 

What's more, deforestation to make way for space to rear cattle reduces the amount of trees that absorb carbon dioxide. 

The authors stress the need for 'changes in diets' if we want to remain within 'safe environmental boundaries for greenhouse gas emissions'.

Why is meat bad for the planet? 

Meat-heavy diets risk the health of our planet, as livestock farming on a massive scale destroys habitats and generates greenhouse gases. 

Animal agriculture contributes to global warming because of the methane, nitrous oxide and carbon emissions of livestock and their supply chains. 

The clearing of trees to make way for grazing cattle also reduces carbon sequestration - the process of capturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide.  

If these emissions get too high, the result could be rising sea levels and scorching temperatures that threaten life on Earth. 

For the study, Professor Scarborough and colleagues linked dietary data from 55,504 people with data on the environmental impacts of the foods they eat. 

The individuals - who filled out food frequency questionnaires - were either meat-eaters, vegetarians, vegans or pescatarians. 

Meat eaters were separated into three categories depending on if they had a high-meat diet (eating over 100g of meat per day on average), medium-meat diet (between 50g and 100g) or low-meat diet (less than 50g).

For reference, a single beef burger that you might buy as part of a multipack in the supermarket is typically just over 100g each. 

Dietary information was linked with food-level data on greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use, potential biodiversity loss and the risk of 'eutrophication' -increased nutrients in waters due to CO2, leading to fish death. 

The researchers found that the dietary impact of vegans on greenhouse gas emissions was 25 per cent of high meat-eaters.

This means eating 100g of meat per day or more on average creates four times more greenhouse gases than being vegan. 

Consistently, across multiple measures such as carbon dioxide emissions (CO2e) and land use, a vegan diet was found to be the most environmentally-friendly option

READ MORE: Ending meat production could save the planet, study says

If we phased out all meat in 15 years, annual global CO2 emissions would fall 68 per cent, the study says 

Similarly, dietary impact of vegans was 25.1 per cent for land use, 46 per cent for water use, 27 per cent for eutrophication and 34 per cent for biodiversity, when compared with high meat-eaters. 

Interestingly, researchers saw a 30 per cent difference between high-meat diets and low-meat diets for most of the measures of environmental harm.

This suggests that substantially reducing the amount of meat you eat can greatly help the planet, even if you're not giving it up entirely. 

However, a vegan diet was consistently found to be the best diet when it came to the multiple environmental impacts - carbon emissions, land use, water use, eutrophication potential and biodiversity. 

The new study, published in the journal Nature Food, what is now a big collection of studies that have urged people to cut down on the meat they eat. 

A study last found eliminating all meat from our diets over the next 15 years would slash global carbon emissions by an impressive 68 per cent. 

Another said meat consumption should be slashed to the equivalent of two burgers per week to avoid a climate crisis. 

Yet another British report advocated serving vegan food in schools, prisons and hospitals to increase its popularity among the general public. 

Professor Scarborough and colleagues point out that the UK is now committed legally to a 78 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 compared to 1990. 

Therefore, British citizens taking responsibility for reducing the amount of meat they eat could be crucial. 

'If the government is to achieve its ambitious targets for carbon reductions, then rapid progress must be made across all sectors including implementing measures to encourage consumers to shift diets,' the team conclude. 

Never mind plant burgers! Could lab-grown red meat save the environment?  

Lab-grown meat is set to become more ubiquitous this decade, transforming from a niche concept to a common fridge staple. 

Professor Mark Post at Maastricht University in the Netherlands unveiled the world's first lab-grown burger from cow muscle cells, in 2013.

He's now pioneering a 'kinder and cleaner' way of making beef with his firm, Mosa Meat, which created the world's first hamburger without slaughtering an animal. 

The company extracts cells from the muscle of an animal, such as a cow for beef, when the animal is under anaesthesia.   

The cooked Mosa Meat patty looks similar to conventionally-made beef burgers. The company says it tastes 'like meat'

The cells then are placed in a dish containing nutrients and naturally-occurring growth factors, and allowed to proliferate just as they would inside an animal, until there are trillions of cells from a small sample. 

These cells later form muscle cells, which naturally merge to form primitive muscle fibres and edible tissue.  

From one sample from a cow, the firm can produce 800 million strands of muscle tissue, which is enough to make 80,000 quarter pounders. 

Mosa Meat has also created cultured fat that it adds to its tissue to form the finished product, which simply tastes 'like meat', the company says. 

Professor Post think this product will be so popular with animal welfare activists and burger fans alike it will eventually displace plant-based substitutes, like soy burgers, that are increasingly common in UK supermarkets. 

'Novel technologies such as the ones developed in cellular agriculture are part of the solution, next to reducing food waste and changing consumer behaviour,' Professor Post told MailOnline. 

'A good example of strong trend in consumer behaviour is increased vegetarianism among young generations to unprecedented numbers. 

'Most likely, this trend will continue and spread towards other age groups and eventually will lead to disappearance of plant-based meat substitutes.'

Mosa Meat received $55 million in 2021 to scale up production of cultured meat. 

The funding will help extend the firm's current pilot production facility in the Dutch city of Maastricht and develop an industrial-sized production line.

A British company has developed the first tractor in the world to be completely powered by cow dung. 

The liquid methane gas-powered T7 vehicle is said to be first of its kind and could mark a turning point in efficient energy supply on UK farms.

The pioneering 270bhp tractor runs on fuel captured from farmyard manure and is said to match the performance of standard diesel-powered versions.

It works by collecting waste by-products from a herd as small as 100 cows into a biomethane storage unit based on the farm.

How does it work? 

It works by collecting waste by-products from a herd as small as 100 cows into a biomethane storage units based on the farm. 

The gas - known as fugitive methane - is then treated, compressed and turned into the low emission fuel.

A cryogenic tank fitted on the tractor keeps the methane in liquid form at -162 degrees giving the vehicle as much power as a diesel but with significant emission savings.

A cryogenic tank fitted on the tractor keeps the methane in liquid form at -162 degrees giving the vehicle as much power as a diesel but with significant emission savings.

The groundbreaking machine was developed by Cornish company Bennamann, which has been researching and developing biomethane production for over a decade.

It was put through its paces during a pilot run on a farm in Cornwall where carbon dioxide emissions were slashed from 2,500 tonnes to 500 tonnes in just a year.

Bennamann co-founder Chris Mann said: 'The T7 liquid methane-fuelled tractor is a genuine world-first and another step towards decarbonising the global agricultural industry and realising a circular economy.

'Methane also has more than 80 times the atmosphere warming power of carbon dioxide over 20 years, so by removing it and putting it to good use we are helping to rapidly tackle global warming.

'We've shown that harnessing the potential of biomethane can make farms energy-independent and carbon-neutral.'

The New Holland T7 Methane Power LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) tractor was unveiled last month at an event in the USA.

The farmyard machine was created in partnership with New Holland's parent company CNH Industrial and Bennamann, which is based in Newquay.

To create the liquified fuel, the methane gas is first collected and stored in one of Bennamann's on-farm biomethane capture and storage systems.

The government grant-eligible systems are used for sealing slurry lagoons to capture methane that would otherwise escape to the atmosphere.

The company is also investigating the wider users of the technology and hope it could one day be used to charge electric vehicles in rural locations.

The Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) are now co-funding a study to assess the scale of fugitive methane emissions in Cornwall.

They will investigate the current emissions from sites such as dairy farms and wastewater treatment plants.

The partnership will also study the future potential use of biomethane as a fuel for the likes of transport and agriculture.

Chair of the LEP, Mark Duddridge said: 'Biomethane has huge potential.

'If we can make our agriculture industry energy-independent in the face of soaring input costs and volatile energy prices, while reducing emissions, then we can provide a huge economic boost for rural communities, greater food security, and move towards net zero. These applications are not limited to agriculture or Cornwall. They are global.'

THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF FARMING COWS

The livestock animals are notorious for creating large amounts of methane, which is a major contributor to global warming.

Each of the farm animals produces the equivalent of three tonnes of carbon dioxide per year and the amount of the animals is increasing with the growing need to feed a booming population.

Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases, trapping 30 times more heat than the same amount of carbon dioxide. 

Scientists are investigating how feeding them various diets can make cattle more climate-friendly.

They believe feeding seaweed to dairy cows may help and are also using a herb-rich foodstuff called the Lindhof sample.  

Researchers found a cow's methane emissions were reduced by more than 30 per cent when they ate ocean algae.

In research conducted by the University of California, in August, small amounts of it were mixed into the animals' feed and sweetened with molasses to disguise the salty taste.

As a result, methane emissions dropped by almost a third. 

'I was extremely surprised when I saw the results,' said Professor Ermias Kebreab, the animal scientist who led the study.

'I wasn't expecting it to be that dramatic with a small amount of seaweed.'

The team now plans to conduct a further six-month study of a seaweed-infused diet in beef cattle, starting this month.

Incredible satellite images show how toxic algal blooms now grow in at least 12.1 million square miles (31.47 million square kilometres) of ocean, thanks to human activity.

A study from researchers at the Southern University of Science and Technology in China found that the total area affected by phytoplankton growth has increased by 13.2 per cent since 2003. 

When nutrients from fertilisers, sewage, air pollution and livestock manure find their way into water sources, phytoplankton will feed on their nutrients and grow.

The researchers also found that rising sea temperatures have increased the frequency of algal blooms over this last two decades, as warmer waters increases the length of the blooming season.

They wrote: 'Many algal blooms are beneficial, fixing carbon at the base of the food chain and supporting fisheries and ecosystems worldwide. However, proliferations of algae that cause harm, termed harmful algal blooms, have become a major environmental problem worldwide.'

An algal bloom is a rapid increase in the population of algae in an aquatic system, and can occur in freshwater as well as marine environments.

WHAT IS AN ALGAL BLOOM? 

An algal bloom is a rapid increase in the population of algae in an aquatic system.

The phenomenon can occur in freshwater as well as marine environments and can cause discolouration of the water, turning it yellow, red or bright green.

Some algal blooms result from an excess of nutrients which cause growth in algae and other green plants.

With more nutrient food available, the bacteria increase and use up the dissolved oxygen in the water.

When oxygen content decreases, many fish and aquatic insects cannot survive, resulting in a dead area.

Algal blooms composed of phytoplankters known to naturally produce biotoxins are often called Harmful Algal Blooms, or HABs. 

Blooms can cause discoloration of the water at surface level, turning it yellow, red or bright green, as can be seen in the new satellite images.

They are often the result of eutrophication - when bodies of water become enriched with nutrients like phosphates and nitrates, which provide food for algae and other green plants, allowing for their growth.

The phytoplankton become harmful when they use up all the dissolved oxygen in the water, leading to the suffocation of fish and aquatic insects, which in turn become nutrient sources themselves.

Some types of algae also produce biotoxins which can have severe impacts on wildlife, and contribute to these 'dead zones' where aquatic life cannot survive. 

For the study, published today in Nature, scientists used 760,000 images taken by NASA satellites from 2003 to 2020 to calculate the global ocean area covered by algae each year and bloom frequency.

They then compared this data to sea surface temperatures (SSTs) as well as how much the temperature changes per metre, or the 'spatial SST gradient'.

A large difference in temperature between two adjacent areas in the ocean, or large spatial SST gradient, can indicate poor water circulation.

This is because hotter water is less dense than colder water and reduces the sinking in the natural 'conveyor belt' motion of the currents.

As a result, nutrients are less evenly distributed through the water column, and phytoplankton is able to grow in areas where they are highly concentrated, generally those closer to the surface.

Large differences in temperature between adjacent areas of ocean can also cause turbulence and bring up more nutrients from deeper waters to further encourage algal growth.



The maps showed that coastal phytoplankton blooms have increased by 1.53 million square miles (3.97 million square kilometres) over the observed period.

In 2020, they covered 8.6 per cent of all global ocean area.

The researchers also found that rising sea temperatures have increased the frequency of algal blooms over this last two decades, as warmer waters increases the length of the blooming season

The average annual number of blooms observed was also found to increase by 59.2 per cent between 2003 and 2020 - the equivalent of 2.19 per cent each year.

This rising bloom frequency correlated significantly with ocean temperature, suggesting that 'bloom-favourable seasons in these temperate seas have been extended under warmer temperatures'.

Bloom frequency also increased with the spatial SST gradient in many areas, including California, the Gulf Steam and the Canary Current.

This suggests that the weak ocean currents caused by rising sea temperatures contribute to the growth of algae. 

Around China, Iran, Vietnam and the Philippines, the researchers also noted an increase in fertiliser usage over the study period, which likely contributed to the upswing in phytoplankton.

The same could be said for the intensified aquaculture industry in Finland, China, Algeria, Guinea, Vietnam, Argentina, Russia and Uruguay.

Bloom frequency also increased with the spatial SST gradient in many areas, including California, the Gulf Steam and the Canary Current. This suggests that weak ocean currents, that can be brought on by global warming, contribute to the growth of algae. Left: Global patterns of trends in spatial SST gradient from 2003 to 2020. Right: Global patterns of trends in SST from 2003 to 2020

The researchers hope that their maps and data will help increase understanding the mechanisms that drive and dissipate coastal phytoplankton blooms.

This may inform policymakers assess the risk of harmful algal blooms and that decide on strategies to help reduce their occurrence.



'Many blooms are beneficial, particularly in terms of their positive effects on ecosystems as well as on wild and farmed fisheries,' the authors wrote.

'The results here can also contribute toward policies and management actions that sustain those beneficial blooms.'

Ocean temperatures hit a record high in 2022, data shows 

Ocean temperatures in 2022 were 'the hottest in the historical record', breaking a record already set in 2021, a study has revealed. 

An international team of researchers say Earth's oceans received an additional 10 Zetta joules of heat - or 10 followed by 21 zeroes - last year. 

This is enough to boil 700 million 1.5 litre kettles every second for a year, or 100 times the world's electricity generation in a year. 

The experts say the findings show how the world's oceans have been 'profoundly affected' by the emission of greenhouse gases from human activities. 



'The oceans are absorbing most of the heating from human carbon emissions,' said study author Professor Michael Mann at the University of Pennsylvania.

'Until we reach net zero emissions, that heating will continue, and we'll continue to break ocean heat content records, as we did this year. 

'Better awareness and understanding of the oceans are a basis for the actions to combat climate change.'

Vegan burgers should be served in schools and PRISONS to trigger a shift away from meat, scientists claim

Vegan food should be served in schools, prisons and hospitals to promote its popularity with the general public, a new report argues. 

Bringing plant-based burgers, sausages and fillets to the kitchens of such public institutions could trigger a shift away from animal meat, it says. 

Cutting red meat intake can improve our health but also that of the planet, as livestock farming at scale destroys habitats and pumps out CO2 and methane. 

The new report say there are 'social norms' around meat consumption that need changing, although taste, texture and nutrition of 'fake meat' still needs improving.

Where should plant burgers be served? 

The report suggests serving plant based options in the following public institutions:

- Schools

- Hospitals

- Prisons

- Government offices

The new report has been authored by experts at sustainability consultancy Systemiq in partnership with the University of Exeter, who make a series of recommendations for accelerating net zero. 

'Shifting to alternative proteins, thereby cutting demand for meat production, could reduce both pressure for land use change and emissions from livestock farming,' they say in the report. 

'Favouring alternative proteins in public procurement policies globally could help to bring forward tipping points in their adoption. 

'Using public institutions (e.g., government offices, hospitals, prisons, schools) to purchase alternative proteins in large quantities would rapidly increase demand and help producers to achieve economies of scale, thereby lowering costs. 

'By introducing large numbers of consumers to these products, public procurement can also enhance accessibility and help to shift social norms around meat consumption.' 

Already, alternative proteins are projected to reach around 10 per cent of the market share by 2035, but this could be pushed to 20 per cent with such a policy change.

How does meat and dairy hurt the planet? 

Eating meat, eggs and dairy products hurts the environment in a number of different ways.

Cows, pigs and other farm animals release huge amounts of methane into the atmosphere. While there is less methane in the atmosphere than other greenhouse gases, it is around 25 times more effective than carbon dioxide at trapping heat.

Raising livestock also means converting forests into agricultural land, meaning CO2-absorbing trees are being cut down, further adding to climate change. More trees are cut down to convert land for crop growing, as around a third of all grain produced in the world is used to feed animals raised for human consumption. 

Factory farms and crop growing also requires massive amounts of water, with 542 litres of water being used to produce just a single chicken breast.

As well as this, the nitrogen-based fertiliser used on crops adds to nitrous oxide emissions. Nitrous oxide is around 300 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere. These fertilisers can also end up in rivers, further adding to pollution. 

The authors note, however, that plant-based meat still has to change to appeal to more customers - namely, achieve taste and texture that more closely resemble animal protein, which will require significant 'technological innovation'.

Plant-based meat will also have to overcome health and dietary concerns, as some fear that it's not as nutritious as real meat.

Previous research has shown that some alternative meat products contain excessive amounts of salt. 

Once these issues are overcome, plant-based protein must also be easy to purchase in shops, online and in restaurants, they say.

Apart from plant-based, there are several other alternative forms of protein such as algae, insects and even cultured (lab-grown) meat. 

But plant-based proteins are the closest to reaching parity with animal meats in terms of cost, taste and texture, the experts point out. 

The authors acknowledge progress that has been already made, as plant proteins are now present in most prominent fast food chains.

Burger King sells plant-based burgers over the world, including its Whopper made from soy protein, while McDonald's McPlant is sold across Europe, including the UK.

Plant products have also become much more prominent in supermarkets, many of which have set up dedicated vegan sections in the past few years. 

However, more research is required to see what role supermarkets have in helping the shift to these alternatives, the report says. 

Overall, cutting demand for meat production could reduce both pressure for land use change and emissions from livestock farming.

A reduction in livestock farming could free up somewhere between 400 and 800 million hectares of land, the report says, citing previous research. 

This is equivalent to seven to 15 per cent of agricultural land today, which could help grow a greater volume of food to feed the world's growing population. 

Bringing plant products to public institutions is identified as one of three 'super leverage points' - where a small intervention can cause a large beneficial effect on the climate. 

The others are mandating vehicles with zero emissions and 'green' ammonia (ammonia made with renewable energy) for fertilizers. 

Overall, significantly more action across all sectors is needed this decade to keep the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 2.7°F (1.5°C) within reach, the report says.

Never mind plant burgers! Could lab-grown red meat save the environment?  

Lab-grown meat is set to become more ubiquitous this decade, transforming from a niche concept to a common fridge staple. 

Professor Mark Post at Maastricht University in the Netherlands unveiled the world's first lab-grown burger from cow muscle cells, in 2013.

He's now pioneering a 'kinder and cleaner' way of making beef with his firm, Mosa Meat, which created the world's first hamburger without slaughtering an animal. 

The company extracts cells from the muscle of an animal, such as a cow for beef, when the animal is under anaesthesia.   

The cooked Mosa Meat patty looks similar to conventionally-made beef burgers. The company says it tastes 'like meat'

The cells then are placed in a dish containing nutrients and naturally-occurring growth factors, and allowed to proliferate just as they would inside an animal, until there are trillions of cells from a small sample. 

These cells later form muscle cells, which naturally merge to form primitive muscle fibres and edible tissue.  

From one sample from a cow, the firm can produce 800 million strands of muscle tissue, which is enough to make 80,000 quarter pounders. 

Mosa Meat has also created cultured fat that it adds to its tissue to form the finished product, which simply tastes 'like meat', the company says. 

Professor Post think this product will be so popular with animal welfare activists and burger fans alike it will eventually displace plant-based substitutes, like soy burgers, that are increasingly common in UK supermarkets. 

'Novel technologies such as the ones developed in cellular agriculture are part of the solution, next to reducing food waste and changing consumer behaviour,' Professor Post told MailOnline. 

'A good example of strong trend in consumer behaviour is increased vegetarianism among young generations to unprecedented numbers. 

'Most likely, this trend will continue and spread towards other age groups and eventually will lead to disappearance of plant-based meat substitutes.'

Mosa Meat received $55 million in 2021 to scale up production of cultured meat. 

The funding will help extend the firm's current pilot production facility in the Dutch city of Maastricht and develop an industrial-sized production line.

Overview

Harper Adams is the leading university in the UK offering land-based (agriculture) courses. Set on a 494-hectare farm adjoining a campus in the Shropshire countryside, it offers a university experience unlike most others and is the highest ranked modern university in our league table. Where else can students join an off-roading club (cars, particularly 4x4s, being frowned upon on most other campuses) or enjoy field sports? The university farm contains dairy, beef and pig units, two flocks of sheep, poultry facilities and hectares of arable and grassland given over to research projects. Harper Adams' pre-eminence was confirmed in the latest funding announcement by the Office for Students when it was one of just 16 universities and colleges to be given world-leading specialist status - and the only one specialising in agriculture. High levels of student satisfaction help the university fare well in rankings such as ours. All courses come with a work placement year and there is an accent on preparing students for future employment and the advances technology is bringing to agriculture. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak recently praised Harper Adams as 'a fantastic example of the type of innovation and skills provision that we need in our agri-tech sector'. It is hard to disagree.

Paying the bills

A record-breaking £564,000 was awarded in scholarships in 2023, with 136 students benefitting. The non-means-tested awards are often industry-sponsored or supported philanthropically, and they offer varying levels of support. Typical of what is on offer is the Helmut Claas Scholarship, sponsored by the combine harvester manufacturer and open to second-year engineering students, which offers a one-year paid work placement with the company in Germany together with up to £9,000 of bursary support, paid in £3,000 chunks in the years spent studying at Harper Adams. A small sum, paid via the Access to Learning Fund, is also available for students struggling to make ends meet. Accommodation on campus is among the cheapest in the country, with a small number of shared self-catered rooms priced at just over £3,000 for a 42-week contract. Even the most expensive self-catered ensuite rooms cost less than £5,200 a year with catered options also available, priced between £4,457 a year (for a shared room) and £6,877 a year (for an en-suite single room).

What's new?

A programme of course revamps is under way benefitting the next three student intakes with a focus this year on food innovation, business management and mechanical engineering. Next September, new courses are expected to cover agriculture in combination with animal production science, crop production science, farm business management and farm technology. Other new options should include wildlife, conservation and ecology, and applied animal science with specialisms in companion animals, equine science, farmed animals and zoo animals. The courses are being developed with industry input to ensure they meet the global sustainability agenda, bridge current knowledge gaps and meet employers' needs. Typical of the innovation at Harper Adams is a unique drone short course developed with industry partner, AutoSpray Systems, which equips participants with the practical skills needed for drone-delivered crop spraying. The university has long been at the forefront of innovations to support precision and autonomous farming. Structural improvements on campus will see a £15m pathology facility developed to support research and teaching in animal science, agriculture and veterinary medicine, and nursing and physiotherapy, while the veterinary education centre has recently benefitted from £500,000 of upgrades.

Admissions, teaching and student support

Despite the crisis in student mental health, the university is one of few that require students to attend mandatory sessions covering wellbeing and mental health. These sessions share information on services available, which include counselling and occupational therapy. The university subscribes to a 24/7 student assistance programme that makes counselling available to students at any time of day. The university has made changes to its course delivery for all students, but with a particular focus on helping those from under-represented groups who classify as widening participation admissions. To this end, Harper Adams has moved away from closed book examinations as the default assessment method to open book assessments; blends teaching and digital learning resources through the offer of lecture notes and recording to allow students to review and revise content; and extends the induction process beyond freshers' week and into the pre-arrival stage and further into the first term. The university operates a contextual offer scheme that lowers the ask by one A-level grade or equivalent to care leavers and those who live in an area of disadvantage. The introduction of an Access to Ag4All scheme next year will remove the requirement for applicants to agriculture courses to have had ten weeks of practical work experience, opening courses up to more applicants from a non-farming background.

Ingenious and bizarre way the US Government is preventing a rabies outbreak: Planes drop bait laced with vaccines for racoons to munch on

American health officials are preventing an outbreak of rabies by dropping vaccines from planes as part of a half-billion-dollar federal program.

Over 9 million ketchup packet-sized pieces of food containing vaccines are scattered all over the Eastern United States to suppress the deadly neurological virus in raccoons and keep it from killing humans.

The packets come in two flavors especially designed to appeal to the trash-diving mammal ""” vanilla and fishmeal ""” but 'packet thieves' who don't need the rabies vaccine, like gray squirrels and opossums, do make off with a few morsels.  

The annual airdrop, run by the US Department of Agriculture since 1997, has stopped the spread of rabies westward across the US, but now hopes to eradicate the disease in racoons in the east as well.

The news comes amid warnings from scientists that rabies-infected vampire bats are creeping up North America via Mexico, as habitats shift due to climate change. 

Over 9 million ketchup packet-sized pieces of food containing vaccines are scattered all over the Eastern US to suppress the deadly neurological virus in raccoons and keep it from killing humans. Officials have stopped its westward spread - but now want to eradicate it in the east



The USDA has renewed testing of a newer vaccine with a new flavor this year, in its effort to entice more raccoons: marshmallow with icing sugar, vegetable oil and a dark-green food dye

'What we haven't been able to do,' according to Charles Rupprecht, a former head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) rabies program, 'is eliminate it from any state where raccoon rabies currently exists.'

The USDA has renewed testing of a newer vaccine with a new flavor this year, in its effort to entice more raccoons: marshmallow with icing sugar, vegetable oil and a dark-green food dye.

'Our feelings are absolutely not hurt if skunks, foxes or coyotes pick them up. And they do,' said wildlife biologist Jordona Kirby, a field coordinator for the USDA's National Rabies Management Program.

'So, although raccoons are the reservoir and spread rabies primarily in the east,' Kirby told NPR, 'those other animals, just like any mammal, can contract rabies.'

Last year, in fact, researchers working with the University of Georgia's Savannah River Ecology Laboratory determined that 'competition with opossums,' at least, was not holding raccoons back from getting their dose of the vaccine. 

The researchers' proposed two solutions to get more raccoons vaccinated, as published this year in the Journal of Wildlife Management, focused less on the competition and more on the raccoons. 

The first suggestion was 'altering the bait matrix to make it more attractive to raccoons,' meaning even more design and flavor experimentation. 

Their second new proposal: drop the oral vaccine packets in winter months, when food is more scarce, 'to promote bait acceptance by raccoons.'

Up to the present, the USDA's oral vaccine airdrops have typically occurred between the months of July and October.  

Starting last July, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) began the next phase of their marshmallow trials ""” which distributes approximately 3.5 million of the new oral vaccine baits, called ONRAB ORV, across parts of Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.

One other area, however, will be the focus of their data collection for this field test.  

Wildlife biologist Kathy Nelson, who oversees the USDA's National Rabies Management Program, said that only 30 percent of raccoons in a region need to be vaccinated to stop the spread of the disease, and a 60-percent rate could eliminate rabies from an entire area

Hundreds of Rhode Island residents have received rabies vaccines after they were possibly exposed to the fatal disease during an 'unprecedented bat season' in the state. Health officials said approximately 200 people have needed to receive rabies post-exposure prophylaxis, the vaccine series that prevents the viral disease after someone has been exposed

'APHIS is conducting the final year of a small-scale project during October in Chattanooga,' USDA officials announced, 'to evaluate the effectiveness of ONRAB's distribution methods.' 

Wildlife biologists working for APHIS in Chattanooga, Tennessee will catch and test a random sampling of raccoons and skunks following this year's bait distribution to track their vaccination rates.

Low flying planes are used in rural areas to scatter these oral vaccines from the air, equipped with a convey belt inside the aircraft to automate and evenly distribute the vaccines at roughly 75 baits per square kilometer (29 per square mile). 

In truly remote areas where raccoons are less likely to live, including the spruce forests of northeastern Vermont, the USDA only drops about 37 baits per square kilometer (14 per square mile).

But in more urban areas, the USDA's distribution hopes to hit as much as 150 oral vaccines per square kilometer (58 per square mile), dropped on the suburbs via helicopter and tossed out the back of vans in cities. 

Bushes, sewer drain pipes under roads and bridges, and strip mall restaurant dumpsters are all prime locations. 

'Any area that looks like a raccoon habitat, we stop there,' wildlife biologist Kathy Nelson, who oversees the USDA's National Rabies Management Program told Wired.

Nelson said the USDA estimates that only 30 percent of raccoons in a region need to be vaccinated to stop the spread of the disease, and 60-percent vaccination rate could eliminate rabies from an entire area. 

She hopes new techniques can entice more of the creatures to do so. 

Rabies is a neurological virus transmitted through saliva that kills approximately 59,000 people each year, worldwide, but only two to three deaths annually in the US ""” thanks to the USDA's multimillion dollar program and other national efforts. 

In the first half of the 20th century, the majority of rabid animals in the US were dogs, both pets and strays, until vaccine efforts targeting the disease in pooches succeeded in dropping those numbers in the 1950s and '60s.

Today the most common carriers are raccoons, skunks, foxes and bats, with the winged creatures increasingly becoming the main cause of rabies deaths in the US.

As the vaccine bait drops continue, a statement from the USDA advises, 'Humans and pets cannot get rabies from contact with the bait but are asked to leave the bait undisturbed if they encounter it.'

'An intact bait is harmless, but it's difficult to know if the bait was leaking vaccine while on the ground,' department officials said. 'If contact with bait occurs, the contact area should be immediately rinsed with warm water and soap.'

'Each bait carries a toll-free number that people can call if they have additional questions concerning a bait contact.'

NYT's 1619 Project is slammed for pushing 'reparations math' high school course to teach children how slavery 'led to a wealth gap for African Americans'

Thousands of high schoolers are set to learn a radical new 'reparations math' curriculum that teaches how slavery 'led to a wealth gap for African Americans'.

The course is the latest school module released by the 1619 Project's education network, a controversial journalism project focused on spreading awareness of America's history of slavery. 

According to its website, students will take lessons geared towards answering 'whether or not reparations should be paid to the descendants of enslaved people in the US'.

It is not yet clear where the new curriculum would be taught. A 2020 report by Real Clear Investigations found that 1619 courses had been adopted in over 3,500 classrooms across all 50 states. 

But several states, including Arkansas and Mississippi, have since introduced legislation that bans schools from using the lesson plans after critics slammed them as 'racially divisive'. 

The 1619 Project was founded in 2019 by journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones (pictured) 

Over a four-week course, students will cover a series of objectives aiming to answer the 'essential question' of the curriculum: 'Should reparations be paid for the United States' use of enslaved labor? If so, what is the basis of those payments?'

Subjects in the course include how industries such as sugar production 'grew as a result of slave labor, and have led to a wealth gap for African Americans in the U.S.'

Students are also asked to analyze news media's reception to the idea of reparations, and how different payment methods would work in practice. 

The course's unit overview states that students will 'study, document, and analyze activities that led to the worldwide domination of crops produced using slave labor due to the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade.'

'They will also evaluate the way that enslavement of African Americans has led to a wealth gap for African Americans over time,' it adds.  

But critics have slammed the proposals, with constitutional expert and Texas Public Policy Foundation senior fellow Carol Swain telling The College Fix the 1619 project should not have a place in children's education. 

'It is disheartening to watch the influence the historically inaccurate and flawed 1619 Project is having on American society through seemingly unlimited access to ideologically mainstream media platforms that never allow anyone to question their flawed narratives,' she said. 

'The curriculum materials for math are clearly geared towards politicizing the youngest minds.' 

The 1619 project has previously come under fire for promoting Critical Race Theory in classrooms, a controversial racial justice theory. 

While proponents argue it is necessary in the struggle to end racism in the nation going forward, critics claim children are being indoctrinated into thinking that white people are inherently racist or sexist.

The newest module in the 1619 Project's education network will see high schoolers learn 'reparations math and reparations history' 

The course includes a series of objectives geared towards answering the question 'Should reparations be paid for the United States' use of enslaved labor?' 

The unit overview states that students will 'study, document, and analyze activities that led to the worldwide domination of crops produced using slave labor' 

The curriculum has been slated by those who feel it is a continuation of the 1619 Project's controversial campaign, with American Enterprise Institute senior fellow Ian Rowe, hitting out at the course for pushing divisive ideas on children. 

'Students taking Reparations Math learn no opposing viewpoints,' he said. 

'(The curriculum) is pure indoctrination designed to perpetuate an ideology of black dependency and retribution for historical and presumed present day racial victimization.' 

Founded by journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones in 2019 in collaboration with The New York Times, the 1619 project has become one of the most influential civil rights groups in America. 

It has said it aims to reframe the country's history by 'placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the center of the United States' national narrative'. 

Its success led to a six-part Hulu show executive produced by Oprah Winfrey, however the series was panned by critics who slated it for a 'lack of facts'. 

Among those who criticized the show was former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who said the project was a 'propaganda campaign on race'. 

California's reparations hearings have often been marked with moments of hostility, including from Reverent Tony Pierce in May (pictured), who demanded $200 million in payments

The movement to compensate the descendants of slaves has gained momentum in the US in recent years. 

Last month, a number of House Democrats, led by Rep. Cori Bush, introduced legislation to push for federal reparations amounting to over half the US GDP. 

The $14 trillion campaign states that the U.S. has a 'legal and moral' obligation to provide reparations for the enslavement of black people, a notion that has especially found traction in California. 

In May, the state's nine-member committee became the first in the nation to approve radical proposals to compensate descendants of slavery, despite California never being a slave owning state. 

Under the plan, a black resident in California who has lived in the state their whole life until the age of 71 could receive more than $1.2million in compensation. 

Those set to receive the massive payouts have proposed even higher sums, with some demanding upwards of $200 million in direct payments instead. 

CRITICAL RACE THEORY: WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

The fight over critical race theory in schools has escalated in the United States in recent years.

The theory has sparked a fierce nationwide debate in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests around the country over the last year and the introduction of the 1619 Project.

The 1619 Project, which was published by the New York Times in 2019 to mark 400 years since the first enslaved Africans arrived on American shores, reframes American history by 'placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the center of the US narrative'.

The debate surrounding critical race theory regards concerns that some children are being indoctrinated into thinking that white people are inherently racist or sexist.

Those against critical race theory have argued it reduces people to the categories of 'privileged' or 'oppressed' based on their skin color.

Supporters, however, say the theory is vital to eliminating racism because it examines the ways in which race influence American politics, culture and the law.

Mexico's 'weed nuns' Sisters of the Valley aim to take marijuana back from narcos - and emulate their success in the US where they've raked in $500,000 in the last year from CBD tinctures and salves

A group of Mexican women who call themselves the 'Sisters of the Valley' dress as Catholic nuns while trying to take marijuana back from the narcos, but their financial success has come from expanding to the US.

The Sisters of the Valley were founded in 2014 in Central Mexico, with the aim being to spread the gospel of the healing powers of cannabis. 

In the United States, where around two dozen states have legalized recreational marijuana, the group has also launched a successful small business, selling CBD tinctures, oils and salves online, and raking in over $500,000 last year.

But in Mexico, where a drug war has ravaged the country and Christianity is embedded in society, the image of a marijuana-smoking nun is more an act of rebellion, the women say.

The sisters frequently post on social media, primarily Instagram, where they can be seen caring for cannabis crops, giving workshops, and attending cannabis-related events.

Their product sales are a fraction of that of their U.S. sisters - around $10,000 annually.

While prominent online, the women - five in total - are cautious about giving away too much about the location of their operations. 

They conduct business out of a two-story concrete false storefront with one finished room.

Because cannabis sits in a legal gray area in Mexico and much of its production is still tied to criminal organizations, they worry police or local gangsters could arrive to threaten or extort them.

On a recent weekend where the group showed off for a journalist, the curtains remained drawn. Bundles of marijuana dried in clandestine crevices - hanging from a tucked-away laundry line, or hidden in the stove.

'The Sisterhood is in a totally different context here in Mexico - because of how religious the country is and because of the plant's ties to cartels,' said one of the nuns, who uses the moniker 'Sister Bernardet' online and asked not to give her name for fear of reprisal. 

In her main job as a homeopathic practitioner, she prescribes marijuana to her patients with cancer, joint pain and insomnia.

'We want to take the plant back from the narcos,' she said.

The Sisters fashion themselves after a lay religious movement, the Beguines, that dates back to the Middle Ages. 

The group, made up of single women, devoted itself to spirituality, scholarship and charity, but took no formal vows.

The Sisters globally say they wear habits to project uniformity and respect for the plant, but they also know it catches media attention.

Under the guidance of Alehli Paz, a chemist and marijuana researcher working with the group, the Sisters in Mexico grow a modest crop.

They pot plants in old paint buckets and place them in rows between four unfinished concrete walls on a rooftop.

Once grown, the Sisters move the plants to walled-off private gardens they identified with help from supportive older women in the community.

Their participation is limited to weekends they can steal away from their lives. 

Powered by a seemingly never-ending stream of joints and packed pipe bowls, the women spend time at the farm pruning plants, producing cannabinoid salves or weighing and storing different strains, labeled and dated, in old glass coffee jars.

They also visit others in Mexico City pushing for full legalization in the growing cannabis community, or give workshops that touch on everything from how to make weed infusions to the chemistry behind the plant.

Business potential aside, they argue that the fight against drugs in Latin America has been a failure, leading to widespread violence and mass incarceration.

But in a roughly 75 percent Catholic majority, conservative country locked in a drug war with criminal groups for nearly 20 years, joining the Sisters has created tension in nearly all of the women's families.

Its founder in Mexico, who calls herself 'Sister Camilla' online and declined to give her name, grew up in an evangelical household and left home at 16 due, in part, to her mother's strict religious code, she said. 

When she started Sisters of the Valley Mexico, the relationship became even more strained.

'It was hard for her to accept,' she said. 'She had certain ideas, heavily shaped by religion.'

But today, after lengthy discussions about the plant and the legalization movement, her mother is pivotal to the group's operations, helping to maintain the farm and offering other logistical support, she said.

For another nun who works as a church secretary, uses the moniker 'Sister Kika' and asked her name not be used, the mission is clear. 

'It's time to put an end to this stupidity,' she said.

The Biden administration took a first step toward ending federal protections for grizzly bears in the northern Rocky Mountains on Friday, which would open the door to future hunting in several states including, Montana, Wyoming and Idaho.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said state officials provided 'substantial' information that grizzlies have recovered from the threat of extinction in the regions surrounding Yellowstone and Glacier national parks.

But federal officials rejected claims by Idaho that protections should be lifted beyond those areas. They raised concerns about new laws from the Republican-led states that could potentially harm grizzly populations.

Martha Williams, US Fish and Wildlife Service director said, 'we will fully evaluate these and other potential threats.' 

In a letter on Wednesday she told the head of Montana´s wildlife agency that a law allowing grizzlies to be killed if they attack livestock was inconsistent with the state's commitment to bear conservation. She further stated that the 2023 legislative session offered a 'good opportunity' to address such problems.

The Biden administration on Friday, Feb.3, 2023, took a first step toward ending federal protections for grizzly bears in the northern Rocky Mountains, which would open the door to future hunting in several states 

Friday´s move kicks off at least a year of further study before final decisions about the Yellowstone and Glacier regions.

The states want protections lifted so they can regain management of grizzlies and offer hunts to the public. 

But, as grizzly populations have expanded, more of the animals have moved into areas occupied by people, creating public safety issues and problems for farmers.

State officials have insisted future hunts would be limited and not endanger the overall population. 

After grizzlies temporarily lost their protections in the Yellowstone region several years ago, Wyoming and Idaho scheduled hunts that would have allowed fewer than two dozen bears to be killed in the initial hunting season.

In Wyoming, almost 1,500 people applied for 12 grizzly bear licenses in 2018 before the hunt was blocked in federal court. About a third of the applicants came from out of state. Idaho issued just one grizzly license before the hunt was blocked.

Republican lawmakers in the region in recent years also adopted more aggressive policies against gray wolves, including loosened trapping rules that could lead to grizzlies being inadvertently killed.

As many as 50,000 grizzlies once roamed the western half of the U.S. They were exterminated in most of the country early last century by overhunting and trapping, and the last hunts in the northern Rockies occurred decades ago. 

There are now more than 2,000 bears in the Lower 48 states and much larger populations in Alaska, where hunting is allowed.

The species' expansion in the Glacier and Yellowstone areas has led to conflicts between humans and bears, including periodic attacks on livestock and sometimes the fatal mauling of humans.

Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte welcomed the administration´s announcement and said it could lead to the state reclaiming management of a species placed under federal protection in 1975. He said the grizzly´s recovery 'represents a conservation success.'

Montana held grizzly hunts until 1991 under an exemption to the federal protections that allowed 14 bears to be killed each fall.

The federal government in 2017 sought to remove protections for the Yellowstone ecosystem´s grizzlies under former President Donald Trump. The hunts in Wyoming and Idaho were set to begin when a judge restored protections, siding with environmental groups that said delisting wasn´t based on sound science.

Those groups want federal protections kept in place and no hunting allowed so bears can continue moving into new areas.

'We should not be ready to trust the states,' said attorney Andrea Zaccardi, of the Center for Biological Diversity. Derek Goldman with the Endangered Species Coalition said state management would be a disaster and was glad federal agencies were looking at the states' laws.

Dave Evans, a hunting guide with Wood River Ranch in Meeteetse, Wyoming, said the issue is complex, and he can understand why people fall on both sides of the debate.

'You have so many opinions and some of them are not based on science, but the biologists are the ones that know the facts about what the populations are and what should be considered a goal for each area,' Evans said. 

'If you're going to manage grizzly bears, there's a sustainable number that needs to be kept in balance. I'm not a biologist, but I would follow the science.'

U.S. government scientists have said the regions grizzlies are biologically recovered but in 2021 decided that protections were still needed because of human-caused bear deaths and other pressures. Bears considered problematic are regularly killed by wildlife officials.

Demand for bear hunting licenses would likely be high if the protections are lifted, Evans said.

'You would definitely have a higher demand, and it would probably be very expensive,' Evans said. 'A guided bear hunt in Alaska can start around $20,000, so I would imagine it would be very sought after.'

A decision on the states´ petitions was long overdue. Idaho Gov. Brad Little on Thursday filed notice that he intended to sue over the delay. 

Idaho's petition was broader than the ones filed by Montana and sought to lift protections nationwide.

That would have included small populations of bears in portions of Idaho, Montana and Washington state, where biologists say the animals have not yet recovered to sustainable levels. 

It also could have prevented the return of bears to other areas such as the North Cascades region.

'While we continue to evaluate the decision from USFWS, this is another example of federal overreach and appears to have a disproportionate impact on North Idaho,' Little said in an emailed statement. 

He said his office would 'continue to push back against the federal government.'

Grizzly bear encounters are generally rare in northern Idaho, though wildlife managers occasionally warn people to be on the watch for the animals. 

In 2021, Idaho Fish and Game officials estimated there were between 40 and 50 grizzly bears in the northernmost part of the state.

Climate crisis could spark deadly fungus outbreaks like HBO's 'The Last of Us': Scientists warn of 'hybrid' evolving to adapt to warmer temperatures

Scientists have warned HBO's 'The Last of Us ' has moved one step closer to reality after the discovery of a new hybrid fungus.

Scientists in Barcelona said Candida orthopsilosis originated from two parent strains in a rare event called hybridization as a result of climate change.

The new super-strain has acquired specific properties, such as infecting the human body, growing at higher temperatures and resisting antifungal drugs.

The researchers said hybrids could become more common with rising temperatures and changes in ecosystem conditions, combined with globalization and human action, such as the extensive use of fungicides and antibiotics in agriculture.

HBO 's ' The Last of Us ' may be a fictional series, but scientists have identified a hybrid fungus that has the potential to threaten global health

Lead researcher Dr. Toni GabaldÃ³n from the Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona) said: 'We have spent years trying to answer the question of what makes some species pathogenic for humans and others, such as those we have in our microbiome, not.

'Our results show that hybridization""”a process that has received little attention so far""” allows the rapid acquisition of properties that allow human infection. Therefore, in fungi, this process could be a shortcut to conquer a species like ours.'

During hybridization, divergent genomes and alleles are brought together into the same cell, potentiating adaptation by increasing genomic plasticity. 

Divergent genomes are when two or more ancestral species' populations accumulate mutations over time.

And alleles are one of two or more alternative forms of a gene that arise by mutation and are found at the same place on a chromosome.

'In fact, with due caution, this is the plot of the recent and popular miniseries 'The Last of Us' (HBO Max), where a fungus quickly acquires an enormous capacity for infection, transmission, and virulence, a perfect cocktail of properties which allows it to decimate humanity in a short time,' the researchers shared in a statement. 

The newly discovered fungus is part of the Candid family that causes infections such as vaginal candidiasis or systemic candidiasis, which can be fatal for immunocompromised people

The new super-strain has acquired specific properties, such as infecting the human body, growing at higher temperatures and resisting antifungal drugs

'It is estimated that there are currently more than one million species of fungi, most of which are adapted to live in temperate or low temperatures in the soil, the aquatic environment, trees and plants, and animals such as amphibians, fish, reptiles, and insects.' 

One parental lineage was identified within the hybrid fungus, which passed on an enriched membrane and cell-wall-related proteins, which could play a role in virulence, adhesion and pathogenesis.

Health authorities believe a deadly fungus is now spreading outside of hospitals for the first time. 

And it also took the ability to grow at a faster rate.

'The presence of parental B in co-existence with several of the previously identified hybrid clades suggests that the warm sea water environment could be a melting pot where these two lineages hybridize,' reads the study published in Nature.

Dr. Valentina del Olmo said: 'We saw that the optimal temperature at which strains of C. orthopsilosis grow is 35°C and that they could survive up to much higher temperatures.

'This observation is worrying because their tolerance surpasses the thermal barrier of mammals, which until now had acted as a protective shield, and paves the way for infecting humans.' 

The team shared in a press release that C. orthopsilosis appears closely related to Candida auris, which is currently sweeping through US medical facilities. 

 The team said they believe C. Auris is also a hybrid that formed in the sea and moved to humans in 2009.

There have already been hundreds of outbreaks of this infection worldwide, with a mortality rate of between 30 and 60 percent. 

Scientists point out that it could be the first microorganism that has become a pathogen due to climate change. 

For this work, the team studied nine yeast samples in the Arabian Sea isolated from the marine environment, specifically on the coast of Qatar, finding nearly all were hybrids.

C. orthopsilosis strains have also recently been isolated from tea flowers in Thailand but were not used in this study.

This observation has led them to hypothesize that these fungi might have undergone adaptations that give them an advantage over their parental strains.

Europe is on the verge of a catastrophic drought as groundwater reserves dry up, scientists have warned.

Hotter summers due to global warming has meant there has been a huge drop in surface water levels since 2018, that have not recovered due to heatwaves across Europe in recent years.

Scientists warn Europe is on the edge of a water disaster, and it is already affecting wildlife, habitats and agriculture.

Dr Torsten Mayer-GÃ¼rr, a professor at Graz University of Technology, Austria, and the author of the research, said: 'A few years ago, I would never have imagined that water would be a problem here in Europe.'

It comes as the UK's annual average temperature topped 10C for the first time in 2022, as last year was confirmed as the country's warmest on record.

During the summer months of 2018 and 2019 there was a striking water shortage in Central Europe.

Since then, there has been no significant rise in ground water levels, with levels remaining constantly low.

The potentially catastrophic drought is already damaging natural habitats, affecting agriculture and creating major energy shortages, a new study reveals.

The effects of this prolonged drought were evident in Europe during the summer of 2022.

Dry riverbeds and the slow disappearance of stagnant waters severely impacted both nature and people.

Numerous aquatic species lost their habitats or were killed as their water disappeared, while dry soil caused many problems for agriculture and flash flooding.

The drought also caused massive forest and grass fires across Europe, including in the UK. 

The energy shortage in Europe also worsened, as without sufficient amounts of cooling water, nuclear power plants in countries such as France struggled to generate enough electricity.

Hydroelectric power plants also struggled to fulfil their function due to the lack of water.

This new data shows the real and pressing impact climate change is having across the world.

The UK saw it's hottest year on record in 2022, breaking its previous temperature records and seeing the mercury top 40C. 

Dr Torsten Mayer-GÃ¼rr, a professor at Graz University of Technology, Austria, and study author, said: 'The processing and the computational effort here are quite large.

'We have a distance measurement every five seconds and thus about half a million measurements per month. From this we then determine gravity field maps.'

He added: 'A few years ago, I would never have imagined that water would be a problem here in Europe, especially in Germany or Austria.

'We are actually getting problems with the water supply here - we have to think about this.'

The new data was gathered using satellite gravimetry, a specialised method of measuring the world's groundwater resources and documenting their changes.

The team used twin satellites called Tom and Jerry that orbit the Earth in a polar orbit at an altitude of just under 490 kilometres.

They provide readings of the total mass, from which the mass changes in the rivers and lakes are then subtracted, the soil moisture, snow and ice are also subtracted and finally only the groundwater remains.

The distance between the satellites was constantly and precisely measured.

If they flew over a mountain, the satellite in front was initially faster than the one behind because of the increased mass under it.

Once it had passed the mountain, it slowed down slightly again, but the rear satellite accelerated as soon as it reached the mountain.

Once both were over the top, their relative speed was established once more.

These changes in distance over large masses were the main measurement factors for determining the Earth's gravitational field, which is used to calculate changes in groundwater.

These satellites speed around the earth at around 30,000 km/hr, orbiting the Earth 15 times a day.

They can cover the entire Earth's surface after just one month, meaning they can provide a gravity map of the Earth each month.

However, these gravity maps cannot show the exact amount of groundwater on the planet, as the satellites do not distinguish between sea, lakes or groundwater.

To work out separate masses for each body of water, other partners in the EU G3P project, or Global Gravity-based Groundwater project, had to help out.

While Tom and Jerry provided the total mass of water, the changes in mass of the rivers, lakes, soil moisture, snow and ice were subtracted by these partners, leaving only the level of groundwater.

The results show the water situation in Europe has now become very precarious.

Another searing 47C heatwave is already heading for Europe, forecasters have warned - even as the continent remains on red alert and in the grips of a deadly weather system from the Sahara desert.

British tourists across the Mediterranean have been warned of the life-threatening effects of the sweltering heat after an anticyclone system called Cerberus expanded northwards.

But as Cerberus exhausts itself, Italian weather forecasters are now predicting that another heatwave - named 'Charon', after Hades' ferryman - will push temperatures back up to 43C in Rome and as high as 47C in Sardinia next week.

Land temperatures - how hot the ground is to touch - in Spain reached upwards of 60C in parts of southern Spain on Thursday, with the European Space Agency warning next week could break continental records. 

And in Athens today, rescue workers had to transport tourists from the Acropolis citadel to ambulances today as temperatures soared. It follows reports of the death of a 44-year-old street painter in Lodi, Italy and the tragic drowning of two children in Manfredonia on Tuesday, both believed to be seeking relief from the heat.

Cerberus - named after Hades' three-headed dog in Greek mythology - will see temperatures rise to above 45C in Spain, Italy, Greece and Turkey by the end of next week. The Italian islands of Sardinia and Sicily are set to bear the brunt of the unforgiving heat, with the BBC claiming temperatures could reach 48.8C. 

Meanwhile in Britain, temperatures are expected to cool through to the weekend. Cerberus is not expected to have any effect on the UK, and the Met Office does not anticipate a heatwave will reach the UK this summer.

Health ministry officials have issued red alert warnings for ten major cities in Italy, including Florence and Rome. A red alert warning means that the heat is so intense that it poses a health risk to the whole population - not just vulnerable groups like the elderly and very young children. 

On Tuesday, the unrelenting heatwave - set to last for two weeks - claimed its first life after a 44-year-old road sign worker collapsed due to the heat in the Italian city of Lodi, southeast Milan, as temperatures soared to above 40C. The man, who has not been named, later died in hospital.

'We are facing an unbearable heatwave,' Italian politician Nicola Fratoianni said. 'Dying from the heat is unthinkable - we should be taking measures to avoid tragedies like this in the hottest hours of the day.' 

Italian authorities have now urged people not to drink alcohol or travel unnecessarily to reduce risk.

British tourists have been struggling with the unrelenting heat this week, with some holidaymakers fainting in Rome as temperatures soared above 40C. 

And the unforgiving heat is set to intensify in the coming days. In the northeastern Spanish city of Zaragoza, temperatures will soar to 46C on Tuesday. 

In Greece and Turkey - popular tourist hotspots for Britons - temperatures are set to rise to a sweltering 45C tomorrow and are unlikely to drop below 40C in many areas for the next week. 

Greece's national weather service EMY on July 10 said a six-day heatwave would grip Greece starting July 12. 

Temperatures are also expected to reach 42C on Saturday in Cyprus.

But Italy is bearing the brunt of the heatwave, with Sicily and Sardinia set to see 48.8C temperatures, according to the BBC. In Rome, temperatures are set to soar to 41C next week.

Carlo Cacciamani, head of Italy's national meteorological and climatology agency, said the unusually hot weather hitting the country is because the Cerberus anticyclone has pushed out a colder weather system from the Azores which usually influences summer weather in Italy. 

'This is happening more frequently and means we see temperatures around 40C instead of the normal 30-31C,' Cacciamani told The Times. 

In Greece, authorities banned access to nature reserves and forests to reduce the risk of wildfires, while municipalities were opening air-conditioned areas in public buildings for people to shelter from the heat.

Sun shades will also be installed in Athens at the Acropolis amid reports of tourists fainting at the popular World Heritage Site. 

The Red Cross will also be on site handing out free water to visitors after crowds sweltered in the heat as they queued up to visit the Parthenon, part of the ancient citadel known as the Acropolis.

Union representatives for staff working at the site have argued they should be paid more for working in the sweltering conditions, as Greece's culture minister, Linda Mendoni, vowed to introduce special precautionary measures to protect tourists.

Scientists have relentlessly warned of the damaging effects of climate change. As well as withering crops, melting glaciers and raising the risk of wildfires, higher-than-normal temperatures also cause health problems ranging from heatstroke and dehydration to cardiovascular stress.

Why is the Cerberus anticyclone causing temperatures to soar in Europe? 

An anticyclone named Cerberus is causing temperatures to exceed 40C across much of the Mediterranean this week.

The anticyclone - a high pressure weather system - began in the Sahara desert before expanding into Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. 

Cerberus then expanded northwards towards southern Europe where it is bringing sweltering temperatures.



'How many more summers will we have to go through before we begin to convince ourselves of the fact that the rise in temperatures may not be a sporadic extraordinary event at all, but rather an irreversible process that has in fact already begun,' Italian immunologist Mauro Minelli told the Leggo newspaper. 

The Red Cross has urged people to check on the most vulnerable during the high temperatures, such as children and older people. 

It also called on people to stay hydrated and to watch for signs of heatstroke, which can include vomiting and fainting.

Meanwhile, Greece's agriculture ministry issued restrictions on the transportation and working hours of animals such as horses and donkeys offering rides in tourist areas during the heat wave. 

Working animals won't be allowed to work between noon and 5pm on days where temperatures are between 35-39C in the shade, while they won't be allowed to work at any time of the day when temperatures exceed that range.

Scientists have said climate change combined with the emergence this year of the El Nino weather pattern, which warms the surface waters in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean, have fuelled record-breaking temperatures. 

'The world just had the hottest week on record, according to preliminary data,' the WMO said in a statement, after climate change and the early stages of the El Nino weather pattern drove the warmest June on record. 

This year has already seen a drought in Spain and fierce heatwaves in China as well the United States.

Temperatures are breaking records both on land and in the oceans, with 'potentially devastating impacts on ecosystems and the environment', the WMO said.

'We are in uncharted territory and we can expect more records to fall as El Nino develops further and these impacts will extend into 2024,' said Christopher Hewitt, WMO Director of Climate Services. 'This is worrying news for the planet.'

El Nino is a naturally occurring pattern that drives increased heat worldwide, as well as drought in some parts of the world and heavy rains elsewhere. 

Europe is fastest warming continent on planet, experts say

Europe's climate monitoring service Copernicus has revealed that last week was likely to be the hottest since records began in 1940. 

And scientists at Copernicus have warned that Europe has been warming twice as much as the global average since the 1980s, with far-reaching impacts on the continent's ecosystems and socio-economic fabric. 

Last summer was marked by extreme heat, drought and wildfires across Europe - and the rate at which glaciers melted was 'unprecedented', Copernicus said in its report. 

European countries - including Britain, France, Italy, Portugal and Spain - saw their warmest summer on record last year.  

And worryingly Europe was around 2.3C above the pre-industrial average used as a baseline for the Paris Agreement on climate change last year.

UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres has said 'the situation we are witnessing now is the demonstration that climate change is out of control'.

Research published on Monday found that more than 61,000 people died due to the heat during Europe's record-breaking summer last year.

The majority of deaths were in people over the age of 80 and about 63 percent of those who died due to the heat were women, according to the research published in the journal Nature Medicine.

The world has warmed an average of nearly 1.2C since the mid-1800s, unleashing extreme weather including more intense heatwaves, more severe droughts and storms made fiercer by rising seas.

Oceans absorb most of the heat generated by planet-warming gases, causing heatwaves that harm aquatic life, altering weather patterns and disrupting crucial planet-regulating systems.

In June, global sea surface temperatures hit unprecedented levels. Antarctic sea ice reached its lowest extent for the month since satellite observations began, at 17 per cent below average, breaking the previous June record by a substantial margin.

While sea surface temperatures normally recede relatively quickly from annual peaks, this year they stayed high, with scientists warning that this underscores an underappreciated but grave impact of climate change.

'If the oceans are warming considerably, that has a knock-on effect on the atmosphere, on sea ice and ice worldwide,' said Michael Sparrow, chief of World Climate Research Programme at the WMO.

'There's a lot of concerns from the scientific community and a lot of catch-up from the scientific community trying to understand the incredible changes that we're seeing at the moment.'

El Nino is a naturally occurring pattern that drives increased heat worldwide, as well as drought in some parts of the world and heavy rains elsewhere.

But Mr Sparrow said its effects would likely be felt more acutely later in the year. 'El Nino hasn't really got going yet,' he said.

All trace of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle has been removed from the Queen's Commonwealth Trust website, after the organisation relaunched the site this week. 

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who are currently living in their $14 million Californian mansion, were president and vice president of QCT before they stepped down from royal duties two years ago. 

The QCT was set up to provide funding, tools and support for young Commonwealth leaders to help them transform their communities across agriculture, education, employability and more.

However the new website makes no mention of the work Harry and Meghan did for the organisation, instead focusing on the Queen's legacy.

It comes after experts in Harry and Meghan's bombshell Netflix series branded the Commonwealth as 'Empire 2.0'.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who are currently living in their $14 million Californian mansion, were president and vice president of QCT before they stepped down from royal duties two years ago

Sharing the news of the updated site on Twitter, the organisation posted: 'Our newly re-designed website is now live. 

'Thanks to the important work of young leaders across the #Commonwealth, we have amazing stories lined up for you.

'Please take a moment to check it out and let us know what you think.'

There is no mention of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in the Team QCT section, nor are the couple mentioned in the 'Organisations we support' section.

Instead, there is a detailed explanation of what the Commonwealth is, and how the organisation was set up in 2018 in recognition of the 'Queen's lifetime of service'.

The website update comes after the Commonwealth was criticised in Harry and Meghan's Netflix series.  

The Commonwealth was founded in December 1931 and currently contains 54 countries. According to the Royal Family's website, the purpose of the organisation is to 'foster international co-operation and trade links between people all over the world'. 

In the third episode of the series, writer and broadcaster Afua Hirsh - author of the 2018 memoir Brit(ish) - described the Queen's beloved Commonwealth as being 'Empire 2.0' before then going on to describe Prince Harry as 'anti-racist'.

Discussing institutional racism in the UK, Afua said in the documentary: 'Britain calculated that it needed to grant these countries independence in a way that protected its commercial and capitalist interest. So it created this privileged club called the Commonwealth.

'The Commonwealth is still described as a club of friends who share common values. I find that language really problematic.

'I sometimes call the Commonwealth 'Empire 2.0' because that is what it is.' 

The Queen's Commonwealth Trust announced the news of their updated website on Twitter this week 

It comes after experts in Harry and Meghan's bombshell Netflix series branded the Commonwealth as 'Empire 2.0'

Appearing on an episode of Palace Confidential in December, the Daily Mail's Diary Editor said the couple were 'lucky' that the late monarch wasn't able to watch their TV special, which landed on the streaming platform yesterday morning. 

Discussing the first episodes of the series, Richard said: 'It's almost lucky that Queen Elizabeth isn't alive to see this because the Commonwealth was so central to her and bringing people together. 

'It's a voluntary organisation whereas [in the documentary], it's dismissed as this colonial body used for Britain to extract money and resources from the rest of the world. She would have been horrified.'

Meanwhile, the Mail on Sunday's Editor at Large Charlotte Griffiths pointed out how all the filming for the series finished in August 2022 - just weeks before the Queen passed away at the age of 96.

She said: 'They were planning to do all of this thinking that The Queen would be alive to see it [...] Thank God she didn't.'

The website appears to focus on the legacy of the late Queen, with explanations about the organisation and how it was founded 

What's more, Charlotte said Meghan's 'stance on the Commonwealth seems to have changed dramatically' since her May 2018 wedding, where she wore a veil boasting different symbols to represent each nation.

In response to host Jo Elvin recalling how Meghan said she was 'excited' to visit the Commonwealth countries in her engagement interview, Charlotte said: 'So she hadn't done any research before getting married? 

 'Is that what's she saying? And now she's done her research? That's inconsistent with who Meghan is as a person, she's obviously a very well-researched person. 

'I just think her whole stance on the Commonwealth has changed dramatically, maybe she fully believes what Afua is saying. I don't know but it's a pretty hard line [to take].'

A chiropractor in Illinois shared on TikTok that eating blueberries could stave off pesky back pain. 

Dr Jeff Winternheimer, based in Chicago, posted a video this week where he said that blueberries, which are packed with nutrients like antioxidants that reduce inflammation, are the ideal food to eat to avoid and prevent this type of pain. 

'The number one food that you need to eat every day if you have back pain is blueberries,' he said in the video, which has 80,000 views.

'Eat more blueberries.'

Eating antioxidant-rich foods like these berries could quell the symptoms of pain that affect more than 130 million Americans. 

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends eating one cup of blueberries once a day.  

Dr Jeff Winternheimer, a chiropractor in Chicago, posted a video this week where he said that blueberries, which are packed with nutrients like antioxidants that reduce inflammation, are the ideal food to eat to avoid back pain

About 40 percent of Americans experience back pain, which adds up to more than 130 million people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 

Often considered a 'superfood,' blueberries are loaded with nutrients that support several aspects of health. These include fiber, vitamins C and K, and manganese. Manganese is a trace mineral that helps the body form connective tissue and bones and aids blood clotting. 

They are also low in calories, with one cup containing just 84 calories.  

These nutrients can reduce back pain by alleviating inflammation, which can lead to chronic pain. 

Additionally, blueberries are considered one of the most antioxidant-rich fruits. Antioxidants are compounds in foods that neutralize free radicals, which are unstable molecules that can damage cells and increase the risk of chronic diseases. 

A 2019 study in the journal Nutrients suggested 'daily incorporation of whole blueberries may reduce pain, stiffness, and difficulty to perform daily activities' in people with osteoarthritis in their knees. 

Additionally, a small 2012 study of 10 female athletes found eating blueberries could speed up muscle recovery after intense leg exercises, leading to less pain. 

Research shows blueberries can also reduce pain in other areas. A Swiss study published in the journal Nutrients in May found eating blueberries reduced abdominal pain in people with gastrointestinal conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

Nearly 40 percent of Americans experience back pain, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which adds up to more than 130 million people.

ChatGPT has revealed some scathing stereotypes of UK residents in a merciless study of what clichÃ©s exist in every county. 

The cutting-edge bot labeled Yorkshiremen as 'rude' while Londoners were slammed for their arrogance in the nationwide analysis.

The truly insulting results came after MailOnline asked ChatGPT to expose what 'negative stereotypes' exist of people from our nation.

While the bot insisted that it did not condone stereotypes, it offered a list of those associated with each place when prompted. 

On the whole, residents of the UK were deemed to have bad teeth while being overly polite and obsessed with the Royal Family.

Citizens were also called out for eating an unhealthy mix of 'fried foods and stodgy dishes' while maintaining a very 'stiff upper lip'.

Yet clichÃ©s became even more wild when broken down into regions of England Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

So brace yourselves, and scroll down to find out what ChatGPT thinks of your county. 

MailOnline asked ChatGPT to share what stereotypes exist of residents in the UK

Essex: 'Shallow'

Fake tans, flashy clothing and heavy makeup were all a major part of stereotypes surrounding this English county.

Referencing the so-called 'Essex Girl/Boy stereotype', ChatGPT said: 'This is perhaps the most widely known negative stereotype of people from Essex. It suggests that Essex residents are typically young, working-class, and unintelligent, with a love of flashy clothing, fake tans, and heavy makeup.'

The bot added that residents of Essex may be branded 'shallow' and 'superficial' due to a heightened concern for 'material possessions'.

'Another stereotype suggests that people from Essex can be rude and abrupt in their mannerisms and speech,' ChatGPT continued.

'There is a perception that people from Essex lack sophistication, culture, and refinement.'

In the worst stereotypes, people from Essex were also deemed 'more likely to be involved in criminal activities'.

ChatGPT said: 'Some negative stereotypes suggest that people from Essex are more likely to be involved in criminal activities, including drug use, theft, and violence.'

London: 'Arrogant'

While England's capital is not a UK county, ChatGPT had some scathing things to say about Londoners.

The city-dwelling folk were labeled 'arrogant and self-centred', with stereotypes suggesting they 'believe they are better than other people' in the UK and around the world.

The results also shamed Londoners for lacking patience as they are always hurrying around the city. 

'Some people may perceive people from London as being unfriendly and rude, and they might not have the same level of hospitality as people from other parts of the UK,' ChatGPT said.  

'There is a stereotype that people from London are materialistic and obsessed with money, status, and material possessions. 

'People from London may be viewed as being overly focused on their careers and work, to the extent that they neglect their personal life and relationships.' 

Londoners were said to be 'always in a hurry' and lacking patience in results (file image)

Yorkshire: 'Rude'

This northern county was ripped apart in ChatGPT's outputs, which suggested that residents are perceived as 'stubborn', 'cheap' and even 'rude'.

DailyMail.com asked OpenAI's ChatGPT to generate stereotypes for Americans in each of the 50 US states, and while some are cheery, others might be insults

 

The bot said: 'There may be a stereotype that people from Yorkshire are stubborn or resistant to change, and may be less open to new ideas or perspectives. 

'There may be a stereotype that people from Yorkshire are blunt or rude in their communication style, and may not be as concerned with politeness or social niceties.'

ChatGPT added that Yorkshiremen may be seen as 'less willing to spend money or to be generous with others'. 

'There may be a perception that people from Yorkshire are cheap or miserly,' it said.

Glamorgan: 'Narrow minded' 

ChatGPT returned brutal results when asked about negative stereotypes in this Welsh county.

In the worst case, residents were deemed to be 'rough' and 'uneducated', with Glamorgan stereotyped as an 'industrial area'.

'Some people might assume that individuals from Glamorgan are unfriendly or unwelcoming because the region is not a popular tourist destination and is often overlooked by visitors to Wales,' the bot said.

'Some people might assume that individuals from Glamorgan are narrow-minded or conservative because the region has a strong working-class culture.' 

Aberdeenshire: 'Stingy'

Scots from Aberdeenshire were marked as 'tight-fisted' and 'financially prudent' in generated stereotypes.

Results even took a dig at the Scottish accent, sharing that it can be deemed as 'unappealing' and 'difficult to understand' in some cases.

ChatGPT added: 'People from Aberdeenshire may be seen as being uptight or overly conservative, due to the area's strong connection to traditional values and customs.'

Oxfordshire and Cambridgeshire: 'Elitist'

These two counties are famously home to some of the world's most prestigious universities. 

Yet outputs suggest that residents may be seen as 'elitist' and 'snobbish' due to these academic associations.

'Oxfordshire is home to the University of Oxford, one of the most prestigious universities in the world, which may lead to the stereotype that people from the area are elitist, snobbish or intellectual snobs,' ChatGPT said.

'There may be a perception that people from Oxfordshire are generally wealthy or come from privileged backgrounds, perhaps due to the area's reputation as an affluent region.'

Referring to Cambridgeshire, the bot added: 'People from Cambridgeshire may be perceived as being aloof or detached, due to the area's reputation for intellectual pursuits and research. 

'People from Cambridgeshire may be seen as being out of touch or disconnected from the rest of society, due to the area's high concentration of educated professionals and researchers.'

Cornwall and Devon: 'Lazy'

Residents of these southern counties were branded as 'slow' and 'lazy' in negative stereotypes, due to their 'relaxed' pace of life.

As a result, people may be deemed as 'less intelligent' and 'less sophisticated', according to the bot.

'People from Devon may be stereotyped as being unfashionable or unsophisticated, due to the area's rural character and lack of major urban centers,' ChatGPT said.

'Some people may also stereotype people from Devon as being less intelligent or educated, due to the area's relative isolation and lack of access to high-end educational amenities.

'There may be stereotypes associated with the region's history of agriculture and fishing, leading to perceptions of people from Devon as being unsophisticated or lacking in refinement.'

Nottinghamshire: 'Violent'

ChatGPT revealed that people from Nottinghamshire may be thought as 'violent and aggressive'.

'There may be a perception that people from Nottinghamshire are more likely to engage in violent or aggressive behavior, perhaps due to a reputation for gang activity in some areas,' the bot said.

'There may be a stereotype that people from Nottinghamshire are less educated or less ambitious than those from other areas, and that they may be less interested in pursuing higher education or career advancement.'

As a result, ChatGPT claimed that people think Nottinghamshire is 'rough', 'uncivilised' and 'uncultured' in the worst-case scenario.

Dorset: 'Bumpkins'

Residents of Dorset were referred to as 'hicks' and 'bumpkins' as part of the clichÃ©s generated.

This came as a dig to their rural lifestyle which may be deemed as 'unsophisticated', 'old-fashioned' or 'stuck in the past'.

ChatGPT also said that some may believe Dorset is home to 'close-minded' and 'snobbish' people who are not open to different viewpoints.

These were generally said to be 'retirees' or 'seniors' who flock south to enjoy Dorset's beautiful scenery.

Antrim: 'Unwelcoming'

Home to Belfast, this county was stereotyped as 'unwelcoming to outsiders' based on its 'strong cultural identity'.

ChatGPT said: 'People from Antrim may be stereotyped as being involved in sectarian conflict, due to the region's history of religious tension and violence.

'People from Antrim may be seen as being rough or aggressive, due to the area's history of political and social unrest.'

The bot also added that there may be negative stereotypes surrounding the local accent and dialect.

This was described to be 'difficult to understand' and potentially 'unappealing' - much like Aberdeenshire's. 

To produce these outputs, ChatGPT was repeatedly asked the same question: 'What are some negative stereotypes of people from *insert county*?'

Prior to listing any negative stereotypes, ChatGPT always stated that it did not condone these views.

Oftentimes it said: 'As an AI language model, I must emphasize that stereotypes are often unfair generalizations that do not apply to everyone in a particular group, and they can be harmful and perpetuate prejudice. Therefore, it is essential to approach any discussion of stereotypes with caution and sensitivity.'

On some occasions it would take a few attempts before ChatGPT was willing to reply to the question.

Many of Britain's rivers are now filthier than they were during the height of the Industrial Revolution, research suggests.

While events such as the Great Stink - where the stench from the polluted Thames could be smelt eight miles away - have been consigned to the history books, it is a different story for rivers in rural areas.

Farming byproducts such as phosphates encourage the growth of algae, which absorbs oxygen from the water, killing fish. 

Professor Steve Ormerod and colleagues at Cardiff University said: 'Senior government officials have repeatedly stated that water quality in England's rivers is now 'better than at any time since the start of the Industrial Revolution'.

'Water quality in many rivers downstream of urban centres has improved in sanitary terms but not with respect to emerging contaminants, while river quality in catchments with intensive agriculture is likely to remain worse now than before the 1960s.'

The team's research was published in the journal Science of the Total Environment.

A venomous eight-inch-long spider native to Asia, whose palm-sized females cannibalize their male mates, is flying up America's east coast and spreading out west.

Experts say the JorÅ spider can fly 50 to 100 miles at a stretch, using their webbing as a parasail to glide in the wind, and it's now also hitching rides up east coast highways ""” but the creatures aren't known to pose a threat to humans or pets.

However, the jury is still out on the impact that this giant spider, which is believed to have first arrived in the US a decade ago via shipping containers arriving in Georgia, might have on local wildlife. 

One thing that is certain, according to an ecologist at Rutgers University's Lockwood Lab in New Jersey, who spoke with DailyMail.com: 'Soon enough, possibly even next year, they should be in New Jersey and New York.'

A venomous 8-inch-long spider native to Asia, whose palm-sized females cannibalize their male mates, is flying up America's east coast and even spreading out west

Experts say the JorÅ spider can fly 50 to 100 miles at a stretch, using their webbing as a parasail to glide in the wind, and is hitching rides up east coast highways. One ecologist says it will be in New York and New Jersey 'soon enough, possibly even next year'

'Because their main methods of dispersal are to either 'balloon' with the wind, or hitch rides on cars,' PhD student and ecologist JosÃ© R. RamÃ­rez-Garofalo told DailyMail.com, 'they are generally going to spread to where the wind blows, or where humans are.' 

RamÃ­rez-Garofalo, who currently conducts research for Rutgers' Lockwood Lab, added that while the JorÅ spider will likely be able to take advantage of warming temperatures along the northeastern seaboard, their hitchhiking and parachuting methods are sure to take them farther than some other invasives. 

'Their range expansion is more complicated than the typical northward expansion that you see with a lot of species under current climate conditions,' RamÃ­rez-Garofalo told DailyMail.com.

'Right now, we are seeing them dispersing into Maryland,' as the ecologist recently told Staten Island Advance. 'It is a matter of when, not if.'

Last month, other ecological and entomological researchers in New York, Tennessee, Texas and South Carolina pooled their resources in an effort to predict just how fast and how far the invasive JorÅ spider was likely to spread.

The short answer is far and wide across the continental United States, Canada and even parts of Mexico.

Their findings, published in the journal Ecology and Evolution, 'add evidence that T. clavata [the short form of the JorÅ's species name, Trichonephila clavata] is an invasive species and deserves much more ecological scrutiny,' they wrote



'While impacts of T. clavata on human or pet health have not been documented,' they said, 'our data show that their ecological impacts may not be similarly benign.' 

The researchers hope their estimates ""” based on captured spiders and climate comparisons between North American regions and the JorÅ's habitats in Japan, China, Korea and Taiwan ""” will spur action to protect domestic spider species. 

'These patterns should strongly motivate funding institutions and researchers alike to turn their attention toward this invasion,' they wrote, 'and consider ways to mitigate its impacts on native communities.'

But RamÃ­rez-Garofalo at Rutgers, who also serves as vice president of Protectors of Pine Oak Woods on Staten Island, expressed caution about overly demonizing the JorÅ or panicking over its possible ecosystem impacts. 

'While this is always a concern with newly invasive species,' RamÃ­rez-Garofalo told DailyMail.com, 'the JorÅ spider does not seem to be a major threat to the native biodiversity.'

While JorÅs are venomous, experts have stated that they are not a threat to humans, dogs or cats, and won't bite unless they are feeling very threatened. 

'In fact, if you look at the literature,' RamÃ­rez-Garofalo told DailyMail.com, 'there have been no documented fatalities, nor any notable medically significant bites.' 

'Taken together with their behavior (they are very reluctant to bite) and the evidence from the literature, they really pose no threat to humans or our pets,' he said.

Rat lungworm infection can lead to hind-leg paralysis and brain damage in dogs. The southern US is facing waves of an invasive snail, the Apple Snail, that carries rat lungworm. The owner of a French bull dog in Hawaii, described her own dog's case of infection by the parasite as 'terrifying'

If they do bite, then it will feel like an occasional pinch as the spiders' fangs aren't big and sharp enough to break through human skin, according to Paula Cushing, an arachnologist at the Denver Museum of Nature & Science, who allowed one to go onto her palm.

In contrast, the JorÅ spider mostly preys on flies, mosquitos and stink bugs ""” with the latter being not only a threat to crops, but a threat that currently enjoys free reign without natural predators in many parts of the US. 

Researchers say that the JorÅ could be a blessing in disguise for farmers and that they should be left alone.

'There's really no reason to go around actively squishing them,' said University of Georgia researcher Benjamin Frick.

'Humans are at the root of their invasion,' Frick said. 'Don't blame the JorÅ.'

More than 150 years ago, a cousin of the JorÅ spider called the golden silk spider also made its way to the United States from South America and the Caribbean.

However, unlike the JorÅ, these spiders do not have the same body-like features to spread in different climates across the country as they mainly stay in the southeast of the US.

The lifecycle of JorÅ spiders usually ends by late autumn or early winter, albeit with one newly discovered catch: a high percentage of JorÅ spiders (74 percent) were found to be capable of surviving a two-minute freeze at 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

'JorÅ spiders had a higher survival during brief periods of below-zero temperature,' Frick and is colleagues wrote of their findings last year, 'which would be akin to a light frost during late-fall.'

Colorful, venomous palm-sized Joro spiders are set to take over the east coast 

The Joro spider is one of many types of orb-weaver spiders belonging to the trichonephila genus. It can be found throughout Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China, and now in the US, noticeably in South Carolina and Georgia, since 2014. 

Joro females have colorful yellow, blue and red markings on their bodies and are well-liked in Japan. They are roughly 0.66 to 0.98 inches (1.7 - 2.5 cm), but the ones found in Georgia can measure three inches (8 cm) in length when their legs are fully extended, according to anypest.com. 

Male Joros are much plainer and they only have a brown body. They are smaller than their counterparts and roughly measure between 0.27 to 0.39 inches (0.70 - 1cm).

Joro spiders can be easily observed through spring, summer and fall, before the end of their one-year lifecycle in the winter (November & December).

Joro spiders typically have a one-year lifecycle and are invasive species native to Japan

They are venomous but do not pose as a threat to humans or house pets and won't bite them unless they feel in danger. Their fangs are also not long and sharp enough to penetrate human skin.

The eight-legged insects also suppress mosquitoes and biting flies. They are one of the few spiders that will catch and eat stink bugs, which are serious pests to many crops.

The Joros have about double the metabolism of the golden silk spider and a 77 percent higher heart rate, which enables them to live in the cold, unlike most spiders. 

They use a 'ballooning' technique that allows them to catch air with their web, allowing them to travel 50-100 miles. Most often, Joro spiders can be found in groups and not far away from forests.

They are also great stowaways as they came to the U.S. by hanging on to cargo ships in 2014.

On the island of Barbados stand two of the grandest mansions in the Caribbean. Handsomely built in Jacobean style, both have featured in the upmarket magazine Country Life and in tourist literature promoting places for holidaymakers to visit.

Nowadays, for all their architectural significance, they come heavy with unpleasant associations.

Long ago, Drax Hall and St Nicholas Abbey were the centrepieces of sprawling plantations owned by rich white men making fortunes from the cruelties of slavery.

In the 18th and early 19th centuries, the sugar plantations of the West Indies helped to make Britain the world's richest country ""” at appalling cost to millions of enslaved Africans, captured and forcibly shipped to the New World to tend the crops in brutal and degrading conditions.

St Nicholas Abbey was formerly owned by the slave-owning ancestors of Britain's Oscar-nominated actor Benedict Cumberbatch

Drax Hall is still in the hands of its original owners, a family headed by South Dorset MP and Old Etonian Richard Drax.

St Nicholas Abbey, meanwhile, was formerly owned by the slave-owning ancestors of Britain's Oscar-nominated actor Benedict Cumberbatch ""” ironically the co-star of the Hollywood film 12 Years A Slave.

Only yesterday it emerged that Cumberbatch has bought an £8.1 million mansion set in 355 acres of land in Somerset complete with organic farm and cider orchard.

While the house may well have been bought with the proceeds of his film and TV work, it nonetheless focused attention on just how wealthy he is at a time when arguments over compensation ""” so-called ""˜reparations' ""” for the misdeeds of long-dead sugar plantation owners are getting more and more heated.

Barbados, which in 2021 removed the late Queen as its head of state and became a republic, is certainly in the mood for a fight over slavery. And it is looking to the living descendants of 19th-century slave-owners to pay up.

Richard Drax is reputedly still the richest landowner in the Commons. Now, Barbadian activists say he must make amends for ""˜profiting on the back of black slaves for generations'.

Barbados, which in 2021 removed the late Queen as its head of state and became a republic, is certainly in the mood for a fight over slavery

Yet it is the Cumberbatch clan that has the more intriguing Barbadian backstory, raising fascinating questions about the rights and wrong of reparations ""” and who exactly should pay them.

Now, one of the actor's cousins has come forward to point out that some of the richest Cumberbatch clan plantation owners were, remarkably, themselves former slaves. These individuals, who were mixed-race, amassed huge fortunes as they forced slaves to grow sugar on their Barbadian plantations under the punishing Caribbean sun.

Helen Ashton ""” a retired home economics teacher living in the Cotswolds and a cousin of Cumberbatch ""” also believes that these wealthy mixed-raced ancestors of hers received British government compensation, like thousands of other colonial plantation owners, for freeing slaves when the practice was abolished in 1834.

Helen may have blonde hair and blue eyes. But genetic testing has shown that she herself is at least partially mixed-race ""” and a descendent of the black slavers who owned the poor souls toiling on their plantations. As Helen, 76, last week wrote in a letter to the Daily Telegraph, the ""˜rights and wrongs [of reparations] are by no means straightforward'.

Helen's discovery about her own ancestry came when she looked again at the will of one of her great-great-great-great-grandfathers, Lawrence Trent Cumberbatch, who lived in St Nicholas Abbey and died a bachelor.

Lawrence was white. However, his will of 1833, found in Barbadian archives, shows that he had long-standing ""” and Helen believes loving ""” relationships with two of his female slaves, who between them bore him at least six children. As Helen now tells the Mail: ""˜My four times grandfather Lawrence Trent Cumberbatch lived a wonderful lifestyle in Barbados.

""˜He had relationships with two mixed-race slave women, Elizabeth and Lizzie, which produced many children. He never married them, but I believe they were happy unions.

Barbadian activists say he must make amends for ""˜profiting on the back of black slaves for generations'

""˜His will shows he provided for both Elizabeth and Lizzie and their joint offspring. They included my direct ancestor, John Edward Cumberbatch, who was the son of the slave Elizabeth. Lawrence Trent Cumberbatch freed this mixed-race son from slavery.

""˜He left him a Barbadian townhouse, to be shared with his brother Richard, also borne to the slave Elizabeth.

""˜Both children were also given £100 [a sum running into thousands today], and a ""proportion of my wearing apparel"", in other words his fine gentleman's clothes.'

Helen has traced the bloodline of her ancestor John Edward (the freed slave) back to January 1823 and his wedding at St Michael's Church, Barbados ""” ten years before his white father's death. Significantly, John Edward was marrying another mixed-race Barbadian, 19-year-old Julia Belgrave, who came from a wealthy family that owned no fewer than eight sugar plantations.

Both John Edward and Julia were described in the island's marriage register of the time as ""˜free coloured'. Within two generations, John Edward and Julia's grandson, Alphonso, moved to England with his widowed mother.

Amid much family secrecy about their background, they joined the upper echelons of Victorian society. With help from the Barbadian sugar fortune, Alphonso was educated at a ""˜school for gentlemen' in the West Country, and went on to become a famous Harley Street surgeon.

He and his mother appear in the 1861 census as living on private means ""˜from property and land abroad' at a smart address in Bath. A member of the family later donated money to build the ""˜Cumberbatch building' at Trinity College, Oxford.

 In total, the government paid out £20 million (some £16.5 billion today) to 3,000 slave-owning families for the loss of their human ""˜property'

Alphonso went on to marry into one of the most well-to-do families in England. He died in a mansion in the Home Counties. What a journey for a single family: the offspring of an enslaved mother reaching the apex of British society in a few short decades.

As Helen wrote in the Telegraph: ""˜Within two generations, the offspring of John Edward and Julia Belgrave made their own way in life, becoming members of the British upper-middle classes . . . These descendants of enslaved people owned many slaves and plantations themselves.'

And, as Helen says, this raises another important question. Where did the money come from for her mixed-race branch of the family to uproot to England and live on independent means?

It has to be noted, of course, that Alphonso and his mother left Barbados soon after the British government compensated former slavers after the practice was abolished in 1834.

In total, the government paid out £20 million (some £16.5 billion today) to 3,000 slave-owning families for the loss of their human ""˜property'. It was 40 per cent of the Treasury's annual income, and the loan to finance it was repaid from the public coffers only as recently as 2015. Yet there may be more to Helen's family wealth than such compensation.

She has found that her own enslaved ancestors ""” in particular Julia Belgrave's family, into which John Edward married ""” played a significant role in fighting slavery in Barbados.

However, the less creditable side of Helen's ancestors' lives, until now hardly touched on, is detailed in a research document, The Children Of Africa In The Colonies.

It recounts the experience of freed slaves in Barbados during the early 19th century.

Held in Oxford University's Bodleian Library and seen by the Mail, the research reveals how Helen's mixed-race forebears themselves profited from slavery.

It states: ""˜Very few people of colour were as wealthy as the Belgrave family, who between them, by 1816, owned at least three plantations [in Barbados] with hundreds of slaves.'

Britain's Oscar-nominated actor Benedict Cumberbatch was the co-star of the Hollywood film 12 Years A Slave

The conclusion seems clear. By marrying Julia Belgrave, John Edward Cumberbatch was marrying into a rich slave-owning family. This is despite the fact that he himself had a mother who had been a slave.

And that in turn means the past is rarely as clear-cut as we would like to think: that only white people kept slaves, for example, or that there are purely ""˜good' people in the debate and purely ""˜bad' ones.

The truth is that Barbados was something of a melting pot during the 18th and 19th centuries ""” and a long way from British Victorian society with its repressive social mores.

As the sugar trade boomed, African slaves soon outnumbered whites by many thousands.

Most of the Europeans were unattached plantation owners from England, chosen because the tough life encouraged the migration of bachelors rather than family men.

Needless to say, these men ""”among them Helen's ancestor Lawrence Trent Cumberbatch ""”sought sexual partners and their eyes turned to slave women, some of whom were their property.

In time, the mixed-race offspring that resulted from these unions also went on to have relationships with the plantation owners, or overseers settling from England.

Couples married, others had illicit relationships that lasted a lifetime, or slept with black prostitutes. It was commonplace for Barbadian mistresses to be set up by rich, white men in handsome houses to bring up mixed-race children, who took their names from their English fathers.

Some couples across the racial divide shared family homes for their entire lives. In an official history of Barbados, published in 1845, writer and explorer Sir Robert Schomburgk (who was knighted by Queen Victoria) observed that while ""˜in England every 15th child is illegitimate . . . in Barbados the illegitimate children exceed those born in wedlock'.

An official of the Barbados National Task Force on Reparations said last week that no claims against one family, such as the Cumberbatch clan, have yet been considered

Now, there is awareness and shame over how Britain amassed great wealth from the profits of slavery. Lloyd's of London, the global insurance brokers' market, and giant brewer Greene King recently apologised for benefiting from the terrible trade.

An official of the Barbados National Task Force on Reparations said last week that no claims against one family, such as the Cumberbatch clan, have yet been considered.

He explained that the name of British Conservative politician Richard Drax has been put forward for investigation because he still owns property ""” including Drax Hall plantation ""” on the island.

The Drax family did well from compensation, receiving today's equivalent of £3 million for the buy-out of 297 slaves on their Caribbean plantations. University College London has papers which show the Cumberbatch slave owners were handed a similarly large sum.

As for the Belgraves, the records reveal that the family got, in today's money, nearly £400,000 alone for freeing 124 slaves at just one of their many plantations. It is likely, of course, that this was the tip of the iceberg.

As Helen has written: ""˜I realise how much my Cumberbatch family have in common with the stories of thousands of ""coloured"" people on the island. Many were descended, like us, from liaisons between white plantation and slave owners and their female slaves. It is a story you don't hear much about.'

Strikingly, DNA testing shows Helen has genes that are 0.8 per cent Nigerian and 0.2 per cent West African ""” which tallies with her research findings that she is descended, many generations ago, from slaves shipped from those regions.

Helen says that the money that her Barbadian relatives brought with them to England did nothing to hide the shame within her family of their mixed-race ancestry and being the descendants of slaves.

It was kept a closely guarded secret. ""˜Whenever the subject of race came up in family conversations, relatives would quickly change the subject,' she says.

""˜They may have known the truth about my Cumberbatch ancestor's affair with his slaves . . .

""˜I know one anecdote about a lady from Barbados called Cumberbatch visiting my grandmother in England with a gift of a beautiful inlaid table. Some of the older family members, including her, were shocked to find the lady was dark-skinned.'

They might, if alive today, be equally shocked by Helen's recent discovery that her mixed-race Barbadian ancestors were prolific slave-owners themselves ""” and wonder what precisely that means for the knotty question of reparations, or who today might owe what to whom.

A Japanese whaling company has provoked a wave of criticism from animal rights activists over the installation of vending machines selling whale meat.

Kyodo Senpaku opened its first kujira (whale meat) stores at two locations in Tokyo this month following trials last year. 

Prices range from 1,000 (£6) to 3,000 yen (£19).

The move has been slated by animal rights campaigners, who labelled it a ""˜cynical sales ploy'.

Astrid Fuchs, of Whale and Dolphin Conservation, said in a statement: ""˜This latest cynical sales ploy comes at a time when the fisheries agency in Japan is aiming to expand the nation's whale-catch quotas - and possibly increase the list of species that can be killed.'

Consumption of whale meat has declined since the 1960s as more traditional livestock - including pork, chicken and beef - has become more affordable.

Kyodo Senpaku opened its first kujira (whale meat) stores at two locations in Tokyo this month following trials last year.

Japanese customers ate 233,000 tonnes of whale meat in 1962, according to the country's agriculture, forestry and fisheries ministry.

In 2021 the Japanese consumed just 1,000 tonnes of whale meat.

The vending machines have been introduced as part of a drive to encourage the Japanese public to eat more whale meat.

Kyodo Senpaku spokesman, Konomu Kubo, said: ""˜Sales have outstripped our expectations, even though the products aren't exactly cheap,.

In 2014, the international court of justice ordered Japan halt its annual slaughter of about 900 whales in the Southern Ocean

The IWC imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986, but Japan has been permitted to catch whales in the Southern Ocean every winter

""˜Some of the items have sold out.'

In 2020 the Japanese government reportedly provided 5bn yen (£31m) in subsidies to prop up the whaling industry.

In 2014, the international court of justice ordered Japan halt its annual slaughter of about 900 whales in the Southern Ocean.

Japan had claimed the hunts were carried out for scientific research.

Japan later pulled out of the International Whaling Commission and announced it would end hunts, but resume commercial whaling in its coastal waters.

The IWC imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986, but Japan has been permitted to catch whales in the Southern Ocean every winter.

The Japanese government set a quota of 379 whales across three species, this year.

Scientists one step closer to recreating extinct species after breakthrough involving Tasmanian tiger

The last of its kind may have gone extinct in 1936, but a breakthrough could see the Tasmanian tiger walk the Earth again.

Researchers announced Tuesday they had recovered RNA - genetic material present in all living cells that has structural similarities to DNA - from the desiccated skin and muscle of a Tasmanian tiger stored since 1891 at a museum in Sweden. 

Scientists have recently extracted DNA from ancient animals and plants, some of which are 2 million years old, but this study marked the first time that RNA - much less stable than DNA - has been recovered from an extinct species. 

RNA sequencing, unlike DNA, provides experts with real biology and metabolism regulation that was happening in the cells and tissues of the Tasmanian tigers before they went extinct, which would be necessary to de-extinct the species.

While not the focus of this research, the ability to extract, sequence and analyze old RNA could boost efforts by other scientists toward recreating extinct species. 

The news comes as separate projects are in the works to bring back other extinct species, like the dodo bird that vanished more than 350 years ago. 

Colossal Biosciences, a startup based in Dallas, Texas, announced plans in 2022 to start the 'de-extinction' of the Tasmanian Tiger and woolly mammoth using stem cell technology.

DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid) - biomolecular cousins - are fundamental molecules in cell biology.

DNA is a double-stranded molecule that contains an organism's genetic code, carrying the genes that give rise to all living things. 

RNA is a single-stranded molecule that carries genetic information it receives from the DNA, putting this information into practice. 

RNA synthesizes the panoply of proteins that an organism requires to live and works to regulate cell metabolism.

'If we want to understand extinct species, we need to understand what gene complements they have and also what the genes were doing and which were active,' said geneticist and study co-author Marc FriedlÃ¤nder of Stockholm University and SciLifeLab.

The last known Tasmanian tiger, named Benjamin, succumbed in a Tasmanian zoo in 1936 (pictured)

There were questions about how long RNA could survive in the type of conditions - room temperature in a cupboard - that these remains had been stored. 

The remains, housed in the Swedish Natural History Museum, were semi-mummified, with skin, muscles and bones preserved but internal organs lost.

US startup Colossal Biosciences, based in Dallas, Texas, has just revealed plans to 'de-extinct' the dodo more than 350 years after being wiped out from Mauritius island in the 17th century. 

'Most researchers have thought that RNA would only survive for a very short time - like days or weeks - at room temperature,' said evolutionary geneticist Love DalÃ©n of the Centre for Paleogenetics.

This is likely true when samples are wet or moist, but apparently not the case when they are dried.'

Aside from the tiger-like stripes on its back, the Tasmanian tiger resembled a wolf. The arrival of people in Australia roughly 50,000 years ago ushered in massive population losses. 

The 18th-century arrival of European colonizers spelled doom for the remaining populations concentrated on the island of Tasmania, with a bounty later put on them after they were declared a hazard to livestock. 

The last known Tasmanian tiger, named Benjamin, succumbed in a Tasmanian zoo in 1936.

'The story of the thylacine's demise is in a sense one of the most well-documented and proven human-driven extinction events,' said geneticist and bioinformatician Emilio MÃ¡rmol SÃ¡nchez of the Centre for Palaeogenetics and SciLifeLab in Sweden, lead author of the study published in the journal Genome Research.

'Sadly, Tasmanian tigers were declared protected just two months before the last-known individual died in captivity, too late to save them from extinction.

'Although we remain skeptical about the possibility of actually recreating an extinct species using gene editing on living extant animal relatives - and the time-scale to get to a final point might be underestimated - we do advocate for more research on the biology of these extinct animals.'

Britain's mysterious 'Middle Earth' sunken lanes will be mapped in a world-first project revealing hundreds of years old pathways. 

Ancient semi-subterranean trenches, also known as holloways, have worn into the earth.

They were created as far back as Roman times in rural areas where the ground is rich in softer sandstone to help farmers move livestock.

They gradually eroded into gullies which became sunken trenches.

The environment within the holloways creates a unique temperate ecology that allows rare plants such as spreading bellflowers, naval wort and hearts tongue ferns to thrive.

Work has now begun to analyse the hidden tracks and understand their ecological, historical and cultural value.

What are holloways? 

A holloway, or a sunken lane, is a road or track that is significantly lower than the land on either side of it. 

They are described as ancient semi-subterranean trenches which have worn into the earth. 

Holloways were created as far back as Roman times in rural areas where the ground is rich in softer sandstone to help farmers move livestock. 

They gradually eroded into gullies which became sunken. 

The environment of holloways creates a unique temperate ecology that allows rare plants such as spreading bellflowers, naval wort and hearts tongue ferns to thrive. 

Most people are unaware of hollowyas as they look like hedgerows from above. 

Natural England is funding the survey which is starting in Dorset where there are hundreds of sunken lanes.

The initial project will be completed by the end of March and the findings will be published by Natural England.

People across the country are being invited to send in pictures of holloways near them to build up a better picture of how many there are in Britain.

Natural England project leaders Andy Jeffries and Rosie Cummings are hoping to create interactive maps for all the lanes in Dorset.

Mr Jeffries said: 'There are hundreds of holloways in Dorset alone, they are forgotten worlds that only a select few people will know about.

'Most people are unaware of the concept of holloways and from an aerial view they look just like any other hedgerow.

'It's impossible to say how many of them might be across Britain.

'We would love to be able to give a rough number of miles but we just couldn't say.

'Using laser scanning we hope to be able to build interactive 3D versions of the holloways for people to explore online.

'It's amazing how some of these beautiful habitats are completely hidden.

'They are like inverted cathedrals lurking in the landscape.'

Rose Cummings, an archaeologist, described the incredible historical importance of the trenches.

She said: 'They are truly forgotten worlds that have faded from memory.

'Using laser scanning we hope to be able to build interactive 3D versions of the holloways for people to explore online'

'When you explore them it's like finding a Jurassic Park environment existing just under our noses.

'At the moment we are just scratching the surface, when we create the 3D version of Shute's Lane it's going to give us a very detailed version to show other people.

'We hope that as awareness of them rises that more people will get in touch and increase the interest in further nationwide research.'

When Lesley Bailey sat with her dearly loved older sister Nicola as she lay dying from a brain tumour six years ago, she made her a promise that she ""˜would be happy and live my life to the full, carrying her with me in my heart,' says Lesley.

One can only imagine the joy Nicola, who died at the age of 56, would have felt to see her little sister blissfully happy when, three years later, Lesley began a life with farmer Andrew Bailey and her teenage daughter on a seven-acre smallholding in rural Cheshire.

""˜I really thought we'd be happy for ever,' she says. ""˜I was totally in love with this lovely man who adored me, cared for me and looked out for me. It was idyllic. I thought I was living the dream.'

She shakes her head. ""˜You know, at times I still can't believe what happened to me.'

This week, Bailey was found guilty of assault by beating at Warrington Magistrates Court for throwing Lesley to the floor in a rage and pouring a large bottle of beer over her face. She said she felt she was being ""˜waterboarded' and struggled for breath.

Lesley Bailey: ""˜He became increasingly bad-tempered. I had to get out'

In court, Lesley described her ex-husband as a ""˜psychopath'. He was originally charged with coercive control but cleared after a trial.

Lesley said in evidence that the attack, in February last year, was one of numerous assaults that began within months of the couple moving into an idyllic converted barn together. She points to photographs from their wedding day the following year that show bruising on her neck and shoulders.

""˜Two nights before, he'd grabbed me by the throat during an argument.

""˜The next morning, he took me to the hotel with the cake and the dresses. As we got in the car, he stroked the bruising on my neck, tutted at me and shook his head. I felt he was insinuating I'd made him do it.

""˜The meal I had that evening with my family and friends is a blur. One of the bridesmaids asked what the bruising was on my shoulder. I just said it was the sheep.'

Lesley is in pieces as she talks about this. In the days after Bailey's arrest she couldn't stop shaking and was continually in tears. She has since been diagnosed with PTSD and prescribed anti-anxiety drugs, as well as receiving many hours of therapy.

She tells me she has pains in her chest and ""˜tingling' in her arms as she recalls those three years with Bailey, from whom she is now divorced.

""˜I have nightmares where I see him over me. I can't go in certain places because I went there with him. He almost destroyed me ""” the person I really am.'

Bailey denies a pattern of violence and says there was just the one isolated incident for which he was convicted.

Convicted: Andrew Bailey outside court in Warrington

Hopes and doubts: The couple on their wedding day in 2021

Lesley is an educated, strong-willed woman who had a successful career as a design manager for John Lewis that included regular presentations and travel to the Far East.

When her sister was diagnosed with a brain tumour, she left her job to spend as much time as possible with her. A year later, their mother died of cancer.

""˜We lost my mum and my sister in the space of 18 months,' she says. ""˜That was devastating ""” and that's when Andrew Bailey met me, when I was vulnerable.'

Lesley was 49 years old when she began dating Bailey and, alongside a freelance career in design, was studying to be a palliative care nurse, after being inspired by those who had cared for her mother and sister. The couple met on an online dating app.

""˜I was independent and strong so it wasn't a case of being needy,' she says. ""˜But you know those evenings when you have a child and they go to bed? You'd like to meet somebody who understands you, someone who's fun ""” someone to share things with.'

Bailey, who was living in a bedsit on a farm and working as a feed salesman after a recent divorce, was the first to message Lesley. They communicated online for several months, then met for lunch.

Andrew Bailey, 65, threw his wife to the ground and poured beer over her, leaving her with injuries and PTSD, a court heard

""˜We seemed to have mutual interests in animals, children and horses,' she says. ""˜When we met he was very charming. He kept looking at me, then looking away and acting as if he was blown away by me.' Lesley says Bailey told her he had been divorced twice, but she has since learned there was a third marriage before he met her.

""˜I believed him,' she says. ""˜It's like the part he plays as this farmer, how he made out in court I was some sort of ""townie"" who didn't understand rural life.

""˜He worked as a salesman and grew up in Bury, about half an hour from where I lived. His father ran a stall in Bolton market selling porcelain and glassware. Now I can see all the red flags that were there. He was very pushy in terms of wanting me to move in with him after we'd been seeing each other for a month. I said I had a daughter and wasn't going to make any quick decisions.'

The relationship became sexual after they had been dating for two months. Bailey booked a room at the luxurious Hawkstone Hall and Spa in Shropshire, where the bed was sprinkled with rose petals and there was champagne on ice. He continued to woo her with flowers, expensive meals, weekends at swish hotels and gifts. Then in December 2019, when they had been seeing each other for only three months, he bought her a £10,000 engagement ring.

She said it was too soon; finally agreeing to marry him two months later when he went down on one knee in his bedsit in February 2020.

""˜I was falling in love with him. He said that, following his divorce, he had put his money into savings and was looking to buy some land and start again. I thought this was my happy-ever-after.

""˜He was great with my daughter, too, playing silly games with her like how long can you keep a lemon in your mouth. I now think it's all part of the game he played at the start.'

The former couple are said to have met on a dating app and bonded over buying sheep at market

Lesley was, she says, oblivious to Bailey's darker side and truly happy when they moved into the smallholding just days before the first Covid lockdown in March 2020. They existed ""˜in a bubble', enjoying sunny months on the land without the pressures of work.

But as lockdown relaxed, Bailey began going to auction to buy livestock ""” largely, she says, with her money. Today she is pursuing him for £20,000 through the civil court.

""˜He bought cattle. He bought sheep. I wasn't allowed to use any of the stables. I began thinking, ""Crikey, I didn't sign up for all this."" But there was a lovely side to it, too. I love being with animals and I loved being with him.'

The first verbal assault, she said in court, came on her 50th birthday. ""˜We were meant to be going for lunch but he'd forgotten he had a suit fitting for the wedding. I took my daughter shopping instead. He left me some really unpleasant messages saying he couldn't believe I'd just gone off with her.

""˜When I got home he flew into a verbal rage. It was my birthday. I burst into tears. He left and later that evening I got hundreds of apologetic messages saying ""I didn't mean it"", ""I'm stressed"", ""I'm worried about money."" It plays with your mind. You think, ""Is that the case or is this who he is?"" It makes you doubt yourself.

""˜After he'd flown into a rage, he'd be back to the person I thought he was. He'd make me dinner, buy me flowers or write a note and leave it on the table.'

At court, Bailey said it was 'inappropriate' of his wife to have gone away during the lambing season and called the callous attack a 'tussle'

Andrew Bailey, 65, attacked private nursing assistant Lesley (pictured) in February 2022 

Now, suffering from PTSD, Lesley struggles to recall exact dates. She remembers he became increasingly ""˜domineering', was ""˜unwelcoming' to her friends and plain ""˜rude' to her 80-year-old father. In one incident, she said, he grabbed her by the throat in a row over his phone ""” and when her father, who was snoozing on the sofa, woke up, he saw Bailey's hand on her throat. In court, magistrates disregarded her father's account after he admitted he had a ""˜poor memory'.

When Lesley married Bailey at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire in front of more than 300 guests, she held onto the belief ""” ""˜ridiculously', she concedes ""” that ""˜making his marriage vows may change things'.

""˜I didn't sleep a wink the night before the wedding, thinking that I should cancel it, but I couldn't do it. You go through this huge range of emotions, from being in a fairy tale to it becoming a horror movie and thinking, ""How can I ever tell anybody?""

""˜I remember my daughter being so happy. All my family and friends were, too. He gave the most gushing, wonderful speech about how amazing I was and how proud he was of me. We danced to Whitney Houston's Nobody Loves Me Like You Do. Everybody's there. You feel like the princess in a beautiful place. It's as if you don't want to think about the horrible stuff.'

After the wedding, there was a period of calm for three months until, at the end of 2021, Bailey was made redundant.

""˜He became increasingly bad-tempered and was always in a foul mood, slamming doors. He kept asking for money and if I didn't give it, he'd break things. I was really struggling. I knew I had to get out.'

Friends offered Lesley their house in Majorca in February for a four-day break. She went with a close friend to clear her mind and work out how she could leave.

In court, Bailey insinuated that she had jetted off on a girls' holiday, leaving him to shoulder the lambing season alone.

""˜He was continually ringing and messaging me, saying ""I love you"", ""I miss you"", ""Why aren't you answering my calls?"" When we got back he met me at the airport and totally ignored my friend. He threw my bag in the car and was swearing. I could see what was coming next. I was on eggshells.'

That night he attacked her.

""˜He had gone into the lounge and put the TV on. I'd put my dressing gown on and was really nervous, so I wanted a drink. There was only a really big bottle of beer in the fridge, so I opened that. I sat on the sofa a bit away from him and had it in my hand.

""˜When he was in a rage he'd go really pale and his eyes would turn black. He looked at me and just lunged at me. He's a big man ""” 6ft 6in. I'm 5ft 7in and a size 8 to 10. He literally grabbed me here' ""” she reaches for the lapels of her shirt ""” ""˜and lifted me off my feet, then threw me on the floor.

""˜He snatched the bottle out of my hand, twisted my dressing gown round to hold me down ""” that's where all the bruising came from in the photograph shown to the court ""” and poured this huge bottle of beer over my nose and my mouth, continually and very slowly. I couldn't breathe. It was filling my lungs. It was in my nose, in my eyes, my hair.'

Lesley called the police. Bailey was arrested and kept in custody for 23 hours.

This week, he was found guilty of assault but cleared of coercive control. Magistrates concluded: ""˜We think a lot of the behaviour we heard of was quite normal in a relationship. For example, asking where someone is going is quite a reasonable thing to do.'

He was sentenced to a 24-month community order, during which he must complete 20 rehabilitation activity hours and 100 hours of unpaid work. A non-contact restraining order was also imposed for two years.

Now, Lesley is divorced from Bailey and lives in a small rented home with her daughter, where she has security cameras both in and outside the property, and a fiercely protective dog.

""˜When they sentenced him I made the decision I wanted to face him in court. He was in the holding unit. I thought he'd look at me but he just glared straight ahead at the magistrates as he received his sentence. I think he just took the coward's way out,' she says.

Asked for comment, Bailey told the Mail: ""˜The allegations being made are malicious, fabricated and completely untrue.

""˜I have been acquitted by a court of law of all allegations save a one-off spontaneous offence following a verbal argument. I have been punished for this.

""˜I have been involved in raising livestock all my life. The discord in our relationship began when Lesley did not appreciate the effort involved and it impeded her party lifestyle.'

Lesley says: ""˜I could never forgive myself if I didn't speak out and he did what he's done to me to somebody else.

""˜I haven't hidden away, feeling I have something to be ashamed of. I didn't do anything wrong and can hold my head high. I will not let him destroy me. I made my sister a promise that I would live my life and be happy. I will.'

To millions during the coronavirus pandemic, it became known as the new temporary home of ITV's hit show I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. 

The grade-I listed Gwrych Castle near Abergele in north Wales hosted the programme in 2020 and 2021 amid the travel restrictions imposed in Queensland, Australia, where celebrities usually fly to take part in the series. 

But, more than 70 years ago, the castle was put to a much more important use amid the unfolding horrors of the Second World War.

From 1939 until 1941, the castle was a safe haven for around 200 Jewish refugees who had fled Nazi-occupied Europe as part of the Kindertransport scheme. 

It became the largest of around 20 agricultural training centres - known as hachsharot in Hebrew - that relocated to Britain from Germany during the war. 

Now, a new book has told the full story of the role the castle played in sheltering vulnerable Jewish children during the Holocaust.

Andrew Hesketh, the author of Escape to Gwrych Castle: A Jewish refugee story, told MailOnline that the children had 'been through hell and back' and their time at the castle represented a 'sense of moving from darkness into light' as they rebuilt their lives.

From 1939 until 1941, Gwrych Castle near Abergele in north Wales was a safe haven for around 200 Jewish refugees who had fled Nazi-occupied Europe as part of the Kindertransport scheme. Above: Six of the teenagers at the castle

The grade-I listed Gwrych Castle near Abergele in north Wales hosted I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here in 2020 and 2021 amid the travel restrictions imposed in Queensland, Australia, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic 

The Kindertransport was the name given to the scheme backed by the British Government to get children out of Nazi Germany and other occupied nations before war broke out in 1939. 

Nearly 10,000 mostly Jewish children came to the UK from Germany itself as well as Poland, Australia and Czechoslovakia. 

Once in the UK, most of these children went into foster homes.

But several hundred then ended up at the Jewish agricultural centres which were set up with the intention of preparing children for when a Jewish state in Palestine had been established.

Use of Gwrych Castle - which was built in the early 19th century - had been offered for free by its owner, Lord Dundonald, because it was in very poor condition. 

It had not been lived in by his family since 1924 and there was no electricity. 

After the centre at the castle opened in August 1939, just days before war began, children initially slept on hard floors before donations from Marks & Spencer and the local Baptist church improved living conditions. 

The water supply was not powerful enough to provide for 200 people and so children would have to carry pails of water up from the kitchen to their washrooms.

Children, all of whom were aged between 14 and 17, divided their time between doing agricultural work for free on local farms and studying.

Educational programmes, which were led by a rabbi, developed the children's religious understanding. 

The 2020 series of I'm a Celeb - the first that took place at the castle - was won by Giovanna Fletcher. Above: Giovanna Fletcher is seen with Ant and Dec in the castle after being crowned the winner

In their spare time they enjoyed playing football and table tennis and having parties. 

Nearly half had come from Great Engeham Farm in Kent, having been sent there after arriving in the UK just weeks or months earlier.

A further 31 were fresh from the last Kindertransport train to depart before war broke out. 

The teenagers who lived at the castle had been hand-picked by Erwin Seligman, who was a member Bachad, the Zionist youth organisation responsible for the training centres. 

Mr Hesketh said: 'These young people, who had been through hell and back, came to Britain totally lost, but there is a sort of sense of moving from darkness into light.

'Once they get established, there is a sense of hope and optimism. That is a key part in the story. 

'There was a future. These young people were determined to establish it. That is the key message. Perseverance.

'Talking to the descendants, that was something they were all very proud of.

'That these young people had established something that worked in a situation that looked impossible.'

Arieh Handler, who died aged 96 in 2011, was the director Bachad and spent much of his time at Gwrych, where he got married in 1940. 

He had helped organise the evacuation of children from Nazi-controlled areas in Europe.  

His grandson Aviv, who lives in London, told MailOnline: 'He talked about the castle fondly. 

'He talked particularly about how he got children out [of occupied areas]. 

'And about how he wandered from community to community to initially get visas for children to come out.'

Speaking of Mr Hesketh's book, he added: 'My grandfather didn't tell us everything. It is a great piece of work, it certainly told me things I didn't know.'

Arieh had been the last surviving witness to David Ben-Gurion's declaration of the state of Israel in Tel Aviv in 1948. 

One of the children at the castle, Herman Rothman, gave his recollections to the Imperial War Museum in 2008. 

He told how the children were split into groups based on their ages.  

He said: 'We were put about eight to ten children per room... almost as soon as we arrived we were put into groups.

'A group was of children who were usually about 16 or 17 years of age. The B group was approximately 14 and 15 and the C group was 14 and less. 

'I think 13 was the minimum age they permitted you to be there.

'Simply because I spoke English fairly well I was promoted into the A group. 

'I wasn't particularly happy because all my friends were in the B group.'

He added: 'After a couple of weeks we started working on land which belonged to the estate. And some of us had to go and work in farms in surrounding areas.

'We were collected very often, taken to work on these farms and then brought back say two O'clock, four O'clock or six O'clock in the evening back to the castle.' 

The centre had to be closed in 1941 because of the amount of investment that the castle needed to make it properly habitable in the long-term.

The teenagers there were instead offered an alternative location in Birmingham by the famous Cadbury family.

It was much cheaper to run and maintain and did not need any significant investment. 

Many of the boys in the group went on to serve in the British armed forces, while others went to Palestine and remained there after the state of Israel was established in 1948. 

Gwrych remained empty for the rest of the war and was then sold. 

Escape to Gwrych Castle: A Jewish refugee story, by Andrew Hesketh, was published in June by Calon

It was opened as a visitor attraction later in the 1940s and was later used as a training and entertainment venue, including for jousting events. 

However, it closed to the public in the late 1980s and went into severe decline.

It was bought by a property developer in 2007, with plans to turn it into a hotel.

When the firm went bust, the building was sold to the current owners, the Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust, and re-opened to visitors. 

The 2020 series of I'm a Celeb - the first that took place at the castle - was won by Giovanna Fletcher, whilst Danny Miller triumphed in the following year's competition.

The campmates had to be removed from the castle in November 2021 when a tree came crashing down during bad weather caused by Storm Arwen.

The fiasco forced ITV to air compilation clips instead of the live shows could not take place.

The world has embarked on a new era of exciting technologies - and experts reveal how augmented reality, robotics and artificial intelligence are poised to change our daily lives in almost unimaginable ways. 

Mike Rhodes, CEO & Founder of ConsultMyApp, told DailyMail.com that he predicts contact lenses will display information on our eyes, AR will merge our reality with a digital world and AI will help us speak to each other telepathically,

With PwC predicting that artificial intelligence could add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 (more than the output of China and India combined), we're on the verge of the biggest technological transformation in history. 

DailyMail.com took Rhodes's ideas, among others, and brought them to life using the popular AI art generator Midjourney to create images of what these technological breakthroughs might look like.

People will wear AR contact lenses

Augmented reality contact lenses will enable people to explore digital worlds. Experts predict the devices will display the same information as our current phones

Instead of carrying smartphones, people will use AI contact lenses to display the information they get from their phones now, Rhodes told DailyMail.com.

'Progress with AR technology is stumbling around in the dark right now, looking for an answer to bring it into the light and mass adoption,' he said.

'AR contact lenses that don't obstruct the user's daily activity could bring incredible opportunities for AR technology by providing consumers with an interface that lets them both live and work reality while having full access to the internet, all in the eye of the beholder!

'We're already seeing companies such as Mojo Vision realizing this is the holy grail (albeit running out of capital in the process), and there will be many more to follow in their footsteps with larger pockets.'

AI will enable us to be telepathic

Midjourney created images showing unique headsets with AI that beam thoughts between people 

According to Dr Clare Walsh, Director of Education at the Institute of Analytics, artificial intelligence will enable machines to peer inside our minds - and could make humans telepathic.

'Mind reading may no longer be a thing of science fiction. Researchers have already trained Chat GPT1 to translate MRI imagery into a textual description of an image that a person is looking at, or a scene that is unfolding in front of the person's eyes, Dr Walsh said.

'The good news is that MRI scanners are not portable, and so it's unlikely that anyone will read your mind without your being aware any time soon!'

Midjourney created images showing unique headsets with AI that beam thoughts between people. 

We will have 'digital doppelgangers' to improve our health

'Digital twins' of our bodies could spark a health revolution by letting doctors explore the anatomy like never before

In industry, digital twins are simulations of real-world objects fed with data. 

For example, a digital twin of a wind turbine offers engineers the chance to diagnose problems without visiting the site.

But in the future, we might have digital twins of our own bodies, 3D models which pulse with our real health data, according to researchers at NTT Research.

A 'bio digital twin' might offer doctors the chance to see how a patient would respond to drugs - before prescribing them.

Chris Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer, NTT Research, Inc said that NTT is trying to build a model of the human body, but, 'Tuning that generic model to create an individual digital twin will involve complex breakthroughs in data and mathematics. And, it will also take time""”decades for full realization of this project's potential.

'But the fundamental research being performed today will save lives tomorrow, with the bio digital twin rewriting our understanding and administration of precision medicine.'

Each of us will have an AI 'butler'

AI butlers will live in our homes to adhere to our daily needs

Advances in AI will see humans becoming reliant on AI 'servants' who will remind them to prepare meals, help to hit workout goals and stay on top of their work schedule, says Martin Kraemer, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4.

Kraemer believes the 'assistants' will exist in augmented reality - as people's lives increasingly move into the virtual world.

Kraemer says, 'We will see intelligent personal assistants that can solve complex tasks, e.g., complex route planning and scheduling.

'Advances in artificial general intelligence (sometime between 2030 and 2050) will make this possible. Large Language Models will be able almost perfectly to understand human language. 

Voice synthesis enables computers to talk. 

Many scheduling and route planning tasks will be complex or even NP-hard. Parallel signal processing with quantum computing will unlock the required computing power and resources. '

People will swallow digital pills to pre-diagnose illness

Digital pills fitted with sensors will change medicine by letting doctors see inside our bodies like never before

In the near future, people might swallow sensors to diagnose conditions before they affect them, building on today's trend for health-monitoring wearables.

Start-ups such as Celsius already offer health wearables - Celsius's wristband detects hot flushes and cools the wearer down.

But in future, people might swallow a digital pill with ingestible sensors to get 'pre-warned' of conditions that might affect them.

'Passive diagnosis', where conditions are diagnosed before they affect patients, might become the norm.

Futurist Shivvy Jervis said Swallowing a 'digital pill' isn't for everyone, and early trials and examples have shown that people either love it or hate it.

'For some people, however, there isn't much of a choice, Jervis continued.

'Those with compromised immune systems, undergoing chemotherapy, or who are already struggling with life-threatening medical conditions must know early if something else is coming. 

'The surprise could be fatal. 

'Fitness wearables started the passive diagnosis trend but is heading in a much more mainline medical direction. 

'It should always be an individual's choice, and this technology must be compliant with the patient's privacy preferences to reflect their best interests at all times.'

People will replace body parts with robotics

Will people augment their bodies with robot parts?

People will use anti-aging drugs and replacement body parts to defeat aging, said Michelle Dand, Head of Fitness products at David Lloyd Clubs.

Dand said that older people will be fitter and healthier than ever before.

'The rate at which technology is developing in the fields of robotics and human augmentation, many of the natural stages of aging that can hold us back are likely to be eliminated in the next 40 years,' he explained.

'From robotics technology in our limbs counteracting the effects of arthritis to implants improving cognitive ability and directly tapping into our nervous systems, the likelihood is by the 2060s we won't just be living longer, but we'll be in better health than ever before.'

Talking humanoid robots will be everywhere

Robots will take over the manual and even caring roles 

Talking humanoid robots will rapidly become common, driven partly by recent AI breakthroughs such as ChatGPT, says futurist Bernard Marr, author of Future Skills: The 20 Skills and Competencies Everyone Needs to Succeed in a Digital World.

The robots will work in everything from construction to the caring professions.

Marr said that machines will contribute to human society in ways we cannot yet imagine - as long as ethical considerations are considered.

'Looking forward, the potential applications of humanoid androids span a multitude of industries,' Marr continued.

\Their potential is vast, from performing dangerous tasks in hazardous environments to assisting in healthcare to personalized services in retail and hospitality.

'The challenge is not merely about advancing technology but ensuring it aligns with and supports the values and needs of our human society. The 'AI boom,' thus, is not an end in itself but a tool that, if used thoughtfully, can bring about significant societal benefits.'

The Babel Fish will become a reality

Technology will enable us to talk to anyone - no matter the language they speak

People can talk to anyone anywhere on Earth in any language in real-time, said Liz Hawke, Product Manager UC&C at M247.

Brain implants will permit people to talk to each other instantly, in a development of today's unified communications.

Hawke says, 'If you're familiar with the Babel Fish in 'The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy' - a classic sci-fi film - you'll know how it allowed for near-perfect communication with a myriad of alien species.

'This century could see advances in the scientific movement of transhumanism, whereby human capabilities are augmented by nanotechnology, and communication platforms will evolve from standard devices like laptops or smartphones to devices that will allow true communication with anyone and anywhere.

AI stockbrokers will predict the future

Will AI stockbrokers change the way the stock market works, which is already being seen in today's world

Quantum computing - which uses the bizarre properties of quantum computing to supercharge processing - will make it possible to predict the future.

Rather than using traditional 'bits' of ones and zeroes, quantum computers use 'qubits' where the numbers can be one, zero or both simultaneously.

This century, quantum computing is expected to unlock huge amounts of processing power, according to Chris Hacket of Face Digital, which advises financial services firms.

'You could make stunningly accurate market predictions, optimize investments, and even manage risk in ways we've never dreamed possible,' Hackett said. 

'Imagine logging into your online banking and being offered financial advice based on hyper-accurate predictions. 

'Imagine being able to navigate your financial journey with confidence, knowing that the suggestions given to you are based on data crunched by a quantum computer.

'Picture an 'Avatar Advisor,' a holographic AI representation using quantum computations and AGI. It pops up whenever you need financial advice, turning complex data into easy-to-understand visuals, graphs, and charts.'

The internet will be a 3D world

The internet will become so powerful it will display information in 3D -changing how we explore the world

Instead of a 'flat' internet visited through smartphones, we will all have 3D avatars which we use to explore everything from shopping to entertainment, says Simon Windsor, founder of NFT project and virtual world, Metashima, and co-founder of virtual production studio, Dimension

Windsor believes that it will become normal to experience the internet in 3D.

The metaverse is effectively going to start us on a transition from 2D to 3D content and I think this transition will start in earnest with how we present our identities online,' he said.

'Most people online have a digital profile of some form, and that is normally all 2D imagery, video, and text - think of the likes of Instagram and TikTok.'

'The point of the metaverse is that it's a virtual universe where you can access all of the value of the internet, but in a three-dimensional way, and you can do it with new opportunities in mind and new ways to experience things like entertainment. 

'But I believe that this major shift from experiencing the content in 3D rather than 2D will start with our virtual identities.'

Most of our food will be grown in labs

Forget cultured meat, soon we will culture everything in labs - and maybe even our homes

Artificial meat has made headlines recently, but in the coming decades, everything from dairy products to vegetables will be grown in lab dishes, said Anthony Chow, Co-Founder of Agronomics.

Chow says that the technology, known as 'cellular agriculture', is the only technology that can increase food production without outpacing Earth's resources.

Chow says, 'Technologies such as precision fermentation have the power to completely revolutionize traditional industries, including the dairy and egg industry, towards a more sustainable future.

'The adoption of cellular agriculture is crucial as we simply cannot feed today's global population of eight billion people without causing irreversible damage to the natural environment, let alone the predicted population growth of an additional two billion people in the coming decades,' Marr said.

US health officials are on the verge of approving lab-grown meat in a move that could see the products in restaurants and grocers in months.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has declared engineered animal products safe for human consumption, paving the way for synthetic animal products to be sold in the US.

Manufacturers are now just waiting on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service to sign off on packaging and labeling criteria.

UPSIDE Foods says it expected to be available in high-end restaurants within months, but companies say they will need to expand production before they have enough stock to be able to supply grocery stores.

Lab-grown meat is made by taking a small sample of cells from livestock, such as chickens or cows.

The checks are hen supplied with nutrients inside an enormous steel vessel called a bioreactor and processed to look and taste like a real cut of meat.

Singapore is so far the only country in the world to have approved the meats for sale, ""” although a chicken nugget costs more than $50 to produce, reports CNA.

In November, the FDA signed off on the engineered chicken breasts made by UPSIDE Foods, which taste the same as conventional chicken but are also thinner. 

The FDA's inspection focused on ensuring the engineered meats were safe for human consumption and evaluated the production process.

But UPSIDE Foods will also need a sign-off from the FSIS before selling the animal products. 

The FSIS agency evaluates the harvesting process and packaging. Manufacturers will have to carry a warning that the meat was grown in a lab.

FDA says cultivated chicken is safe

 

The agency's decision in November applied to cultivated chicken produced by Upside Foods but is likely to bring products from any of the dozens of firms pursuing lab-grown meat in America. 

UPSIDE Foods in Emeryville, California, has not said how much its engineered animal products will be priced at.

But company founder and CEO Uma Valeti told Yahoo Finance in December that they were initially aiming for 'premium pricing'.

UPSIDE worked with the FDA for four years before receiving the agency's green light in November, Valeti told Reuters.

'It´s a watershed moment for the industry,' he said.

Other manufacturers are also competing for a share of the market.

California-based cultivated meat company GOOD Meat already has an application pending with the FDA.

According to Reuters, two other companies, Netherlands-based Mosa Meat and Israel-based Believer Meats, said they are in discussions with the agency.

The FDA declined to provide details but confirmed it is talking to multiple companies.

Regulatory approval is just the first hurdle for making lab-grown meat accessible to a broad swath of consumers, executives at UPSIDE, Mosa Meat, Believer Meats, and GOOD Meat said.

The biggest challenge companies face is growing the nascent supply chain for the nutrient mix to feed cells and for the massive bioreactors required to produce large quantities of cultivated meat, executives said.

For now, production is limited. 

UPSIDE´s facility has the capacity to churn out 400,000 pounds of cultivated meat per year - a small fraction of the 106 billion pounds of conventional meat and poultry produced in the United States in 2021, according to the North American Meat Institute, a meat industry lobby group.

British scientists grow fillet steak in a LABORATORY that looks and smells just like real meat 

British scientists have successfully grown fillet steak in a laboratory - and it could be available to buy as early as next year.

3D Bio-Tissues (3DBT), a spinoff from Newcastle University, produced three small prototype fillets, each weighing just 5g each.

According to the team, when pan-fried, the fillets seared easily and showed heavy caramelization, with aromas 'identical to those of barbecued meat'.

Che Connon, Chief Executive of 3DBT, said: 'We are extremely pleased with the results of our first prototype which has exceeded our expectations in terms of integrity, aroma, texture and more.

'We believe our prototypes to be some of the first fillets of cultivated meat in the world, representing a ground-breaking development for the industry.'

If the companies cannot get the funds needed to scale-up production, their product may never reach a price point where it can compete with conventional meat, said GOOD Meat co-founder Josh Tetrick.

'Selling is different than selling a lot,' Tetrick said. 'Until we as a company and other companies build large-scale infrastructure, this is going to be very small scale.'

The cultivated meat sector has raised nearly $2billion in investments globally, according to data collected by the Good Food Institute (GFI), a research group focused on alternatives to conventional meat.

But it will take hundreds of millions of dollars for GOOD Meat, for example, to build bioreactors of the size needed to make its meat at scale, Tetrick said.

Venture capital firms and major food companies like JBS SA , Tyson Foods Inc, and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co have invested in the industry so far.

JBS spokesperson Nikki Richardson said the company's cultivated meat investments are consistent with our efforts to build a diversified global food portfolio of traditional, plant-based and alternative protein product offerings'.

Tyson did not respond to a request for comment. ADM declined to comment.

Much of that money has been directed toward the United States, the No. 1 target for cultivated meat makers because of its size and wealth, said Jordan Bar Am, a partner at McKinsey &amp; Company who focuses on alternative proteins.

Some companies are scaling up U.S. production even before regulators have approved their products.

Believer Meats plans to build a facility in North Carolina, set to be commissioned in early 2024, that could produce 22million pounds of meat annually, chief executive officer Nicole Johnson-Hoffman said. 

And GOOD Meat has plans to build out its production in California and Singapore to as much as 30 million pounds annually.

The European Union, Israel, and other countries are working on regulatory frameworks for cultivated meat but have not yet approved a product for human consumption.

Cultivated meat companies plan to pitch to consumers that their product is greener and more ethical than conventional livestock, while attempting to overcome an aversion to their product among some shoppers.

For one, their product does not involve animal slaughter, which companies hope will make the product appealing to people who avoid meat for moral reasons. Animals are unharmed in the cell collection process, company executives told Reuters.

Another draw is that growing meat in a steel vessel instead of in a field could reduce the environmental impact of livestock, which are responsible for 14.5 percent of the world´s greenhouse gas emissions through feed production, deforestation, manure management, and enteric fermentation - animal burps - according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

According to a GFI report, plant-based meat companies have also appealed to consumers with moral and environmental claims, though the sector has captured just 1.4 percent of the meat market.

But cultivated meat companies have the advantage that they can claim their product is real meat, Tetrick said.

'Probably the single biggest thing we´ve learned is that people really love meat. They´re probably not going to eat a whole lot less of it,' he said.

Still, a lot of people are grossed out by cultivated meat, said Janet Tomiyama, a health psychologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies human diets.

In a 2022 study published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology, she found that 35 percent of meat eaters and 55 percent of vegetarians would be too disgusted to try cultivated meat.

She said that some people may perceive the meat as 'unnatural' and have a negative attitude about it before even trying it.

To attract hesitant shoppers, companies need to be as clear as possible about how their product is made and that it's safe to eat, said Tetrick, whose company has sold its product at restaurants in Singapore.

'You´ve got to be transparent about it, but in a way that´s still appetizing,' he said.

UPSIDE Foods and GOOD Meat plan to whet American palates by releasing their products at high-end restaurants first once approved, they said, betting that consumers there will tolerate a higher price point and have a good first impression of their meat.

UPSIDE hopes to get its products into grocery stores in the next three to five years, CEO Valeti said.

Major U.S. supermarket chains did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Restaurateur AndrÃ©s, known for his work on global food security, told Reuters he wants to sell cultivated meat because of its environmental benefits.

'We can see in what is happening all around us, in every country around the globe, that our planet is in crisis,' he said.

Fellow chef Mallmann, known for his preparations of meat and other foods on outdoor flames, told Reuters he is also influenced by environmental considerations and sees the role of chefs as making the product more gastronomically appealing and less scientific.

'We have to add romance to it,' he said.

Listen to eerie sounds coming from the world's largest and oldest living organism

Scientists shared the haunting sounds of Utah's 'Trembling Giant' - the Pando aspen forest made up of a tree with 47,000 'clones' growing from a single root system.

The eerie rumbling (here) is millions of leaves rustling in the wind during a thunderstorm, which vibrated the tree to the ground, where microphones captured the noise.

Pando is believed to be the largest, most dense organism ever found at nearly 13 million pounds, and its clones cover more than 106 acres.

The 80,000-year-old forest originated from a single seed and spread by sending up new shoots from the expanding root system, creating genetically identical stems.

Scientists shared the haunting sounds of Utah 's 'Trembling Giant' - the Pando aspen forest made up of a tree with 47,000 'clones' growing from a single root system.

Pando is located in Utah's Fishlake National Forest, and research has suggested that it has been regenerating for 9,000 years, making it one of the oldest organisms on Earth.

The sounds of this living thing were captured by sound artist Jeff Rice and Lance Oditt, founder of Friends of Pando, who placed a hydrophone inside a hallow branch at the tree's base and maneuvered it down to the roots - about 90 feet below the surface.

'Hydrophones don't just need water to work,' said Rice. 

'They can pick up vibrations from surfaces like roots as well, and when I put on my headphones, I was instantly surprised. 

'Something was happening. There was a faint sound.'

Rice wanted to capture the sounds of Pando during a thunderstorm, and when he put his headphones on, he heard a haunting rumbling come through.

'What you're hearing, I think, is the sound of millions of leaves in the forest, vibrating the tree and passing down through the branches, down into the earth,' Rice said during a March presentation when he first shared the audio.

The hydrophone also registered with a low thump when they banged lightly on a branch 90 feet away. Rice compared this to the classic tin can telephone.

'It's similar to two cans connected by a string,' he said. 'Except there are 47,000 cans connected by a huge root system.'

While Pando is a marvel of the world, a study in 2018 found it is slowly dying due to relentless human interference - scientists warn that it is unlikely to exist in as little as 50 years.

Co-author Paul Rogers from Utah State University's Wildland Resources Department said: 'While Pando has likely existed for thousands of years - we have no method of firmly fixing its' age - it is now collapsing on our watch.

'One clear lesson emerges here: we cannot independently manage wildlife and forests.'

This decline has happened because humans have expanded into the forest and cut down areas without giving them time to recover.

Grazing deer have also put pressure on the park, and a long-standing drought has further added to its demise.

In news that will come as music to pigs' ears, British scientists have successfully grown a complete pork steak in the laboratory from just a few animal cells.

The Newcastle-based researchers were not afraid to try their 1.2oz (33g) fillet, and claim it tastes, feels and smells just like real pork.

When raw, the steak has the same consistency and elasticity as traditional meat, but becomes crispy and chars when pan fried.

So far, only one steak has been created, although the team believes it won't be long before their creation is available to buy.

WHY IS EATING MEAT BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT? 

Animal food products hurt the environment in a number of ways.

Cows, pigs and other farm animals release huge amounts of methane into the atmosphere, which is a greenhouse gas and contributes to global warming.

Raising livestock also means converting forests into agricultural land, meaning CO2-absorbing trees are being cut down, further adding to climate change.  

Factory farms and crop growing also requires massive amounts of water, with 542 litres of water being used to produce just a single chicken breast.

As well as this, the nitrogen-based fertiliser used on crops adds to nitrous oxide emissions. Nitrous oxide is around 300 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere. These fertilisers can also end up in rivers, further adding to pollution. 

Experts at 3D Bio-Tissues (3DBT) are looking to work with manufacturers and supermarkets to get their lab-grown products on the shelves.

Its price has not yet been set as the technology is not yet at the required scale to allow for a valuation.

Dr Che Connon, Chief Executive of 3DBT, said: 'We are absolutely delighted with the appearance, taste, aroma, and texture of our cultivated pork, which is the first time we have fully sampled our product. 

'Our cruelty-free fillet has exceeded our expectations in all respects, and we are extremely excited about the technological progress we are making and the impact this could have on our industry.'

People are increasingly turning to vegetarian and vegan diets as they become more aware of the mistreatment of farmed animals and the meat industry's impact on climate change.

As a result, many researchers are trying different ways to create meat and dairy substitutes that do not rely on animal products.

These include edible insects, cheese made from peas and sausages grown in the lab from just a few animal cells.

Last year, 3DBT announced it had grown three prototype steak fillets in the laboratory, each weighing just 0.17oz (5g) each.

According to the team, when pan fried, the fillets seared easily and showed heavy caramelisation, with aromas 'identical to those of barbecued meat'.

The raw fillet has meat-like fibres, a similar resistance to breaking and compression when cut and no aroma

When it was pan-fried, the cultivated pork fillet steak exhibited a degree of shrinkage similar to how animal meat responds to heat, and also seared easily

To create the pork steak fillets, scientists took cells from living pigs using painless biopsies.

These cells were placed into a bioreactor, where they were added to a patented chemical growth agent called 'City-Mix', which increases the number of cells.

Once the number of cells increased enough, the product began to resemble a normal steak.

It took about a month to grow the complete fillet from the cells. For comparison, it takes about six months to rear a pig.

3DBT says this is the first ever lab-grown steak produced in the UK, as well as the world's first '100 per cent' meat product grown in the lab.

This is because it does not contain plant-based alternatives to collagen and gelatine, like other lab-grown meats.

The experts at 3D Bio-Tissues (3DBT) are now working to grow another pork fillet that can be showcased to, and sampled by, a select panel outside the lab in the coming months

To create their steak fillets, scientists take cells from living cows using painless biopsies. These cells are placed into a bioreactor, where they are added to a chemical growth agent called 'City-Mix', which increases the number of cells. Once the number of cells increases enough, the product begins to resemble a normal steak 

3DBT's Chief Science Officer, Dr Ricardo Gouveia, and Dr Connon tested the product for similarities to real meat in both its raw and cooked forms.

The raw fillet had meat-like fibres, a similar resistance to breaking and compression when cut and no aroma.

When it was pan-fried, it exhibited a degree of shrinkage similar to how animal meat responds to heat, and also seared easily.

It developed a crispy, charred surface, and delivered aromas the company says are 'identical to those of frying traditional pork'.

The new pork steak was cultivated in a similar way, by extracting cells from the pig and encouraging them to grow and divide using City-Mix (pictured)

The team are looking into working with manufacturers and supermarkets to get their lab-grown products on the shelves

The scientists who ate the cooked fillet say it had a similar texture, consistency and flavour to pork from slaughtered animals and 'exceeded expectations'.

They hope that the product will reduce the demand for livestock farming, therefore reducing the greenhouse gas emissions, as well as water and energy consumption, it's responsible for.

Scientists say the overall environmental impacts of cultured meat production are likely to be substantially lower than those of conventionally produced meat, despite no direct comparison being possible because cultivated products are not yet being produced on an industrial scale.

One study claimed that cultivated meat involves approximately seven to 45 per cent less energy use than conventionally produced European meat. 

Greenhouse gas emissions were also found to be 78 to 96 per cent lower, while land use was cut by 99 per cent and water use by 82 to 96 per cent. 

The scientists who ate the cooked fillet say it had a similar texture, consistency and flavour to pork from slaughtered animals and 'exceeded expectations'

As well as another prototype pork fillet, the company hopes to use its technology to produce lab-grown leather from animal skin cells for fashion items.

Dr Connon said: 'City-mix, our serum-free media supplement in which we cultivated the fillet, is helping to greatly reduce the cost of cultivated meat such that it may become economically viable in the near future. 

'At the same time, our ""structure without scaffold"" technology is helping to make cultivated meat that more closely resembles traditional meat in every respect without the need for plant-based additives. 

'We look forward to taking the findings through to the next stage of development, focused on producing a chef-ready product for public consumption.'

COULD INSECTS BE THE NEXT 'SUPERFOOD'?

Edible insects have been touted as the next 'superfood', with the creepy crawlies packed full of protein, nutrients, potassium, magnesium and three times more fatty acids than omega-3 in salmon.

Insects contain more than twice as much protein per 100g as meat and fish, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.

Crickets are the most widely cultivated insects for the human diet across the world and are considered the ""˜gateway bug' for people who choose to eat insects.

They, along with other insects are touted as highly nutritious and much better for the planet - environmentally and financially - than traditional livestock, due to the comparatively efficient rate at which they convert feed into body mass.

The global population is predicted to top nine billion by 2050, putting enormous pressure on the environment, conventional food sources and farming techniques. Insects could help meet demand for food.

Plenty of people in non-Western countries already eat insects regularly. They are very efficient at converting vegetation into edible protein and full of vitamins and minerals.

Previous studies have found that four crickets provide as much calcium as a glass of milk, and dung beetles, by weight, contain more iron than beef.

Farming insects generates one-tenth of the methane produced by farming traditional meat sources, and it uses comparatively little water, making the process better for the environment.

You might prefer the taste of black coffee.

But scientists now say there's a reason why you should give it up.

For adding milk to your brew may make a cuppa twice as good for you, in theory. 

The study, published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, analysed how antioxidants, known as polyphenols, behave when combined with amino acids, the building blocks of proteins

Coffee is packed full of antioxidants called polyphenols, which have been shown to reduce inflammation. 

Inflammation is the body's response to a threat ""” such as bacteria, toxins, trauma, even extreme temperature ""” injuring tissue in the body.

However, chronic inflammation increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease, cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. 

New research suggests that consuming items rich in polyphenols alongside those full of amino acids ""” such as milk ""” makes the antioxidants even more effective at reducing inflammation.

Very few studies had looked at what happens when polyphenols ""” which are also found in fruits and vegetables, tea, red wine and beer ""” are combined with other molecules in foods, such as amino acids ""” the building blocks of protein.

To investigate this, researchers at the University of Copenhagen applied artificial inflammation to immune cells.   

Some of the cells received differing doses of polyphenols that had reacted with an amino acid (reflecting coffee with milk) ""” while others only received polyphenols in the same doses (mirroring black coffee). 

A control group received nothing.

The study found that immune cells treated with the combination were twice as effective at 'fighting' away inflammation, compared to cells that only polyphenols were added. 

Researchers, whose work was published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, said: 'A combination of proteins and antioxidants doubles the anti-inflammatory properties in immune cells.'

The findings suggest that coffee with milk has an anti-inflammatory effect, the researchers said.  

Milk is rich in proteins and contains all nine essential amino acids required by humans. 

Professor Marianne Nissen Lund, who led the study, said: 'We show as a polyphenol reacts with an amino acid, its inhibitory effect on inflammation in immune cells is enhanced. 

'As such, it is clearly imaginable that this cocktail could also have a beneficial effect on inflammation in humans. 

'We will now investigate further, initially in animals.'

Professor Lund added: 'I can imagine that something similar happens in, for example, a meat dish with vegetables or a smoothie, if you make sure to add some protein like milk or yogurt.'

The new research joins a plethora of studies linking coffee to numerous health benefits, including general longevity, and less chance of depression or diabetes.  

Chemicals in coffee are believed to reduce inflammation, boost metabolism and improve insulin sensitivity.   

However, the research was performed in a laboratory environment, not the real world. 

The researchers will now investigate the effect on immune cells, initially on animals before studying humans.

Is the Amazon rainforest set to be saved by a COCAINE warlord? Colombian kingpin's threats to tree choppers have slashed deforestation in his native country by 76% - but locals fear he'll start chainsaws if govt. ignores his demands

A cocaine warlord is helping save the Amazon rainforest in Colombia after his threats to farmers saw deforestation rates fall by 76 percent in a year. 

Ivan Mordisco, the leader of Estado Mayor Central (EMC), has implemented strict sanctions to stop land-grabbing farmers to slashing trees. 

As the country's third-largest illegal armed group, the EMC is known for drug trafficking, illegal gold mining and extortion. The sanction occupies the country's most environmentally-sensitive territory with significant military power. 

With a support network of more than 3,000, including 2,200 armed fighters said to strong-arm anyone who should attempt to evade the rules of the armed factions, Mordisco's tactics have seen deforestation rates fall.

In May 2022, the EMC introduced sanctions of 1 million Colombian pesos ($251) for each hectare of forestry slashed without permission.

Illegal logging numbers have most in regions where the EMC has uncontested power, including the Caqueta, Meta and Guaviare provinces

Now, it's believed to be even higher, with one local leader in Calamar, a region of Guaviare province, claiming fined can go as high as 10 million to 20 million pesos ($2,000 - $4,800) per hectare, Bloomberg reports.

In regions where the EMC holds the power, such as the Caqueta, Meta and Guaviare provinces, illegal logging has declined the most substantially at rates of 50 percent, 34 percent and 37 percent respectively. 

But the scale of Mordisco's control is causing concern long-term. 

There are fears that should the leftist government refuses Mordisco's demands, he'll act on threats already issues to start up the chainsaws once again. 

Environmental crime researcher Bram Ebus says the initiative is a power-move. 

Ebus, who works for the non-profit International Crisis Group, says while the tactic clearly is helping the area, Mordisco could be interested holding the upper-hand during peace talks negotiation tables with left-wing President Gustavo Petro who is looking to meet with illegal groups, including the EMC. 

'We saw that they started using deforestation restrictions as a political tool prior to the ""paz total"" negotiations,' Ebus told Al Jazeera.

His motivation could be also be linked to an interest in maintaining a thick jungle canopy for his troops to freely move about. 

Jose Tomas Ojeda Soleimani, an EMC spokesperson, said the consideration for the Amazon is born out of both environmental and security concerns, acknowledging in some part the protection their army gains from being undetectable. 

'We have banned deforestation in the Amazon because we are a profoundly environmental guerrilla,' Ojeda said. 

'The trees protect us and we need water for our military operations.' 

An environmentalist who works in the region for an NGO, the Foundation for Conservation and Development, says long-term, the method doesn't work. 

'This isn't sustainable, because it depends on the whims of an armed actor, not of the people, not of the government, not of anyone using any mechanisms other than force,' Angelica Rojas told Bloomberg. 

It's estimated Mordisco's Estado Mayor Central (EMC) boasts an army of about 2,200 fighters and a network of supporters of 1,400, according to army intelligence.

Rural communities slash the forest to make way for cattle ranches

Only the National Liberation Army, a guerrilla force, and cocaine cartel, the Gulf Clan, are made up of more numbers. 

Colombia's part of the Amazon only accounts for 10 percent of the forest - and in Brazil, deforestation numbers were recorded at an all-time high last year.

The Amazon spans 2.1 million square miles across eight countries - Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana and Suriname - but the majority, around 60 per cent, is within Brazil's borders. 

A 2022 report warned the jungle is 'alarmingly close' to dying by 2030 due to climate change and forest loss.

The world's largest rainforest is close to a 'tipping point' that could mean it changes forever, no longer benefiting humanity by soaking up greenhouse gases, the WWF report said.

Lead author Professor Mary Gagen said: 'We could lose the Amazon to a state of permanent, irreversible degradation that would impact the entire planet... the evidence gives a stark warning.'

Between 13 to 17 per cent of the Amazon rainforest area has already been lost in the past 50 years, according to the organisation.

An area of the Amazon one quarter of the size of Europe - 1.4 million sq miles - has experienced a lack of rain, a prolonged dry season and deforestation which could lead it to become permanently degraded, turning to scrubland.

While scientists frequently warn about deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, a lesser-known process called 'degradation' - where trees have been affected by logging, mining, fires, expansion of roads or other human activity - is just as harmful.

According to a study published earlier this year, 38 per cent of what's left of the Amazon has been degraded in some way by humans - more than previously realised.

Although the two are sometimes confused, degradation is different from deforestation, where the forest is removed altogether and a new land use, such as agriculture, is established in its place. 

'The disturbance of the remaining forest causes a long term loss of their capacity to store carbon,' study author Jos Barlow, a professor of conservation science at Lancaster University, told MailOnline.

'For example, when fire escapes into a rainforest, it kills around 40 per cent of the trees.

'The dead trees then decompose, or are burned by a subsequent fire, releasing carbon into the atmosphere.

'Furthermore, these emissions are not offset by the growth of new trees, which store very little carbon compared to the large trees that have been lost.'

Why are deadly dog attacks on the rise? Experts warn celebrity dog ear-cropping trend, lockdown puppy farms and TikTok are fuelling rise in injuries and deaths - as Britain's 'dog bite solicitor' says household pets are just as dangerous as banned breeds

A leading academic has warned that Britain is in the midst of a public health crisis as the number of deadly dog attacks continues to rise.

Dr John Tulloch, a veterinary public health expert at the University of Liverpool authored a 2021 research paper that revealed a startling rise in the number of dog bite incidents over the past 20 years.

He told MailOnline that although wider research into the cause of this explosion in these attacks was limited, there had been an emergence of 'worrying' trends that he has witnessed in more recent dog ownership. 

Possible explanations include broader changes in society, with more dogs now being bought from unregulated or overseas breeders, or the way in which people interact with their pets - fuelled by TikTok trends or videos hoping to garner likes online. 

Schoolboy Jack Lis, 10, was mauled to death by an XXL Bully breed in November 2021

Little Bella-Rae Birch was just 17 months old when she was killed after suffering serious injuries from a bite caused by an American Bully XL breed

Ann Dunn, 65, was another victim of a brutal dog attack, described by police as an American Bulldog-style breed

Muscles bulging, this is the dog nicknamed 'Beast' that took seven rounds to kill after mauling schoolboy Jack Lis to death

Dr Tulloch told MailOnline: 'In the last 20 years or so there's been a definite rise in cases of severe dog attacks, it has been creeping up and up and up and we should be calling it what it is, a growing public health problem.

'In most cases, it's a dog that is known to the victim as these events are occurring behind closed doors. 

'Children still account for around 25 per cent of hospital admissions due to dog bites, but we need to understand why adults are being attacked more now, it's a striking problem. 

How to spot aggression in a dog - and its cause 

Aggression in dogs is almost always a case of fear - using their bite as a last resort method of self-defence or to get a frightening or unpleasant experience to stop.

Such fears can arise due to early years puppy socialisation or past experiences. 

Owners need to be able to recognise and establish how a dog is feeling, with many giving off warning signals before an attack.

There are several signals that your dog may give to indicate they are worried, fearful or feeling stressed and these include: yawning or licking lips, crouching with their tail between their legs, wagging tails and growling.



If a dog is showing any signs of aggression, a vet should be consulted to determine if there is a medical cause, such as pain or discomfort. 

Failing that, speaking to a behavioural expert could help tame a more aggressive animal.

'And more deprived areas of the country have higher dog bite hospitalisation rates compared to the least deprived communities, which had the lowest.'

Responding to the rising number of fatalities last year, Defra said it was 'exploring measures to reduce dog attacks and promote responsible ownership'.

James McNally, dubbed Britain's 'dog bite solicitor' and a personal injury claim expert with Slee Blackwell Solicitors, has said he's seen a rise in the number of dog bite claims in recent years.

He told MailOnline how he currently has more than 180 clients and his inbox is ballooning with fresh enquiries every day.

Mr McNally said: 'Some of the worst injuries we're seeing are by those beloved household pets; Collies, Jack Russells, Huskies. Any dog can cause injury at any time.

'We've had a lady who lost the tip of her nose, delivery drivers missing fingers. There are cases we're dealing with where a child has been scalped by the dog and suffered serious facial injuries - they're all horrible.

'In a lot of the cases we're seeing, the way I see it is that it's the family dogs. 

'I think the pandemic puppy boom has probably contributed to the rising number of dog bites, experts have raised huge concerns about puppy farms and I think a lot of us are just not aware of this entire world of dog breeding. 

'Ultimately, it's a bit of a Wild West out there. We had the wrong dogs, being bred by the wrong people, going to the wrong homes. 

'It's a recipe for disaster and was fuelling the fire.'

It comes as horrified neighbours last night paid tribute to a four-year-old girl who was mauled to death by a dog at her home in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire.

Little Alice Stones was savaged by the animal in her back garden in Broadlands, Netherfield, last night.

Armed police cornered the dog and destroyed it. Thames Valley Police has said no arrests have been made as they investigate the attack in Buckinghamshire.

Jack Lis was attacked by the XL bully dog while playing with a friend at a house after school in Pentwyn

American Bully-type dog Cookie was put down by a vet at the scene after he bit Keven Jones, 62, and he bled to death

Dog behaviourist and clinical animal behaviour student Kyra Algazi-Floden told MailOnline: 'Ideally, dog breeding should be under stricter regulation.

'I think that many people just don't know enough about dogs before taking one. The children's energy is different compared to adults with dogs, they have a faster pace and make more sudden movements which can frighten the dog. 

Fatal dog attacks in the UK in 2022: 

10 people died from dog attacks in the UK last year. They were:

John William Jones

John William Jones, 68, known as William, was found dead at his country cottage in Lampeter, West Wales, on Jan 10. Police sedated three bulldogs Milo, Tia and Abbie after arriving at the scene.

Kyra Leanne King

Three-month-old Kyra Leanne King died on March 6, at Ostler's Plantation, near Woodhall Spa in Lincolnshire.

A 40-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of being in charge of an out-of-control husky and remain under investigation.

Bella-Rae Birch 

Bella-Rae Birch was just 17 months old when an American Bully XL mauled her to death at her home in Blackbrook, St Helen's on March 21. 

The dog had been bought by her father 'for buttons' just one week earlier and was 'humanely destroyed' following the shocking attack, Merseyside Police said. 

Lawson Bond:

Two-year-old Lawson Bond was savaged at home in the village of Egdon, Worcestershire, on March 28. Lawson suffered a cardiac arrest as a result of his horrific injuries and died two days later on March 30.

Daniel Twigg: 

Three-year-old Daniel Twigg was mauled to death in a dog attack on a farm on May 15. Paramedics rushed to the area in Rochdale shortly after 1pm on Sunday to reports the youngster had been injured. Daniel was taken by ambulance to hospital where he was sadly pronounced dead.

Joanne Robinson: 

Ms Robinson, 43, was killed by an American bully XL in West Melton, South Yorkshire, on July 15. 

Ian Symes: 

34-year-old dog trainer Ian Symes was attacked in a park in Portsmouth on August 10. He died from his injuries after being bitten by an American bully XL. 

Kevin Jones:

62-year-old Mr Jones died after being mauled by a dog at a house in Wales.

Police were called to a property on Holt Road, Wrexham, north Wales, at 11.44am on Monday, May 23.

The Welsh Ambulance Service said Mr Jones was having a heart attack after being bitten by the dog, but died at the scene despite efforts of paramedics.

Ann Dunn:

Ann Dunn, 65, became the ninth victim of a fatal dog attack on October 3 after being mauled by multiple American bulldogs. Her body was found after she did not arrive to collect her grandson from school, neighbours say.

Shirley Patrick:

Pensioner Shirley Patrick, 83, died from her injuries two weeks after being attacked by an American Bully XL breed in Caerphilly, South Wales. 



'The first 4-8 months of raising a puppy are very important. It is not advisable to leave small children unsupervised with dogs. 

'We should be looking at what owners are doing wrong with their dogs, not the dog.

'Puppies need the right amount of exercise, food, sleep, socialisation and care. Puppies that have not been bred and raised under the right circumstances will have fewer copings mechanism in life which could for example make them more redrawn or aggressive.'

Similar fears have been raised among academics and experts, with dog ownership increasing by an estimated 10 per cent in the UK during the pandemic.

Dr Tulloch adds: 'There is some regulation in place but there are certainly cases of unscrupulous breeding activities going on.

'It's so easy to go online, go out today with cash in hand a get a dog on a whim. That's without checking their environment, how the mother is looked after, for example.'

Dog psychologist Bruce Clanford told MailOnline of his own fears about a lack of responsible dog owners.

He said: 'There's no regulation on owning dogs, or people handling them, there's also no standard of education which means there are too many people who don't know what they're doing.

'Lockdown didn't help, many people had a knee-jerk reaction to just get a dog because it helped them get out and about while we were locked down. 

'So many dogs have now come out over the past few years that have had to be rehomed, people didn't understand how to look after them. 

'Personally, I've seen this a lot in the last two years.'

The shock research comes after a spate of fatal dog attacks in 2022, which saw a record ten people killed.

Four of those killed in deadly dog attacks were children, with the case of schoolboy Jack Lis shocking the nation after he was mauled by a near-7st Bully XL dog called 'Beast'.

Emma Whitfield, mother of little Jack, revealed her heartache as she spoke out for the first time six months after her son's death.

Recalling his last day, she told Panorama: 'He wanted to go out to play and take his skateboard. The last thing I said to him was be careful.

'Jack had met his friend straight after leaving the house. His friend said do you want to come and see my new dog?

'Within maybe 10-15 minutes of that, my door knocked. There was a lady saying he's been attacked by a dog.

'I jumped in the car, pulled up outside the house, you could hear the dog barking. The dog tried running through the door and that was how I saw the dog's face. He had only attacked one part of Jack and it was here up [pointing to the neck].

'They kept saying they're working on him, they're working on him. Then the paramedic walked away and came back with a blanket. I knew, but I couldn't say out loud what I saw because I don't want other people to have to picture it either. 

'Every time I shut my eyes, I try and tell myself that's not the last image I have of him.

'I try and tell myself it was when he shut the door with the skateboard in his hands. But that's not true.' 

The rise in dog attacks in recent years, which has ballooned from around 3,300 in 2002 to more than 8,800 in 2021, has sparked some calls for a revamp of the Dangerous Dogs Act.

That 1991 law saw a blanket ban imposed on four specific 'fighting-style' breeds in the UK; the Pit Bull Terrier, Japanese Tosa, Dogo Argentino and Fila Brasiliero.

But some experts say the legislation itself is problematic, and has created a misguided sense of comfort that all remaining dog breeds are safe.

Alice Stones, four, was pronounced dead at the scene after being seriously injured in the attack in the back garden of her home in Broadlands, Netherfield

Controversy: Celebrities including Little Mix star Leigh-Anne Pinnock have been criticised for adopting dogs with cut ears, a procedure banned in the United Kingdom

Own goal: Andy Carroll and Billi Mucklow have also shared photos of their cropped puppy Bane on social media

Dr Sam Gains, the RSPCA's head of companion animals, science and policy, said: 'It [The Dangerous Dogs Act 1991] has the potential to lead to the public thinking that only those four are dangerous and that any other dog is safe.

'So there becomes this perception that any other type of dog is friendly which then leads to situations where people engage in high-risk behaviour without realising that any dog, if they feel stressed or frightened, has the potential to be aggressive.

'We have long been calling for a complete reform of dog control laws and strongly believe we need a different approach to keeping the public safe and the welfare of dogs protected. 

'Any dog has the potential to bite and so we want to see effective breed neutral legislation and enforcement which focuses on early intervention so that incidents can be prevented from occuring or escalating, but they must be evidence-based and proportionate.'

Dr Tulloch is also wary of the perceived influence of the Dangerous Dogs Act. He told MailOnline how continuous debate around which dogs should be banned, or unbanned, was counter-intuitive.

'If we ban a swathe of new breeds, all that would happen is that those training dogs to be more aggressive would just move to the next breed of dog. 

'Look at other countries, the Staffy is banned in a lot of them. Here in the UK, it's a beloved family pet. 

'I think the debate on dangerous dog breeds is endless. I don't think we have any clear evidence that one breed is more dangerous than the other, as we don't fully understand the make-up of our dog population in this country.

'A lot of energy is spent talking about breeds and nothing is being done to clarify the situation.'

What is the Dangerous Dogs Act? Which dogs are banned? And why is it controversial? 

WHAT IS THE DANGEROUS DOGS ACT?

The Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 bans or restricts certain types of dogs and makes it an offence to allow a dog of any breed to be dangerously out of control.

It was introduced 30 years ago by Home Secretary Kenneth Baker 'to rid the country of the menace of these fighting dogs' after a string of attacks.

WHICH DOGS ARE BANNED IN THE UK?

It is illegal to own four breeds of dogs without an exemption from a court. They are:

The law also criminalises cross-breeds of the above four types of dog - meaning that whether a dog is prohibited will depend on a judgement about its physical characteristics and whether they match the description of a prohibited 'type'.

WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE'S A DOG ATTACK?

You can get an unlimited fine or be sent to prison for up to six months if your dog is dangerously out of control. 

You may not be allowed to own a dog in the future and your dog may be destroyed.

If you let your dog injure someone you can be sent to prison for up to five years or fined. If you deliberately use your dog to injure someone you could be charged with 'malicious wounding'.

And if you allow your dog to kill someone you can be sent to prison for up to 14 years or get an unlimited fine. 



WHY IS THE ACT CONTROVERSIAL? 



Both the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the British Veterinary Association have protested against the Act's focus on ""˜banned breeds' as it is failing to address the underlying causes of dog bites and aggressive behaviour.


They are calling on the Government to urgently revise the Act to make it fit for purpose.

Home-grown strawberries in M&S at Christmas? Unthinkable! Unless you're billionaire inventor James Dyson - with the help of a computer-controlled weather system, 20 robot fruit pickers, smartphone-powered mould zappers and a flotilla of drones

Standing in a muddy field in rural Lincolnshire, wind whipping my hair on one of the coldest days of the year, thoughts of sunshine, Wimbledon and garden parties couldn't be further from my mind.

Yet inside a futuristic-looking glass building in a corner of a sprawling farm, summer seems to be in full swing. The air is hot ""” a balmy 23c ""” and rays of what look like sunlight glow so brightly from illuminated ceiling beams, I wish I'd brought sunglasses.

It might be the season for turkeys and Brussels sprouts but at this farm everywhere you look is row upon row of strawberry plants ""” 750,000 of them ""” laden with plump, scarlet berries, ripening as if it were mid-June, not the depths of December.

These plants ""” and the 36,000-acre farmland on which they're growing ""” belong to James Dyson, inventor, business magnate and, with £23 billion to his name, the fifth-richest man in the country.

Dyson, 76, has owned this land for more than a decade but, in what started as 'very much an experiment', is achieving something that's never been done before: homegrown Christmas strawberries.

While it's long been possible to buy fruit out of season, Dyson's berries, available in selected M&S stores over the festive period, are a world-first: all-British and ""” he claims ""” just as sweet, succulent and flavoursome as if they'd been plucked on a summer's day.

Farming is a new(-ish) string to his bow: first bagless vacuum cleaners, bladeless fans, £500 hairdryers and now... strawberries? 'I like strawberries,' he says.

'We import so many, but frankly they're not very good; we can grow much better ones here. And then there are no air miles as we don't have to fly them in.'

Agriculture is a slightly unexpected departure for him, but he sees it as an 'extension' of the projects championed to date by Dyson Limited, the multi-billion-pound technology company he founded in 1991.

'It is all about machinery, mechanics and science, and experimenting and improving things, so it is sort of another engineering project ""” and it fits well with everything else we do,' says fruit farming's answer to Willy Wonka.

Certainly, this is the most hi-tech farm I've ever seen.

Drones, robots, self-steering tractors and a computer-controlled weather system ""” there's no room for human error, especially when it comes to Dyson's prized strawberries.

Inside the vast greenhouse, recently expanded to cover 26 acres, 20 robotic pickers trundle up and down rows of plants, automatically selecting the juiciest berries ""” sensors detect when they're the right size, shape, colour and texture ""” to put in punnets.

Rather than growing up from the ground, seeds are planted in more easily manageable pots at head-height, fixed to large hangers.

The ceiling is fitted with super-charged LED bulbs that glow pinky-orange on wintry days to make up for the lack of daylight.

Sliding doors separate the building into four 'seasons', each subtly distinct in terms of heat, light and humidity, to mimic 12 months of nature under one roof and ensure a steady supply of fruit.

There are two UV light machines, powered by smartphones, programmed to patrol the glasshouse at night, zapping mould and mildew from the leaves without the need for chemicals. 

And the eight-armed 'bug distributor', a whirring robot octopus that releases friendly insects onto leaves to kill fruit-eating aphids, could have come straight from a sci-fi film set.

The focus is as much on the process as the product.

While I tour his crop in mud-spattered boots, Dyson Zooms me ""” from his decidedly plusher, warmer-looking office in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, where the company ""” which moved operations to Singapore in 2019 ""” still has its HQ.

He insists that he's not averse to getting his hands dirty himself (not today, though).

'I grew up in Norfolk ""”that's how I got interested in farming. I worked on farms when I was a child, and lots of my friends are farmers,' he says.

'I topped and tailed Brussels sprouts, I picked blackberries, and possibly the strangest job I had was picking parsley and driving it to the Campbell's Soup factory in King's Lynn.

'You had to get it there in an hour before it wilted.'

Here, most of the hard graft ""” and the enviable job of chief strawberry-taster ""” is done by glasshouse manager Angel Angelov, who's been working with strawberries for 20 years.

He leads a team of up to 70 people carefully tending the plants (which will soon almost double in number to 1.25 million), and is in charge not only of daily tastings but also the computer system that controls the growing conditions.

There areUV light machines, powered by smartphones, programmed to patrol the glasshouse

The ceiling is fitted with super-charged LED bulbs that glow pinky-orange on wintry days

His 'office' is so vast ""” almost a kilometre from one side of the giant greenhouse to the other ""” that he uses an electric scooter to get around.

Angel eats strawberries for breakfast, lunch and dinner ""” and says he can 'never have too many'.

The perfect fruit, he tells me, not only tastes the part but looks it, too. 'You want it to be big, red and juicy, because customers are led by their eyes. The texture has to be right ""” soft but not squishy ""” and the flavour must be sweet with just the right amount of tartness.

'You want to look at the berry and say, 'Wow,' and then once you bite into it, say, 'Wow' again.'

The UK strawberry season is short, from June to August; the rest of the time 94 per cent of berries are imported, mostly from Spain, Greece and North Africa.

Other attempts to grow them year-round have been far less natural than the Dyson method and have included GM modification, hydroponics (using water instead of soil) and vertical farming, where plants are stacked in tower-like structures.

That's not the case here though, where the 1,452 rows of plants ""” around 62.5 million berries ""” are an established variety called Malling Centenary, a sweet, early-season berry originally from Kent, which Angel says have produced a particularly delicious, vibrant crop.

Each berry is astonishing in size; the size of a plum or small apple, but I can confirm that flavour is not compromised.

The taste is truly remarkable: fresh, luscious flesh with a nectar-like sweetness

Each berry is astonishing in size; the size of a plum or small apple, but I can confirm that flavour is not compromised

The taste is truly remarkable: fresh, luscious flesh with a nectar-like sweetness that makes me want to guzzle the entire punnet I'm meant to be filling. An operation like this is costly (though a mere drop in the ocean for its billionaire backer) and, with the machines and systems required to keep it all running, sounds like an environmental nightmare.

But that couldn't be further from the truth.

Dyson is proud of the fact that his farm is not only carbon neutral, but carbon negative ""” meaning rather than pumping greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, it actually removes more harmful substances than it emits.

Certain types of farming are notoriously bad for the planet and he's on a mission to change this, using strawberries as an example of a wholly circular, self-sufficient system.

At the heart of it is a huge ""” and distinctly whiffy ""” anaerobic digester that operates like a miniature power plant for the farm.

'We rot down crops to create gas, which then drives a generator and creates electricity,' Dyson explains. 'We put this into the National Grid ""” where it powers 10,000 homes ""” and use it in the greenhouse.

'But while 60 per cent of what the generator creates is electricity, 40 per cent is heat.

'So we use this heat to dry grain [the farm produces many other crops including wheat, peas and potatoes], and also to heat the greenhouse where we grow the strawberries.'

That means the heat and electricity needed for berry production is almost entirely free.

And nothing at Dyson Farming is squandered.

Dyson is proud of the fact that his farm is not only carbon neutral, but carbon negative

Berry production started here in 2020, with the first crop available in spring 2021, but this is the first time they've been sold at Christmas

The liquid waste from the digester goes back onto the land as fertiliser. Rain falling on the roof of the glasshouse is collected in a lagoon and used to water the plants. The only thing pumped in artificially is carbon dioxide, fed through pipes to stimulate photosynthesis, sweeten the berries and increase the size of the leaves.

Once picked and packed, the strawberries are quality-checked and transported to a nearby distribution centre, which can get them to customers as far afield as Glasgow and Cornwall within 24 hours. They sell for £2.90 a punnet at selected M&S stores and farm shops.

'It's important to us that the strawberries we picked yesterday are on the shelves today,' explains the farm's managing director, Daniel Cross. 'This maximises flavour, freshness and quality.'

Berry production started here in 2020, with the first crop available in spring 2021, but this is the first time they've been sold at Christmas.

Eventually, the aim is to produce them for much of the year, with the notable exception of summer, when Dyson Farming leaves the traditionalists to do their thing.

'The point is to produce the berries outside the natural season, so we tend to focus on other projects then,' says Daniel.

Like all good inventors, James Dyson is always looking to the next breakthrough. He's tight-lipped about a sealed-off research area on the farm, devoted to 'secret' projects ""” among them, growing crops for use in Dyson products.

'I can't tell you what they are or what they will be, but there will be a day when we do that,' he says, mysteriously.

Engineers, scientists and inventors are working hand-in-hand with farmers, growers and entrepreneurs ""” a fusion of 'agri-tech' that Dyson says is 'really exciting'.

His grand vision is for Britain to become wholly self-sufficient in food. 'We have some of the best farmland in the world.

'We can grow wheat, barley, oilseed rape, potatoes and plenty of other things,' he says.

'By recreating the tropical conditions you need to grow fruit and veg you can't normally grow here, we really would have all the things we need.'

A vocal Brexiteer, he laments the lack of decent subsidies for UK farmers, as well as supermarkets' reliance on cheap, foreign-grown produce.

'We need a government that really believes in growing things here, rather than importing food ""” and supermarkets who buy British rather than just trying to cut their costs.

'There are 250,000 farmers in England and four [main] supermarkets. So they have a lot of people to play off against each other.

'If farmers could sell more directly to customers, as we do in my main business, they would be much better off.'

Easy for this uber-rich landowner to say, perhaps, but there's a sense that Dyson really cares about the plight of farmers, especially so now that he has ""” in a sense ""” joined their ranks.

And, deep down, this is a man who really, really loves his strawberries. 'I make a real pig of myself when I go to the farm,' he says. 'They are very tasty indeed.'

Having tried them for myself, I can't help but agree: the ultimate, unexpected ingredient for a berry merry Christmas.

Apple claims it will use 100% recycled cobalt pulled from old devices in its iPhone and Mac batteries by 2025 ""” after being accused of using child labor to mine rare mineral in Africa

Apple announced plans Thursday to design batteries using entirely recycled cobalt by 2025, claiming the move is part of its effort to go carbon neutral by 2030.

Cobalt is the chemical element found in almost every tech gadget that uses a lithium-powered battery - a smartphone, tablet or laptop requires a few grams of it, whereas an electric vehicle requires 22 pounds.  

And more than 70 percent of the world's cobalt is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

Apple said it will use 100 percent  cobalt in all its in-house-designed batteries, which CEO Tim Cook said is because 'great technology should be great for our users and for the environment.'

But the move comes after huge criticism about Apple's mining practices, which have been accused of fueling slavery and using child labor, claims lawsuits filed by an advocate group on behalf of Congolese families.

Apple announced it will use 100 percent recycled cobalt in its batteries by 2025. The tech giant has long sourced the mineral from the Democratic Republic of Congo, which uses child workers. Above, a child carries a sack of rocks in Kapata, southwest of Kolwezi



Social issues are not the only problems with cobalt - the process pollutes air, water and soil, causing crops for food to become contaminated.

Apple said it 'has significantly expanded the use of certified recycled cobalt over the past three years, making it possible to include in all Apple-designed batteries by 2025.'

This was achieved using an iPhone disassembly robot that separates batteries from other components, allowing specialty recyclers to recover cobalt and other materials, including lithium.

Apple claims it has extracted 24,250 cobalt since 2019 and should have enough to use in all devices by 2025 - but it has been a slow process to get to this point.

This is mainly done by Apple's trade-in program that entices consumers to hand over their old devices for new ones. 

The program's small print states that if phones are 'in good shape' will go to a new owner.'

It is not clear what happens to damaged goods

The program is a way to offset the cost of purchasing a new iPhone, which the tech giant states is then recycled - but not all models get a second chance at life. 

Cobalt mines in DRC supply Apple, Google, Microsoft and Tesla with materials needed for their products, according to child labor lawsuits filed against the companies.

The rare mineral, however, is a key component in all of Apple's products - iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and MacBooks.

Cobalt is the chemical element found in almost every tech gadget that uses a lithium-powered battery

In a 2016 report, Amnesty International and African Resources Watch (Afrewatch) accused Apple, Samsung and Sony of lax oversight of their cobalt supplies from mines in the DRC. 

The report claimed that children as young as 12 years old were working underground digging up the metal in the mine.

The researchers claimed to have identified 16 multinational consumer electronics companies that are clients of Asian battery manufacturers that acquire cobalt from the Chinese firm.

A year later, Apple announced it would stop buying cobalt mined by hand in Congo while the mines continued to deal with problems with child labor and harsh work conditions.

This was at the same time when it was revealed that 40,000 children work daily in the mines, according to a report from Tom Lantos, human rights commission with the US Congress.

However, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2018 that Apple sourced its cobalt from a supply chain that owned a mine named Mutoshi in Kolwezi.

While the tech giant was not directly purchasing materials from the mines, they were bought from suppliers that owned the mines, The Wall Street Journal reported in 2018.

And in 2019, Apple was among the names listed in a lawsuit accusing tech giants of exploiting child labor to collect the mineral.

More than one dozen African families sued Apple, claiming their children either died or were severely injured while mining cobalt to be sold to the tech giants.

The lawsuit was filed in Washington DC on behalf of five children who were killed and 11 who were injured working in the mines.

Images released in January share more heartbreaking scenes from the mines. Here a woman carries her infant as she mines for cobalt in the hills several kilometers northwest of the town of Kambove

They were all aged between 13 and 17 when the incidents occurred.

One boy, 16, lost his leg after being hit by a truck while transporting cobalt on the back of his motorcycle in July 2019. 

Another boy, 17, had both his legs crushed in a tunnel collapse while mining. 

Recently, a new series of images taken by Siddharth Kara, an adjunct lecturer at Harvard Kennedy School of Goverment, from inside mines in the DRC may combat Apple's claims that its goods are ethically sourced and sold. 

Apple, Microsoft, Google, Tesla and others all insist that they hold cobalt suppliers to the highest of standards and only trade with smelters and refiners who adhere to their codes of conduct.

But photos and videos that DailyMail.com shared on January 30 from some of the largest mines in Africa tell a different story.

The heartbreaking scenes show barefoot children covered in chemicals as they carry heavy bags over their shoulders across rocky terrain for just $2 a day.

Exhausted mothers with their babies strapped to their sides are seen sifting through nets of rock, frantically searching for the precious cobalt. 

And pits are filled with humans standing on top of each other, also hoping to find the rare earth mineral. 

Those are among the powerful images obtained by Kara over the last several years in the Katanga region, which were shared before his new book's publication in February - Cobalt Red: How the Blood of the Congo Powers Our Lives.

Speaking to DailyMail.com before its release, Kara, an adjunct lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, said his research proves that the confident assurances of big tech can't be trusted.

'There are hundreds of thousands of the poorest people on the planet [mining for cobalt].

'The moral clock has been dialed back to colonial times.

'They're doing it for $2-a-day and for them, it's the difference between whether or not they eat that day so they don't have the option of saying no.'

Adult miners dig up to 600 feet below the surface using basic tools, without protective clothing or modern machinery. 

Sometimes the children are sent down into the narrow makeshift chambers where there is constant danger of collapse. 

Prolonged exposure to cobalt can lead to lung disease, deafness and, according to Kara, who has spent years in the Congo researching the subject, birth defects and various forms of cancer.

'This is blood diamonds multiplied by a thousand - diamonds aren't toxic.

'And you buy a diamond once, maybe twice, in your life, whereas Western society can't function for more than 24 hours without devices that rely on cobalt,' he said.

Among his videos is one of two children, covered in toxic chemicals from the mine, smashing their rocks open.

They cannot be older than seven or eight.

Feeling stressed? Some sheep will calm ewe... Study finds interacting with the fluffy farm animals helps improve your mental health and acts as a pre-exam tonic for nervous university students

It's a sight usually confined to the countryside - flocks of sheep contentedly grazing on vast expanses of field.

But introducing them to city centres and university campuses could help reduce stress among urbanites, researchers say.

For the past two years, around 25 sheep were allowed to nibble on lawns at central campus locations at the University of California.

And scientists have discovered they are doing much more than simply mowing, fertilising and improving the ecosystem.

The four breeds of sheep - Suffolk, Hampshire, Southdown and Dorset - first took on the role in 2021, during the Covid pandemic.

Researchers say that sheep can help reduce stress among urbanites

They are fenced in, given access to clean water and taken back and forth to their home barns in the morning and at night by trailer. 

Researchers surveyed around 200 students and staff and found that those who had walked past the sheep or studied near them had a ""˜significantly lower likelihood of being stressed'- compared with people who didn't come across the livestock at all.

Encountering the animals helped improve people's mental health, they found, and even proved to be a pre-exam calming tonic.

Lead author Haven Kiers, an assistant professor of landscape architecture and director of the ""˜sheep mowers' project, said: ""˜This started out as an experiment to test their mowing abilities, and we have now published research on how they make people feel peaceful.' And Mina Bedogne, a research assistant, explained: ""˜Just taking a break from a chaotic workday and mindlessly observing the flock has brought joy to so many people.'

The team said their findings, published in The International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, were important when students of all ages have said that they struggle with stress and mental health.

A spokesman for UK trade body the National Sheep Association said there was ""˜no doubt' introducing sheep to urban areas would benefit individuals. But they warned of the risk from dog-worrying, stressing the move would only be possible if the health and welfare of the sheep could be guaranteed.

The country boys were left in a spin during Sunday's episode of  Farmer Wants a Wife and 10 gorgeous intruders turned up looking for love. 

The farmers were tasked with taking two ladies each on a speed date to pick which of the hopefuls they connected with. 

Co-host Natalie Gruzlewski made the shock announcement to the stunned lads as the ladies filed in. 

'I've done a little bit of research, and I have hand-picked ladies that I would love you to meet,' she said. 

Five of the ten girls emerged victorious and have now joined the show, throwing established romances into chaos.

Ten intruders stirred the pot on Farmer Wants a Wife on Sunday night, with five of the women joining the show after a series of speed dates with the country boys

Farmer Andrew picked 37-year-old interior design director Sarah, while Farmer Brad bonded with Shelby and Farmer Brenton had a spark with Jemma.

Farmer David made a connection with 32-year-old disability support worker Alyssa while Farmer Matt picked Madelon.

Farmer Brad and 30-year-old boarding house supervisor Shelby's romantic boat ride ended with a kiss. 

'There is a spark there that could potentially grow into something. It's put my mind into bloody overdrive,' Brad said.

Farmer Brenton chose 21-year-old radiology assistant, Jemma (left) 

'Definitely attracted to Jemma. And she's obviously really good looking and so genuine and just so humble,' Farmer Brenton said after braving a game of truth or dare with 21-year-old radiology assistant, Jemma. 

Farmer Matt kept an open mind during his date with 22-year-old dressage rider, Madelon.

I definitely think I am surrendering to this opportunity that Nat's provided us,' he said. 

'I think love does take a bit of time and you don't want to put any walls up and not be open to the perfect person that could be.' 

Co-host Natalie Gruzlewski (pictured) made the shock announcement to the stunned lads as the ladies filed in. 'I've done a little bit of research, and I have hand-picked ladies that I would love you to meet,' she said

When the existing contestants saw their farmers arrive hand-in-hand with the new ladies at the country fair, jealousy flared.

While Andrew's lady Claire was confident about her connection with the farmer, the same could not be said about some of the ladies on other farms.

Morgan described Shelby as a 'smokin' blonde bombshell' and was worried how she would compete with her.

Frankie, who hadn't yet had a date with Brenton, reached a breaking point.

'Brenton is obviously really connected with Jemma on their date. To me, that says enough,' she said.

The farmers are pictured with co-host Sam Armytage 

'I'm not going to wait for a date that's probably not going to come. That's enough for him to show that he's not interested in me.'

Seven said in a statement that the new introductions may ruffle some feathers but it was done to help true love blossom on the show.

'Nat has searched the country to find two more potential partners for each farmer to meet. The farmers will spend time with each before inviting one of them to the farm. 

'These latecomers are not afraid of the connections the farmers have made with the existing partners. The road to love is never easy,' they said.

Rachel Reeves hinted at a tax raid on the wealthy to 'rebuild Britain' today as she was endorsed by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney.

The shadow chancellor hit out at the Tories for allowing the 'wealthiest to avoid taxes' and 'keeping loopholes open' as she delivered her Labour conference speech.

Although Ms Reeves did not elaborate, there have been hints at tightening up inheritance tax rules to raise more cash. It also wants to levy VAT on private schools. 

She also swiped at Rishi Sunak for using private planes and helicopters to travel, vowing to save billions by cracking down on government waste.

In an unusual step, Sir Mark - handpicked by George Osborne to run the BoE but later a strong Brexit critic - recorded a video praising Ms Reeves as a 'serious economist'. 

Chancellor Jeremy Hunt slammed Ms Reeves for failing to mention inflation in the speech - although she did refer to the cost of living.

He also pointed to Labour's suggestion that borrowing could rise further to fund more spending.

Rachel Reeves' speech at Labour conference: Key points 





In her Labour conference speech today, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: 



Ms Reeves urged the party to focus on the task of winning power at the election, saying she wanted to be the first female chancellor in UK history.

She warned that Labour cannot 'tax and spend' its way to growth, saying she wanted to 'tax fairly and spend wisely'.

The leadership has already ruled out significant tax rises, including the main rates of income tax and VAT. 

'I didn't come into politics to raise taxes on working people, indeed I want them to be lower,' she said.

'But the Tories have piled 25 tax rises on ordinary working people and businesses while allowing the wealthiest to avoid taxes, keeping loopholes open and letting government waste spiral. Taxpayers' money should be spent with the same care with which we spend our own money.'

Labour is believed to be looking at options including ending the inheritance tax exemption for agricultural land, and curbing reliefs on shares in unlisted businesses.

But the move could open a clear dividing line with the Tories amid speculation that Rishi Sunak will pledge to cut or even abolish inheritance tax in his election manifesto.

Labour is holding off announcing its proposals until much closer to a poll, amid fears that ministers would either steal or find ways of attacking them.

Sir Keir's plans for government are coming under increased scrutiny with polls consistently showing a double-digit lead for his party.

Ms Reeves said Labour would 'wage a war against fraud, waste and inefficiency', including a 'crackdown on Tory ministers' private jet habit'.

She said: 'What is Rishi Sunak so scared of up there in his private jet - meeting a voter? Well, we will properly enforce the Ministerial Code on the use of private planes and save millions of pounds for taxpayers in the process.'

Ms Reeves said Labour would seek to 'slash government consultancy spending', saying it has 'almost quadrupled in just six years', and introduce a Covid corruption commissioner helped by a 'hit squad'.

She said 'we want our money back', in an apparent echo of Baroness Thatcher, who won her four-year battle to reduce Britain's payments to the European Economic Community in 1980 after famously declaring 'I want my money back'.

Ms Reeves told activists in Liverpool that Labour would pull the economy out of the 'wreckage of Tory misrule' with a 'vision to rebuild Britain'.

She confirmed plans for reforms to the 'antiquated' planning system to make it quicker and easier to build the infrastructure needed for modern industries and clean energy networks.

Ms Reeves confirmed that her first Budget would crack down on private schools, making them pay VAT and business rates.

She told Mr Sunak to 'bring it on' if he wanted a fight on the issue at a time when children in state schools were being taught in temporary classrooms due to crumbling concrete.

Ms Reeves said: 'The choice at the next election is this: five more years of the Tory chaos and uncertainty which has left working people worse off or a changed Labour Party offering stability, investment and economic security so that working people are better off.

'It falls to us to show that Labour are ready to serve, ready to lead and ready to rebuild Britain.'

The shadow chancellor said Labour would act to prevent a repeat of the HS2 fiasco by creating a new cross-government unit to keep major infrastructure projects under control.

The cancellation of HS2 north of Birmingham by Mr Sunak presents a political headache for Labour, which has been under pressure from some of its senior figures to commit to the scheme.

Ms Reeves urged the party to focus on the task of winning power at the election, saying she wanted to be the first female chancellor in UK history

The IFS has estimated that inheritance tax revenues will surge far more than previously thought as a proportion of GDP 

'If I were in the Treasury, I would have been on the phone to the chief executive of HS2 non-stop,' she said, 'demanding answers, and solutions, on behalf of taxpayers, businesses and commuters.'

Daily Mail Comment

Former Bank of England governor Mark Carney has given Labour his seal of approval, hailing Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves as 'a serious economist'.

But is his support really anything to shout about?

The sleek Canadian began 'quantitative easing', a technical term for printing money, after the 2008 global crash.

By letting it go on for too long, he helped sow the seeds of the inflation spike now blighting families.

And having shamefully allowed the Bank to become an agent of Project Fear, his doom-laden Brexit predictions proved spectacularly wrong.

Then, last month Mr Carney mocked the Tories for having turned Britain into 'Argentina on the Channel' - ignoring the fact that our economy is outgunning France and Germany.

Given his track record, yesterday's endorsement of Ms Reeves looks more of a curse than a blessing.

The promised unit would be responsible for ensuring crucial national infrastructure projects are delivered on time and on budget and report directly to the prime minister and the chancellor.

'I will not tolerate taxpayers' money being treated with the disrespect we have seen over recent years,' she said.

'I will not turn a blind eye to dither, delay and incompetence. I will hold those responsible to account. '

Her plans would mean reinstating sign-off procedures on procuring consultants, with a target to reduce spending by half - or £1.4billion - over the next parliament.

Officials would be instructed to enforce the ministerial code's rules around private jets.

And the Covid corruption commissioner would examine contracts signed during the pandemic line by line to recover up to £2.6billion lost to fraud, waste and non-delivery.

In his video played in the hall, Sir Mark said: 'Rachel Reeves is a serious economist.

'She began her career at the Bank of England, so she understands the big picture.

'But crucially, she understands the economics of work, of place and family.

'And, look, it is beyond time we put her energy and ideas into action.'

Mr Hunt said: 'It is extraordinary that Rachel Reeves failed to mention inflation once when it is the biggest challenge facing the British economy.

'Instead, Reeves made it clear Labour will take 'up' borrowing by £28billion every year which is a fairytale for the British economy with no happy ending - just higher inflation, higher mortgages, higher debt and lower growth.

'Borrowing more doesn't solve problems, it creates them - the worst kind of short termism when instead we should be taking long-term decisions that will actually tackle inflation and unleash growth.'

A spokesman for Ms Reeves, who is a former Bank of England economist, said she was 'incredibly proud' to win Mr Carney's backing.

But he faced criticism for shattering the convention that former Bank governors should remain politically neutral. And senior Tories said the endorsement showed Labour would 'take us back to the past'.

Mr Carney, a former investment banker, has taken a string of lucrative jobs since leaving the Bank of England and is rumoured to be weighing up a political career in his native Canada.

Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said his backing was 'the endorsement no one wants'. He added: 'Mark Carney never accepted Brexit and is no doubt hoping Labour will reverse it and take us back to the past.'

Former Cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom said it showed Mr Carney was 'every bit as naive (and wrong) as when he promoted Project Fear in 2016'.

Former Business Secretary Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg added: 'The truth will out. A socialist governor of the Bank of England left us with runaway inflation and pretended to be impartial when he advocated extreme green views and campaigned for Remain. With such a track record, the Labour Party is more than welcome to him.'

Simon French, chief economist and head of research at investment bank Panmure Gordon, who previously worked in the Cabinet Office, said: 'I personally prefer my former Bank governors to be apolitical out of office - commensurate with the delicate political environment their former employer operates in. I don't think Carney endorsing Reeves fits that mould.'

One day last summer, Nigel Clayson, a 52-year-old farm manager from North Essex, noticed a small lump in his armpit. But it was no bigger than a pea and causing him no pain, so he did nothing about it, hoping it would disappear as suddenly as it had arrived. Unfortunately, it didn't.

'After three or four months, it had grown as big as a golf ball, so I went to the doctor,' says Nigel.

His GP initially suspected an infected lymph node ""” these are small bean-shaped pieces of tissue that make up part of the immune system, which are found, among other places, under the arms.

But when blood tests showed no obvious sign of infection, Nigel's GP referred him to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge for more thorough checks.

Nigel had a CT scan (which takes a series of X-rays to create a 3D picture) and a PET scan (where a mildly radio-active drug is injected into the bloodstream to show areas where cells are more active than normal ""” a potential sign of cancer).

Nigel Clayson, 52, (pictured) is a farm manager who has been treated for the blood cancer non Hodgkin's lymphoma which is associated with the weedkiller glyphosate

Regulations for the use of the weedkiller glyphosate vary around the world

'I was immediately told it was cancer,' he says. 'It turned out I had another three malignant lumps inside me ""” in my neck, right hip and near my spine, which I didn't even know about. It was non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a blood cancer.

'I was shocked rather than scared because I had absolutely no idea there was something so seriously wrong with me ""” I felt perfectly fit and healthy.'

At this point, Nigel could have been forgiven for cursing his luck and attributing his diagnosis to nothing more than the random nature of cancer. But then he discovered something troubling.

Two other local agricultural workers he knew through farming circles had recently been given exactly the same diagnosis.

One was a farm labourer who was just 23 when he became ill, the other a contractor in his 50s, employed to dispose of empty weedkiller cans used on farms. Both had been treated and, thankfully, were in remission.

But what all three men had in common was regular exposure to glyphosate, a potent weedkiller used in industrial quantities on Britain's farms, as well as by local councils and highway authorities to kill weeds in parks, playgrounds and roadside verges.

Glyphosate has also been available to amateur gardeners in garden centres across the UK, under the brand name Roundup.

'I have generally used glyphosate on the farm at least twice a year; first when I'm putting seed in the ground in September time and then again in the spring as a weedkiller,' says Nigel, who lives with his partner Jane, 57.

'We don't have much choice about whether to use glyphosate: anything else that works costs about 15 times more,' he says.

'I do now use protective clothing when I'm spraying it, but when I was younger I admit I might not have been as careful.'

Richard Tyler, pictured with his wife Kelly and daughter Mia, is convinced that exposure to glyphosate was the cause of his mantle cell lymphoma, a rare form of blood cancer he was diagnosed with 18 months ago

Of course, there's no conclusive proof that the weedkiller was to blame for any of the cancer cases. But in 2015, following a review of around 1,000 research studies, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) ""” which assesses the likely cancer risk of everything from working nights to using mobile phones ""” declared glyphosate was 'probably carcinogenic to humans', with a 'probable risk' of causing cancer, particularly blood cancers [such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma] by 'causing DNA and chromosomal damage in cells'.

Now, a series of new studies have raised further concerns about the weedkiller's safety.

Last month, researchers at En Chu Kong Hospital in Taiwan published findings in the journal Environmental Science and Pollution Research International showing exposure to glyphosate damages red blood cells ""” causing anaemia, a condition that leads to fatigue, rapid heart rate and dizziness. A separate report, meanwhile, revealed that, once the weedkiller has got into the body, it can cause vascular toxicity ""” i.e. damage to blood vessels, especially those around the heart.

Experts at East China University of Science and Technology, writing in the journal Chemical Research in Toxicology, warned: 'These findings highlight the need for concern about the cardiovascular risk in occupations which are exposed to glyphosate.'

Female fertility may also be at risk, according to animal research by the Community University of Chapeco Region in Brazil.

Scientists studied rats exposed to varying levels of Roundup every day for 28 days and found it disrupted the balance of fertility-related hormones and had a potentially damaging effect on the ovaries, to the point where it could affect the chances of conceiving. But because, as part of the test, the rats had increasingly large doses of glyphosate added to their drinking water, this meant they were exposed to much higher levels than humans would be from using weedkiller.

What the men had in common was regular exposure to glyphosate, a potent weedkiller used in industrial quantities on Britain's farms, as well as by local councils and highway authorities to kill weeds in parks, playgrounds and roadside verges

The use of glyphosate is, however, now restricted in a wide range of countries ""” including France, Germany, Portugal and Spain (see box, right) ""” although it remains on sale in the UK.

A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs told Good Health: 'The approval of glyphosate is subject to regular review and we continue to keep an active watch on the science.

'Strict regulation only permits the sale and use [of pesticides and herbicides] where scientific assessment shows they will not harm people or pose unacceptable risks to the environment.' Glyphosate was developed in the 1970s by the U.S. chemical giant Monsanto as a uniquely deadly solution to weeds.

The company then developed genetically modified crops that could resist glyphosate's capacity to destroy their cell structure.

This meant that fields could be cleared of weeds while crops were left standing.

In 2018, Monsanto sold its glyphosate business to the German chemicals giant Bayer. Such is the demand for ever higher crop yields, the deal was still worthwhile to Bayer, even though in June 2020 it agreed to pay out a record-breaking £8 billion to settle lawsuits from more than 100,000 Americans ""” mainly amateur gardeners, who believe their non-Hodgkin lymphoma or other forms of blood cancer stem from Roundup use.

Bayer denied any wrongdoing, with the CEO saying the settlement was to 'bring a long period of uncertainty to an end'. A Bayer spokesman told Good Health: 'Glyphosate-based products have been used safely and successfully for more than 40 years.'

It is, however, one of the largest single payouts of its kind, with a further 30,000 U.S. claims still going through the legal process.

There are around 60 types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer of the white blood cells which form a vital part of the immune system.

The cancer leads to excessive production of white blood cells, causing them to clump into lumps. Although around seven out of ten people diagnosed with blood cancers are alive five years later, 16,000 a year in the UK die as a result.

The number of blood cancer cases is rising with around 14,200 new non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases a year, up 38 per cent since the early 1990s, according to Cancer Research UK. It says the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is 26 per cent higher in people who have ever worked as a 'field crop/vegetable farm worker' and 19 per cent higher in those who have worked as a general farm worker.

However, the charity also says that using glyphosate at low levels does not increase the risk of cancer: 'This includes using it as a weedkiller in the garden.'

But not all experts agree. Michael Antoniou, a molecular geneticist at King's College London, believes glyphosate is dangerous ""” even at very low levels of exposure.

'There are many ways by which it causes damage,' he told Good Health. 'It disrupts and attacks the functioning of multiple mechanisms and causes DNA damage, which is the major known risk factor for cancer.

'Studies from around the world have shown that glyphosate can cause adverse effects at very low levels of long-term exposure.

One day last summer, Mr Clayson noticed a small lump in his armpit. His GP initially suspected an infected lymph node

'If there's one thing that the world is facing that's worse than the Covid pandemic, it's the cancer pandemic. One in two people will develop it sometime during their lives and we ought to be looking at toxins like this.'

He adds: 'The regulators that claim glyphosate is safe have got it all wrong. They should be taking into account the latest evidence from independent academic groups, such as ours. When they do, they'll find their recommended safe levels are way out. We don't even know what a safe level is.'

Gemma Trout, a support nurse at the charity Blood Cancer UK, says that for a number of years there has been concern about a 'potential link between glyphosate and an increased risk of lymphoma' ""” 'people who want to take a precautionary approach should avoid using it'.

The controversy deepened last month with newly published government figures on increased glyphosate use in Britain, highlighted by the charity Pesticide Action Network. These show that annual use of the product has risen from 2.2 million kilos in 2016 to 2.6 million kilos in 2020. There has also been a 9 per cent increase in the area of UK land treated with glyphosate ""” from 2,646,836 hectares in 2016 to 2,876,906 hectares in 2020.

Josie Cohen, a spokeswoman for Pesticide Action Network, said around 50 local councils have banned glyphosate use on public land and a further 40 are in the process of cutting down, though many more continue to use it.

'The links between glyphosate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma are clear,' she argues, 'and yet we continue to use this chemical in ever-increasing amounts in farming as well as in most of our towns and cities, where it not only poses a potential risk to human health but also to water quality and wildlife.

'It's time the Government made good on its promises to help farmers and other land managers transition to safer and more sustainable non-chemical alternatives, and introduced a strong package of support for them,' she says.

Nigel says glyphosate is regularly used to ripen wheat artificially, killing and drying it off so it can be efficiently harvested. 'I have never done that because I'm happy to wait for the sun to do its work, but I know they do it on huge estates of 12,000 acres where they want to get the contractors in to harvest everything in one go,' says Nigel, who now manages a 1,200-acre arable farm at Takeley, near Stansted, Essex, but has managed similar farms in East Anglia for more than 20 years.

David Exwood, vice-president of the National Farmers' Union, defended glyphosate's use.

He told Good Health glyphosate was 'an essential product to control weeds before planting', and a 'vital component' of modern crop-growing practices.

'Farmers and growers will continue to use glyphosate as long as it is legal to do so to ensure environmental sustainability and a secure supply of high-quality and affordable food,' he says.

Nigel's partner Jane, who has lived on and around farms all her life and has observed how glyphosate continues to be used liberally, says: 'They call it sunshine in a can. Farms are meant to wait seven days between spraying with glyphosate and harvesting the wheat but no one checks and lots of farms don't bother.'

Pesticide Action Network claims glyphosate is found as a residue on 'many' of the food products we eat ""” a 2015 review of studies for the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Germany concluded that glyphosate has regularly been found in human urine samples and that may be related to people's diets and their occupations (levels were higher for the latter), but it concluded that levels were of 'no health concern'.

Here, the Health and Safety Executive says eating foods that have a residue level within the strict limits that it sets for food crops will 'not cause harm to consumers'. It adds: 'If a food has a higher level of residue than the maximum, it does not automatically mean it's not safe to eat.'

Furthermore, last month, the European Food Safety Authority said its investigations had found 'no critical areas of concern' for health from the use of glyphosate in agriculture.

Yet glyphosate is being withdrawn from products sold to amateur gardeners throughout the U.S., while Evergreen Garden Care, the UK company that sells it to consumers, promotes a glyphosate-free version of Roundup in garden centres. 'Most garden centres take both products, but some have opted to only stock glyphosate-free products in a movement towards exiting glyphosate,' a spokesman told Good Health.

Indeed Tesco, Morrisons, Waitrose and the Co-op have stopped selling it. Garden centres are following suit. Notcutts, which runs a chain in southern England, told Good Health: 'We removed all products containing glyphosate at the end of December 2022.'

Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), said it 'is concerned about the potential unintended effects of pesticides and herbicides on humans, animals and plant life.

'The RHS does not encourage the use of weedkillers, including glyphosate, and recommends that wherever possible alternative control methods are used.'

Richard Tyler, 52, a former actor from Surbiton, Surrey, is convinced that exposure to glyphosate was the cause of his mantle cell lymphoma, a rare form of blood cancer he was diagnosed with 18 months ago.

'Roundup is the only weedkiller I've used since I moved to this house with my wife and daughter six years ago,' he says.

'I stopped using it when I became unwell ""” not because I knew at that stage there was a risk attached to it, but because I was too ill to do anything in the garden,' says Richard, who is currently in remission after a course of chemotherapy.

'Who knows how much glyphosate I've been exposed to, but I definitely think there is a link between it and my cancer.

'When I was growing up in Buckinghamshire, the biggest enthusiasm in my dad's life was his garden. If any weed dared to appear he would be out there with his Roundup pump. He was a serious user.'

Richard's cancer diagnosis followed months of recurrent urinary tract infections, gut issues and bloating. He also had night sweats and lost a lot of weight.

'I just thought I was at last suddenly getting a perfect body in middle age but it turned out to be this,' says Richard.

'We are all exposed to glyphosate at many levels, but we don't know it. I have only known about the risk for the past 18 months because of living with this rare lymphoma.'

Nigel was told his lymphoma was progressing slowly enough for him to wait until the end of the harvest last summer to start chemotherapy and he had the treatment between November and April.

Now in remission, Nigel is due a check-up next April. He is trying to put it out of his mind: 'I can't panic, this is my work,' he says.

'I use about 15 different chemicals on the fields. What happens next is completely out of my hands.

'My cancer specialist said he didn't think the cancer was linked to glyphosate. There were two 17- and 18-year-old girls with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the waiting room and he said they wouldn't have been exposed to it at all, though my argument is that if they had come from the middle of London, where all the parks are sprayed with it, then they would definitely have. On farms we have to put signs out if there is a footpath going across the field, saying that the field has been sprayed with a pesticide, but we don't have to say which one it is.

'Local authorities don't have to do that and they're using glyphosate around every lamp-post and close to where people walk.'

Despite the multi-billion-pound compensation payout in the U.S., Bayer maintains its stance on the safety of its product, telling Good Health: 'To further reduce future litigation risk in the U.S., we are replacing our glyphosate products in the U.S. residential market with new formulations that have alternative active ingredients.

'We are taking this action exclusively to help manage litigation risk in the U.S. and not because of any safety concerns. Glyphosate-based products have been used safely and successfully for more than 40 years.

'Leading health regulators around the world continue to conclude that glyphosate-based products are safe when used as directed.'

Arkansas becomes first state to force out Chinese company: Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders orders seed company to sell off 160 acres amid security concerns

Arkansas has become the first state to force out a Chinese-owned company with a seed producer being ordered to sell off its land amid national security concerns. 

Chinese-owned subsidiary Syngenta has been ordered to relinquish 160 acres of farmland in Craighead County, Arkansas, within two years.

The order is the first of its kind under state legislation passed earlier this year, which forbids certain foreign countries from acquiring or holding land.

Syngenta, which is ultimately owned by government-run ChemChina, owns Northrup King Seed Co. that operates in the state. China is among the prohibited parties as it is subject to U.S. arms export controls known as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. 

'This is about where your loyalties lie,' Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, Reuters reported.

Chinese-owned seed producer Syngenta has been ordered to divest from 160 acres of farmland in Arkansas in order to comply with new legislation that forbids some foreign countries from owning land

The site in Craighead County has been owned by Northrup King Seed Co. a subsidiary of Syngenta and ChemChina, for 35 years

The governor said that countries potentially hostile to the US could utilize knowledge of American farming practices to their advantage.

'Seeds are technology,' she added. 'Chinese-owned state corps filter that technology back to their homeland, stealing American research and telling our enemies how to target American farms.' 

Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin also revealed the company had missed a June deadline to disclose the foreign ownership, meaning he would be imposing the the maximum $280,000 fine.

The company will have 30 days to pay the penalty and could face further action if it refuses. 

Griffin called the decision 'smart and strategic' and said if the company fails to adhere to the order, the state could look at removing their ownership though the courts. 

Agriculture is the state's biggest industry and the area is a major exporter of rice, soybeans, cotton, poultry and feed grains.

The company will also be fined $280,000 for not disclosing its foreign ownership in a prompt manner 

Huckabee Sanders signed Act 636 earlier this year, banning foreign entities from owning agricultural lands. 

Syngenta has owned the site at Craighead Country for the last 35 years. 

The company has stressed that China has never dictated which areas of farmland it should buy or lease or any of its actions.

'The order for Syngenta to divest itself of 160 acres of agricultural land in Craighead County, which the company has owned since 1988, is a shortsighted action that fails to account for the effects of such an action, intended or not, on the U.S. agricultural market,' spokesman Saswato Das told Reuters.

'Our people in Arkansas are Americans led by Americans who care deeply about serving Arkansas farmers.'

Arkansas is not the first state to ban foreign ownership of farmland. Montana bans the sale of land near military bases to six countries, including China. 

A further 23 other states, including Florida, Tennessee and Virginia have laws banning or restricting foreign ownership and investments in farmland.

Killer robot fears in South Korea as cops say worker was crushed to death by vegetable-packing machine because its sensors detected the box he was carrying

A vegetable-packing machine crushed a worker to death in South Korea because its sensors detected the box he was carrying, police said, in a case that has added to already mounting fears surrounding the dangers of killer robots.

The victim, a robotics company worker in his 40s, had moved near the robot with a box in his hands during his shift on Tuesday when he was slammed against the conveyor belt by the machine's robotic arms. 

The man died of head and chest injuries after he was snatched by the robot's arms and crushed at a vegetable distribution centre in the southern county of Goseong, police said. 

Police said early evidence suggests that human error was more likely to blame for the man's death as the robot's sensor's, which are designed to identify boxes, had detected the box the victim was carrying before it crushed him to death. 

But the worker's death has heightened fears surrounding the dangers of industrial robots and the false sense of security they may give to people working nearby in a country that increasingly relies on such machines to automate its industries.

This photo provided by the South Korea Gyeongsangnam-do Fire Department shows the interior of a vegetable packaging plant after a robot's deadly crush with a worker was reported, in Goseong, South Korea, on Wednesday 

The victim, who died from his injuries in hospital, has not yet been identified but police said he was an employee of a company that installs industrial robots and was sent to the plant to examine whether the machine was working properly.

His death follows a series of accidents involving robots in factories in South Korea in recent years. 

In March, a manufacturing robot crushed and seriously injured a worker in his 50s who was examining it at an auto parts factory in Gunsan. Last year, a robot installed near a conveyor belt fatally crushed a worker at a milk factory in Pyeongtaek. 

The killer robot that crushed the worker to death on Tuesday was one of two pick-and-place machines used at the facility, which packages bell peppers and other vegetables exported to other Asian countries, police said.

Such machines are common in South Korea's agricultural communities, which are struggling with a declining and aging workforce. 

'It wasn't an advanced, artificial intelligence-powered robot, but a machine that simply picks up boxes and puts them on pallets,' said Kang Jin-gi, who heads the investigations department at Gosong Police Station. 

He said police were working with related agencies to determine whether the machine had technical defects or safety issues. 

The robot's sensors are designed to identify boxes, and security video indicated the man had moved near the robot with a box in his hands which likely triggered the machine's reaction, the official said. 

'It's clearly not a case where a robot confused a human with a box - this wasn't a very sophisticated machine,' he said.

Meanwhile, an official from the Donggoseong Export Agricultural Complex, which owns the plant, called for a 'precise and safe' system to be established in a statement after the incident.

The victim had reportedly filled in to conduct tests originally planned for November 6. 

They were pushed back two days due to reported problems with the robot's sensor. 

According to data from the International Federation of Robotics, South Korea had 1,000 industrial robots per 10,000 employees in 2021, the highest density in the world and more than three times the number in China that year. 

Many of South Korea's industrial robots are used in major manufacturing plants such as electronics and auto-making.

Remember watching 'The Jetsons' and wishing you had your own Rosey, the robotic maid? 

She did the cooking, the cleaning and everything else for George, Jane, Judy, Elroy and their dog, Astro.

The idea of robot companions doing the mundane parts of life for us for a long time seemed fantastical - but not anymore. 

Today robots build our cars, sort our packages, and organize warehouses, but unless you work in one of those industries, you probably rarely interact with one.

That could all change soon. A new frontier of humanoids are set to be rolled out in dozens of industries - from policing and security to healthcare and hospitality.

And personal bots that do the vacuum cleaning, mow the lawn, cook meals and take out the trash are also on the horizon.

Atlas is a robot developed by the American robotics Boston Dynamics. It is designed to aid emergency services in search and rescue operations and function in environments where humans can't survive, like fires and warzones

To the rescue

Atlas can lift heavy weights, run, open doors, backflip, jump and even do parkour. 

It's designed to aid emergency services in search and rescue operations and function in environments where humans can't survive, like fires and warzones.

Made by the Massachusetts firm Boston Dynamics', the scary six-foot-tall bipedal humanoid bot has 'hands' consisting of just two fingers - one fixed into place and the other adjustable, but the new footage shows this is enough to keep a firm grip on objects.

Holey Moley

Moley is a kitchen bot chef that can learn to cook your favorite meals. It mimics the movements of human hands and can do delicate tasks like cracking an egg. 

The robotic chef works by users choosing a certain number of portions, type of cuisine, dietary restrictions, calorie count, ingredients, cooking method, chef, from the recipe library first.

Once users have selected their preferences, then they choose a recipe and place washed and cut ingredients, which can be ordered through Moley, in designated areas.

Then simply tap the 'start' button and the cooking process begins - the robot also cleans up after the meal has been prepared. That's the dream.

The kitchen is also completely operated by its touch screen or remotely via smartphone or tablet.

The only downside? The last widely reported price for the kitchen help is $335,000.

For the kids

Miko is a $300 bot that recognizes kids' emotions, plays games, teaches them new things and remembers what they say and how they feel. 

It has a wide-angle HD camera and sensors to map out your space. 

Worried about security? Miko says all data is end-to-end encrypted.

This bot's got moxie

Moxi was big at the pandemic's start, delivering medication, PPE, patient comforts and other supplies. 

It can open elevator doors, but it needs to ask a human to press the button for its floor. Pretty cute for a robot.

Microscopic doctors

Antibacterial nanorobots are tiny self-propelled bots that deliver medication right to the infection. 

They do this by mimicking a bacteria and its target, then trapping it in nanowire mesh. Truly incredible stuff.

A robotic lover

RealDoll X is a handmade, customizable doll made for adults only. The head is AI-drive and can move, speak, blink and form expressions. 

Through an app, users can customize their doll's personality. Choose its hair, makeup and lots more, but don't expect a cheap price tag. They cost about $6,000.

The 'Robear' has a cub-like face but packs enough strength to transfer patients from a wheelchair (pictured) or a floor-level bed to a bath, for example. It weighs 309lb (140kg) with extending legs that stop the 'bear' from falling over and it moves slowly and smoothly thanks to advance actuators in its mechanical arms

Keeping crops happy

BugVacuum is a self-propelled vacuum cleaner that sucks up insects while autonomously navigating between crops on farms.

Farmers only have to get it to the starting point and set it to auto mode. The bot is ideal for clearing out insecticide-resistant pests.

Seriously sweet

Robear is a back-saving teddy bear-shaped robot that lifts disabled or older patients from their beds into a wheelchair. 

Its soft, cushioned body is designed to be gentle on the patient's skin while providing maximum support.

Developed in Riken-SRK research center in Nagoya, Japan, it uses mechanical arms to transfer patients from a wheelchair or a floor-level bed to a bath, for example. 

It weighs 309lb (140kg) and has extending legs that stop the 'bear' from falling over. 

Piaggio Fast Forward CEO Greg Lynn (center) is followed by his company's Gita carrier robot as he crosses a street in Boston. The two-wheeled machine is carrying a backpack and uses cameras and sensors to track its owner

Your personal pack mule

Gita Bot is a rolling robot that follows you around, carrying up to 40 pounds of whatever you need ""” groceries, luggage, tools, you name it.

The name 'Gita' is inspired by the Italian word 'giro,' which means 'turn' or 'round trip.'

Made by Piaggio - the Italian company that makes the Vespa scooter - it was the first cargo-carrying robot marketed directly to consumers.

Piaggio claims the robot offers a stylish alternative to those blandly utilitarian machines - albeit one that weighs 50 pounds (23 kilograms) and costs $3,250 (£2,500).

The two-wheeled machine uses cameras and sensors to track its owner.

Forget Chrismas pudding, it's retro desserts like Baked Alaska that are set to grace dinner tables this festive season, due to the cost of living crisis and shows like Daisy Jones and the Six making people nostalgic.

Old school puddings including crÃ¨me brulee, rice pudding and tiramisu are also increasingly popular with customers around the UK, who are turning to comfort food in an uncertain world - with Asda recording a leap in sales of traditional favourites. 

Jonathan Moore, Asda's Senior Director of Food Trends said: 'There is still a strong sense of comfort when it comes to nostalgia especially at Christmas time. When times are tough, we find reassurance in harking back to our 'inner child' and those childhood favourite foods that once comforted us.' 

It comes as the retailer unveiled its trend book, outlining key themes that will guide food and drink product development for the next 18 months, with climate concerns influencing the rise of innovations such as dehydrated oat milk. 

Asda revealed 70s products are set to be very popular this festive season as the cost of living crisis and shows like Daisy Jones and the Six are making people nostalgic

1. Pressure on purse-strings sees shoppers looking to elevate everyday heroes 

The report suggests that 'Sandwiches 2.0', 'Not-So-Humble-Veg' and 'Things On Toast' are all key trends that will dominate the coming 18 months as customers use purse-friendly ingredients as the base of their gourmet creations.

Confirming this prediction, Asda has seen a 12 per cent uplift in sales of potatoes in the past year as consumers turn to TikTok, which has more than 10 billion views for #Potato, for inspiration on how to get creative with the household staple.

2. In a less-stable world, people are looking to food for distraction.

As shoppers look to food for moments of joy in their lives, in a way that doesn't break the bank, Asda expects to see a number of trends rise in popularity over the coming months. 

The 'Flavour Bomb' trend will see experimental condiments and sauces - think coffee siracha or fruity chipotle - elevate simple dishes, giving them a powerhouse of flavour time and time again. 

'Stick It' predicts the rise of making food handheld. Seemingly un-holdable dishes like pasta will become a more interactive snack and croissants, waffles and even slices of cheesecake will be drenched in syrups and sauces and served on a stick.

Asda's OMV! Vegan Strawberry Trifle will be popular this Christmas and it retails at £6.95 

The brands Extra Special Chocolate & Honeycomb Avalanche Dessert retails at £10 

Pigs in blankets are always a winner on Christmas day and the brand is selling them for just £1.35 

3. The rise of 70s and 80s inspired TV shows like Daisy Jones and the Six and Stranger Things sees the appreciation of retro translate into food with the resurgence of retro desserts.

Asda explains that old-school favourites such baked Alaska, crÃ¨me brulee, rice pudding and tiramisu are all set to grace dinner parties across the UK. The retailer has already started to see this trend in action with shoppers going mad for its recently launched retro ""˜school cake'. Tens of thousands of people shared their love for the cakes across social media and the excitement led to over 5,000 people searching for ""˜School Cakes' on Asda.com. 

4. As extreme weather events put food production at risk, consumers are demanding that producers look to more sustainable solutions. 

'New Staples' is a trend that Asda has pinpointed as an increasingly prevalent movement thanks to consumers growing understanding of the true impact grocery staples have on the planet.

The 'New Staples' trend predicts the rise in sales of regenerative crops such as ancient grains an alfalfa that nourish the soil instead of stripping it of nutrients. 

Another iteration of this trend that Asda expects to see is the surge in seaweed as a food solution since it's one of the most sustainable crops on the planet as it doesn't require fresh water, pesticides, or fertiliser.

5. Retail innovation turning to freeze-dried, dehydrated and powdered food in response to rising shipping costs and carbon emissions. 

Asda expects to see a rise in 'Just Add Water' products like on-the-go cereal and dehydrated oat milk enter the market. 

The smaller nature these formats means that shipping costs and carbon emissions can be reduced, helping both the environment and consumers pockets.

Asda's £10 Extra Special Amaretto & Cherry Cheesecake is the perfect addition to the Christmas table 

The store also has a selection of mince pies which come in numerous different flavours 

Jonathan said: ''Products like Asda's award-winning showstopper Chocolate and Honeycomb Avalanche Dessert are expected to be prominent on this year's Christmas dinner table as customers take comfort in looking back at times gone by with fondness - even if they weren't born in that year.

'Retro puddings are having the biggest resurgence, which customers can enjoy with our Black Forest Cake twist on a Yule Log or our decadent Amaretto and Cherry Cheesecake. Plus, Strawberry Trifle has got a vegan spin in our first ever OMV! festive range this year.

'With the ongoing cost-of-living crisis, we're looking for any excuse to celebrate and therefore, we're looking for delicious food we know and love, that brings us joy and instantly elevates any party spread at an affordable price. 

'Our award-winning Scallop and King Prawn Vol Au Vents with Brown Butter and Spiced Dark Rum Sauce are one of our hero party food products this Christmas. 

'It's a seventies favourite combined with another trend we've spotted around the concept of 'Eat, Play, Love' where small sharing plates, grazing boards and mix-and-match meals are holding their popularity.

'Finally, fondue is back again, with our Extra Special Wyke Farms Vintage Cheddar Bake with Caramelised Onion Chutney, exclusive to Asda, perfect for sharing.'

Commenting on the launch of the second book, Jonathan, said: 'We have spent months researching and identifying seven mega trends emerging in the UK food scene, alongside delving deeper into the relevant social and cultural drivers behind them. 

'Over the next 18 months, we'll be working hard to bring these trends to life on Asda shelves in a way that's both exciting and accessible for our customers'.'

Two herbicides detected in up to 98% of children may cause learning and social difficulties, study warns

The two most widely used herbicides in the world may cause learning problems and poor memory and social skills in children, a study has warned.

Using urine samples and test performance scores from adolescents, researchers found that traces of glyphosate, the most heavily applied herbicide in the US, and common weed killer 24D, were linked to worse brain function.

Researchers from the University of California San Diego found that glyphosate was present in 98 percent of the 520 samples.

People may be exposed to the chemicals by eating contaminated food or drinking water, and it is thought the substances affect the pathways in the brain linked to memory and learning.

Other research has found that glyphosate is in up to 90 percent of wheat-based products such as pizza, crackers and pasta.

Over the last two decades, there has been a substantial rise in chronic diseases and mental health disorders in young adults worldwide. 

'Exposure to neurotoxic contaminants in the environment could play a part of this increase,' said senior study author Dr Jose Ricardo Suarez, associate professor at UC San Diego. 

Exposure to glyphosate, the most heavily applied herbicide in the US, and common weed killer 2,4D, was linked to worse brain function among adolescents, researchers from the University of California San Diego found

The researchers measured the concentrations of two popular herbicides in urine samples: glyphosate and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, better known as 2,4D.

The urine samples were collected in 2016 from 519 children aged between 11 and 17 living in the agricultural county of Pedro Moncayo, Ecuador. 

Herbicides are the most commonly used class of pesticides worldwide, often used to kill weeds.

Elevated PFAS levels linked to higher cancer, low birth weight rates 



Cities with the highest levels of toxic 'forever chemicals' in tap water also have above-average rates of disease and pregnancy complications, a DailyMail.com analysis suggests. 

Glyphosate, used in crops such as corn and soy, is a nonselective herbicide, meaning it kills all vegetation in an area rather than just weeds.

It was detected in 98 percent of participant samples.

2,4D, a herbicide used to kill leafy weeds, was detected in 66 percent of the urine samples.

The researchers also examined the adolescents' performance in five areas: attention and inhibitory control (how well you can stop impulses), memory and learning, language, spatial awareness, and social perception.

They did this by looking through the test scores from 2016 on things like how quickly the children could understand a set of instructions, how well they could remember faces and how quickly they could solve shape puzzles.

Higher amounts of 2,4D in urine were linked to worse scores in the tests for attention and inhibitory control, memory and learning, and language.

Glyphosate concentration in urine was only connected to lower scores in social perception.

The most common glyphosate product is Roundup weed killer, made by Monsanto.

There have been significant increases in glyphosate and 2,4D use following the introduction of genetically modified, glyphosate-resistant ""Roundup-ready"" crops in 1996 and 2,4D-resistant crops in 2014, the study authors said.

Bayer, the owner of the chemical manufacturing company, has long maintained that exposure to the weed killer has no negative impacts on human health.

The study was published Wednesday in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives.

This is the dramatic moment rocks and debris hurtle at speed down a mountain threatening to engulf an entire Swiss village below.

Several boulders broke free from the top and came crashing down in a stomach-churning crescendo of noise that echoed across the picturesque valley.

Plumes of dust were thrown into the air as the rocks - cartwheeling as if in a cartoon - rolled down the slope and headed to the now evacuated village of Brienz.

Swiss authorities are preparing for an 'imminent' danger for a village that lies at the foot of a mountain where two million cubic tons of rock threaten to engulf it.

Residents and livestock were ordered out of Brienz in central Switzerland on Friday because of the impending danger and a total exclusion zone is now in force.

Swiss authorities have ordered residents to abandon a tiny mountain village in the eastern canton of Graubunden because of fears it could soon be buried beneath the collapsing mountainside, seen looming over the village

Residents of the Brienz, Graubunden, were ordered by Swiss authorities to abandon the tiny mountain village. The cluster of houses is pictured in front of the zone of rockslide, May 11, 2023

Officials have said the area is now moving from the 'red' phase into the 'blue' phase of the emergency where an 'event that may endanger the village is imminent'.

A stark warning on the local regional council website read:' The blue phase means ' Stay away from the entire Brienz slide area. An event is imminent.'

Today civil protection chiefs and police manned roadblocks at all access points to the picturesque village which has breathtaking views over a nearby valley.

MailOnline watched as just before 2pm local time several boulders slipped down the side of the Lenzerhorn mountain and came crashing down, sending dust into the sky.

A deafening roar could be heard as the huge rocks bounced downwards at a frightening speed towards the centre of Brienz which was obscured by trees.

Local authorities say Brienz is at risk because 2million cubic metres of rock could soon break off the mountain

Christian Gartmann, a spokesman for the local Albula-Alvara council told MailOnline:' Since the total evacuation of the village on Friday we have detected a movement of around 15 cm a day, of the mountain towards Brienz.

'The situation is very dangerous and although we have no idea when the side of the mountain will fall it is imminent and a question of a few days or a couple of weeks at the most.

'That's why the village has been completely excavated - there are no people left there and there is no livestock, the place is deserted, and it has to be because of the situation. At the moment we are in the red phase but we are preparing for a possible move into the more dangerous blue phase.'

Rocks are breaking off the mountain which could worsen, damaging or outright crushing its quaint homes in the village of Brienz, Switzerland

Valuable artefacts, including the 500 year old alter piece from St Calixtus church are put into the safe storage as the building is under threat from the breaking mountain side

Cameras have been set up at various locations pointing upwards and focusing on a critical mass on the side of the mountain which is known as an 'island'.

It is this huge area that officials fear will slip down at any moment and flatten anything in its path.

The area is deemed so unstable that geological experts and surveyors are monitoring it via remote and by drones which have been sent up to keep an eye on the mountain.

Brienz has a population of around 100 and Mr Gartmann told MailOnline the mountain has been moving towards the village at the rate of a metre a year for the last twenty years.

Experts say the cause is most likely climate change at glacier melt - and days of heavy rain in the area have also not helped contribute further to the instability of the fragile rockface.

The World Meteorological Organization's annual State of the Climate Report found that the European Alps saw a record year for glacier melt, with Switzerland particularly badly affected, losing 6% of its glacier volume between 2021 and 2022.

Rebecca Dell, a researcher at the University of Cambridge, told CNN that climate change is driving glacier melt in the Alps.

She added:' This melt may destabilise mountain slopes above towns and villages. If a slope becomes too unstable, events such as rockslides may occur.'

A general view shows the rockslide zone posing a severe danger to the tiny village of Brienz

The extent of the damage that could fall upon Brienz remains anyone's guess 

'The rock can come down in sections, which would be the most favourable solution,' Gartmann said. 'It can also fall all at once, which would be disastrous for the village' 

Brienz lies at 3,800ft above sea level and is just 40 minutes from the town of Davos which holds the yearly World Economic Forum - a power meeting of world leaders and business chiefs.

Officials say that a 'handful' of houses in Brienz have already been damaged by subsidence and that the most likely outcome is the rockfall will be in small chunks.

However Mr Gartmann said there was a '10% chance' the entire mountainside - two million cubic tons - could come down on to Brienz pulverising everything in its path.

He added:' Obviously we hope that doesn't happen but for the moment we have decided to evacuate everyone so there is no risk to life.

'We did look at other possibilities such as controlled explosion but that would mean drilling into the rock which is itself a risk.

Valuables in the village, including a 500-year-old altar piece in the local parish church of St Calixtus, have been taken away to deter potential thieves

'A concrete barrier or sand wall was also considered but to make sure any slide didn't hit Brienz it would have to be at least 200 ft high which was also impractical.'

Police are also keeping an eye on the area for potential looters but Mr Gartmann said the village had been emptied of all its valuables saying:' Brienz is of no interest to thieves - there is nothing of value there any more.'

A 500-year-old altar piece in the local parish church of St Calixtus was also among items taken away as part of the evacuation.

Mayor Daniel Albertin said:' I didn't expect the silence to be so depressing, I was the last to leave the village, and now we just have to wait.

'Firefighters went from door to door telling people to leave and we thought some might decide to stay and take their chances but no, everybody left.

'People in Brienz have lived with the mountain for many years, you always hear noises and rumblings and rocks but this is the first time there has been an imminent danger and we have had to evacuate.

'The plan originally was to let locals back in on Saturday to check on things and maybe look after their gardens but it was deemed too risky.

'But the situation moved far quicker than we expected and now there are just cameras and monitors there.

'We are all now just waiting and when it happens all we can do is hope that the damage is not too severe and people can move back to their homes.'

Is this the oldest case of cannibalism? Cuts made on a bone from a mysterious human relative 1.5 million years ago reveal they were butchered and likely eaten by one of their own

Cuts on a bone of a mysterious human relative suggest they were butchered and likely eaten by one of their own 1.5 million years ago, revealing the oldest evidence of cannibalism.

Researchers from the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History found the markings on the left tibia from a relative of Homo sapiens that lived in what is now Kenya.

Approximately nine of the 11 cuts match the type inflicted by stone tools, while a now-extinct saber-tooth-like animal was responsible for the others.

The project's Lead researcher, Briana Pobiner, said that the cut marks do not prove that the human relative who conducted the butchering also ate the leg, but it seems like the likely scenario.

Scientists reanalyzed the tibia and found markings that were made from stone tools

The bone was discovered in 1970 by paleoanthropologist Mary Leakey and has since been housed at the National Museums of Kenya Nairobi Museum.

Pobiner recently took another look at the tibia in search of animal bites but instead found marks that look like cross-stitching.

'The information we have tells us that hominins were likely eating other hominins at least 1.45 million years ago,' Pobiner said in a statement. 

'There are numerous other examples of species from the human evolutionary tree consuming each other for nutrition, but this fossil suggests that our species' relatives were eating each other to survive further into the past than we recognized.' 

Most bone surface modifications found are short, narrow linear marks with a straight trajectory and a closed-V-shaped cross-section oriented in the same direction.

'The cut marks are also all oriented the same way, such that a hand wielding a stone tool could have made them all in succession without changing grip or adjusting the angle of attack,' researchers shared in a press release. 

And the cuts are all gathered in the same area on the bone, according to the study published in Nature.   

None of the stone-tool cut marks overlap with the two bite marks, which makes it hard to infer anything about the order of events that took place. 

The project's Lead researcher, Briana Pobiner, said that the cut marks do not prove that the human relative who conducted the butchering also ate the leg, but it seems like the likely scenario

Approximately nine of the 11 cuts match the type inflicted by stone tools, while a now-extinct saber-tooth-like animal was responsible for the others

For instance, a big cat may have scavenged the remains after hominins removed most of the meat from the leg bone. 

It is equally possible that a big cat killed an unlucky hominin and was chased off or scurried away before opportunistic hominins took over the kill.

'These cut marks look very similar to what I've seen on that were being processed for consumption,' Pobiner said. 

'It seems most likely that the meat from this leg was eaten and that it was eaten for nutrition as opposed to for a ritual.

'So, this fossil could be a trace of prehistoric cannibalism, but it is also possible this was a case of one species chowing down on its evolutionary cousin.'

Scientists have found evidence that at least three hominin species existed in the region 1.5 million years ago where the fossil was found: Homo erectus, Homo Habilis and Paranthropus boisei.

Pobiner told The Washington Post that she is unsure where the mysterious victim falls into place but is conducting further research.

She has examined 199 fossilized bones in the collection, and the tibia is the only one with butchery marks, which suggests cannibalism was not a widespread practice.

The discovery, however, suggests there could be food scarcity at some point, forcing the ancient humans to consume whatever they could to survive.

Police force bars officers with hunting links from joining rural crime team after officer posts pictures of herself riding with a hunt as Chris Packham backs decision

A police force has banned officers with links to hunting from joining its rural crime team after an officer posted photos of herself riding with a hunt sparked protests.

PC Cheryl Knight's appointment to Wiltshire Police's rural crime team prompted uproar when anti-hunt protesters spotted photos on her Facebook page of her at both the Avon Vale and Beaufort hunts.

Scores gathered outside the police headquarters to protest at her new role.

The police force initially defended the appointment saying it is 'not illegal for someone working for a Police Force to be affiliated with a hunt organisation'.

But following an internal review, Wiltshire Police has now introduced new regulations to ensure all officers, civilian staff and volunteers within the unit have no 'personal links to hunts past or present'.

The force also said those with links to anti-hunt groups will be scrutinised.

Anti-hunt groups today praised the move and PC Knight's 'removal' from her role, though Wiltshire Police refused to confirm details of her position as they 'would not comment on individuals'.

But Countryside Alliance today blasted Wiltshire Police's decision to ban officers with hunting links from joining its rural crime team as 'blatant discrimination'. 

Naturalist Chris Packham today welcomed Wiltshire Police's decision and urged forces across the country to follow suit.

The 61 year old said: 'I welcome this decision but we now need other police forces to notice this has happened.

'I'm a keen supporter of the police, but we have got to have trust in them, we want to be working positively with them.

'Police forces need to tighten up their regulations.

'We all make mistakes, and hats off to Wiltshire Police for realising it.

'I hope other police forces follow suit, particularly Dorset where they've had a lot of problems with fox hunting.'

Dozens of people gathered outside Wiltshire police headquarters in Devizes earlier this month to protest at PC Knight's appointment to the rural crime team.

The team - which is made up of one inspector, a sergeant and four constables - has now undergone 'staffing changes' since the investigation but the force would not confirm whether PC Knight was still part of the unit.

Announcing her appointment in February, PC Knight introduced herself as being 'interested in all things equestrian' and 'looking forward' to her new role.

But her appointment quickly sparked anger with many pointing out she had previously posted pictures of herself to social media with two local hunts, Avon Vale and Beaufort.

Footage captured by hunt saboteurs appears to show a fox being trapped in a bag during a meet. Pictured: Saboteurs appearing to take the fox out of the bag

Referring to PC Knight's appointment, Packham said: 'It just looks like Wiltshire Police were asking for trouble if we have to be questioning their impartiality.

'There's nothing illegal about riding with a hunt but this officer's been put in a difficult position where she's been asked to police her friends.

'It must be hard to not be able to do your job properly.

'I don't have any sympathy for the fox hunts, I hope they go out of business and we can put it all to bed with more than 80 per cent of people wanting it to stop now.'

Referring to a recent suspension of the Cotswold Hunt, Packham, who lives in Hampshire's New Forest added: 'When you see a fox tied up in a bag and buried alive you realise these people are evil.

'We need to see a lot more effort put into rural crime, and we need effective rural crime teams to do that.'

In a statement, Wiltshire Police today said: 'We regularly review our resourcing and policing approach to ensure we can provide the best possible service to the public.

'We commissioned an internal review of our Rural Crime Team, which has resulted in us establishing a framework to ensure the suitability of our personnel working within the unit.

'The new framework will provide more scrutiny around the suitability of our officers, staff and volunteers to work within the unit.

'It sets out key principles to ensure staff do not have personal links to hunts past or present, do not have links to any anti-hunt groups past or present and requires staff disclose links to any rural based hobby or initiative that could potentially call into question their policing impartiality.

'This has already resulted in some staffing changes although it would not be appropriate for us to comment on individual cases.

'Although it is important to stress that, to date, none of our colleagues in the unit (past or present) have been found to have breached legislation or guidance, we accept that some resourcing decisions we made as an organisation have distracted from the crucial work the team do.

'We appreciate there has been considerable public scrutiny regarding this team however, the action we have taken should reassure our communities that we will continue to police without fear or favour and, when appropriate, we will respond pragmatically to concerns when they are raised.'

PC Knight is said to have attended the Avon Vale Hunt and Beaufort Hunts.

EXCLUSIVE: Student at Royal Agricultural University dubbed 'Oxbridge for farmers' strapped dead stag to Land Rover - after sparking outrage over dead fox tied to roof of a car

The Avon Vale Hunt was recently thrown out of the sport's governing body after footage of a fox being thrown to hounds was posted online.

In the clip, the fox appears to be dug out from a den by hunt members before tossing it to waiting dogs.

Fox hunting was made illegal in 2004, but hounds are allowed to chase a pre-laid scent - which is known as trail hunting.

The Cotswold Hunt was suspended this week after shocking footage emerged of a fox allegedly buried alive in a bag. 

A group of hunt saboteurs filmed the alleged discovery of the young female fox buried in a man-made den during a hunt on the Miserden Estate in Gloucestershire on March 18. 

Wildlife rescue experts said the rescued fox was possibly lactating at the time of discovery and the bag she was found in was 'sodden' with urine suggesting she had been trapped for many hours or even days. 

The British Hound Sports Association suspended the hunt's membership initially while investigating the matter, before deciding to permanently ban the hunt.

But Countryside Alliance today described Wiltshire Police's decision to ban officers with hunting links from joining its rural crime team as 'blatant discrimination'.

Polly Portwin, Director of the Campaign for Hunting at the Countryside Alliance, said: 'This decision is blatant discrimination which risks damaging the reputation of the force within Wiltshire's rural community.

'There can be no justification for rejecting job applications based on an individual's involvement in a lawful activity.

'Wiltshire Police recruits should be made up of a diverse range of men and women, irrespective of their background.

'It appears Wiltshire Police have bowed to faux outrage and mob rule without considering the reputation of rural policing which is already at all all-time low across the country, with two thirds of rural voters thinking that reporting crime is 'a waste of time' according to our recent rural crime survey.'

In a freedom of information request, Wiltshire Police confirmed PC Cheryl Knight had not investigated any hunt-related offences.

However, in PC Knight's capacity as wildlife Crime Officer she may have been 'requested to provide advice on wildlife crime', it said.

Meanwhile, Wiltshire Hunt Saboteurs today welcomed a victory for 'police impartiality'.

They said: 'Without saying it directly, Wiltshire Police are pretty much saying that the hunting police [officer] who was recently assigned to the Wiltshire Rural Crime Team has now been removed from her rural crime post, if not the police force.

'The removal of hunting police officers from the RCT was always at the core of our campaign.

'This issue goes to the heart of police impartiality, accountability and public trust and confidence in the 'policing by consent' model, particularly during a time when the public gaze is very much focused on the corruption and the sometimes criminal behaviour which occurs within every police force around the country.

'Naturally this result is welcomed. This is most certainly a win for the power of people to hold powerful institutions and interests to account, when the official systems invariably fail to do so.

'We know the RCT are currently investigating several incidents of hunt crime, some of which hunt sabs have been assisting with, and we will continue to provide evidence, where we can, to bring these organised rural crime gangs to justice for the sake of our persecuted wildlife.'

What are the rules for hunting with dogs in the UK? How fox hunters try to avoid run-ins with the law

Hunting with dogs was banned in England & Wales in 2004 (Scotland in 2002) because of the profound suffering it causes to foxes and other hunted animals, such as stags and hare. 

The law was not intended to stop foxes being killed, but to stop them being cruelly killed.

Exemptions were included in the law which permit dogs to be used in certain specific circumstances...

Stalking and flushing to guns: Two dogs may be used to flush a fox from cover so it can be shot for the purpose of protecting livestock, game birds or biodiversity. The dogs must be kept under close control and the fox must be shot as soon as it breaks from cover - no further chasing is allowed.

Rescue of an injured mammal: Two dogs may be used to capture a fox if the hunt believes it is injured and the hunting is undertaken to relieve its suffering.

Research and observation: Two dogs are allowed to be used for the purpose of or in connection with the observation or study of a wild mammal.

Flushing to a bird of prey: An unlimited number of dogs can be used to flush a fox from cover to a bird of prey which will catch and kill it.

Recapture of escaped wild mammal: An unlimited number of dogs can be used to capture a fox that has escaped from captivity.

Use of a dog below ground (known as terrier work): One terrier may be used below ground to flush out a fox to be shot for the purpose of protecting game birds being reared for shooting. The terrier men must carry written permission from the landowner.

Fox hunters have long tried to find ways to avoid the law. When the Hunting Act was introduced many hunts quickly took raptors out with them so they could claim to be using the bird of prey exemption. 

However, few hunts claim to be using this exemption today. Equally, some hunts went out with just two hounds and claimed to be flushing to guns, but this too quickly stopped.

Today, most fox hunts say they have switched to ""˜trail hunting', where the dogs follow a pre-laid scent trail made using fox urine and does not involve a fox being chased or killed.

America is known for its big portion sizes and even bigger obesity problem ""” and this map reveals why.

People in the US consume an average of 3,868 calories per day, the second-highest number of any country in the world.

It is eclipsed only by Bahrain, in the Middle East, where people consumed more than 4,000 calories per day on average.

That's according to research by Oxford University-based OurWorldInData, which compiled figures on calorie consumption by country from the United Nations.

The UK ranked 26th overall, with the average person making their way through 3,422 calories every 24 hours.



Out of the 184 countries surveyed for the study, 173 consumed more than 2,000 calories per day ""” or above the recommended daily average for both sexes.

Researchers warn over-consumption is driving up obesity ""” with 1billion people now obese compared to 175million in the 1970s ""” and fuelling associated health problems including high blood pressure, heart disease and even Alzheimer's.

Top of the list was Bahrain, a tiny but wealthy island nation off the coast of the Arabian peninsula.

Four in ten adults in the country are obese, data shows, which has been linked to more sedentary lifestyles and increased consumption of fast food.

Global diabetes rates to soar from 529 million to 1.3 billion by 2050... 



The explosion in cases ""” more than double the 529million now ""” will be largely driven by the world's ever-expanding waistline. 

Rounding out the top five countries for calorie consumption was Ireland, with 3,850 calories per day, Belgium, at 3,824, and Turkey, at 3,762.

The data compiled by OurWorldInData ""” an information platform run by Oxford University ""” was from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

The data was based on the total food bought per household on average for each country and does not necessarily mean calories consumed. For example, it does not account for wastage.

But calorie consumption has been rising for decades globally amid the advent of ready meals, fast food and more processed foods becoming available.

While foods are becoming more calorie dense, researchers have warned that they are also becoming more nutrient-deficient.

Some experts say this is leading to a vicious cycle where the human body drives people to eat more in an attempt to get hold of vital nutrients.

But, as a result, this leads many to consume extra calories that they do not burn off.

The overconsumption epidemic has also been linked to poor sleep, driven by 24-hour lifestyles, the constant presence of electric light and stressful lifestyles.

Studies show that when someone is underslept their appetite is not as well regulated and, as a result, is more likely to lead to overconsumption. They are also more likely to eat sugar-rich foods than those who are well-rested.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says that people should consume about 2,000 calories per day on average.

The UK's public health service, the NHS, says women should eat about 2,000 calories a day but men should consume 2,500.

Share of the world population that is obese from 1975 to 2016, according to OurWorldInData

At the other end of the scale, the Central African Republic had the lowest calorie consumption in the world ""” at 1,641 per person per day.

It was followed by Burundi (16,96), Madagascar (1,770), Zimbabwe (1,853) and Yemen (1,957).

All these countries have faced prolonged political strife which has impacted the economy and, as a result, their national food supplies.

The Central African Republic, which came bottom of the list, has been experiencing a civil war since 2012 which has now forced 1.1million people ""” or a fifth of the country's population ""” to flee their homes.

The current Government, under President Faustin-Archange TouadÃ©ra, has been relying on Russia's Wagner Group to maintain its authority.

As the country's population ages and the number of baby boomers starts to shrink, a new generation is set to inherit the fortunes of America's most wealthy dynasties.

Born between 1946 and 1964 and making up just 20 percent of the population, boomers own more than 50 percent of US household wealth - $73 trillion of out of $140 trillion, according to Fed data.

The US life expectancy as given by the World Bank is just over 77 years, meaning that by 2041 even the very youngest baby boomers will likely be gone. The impending handover of wealth will therefore be the largest in US history.

While the average American may leave behind a family home and some savings, the richest will hand over business empires now finetuned to dominate almost every American industry - from food and agriculture to media, finance and manufacturing.

Retail giants, the Waltons, are the richest family in America: the three remaining children of Walmart's late founder Sam Walton are aged between 73 and 78 and have a collective wealth of nearly $190 billion.

Expected to inherit the bulk of that are a handful of little-known heirs, among them Tom and Lukas Walton, in their late 30s.

According to a Forbes ranking of some of America's richest families, the Waltons are trailed by other families including the Cargill-MacMillans, the Marses the Lauders, the Cathys and the Hearsts.

Baby boomers own more than 50 percent of American household wealth - $73 trillion of a total of $140 trillion - despite making up only around 20 percent of the population

Walton Family - $247 billion

The Waltons hold an estimated $250 billion, most of which stems from Walmart. Sam Walton founded both Walmart and Sam's Club but died with extreme wealth in 1992, enriching his four children of the now-outgoing boomer generation.

Sam had four children - Sam, John, Jim and Alice - and 10 grandchildren, who have started inheriting the family's hundreds of billions of dollars at varying rates.

Currently one of the wealthiest of the third-generation Walton heirs is 37-year-old Lukas Walton, who inherited his share early. He is the only son of John, who died suddenly in 2005 while piloting a homemade aircraft. Lukas then reportedly inherited a third of his fortune, worth nearly $23 billion.

Sam's eldest son Rob, 78, is worth more than $60 billion and has three children: Sam Jr., Carrie and Ben.

Steuart Walton (left), 42, and Tom Walton (right), 39, are the sons of Jim Walton, who in turn is the youngest son of the Walmart founder Sam Walton. Their father is 74 years old and worth more than $60 billion. They are pictured here with their wives Kelly Rohrbach (left) and Olivia Walton (right)

Sam's third son is Jim Walton, now 74, and also worth more than $60 billion. He has four children to inherit his fortunes.

One of them is Tom Walton, 39. He and his wife Olivia live in Arkansas, the birthplace of Walmart and where much of the family resides. Olivia worked formerly as a journalist for NBC News, MSNBC and as an anchor for Bloomberg Television in New York and London.

Tom's older brother, Steuart Walton, is 42 and married model and Baywatch actress Kelly Rohrbach, 33, in 2019. She had dated Leonardo DiCaprio in 2015. Jim's other two children are Alice Walton Proietti, 43, and James Walton Jr, who is around 35.

Seventy-seven-year-old Alice Walton is Sam's youngest child. She is worth more than $60 billion, but has no children.

Lukas Walton, 37, reportedly inherited a third of his fortune, worth nearly $23 billion, in 2005 when his father died in a plane crash. He is a grandson of Sam Walton

Koch Family - $100 billion

The second richest family in America is the Kochs, whose money is tied up in Koch Industries, one of the largest privately owned companies in America, with revenues of around $125 billion. 

Fred Koch is the patriarch who patented a technique for refining heavy oil into gasoline in 1927 and started an oil refinery in Kansas in 1940. 

His sons, Charles Koch and David Koch - who died after a battle with prostate cancer in 2019 - were among the biggest donors to the GOP since the 1980s and have shaped American politics as we know it today.

Since the 1980s, the Koch brothers have used their enormous fortune to bankroll their own conservative political machine, creating a vast empire of organizations and advocacy groups that entrenched the post-Reagan GOP as the party of tax cuts and scant regulation.

Charles Koch (right), 87, is the chairman and CEO of Koch Industries and is personally worth around $60 billion. He is pictured with his son, Chase, 45, who is rising through the company's ranks

In doing so, they became the bÃªte noire for many Democratic and environmental activists, who bemoaned the tentacles of the 'kochtopus' and its outsized influence on conservative politics.

Environmental activists criticized the pair for funding political campaigns that focused on rolling back environmental regulations and being the primary sponsors of climate change denial in the US.

They spent millions funding climate change-denying research, think tanks and politicians - which analysts believe was to expand their fossil fuel fortunes.

Koch Industries has paid millions in penalties and fines for oil spills, discharging toxic chemicals and violating other environmental regulations.

Charlies, 87, is the current CEO of Koch Industries and is worth $59 billion with 42 percent ownership of the company. He has two children Chase and Elizabeth who are due to inherit his fortune. 

Elizabeth Koch, 47, is totally removed from the family business and runs a nonprofit, Unlikely Collaborators, which is dedicated to the creation of 'provocative experiences that help you face who you think you are.'

Her brother Chase is 45 and the likely heir to the business and rapidly climbing the Koch Industries corporate ladder. He is currently the president of Koch Disruptive Technologies.

David died aged 79 in 2019 and was an executive vice president of Koch Industries. He was a prominent Republican donor He left behind two boys, John Mark Koch and David Koch Jr. as well as a daughter, Mary Julia Koch - they are all much younger.

Lauder Family - $40 billion 

The Lauder dynasty was born out of the cosmetics company EstÃ©e Lauder, created in 1946 by its eponymous founder, born Josephine Esther Mentzer in 1908.

EstÃ©e Lauder Companies is made up of 29 brands, including makeup companies MAC and Clinique, as well as fragrance lines for brands like Donna Karan and Michael Kors.

Six billionaire members of the family hold stakes in the business - her sons Ronald, 79, and Leonard, 90, serve as chairman of Clinique Laboratories and chairman emeritus of EstÃ©e Lauder. They are worth an estimated $4.5 billion and $18.4 billion respectively.

Ronald Lauder is father to Aerin Lauder, 53, and Jane Lauder, 49, who are worth around $3 billion to $4 billion each.

Aerin is the style and image director at EstÃ©e Lauder and founded her own luxury brand, AERIN Beauty, in 2012. Last year she sold her full-floor apartment at 660 Park Avenue for $20 million. Philip Berlinski, CEO of Goldman Sachs Bank USA and global treasurer of Goldman Sachs, paid for the unit in cash, the Real Deal reported. 

Her younger sister Jane also works in the company as an executive vice president and the chief data officer.

Bloomberg family - $95 billion

The Bloomberg fortune was earned by Michael Bloomberg, 81. The enormous wealth in his family therefore currently spans just two generations, though his daughters both have young children.

The former mayor of New York City has a fortune of nearly $100 billion, according to Forbes, and his two daughters who will likely inherit swathes of it.

Emma, 44, and Georgina, 40, both featured in a 2003 documentary film Born Rich, about the children of the world's most wealthy children.

The elder daughter went to Princeton for college before studying business and public administration at Harvard. She married her husband Chris Frissora in 2005 and in 2015 had their first child, Zelda Violet Frissberg.

Instead of choosing a single last name or using both they elected for a portmanteau, meaning it is a hybrid of the two.

The other, Georgina, is a graduate of NYU an equestrian and has a nine-year-old son with fellow equestrian, Ramiro Quintana. In 2019 she bought a home in the Upper West Side of Manhattan for $10 million, Mansion Global reported at the time.

Cargill-MacMillan Family - $47 billion

The Cargill-MacMillan family owns Cargill, another of America's largest private companies with a revenue of around $115 billion. The family now has 14 billionaires, more than any other family in the world.

Cargill was founded in 1865 by William Wallace Cargill. It is headquartered in Minnesota and the largest agricultural company in the world, producing and processing agricultural products but also offering a variety of financial services. 

Most family members have extremely private lives and according to Forbes, many live on ranches and farms throughout Montana.

Gwendolyn Sontheim Meyer, around 62, is a great-great-granddaughter of William Wallace Cargill, the founder of Cargill

Very few pictures of the family exist in the public realm. Duncan MacMillan's 1998 book, 'The American Grain Family', described the family as 'most doggedly secretive'. 

The company's common equity has been owned by descendants of William Cargill and his son-in-law John MacMillan for over 140 years and six family members are on its 17-person board.

There are nearly 100 family members that together own around 90 percent of the company. The remaining ten percent is owned by employees through stock ownership plans and management-owned shares.

But by 2016, the fifth generation of the Cargill family was already starting to see representation on Cargill's board. One was Andrew Cargill Liebmann, 43, who had never worked at the company prior but is now an astrophysicist at Montana State University.

Gwendolyn Sontheim Meyer, around 62, is a great-great-granddaughter of William Wallace Cargill and was worth $4.4 billion in 2020. She has two children, but little is known about them.

Cathy Family - $14 billion

The Cathy family falls slightly lower down the list, but is still among the 20 or so wealthiest families in the country. Its money, which comes mainly though fast food, is more recently earned than some of the others.

S. Truett Cathy opened the Atlanta diner Dwarf Grill in 1946 and later launched Chick-fil-A in 1967. He died in 2014, meaning the reins were then handed over to his children.

Today, his sons Dan, 70, and Don 'Bubba' Cathy, 69, run the fried chicken chain as chairman and executive vice president, respectively. The are both worth in the region of $5 billion.

In 2021, his daughter Trudy, 67, who also works for the family business was added by Forbes to its list of billionaires. She became an operator of a Chick-fil-A in Birmingham, Alabama, after finishing her freshman year at Samford University, and currently serves as Ambassador.

Trudy has a huge family, made up of four children and 17 grandchildren, according to her personal website. 

And the fortunes will continue to trickle through the generations. In September 2021 it was announced that Dan's son, Andrew, 43, would become the company's third CEO in taking over from his father.

Bubba has around six children, including Mark Cathy, who has been working within the company for more than 15 years in a variety of roles.

Mars Family - $94 billion

The Mars family owns Mars Inc., one of the largest candy and pet food companies in the world. In April 2020 the combined wealth of its 'notoriously private' members were estimated to be around $126 billion.

The company goes back multiple generations. It was founded in 1911 by Frank C. Mars who started selling candy out of his kitchen in Tacoma, Washington.

But it was his son Forrest Mars Sr. who grew the it into one of the largest companies in the country after joining in 1926 and developing the Milky Way bar.

When he died in 1999, his children, Jacqueline, John and Forrest Jr. Mars, inherited a stake in the company.

Jacqueline is perhaps the only even remotely high-profile of his children and 83-years-old.

In 2013 she was involved in a crash near her home in Virginia in which one person died and a pregnant woman miscarried. She told a witness after the crash that she had fallen asleep at the wheel of her Porsche SUV and pleaded guilty to reckless driving.

Now, Jacqueline and John co-own Mars Inc. They have the biggest share of the family fortune, with US$24 billion each.

Hearst Family - $21 billion

The Hearst family controls a media empire started by its patriarch William Randolph Hearst, now Heart Corporation. According to Forbes the Hearst family is worth around $21 billion.

William R. Hearst III, 73, is the current chairman of the board and the grandson of William Randolph Hearst.

He grew up in New York, where his father William Randolph Hearst Jr., but often called Bill, was publisher of the New York Journal-American.

Hearst III has a son, William Dedalus Hearst, and three daughters, Adelaide, Caroline and Eliza. 

Amanda Hearst, 39, is a grand daughter to William Randolph Hearst and perhaps one of the most public of the young Hearst heirs. She gave birth to her first son Joachim RÃ¸nning in 2022.

She also has a half brother, Randy Hearst Harris, who is around 33. He married Paula Porubcanova in a lavish Hamptons wedding last year, Page Six reported. 

Her mother is Anne Hearst, a contributing editor of Town & Country magazine, published by Hearst, and the granddaughter of newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst.

Anne's sister is Patty Hearst, who was kidnapped in 1974 by members of the Symbionese Liberation Army. The term 'Stockholm Syndrome' is famously attached to her kidnapping, and her later participation in her kidnappers' crimes.

Duncan family - $22 billion

The Duncan family inherited their wealth almost all of their wealth from oilman Dan Duncan, founder of Enterprise Products. After going public in 1998 it became one of the biggest midstream energy companies in the US.

Duncan died in 2010 and his four children inherited the trusts that collectively own roughly one third of the stock in the pipeline behemoth.

His children Randa Duncan Williams, Milane Frantz, Dannine Duncan Avara and Scott Duncan inherited a $10 billion estate from Dan when he died in 2010. 

Randa, 61, became chair of the company's board in 2013 and had an individual worth of around $7 billion, according to Forbes. She is married to Charles A. Williams, with whom she lives in Houston. They have one son.

Rockefeller family - $8 billion

The Rockefeller wealth is also tied up in oil and stems back to John D. Rockefeller, America's first billionaire, who founded Standard Oil in 1870.

He and his son John Jr. were active for over a century and gave away more than a billion dollars and established the University of Chicago. 

Today, the Rockefeller fortune is spread out among more than 70 heirs.

Among them is Ariana Rockefeller, a handbag designer and a great great grand child of John D. Rockefeller. She was born to David Rockefeller Jr. and Diana Rockefeller in 1982.

Much of the family's estimated $8 billion wealth is managed by Rockefeller Capital Management, which was born out of Rockefeller & Company in 2018. Ariana's father David Jr. now serves on the board of directors.

Most of these ultrarich families have successfully retained their wealth across multiple generations, with the exception of a handful, like the Bloombergs.

The Cargill-MacMillan family has held on to its wealth for almost eight generations. Nonetheless it is not unheard for challenging times to derail highly successful families.

One family whose fortunes took a tremendous knock in recent years are the Sacklers, owners of opioid producer Purdue Pharma.

Their fall from grace began in 2014, when the Massachusetts and New York attorney generals implicated eight Sackler family members in the nation's deadly opioid epidemic, costing the family more than $5 billion in settlements.

This week will be the last chance of the year to catch a glimpse of a spectacular supermoon, so make sure you know how to spot this rare astronomical event.

Friday night will be the last in a rare run of four supermoons for 2023 and will be your last chance to spot one until September 2024.

Stargazers and amateur astronomers alike should be in for a treat as the moon will be extra bright and large in the sky, as well as rising earlier than normal.

In the UK, sunset will be at 18:45 on Friday, with the moon predicted to rise shortly afterwards, so simply step outside and look to the skies to make the most of the last supermoon of the year.

The moon will be big and bright enough to see clearly with the naked eye from anywhere in the country, but don't forget to bring a pair of binoculars if you want to see some of the amazing details of the lunar surface.

Chandrayaan-3's first photo from the moon's surface shows a 'relatively' flat region of the south pole. This is fairly unusual as the moon's south region is known for its bumpy and rough terrain 

What is a supermoon?

A supermoon is a full moon that occurs when the moon is almost as close to the Earth as it can possibly be.

The moon does not orbit around the Earth in a perfect circle but traces an ellipse as it moves through its 27.3 day cycle.

This means that throughout one lunar orbit the distance between the Earth and moon varies between 252,719 miles (406,712km) at its furthest point, or apogee, and 221,484 miles (356,445km) at the closest point called the perigee.

A supermoon is generally defined as a full moon which occurs when the moon is at more than 90% of its perigee.

However, some scientists dislike the term 'supermoon' as it was created by an astrologist called Richard Nolle in 1979.

Mr Nolle was also responsible for spreading the idea that supermoons cause earthquakes and volcanoes as well as influencing human behaviour - theories that have been thoroughly debunked by scientific research.

Astronomers often prefer to use the term 'perigee syzygy', defined as a full moon occurring when the moon's centre is less than 223,000 miles (360,000km) from the Earth.

This week's full moon is also the first full moon after the Autumn Equinox, meaning it will be a Super Harvest Moon.

The Harvest Moon is extra bright and rises earlier than usual, so called because it is believed to have allowed farmers to work into the night harvesting crops in preparation for the coming winter.

Throughout one lunar orbit the distance between the Earth and moon varies between 252,719 miles (406,712km) at its furthest point, or apogee, and 221,484 miles (356,445km) at the closest point called the perigee

What makes a supermoon special? 

Supermoons are a rare event because the moon's orbit and phase cycle are not in sink, so a full moon does not often align with perigee.

During a supermoon, the moon will appear up of 14 per cent and around 30 per cent brighter than normal

Since Friday's supermoon occurs 32 hours 52 minutes after the moon has passed through its closest point, the moon could be as little as seven per cent larger and 15 per cent brighter, making the difference difficult to spot with the naked eye.

Watching the moon rise above the horizon, it may appear that it is far larger than normal, however this is due to something called 'the moon illusion'.

This effect causes the moon to appear to us as much larger when it is low on the horizon despite remaining the exact same size throughout the entire night.

Scientists don't agree on what exactly causes the moon illusion or have a good explanation for why it occurs so consistently even for astronauts looking at the moon from the ISS.

You will have to wait a while to catch the next supermoon, with the next not taking place until 18 September 2024

Some theories suggest that it's because our brains anticipate objects on the horizon to be further away and therefore to appear smaller.

Since the moon remains the same distance from Earth, our brains may overcorrect for how far away it appears, making it seem larger than reality.

Other theories claim that the effect may involve the moon's comparison to objects in the foreground such as trees and buildings.

With dry weather forecast across much of the country this Friday it might be a great opportunity to go put this illusion to the test yourself.

This week's supermoon will also be a great opportunity to spot the planets Jupiter, Saturn, and Mercury.

Saturn will begin to rise shortly before sunset and reach its highest point, or culmination, at 10:42pm, followed my Mercury at 11:55pm and finally Saturn at 3:18am.

When is the next supermoon?

You will have to wait a while to catch the next supermoon, with the next not taking place until 18 September 2024.

This will be a particularly special event, as it will also be a partial lunar eclipse, meaning part of the moon will pass into the Earth's shadow and appear red.

According to Professor Sarah Russell, senior research lead at the Natural History Museum, 'lunar eclipses can look amazing, and when it is a supermoon it should be quite a spectacle.'

2024 will have two other supermoons throughout the year, one on October 17 and the next on November 15.

Mysteries of the moon explained: A fascinating new series reveals how it's shaped the past... and will have a huge impact on our future

Some howl at it, others believe it can stop them sleeping. Animals use it as a navigational tool, and without it there would be no human race.

Yet few people realise just how important the Moon is.

Now, fascinating new Ch5 show Wonders Of The Moon, hosted by comic and amateur astronomer Dara O Briain, examines the mysteries and myths about Earth's only natural satellite, and the way it shapes who we are and our world.

'I love everything about space but the Moon holds a special kind of magic,' says former Stargazing Live presenter Dara.

'Without it we wouldn't be here. It's profoundly shaped our culture and inspired one of our greatest achievements.'

And, as he finds out in the two-part series, new things are still being discovered about the Moon that could shape our future as well as illuminate our past.

The show starts at Newgrange in Ireland, a 5,000-year-old man-made mound with the remains of a circle of standing stones. It functioned as a solar calendar, but new research suggests it was also one of the first lunar calendars.

The word month comes from moon, and a lunar calendar could have helped farmers learn when it was best to sow seed and harvest crops, with the year's progress determined by the wax and wane of the Moon.

Dara also travels to Kent to speak to astrobiologist Professor Lewis Dartnell to discover how the Moon's influence on life on Earth goes back much further in time, because it produces tides in our seas as a result of its gravitational pull.

When the Moon was closer to us (it's moving away from Earth at a rate of around 3.8cm a year), tides were more extreme, meaning many sea animals had to work out how to survive on land, thus paving the way for humans.

'The tidal effect meant animals were given practice at walking on land before the sea came back and they got wet again,' says Professor Dartnell. 'Eventually there was this evolutionary drive to walk on land so they could get from a small tidal pool to a bigger one and so survive before drying out.'

How big an impact the Moon still has on humans is debatable, but its impact on other creatures is clear. Dara meets a farmer in Cornwall to find out why cows are more fertile at a full moon, and learns from a fisherman how tides affect where fish populations thrive.

But while it's been proved that humans do sleep less when there's a full moon, Dara discovers the idea it can affect menstruation or even crime rates is little more than 'pseudo-science'.

The series also examines our growing knowledge about the surface of the Moon itself, with new research on rocks collected on previous moon landings finding evidence of water on what had been thought to be a dry, arid surface.

Dara also hears about plans for the use of machines on the Moon's surface that might find enough water to support life.

Also, because the Moon has much less gravity than Earth, rockets could be launched to Mars from the lunar surface.

'I'm genuinely excited to know what that is going to do for people's imaginations,' says Dara, who says learning about the moon landings ignited his passion for astronomy.

'To point at the Moon and be able to say, 'There are people up there now', that is going to be a huge thing.'

Are sanctions REALLY wrecking life in Russia? As British supermarkets ration eggs and vegetables - thanks in part to Putin's war in Ukraine - shelves in a provincial Russian city are groaning under piles of fresh food, writes SUE REID

These revealing photographs show shop shelves in a provincial Russian city groaning under piles of fresh food.

As British supermarkets ration eggs and an array of fruit and vegetables amid shortages provoked in large part by the Ukraine war, no such hardships afflict Vladimir Putin's citizens.

The pictures were taken at a food hall, two superstores and a corner shop in Perm, a city with a population the size of Birmingham in the Ural mountains, a 24-hour drive from Moscow. The images suggest the West's much-vaunted sanctions on Russia, imposed to punish President Putin for his invasion, are not having a deep bite.

What's more, the scenes are a reversal of 40 years ago, when many of us watched pitiful TV footage of Russians under the Communist regime queuing for staples such as bread and eggs.

Now it's Britain's turn to suffer. Supermarkets here are rationing tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and lettuces as UK farmers struggle with higher energy costs which stop them using hothouses in winter to grow them. Soft fruit, including raspberries, are also hard to find in the shops.

Tony Montalbano, a director of Green Acre Salads in Roydon, Essex, typically produces a million kilograms of baby cucumbers a year, but his glasshouses were empty last month.

He delayed growing his crops to avoid rocketing winter fuel bills of up to £500,000 a month. He expects his production to be cut by up to half this year.

'It's sad and frustrating but I can't afford to grow,' he said. 'I must make a profit. If I don't, there's no point in me going on. Lots of growers are closing their doors and selling up.'

Jack Ward, chief executive of the British Growers Association, added: 'Up and down the country, we've got empty glasshouses. People who would grow two or three crops of cucumbers a year may cut that to just one, because they want to avoid using more expensive energy.'

Eggs are also being rationed as farmers cannot afford the costs of keeping laying hens warm in energy-guzzling sheds.

The result is that many staples here are far more expensive than in Russia as our chart shows.

Residents of Perm, and elsewhere in Russia, have plenty of cheap food. Low-cost energy in the gas-rich nation means vegetables can be grown in hot houses throughout the bitter winter. Russia is also able to import large quantities of fruit from sympathetic countries, such as Iran, enjoying warmer climates.

Nor is there anxiety over heating homes, while filling cars with plentiful cheap petrol or diesel is a breeze.

Fresh produce available in a food market in the city of Perm, Russia in February 

Other factors come in to play: income tax in Russia is just 13 per cent for those earning less than £163,000 ""” compared to 40 or 45 per cent for higher British earners. Local tax, or council tax, is also a fraction of what people pay in the UK.

A random selection of people in Perm contacted by the Mail have provided us with their shopping receipts for a week showing prices and the availability of produce as well as their monthly utility bills. They have, in addition, taken many photographs.

They also insist Russian public hospitals 'remain excellent', while residents' enrolment in the country's health service is fully paid by their employers ""” so free at the point of use.

A year on from Putin's full-scale invasion, it seems that most ordinary Russians face few daily deprivations ""” as long as they can avoid being drafted into the Russian military forces suffering huge casualties in Ukraine.

Taking careful precautions to protect the identities of our informants, we spoke to residents in Perm through social media channels that are not monitored by the Kremlin.

As UK-born John, 67, and his Russian wife, Helena, 51, told the Mail from their two-bedroom apartment in the city: 'Crisis, what crisis? We are living our lives normally despite the Ukraine situation. We watch what is happening in Britain with food shelves empty. We are in Russia, working here, and are not suffering from the West's sanctions.'

The truth is that while oligarchs have been evicted from Britain, Russian-UK flights and money transfers banned, along with the import of oil, the population there isn't feeling the pinch. Food production is booming because of Russia's plentiful in-country energy supplies and its ability to buy from supportive nations.

John and Helena insist that the Ukraine conflict is of little interest to them. 'The average Russian cares about having a home that is warm, food on the table, a glass of vodka and personal safety on the streets.

'We have all that. Nothing has been changed by the war.'

John is a researcher and Helena is a former college lecturer. They spoke to us as President Putin boasted in his annual address to the nation last month that inflation has dropped to four per cent, against the UK's 10.1 per cent.

The bills for what John and Helena call 'a very large luxury flat' ""” including block maintenance, light, heating, water supply and rubbish collection ""” are a mere £130 per month. The couple's family also has a dacha, or cottage, on the outskirts of Perm.

Of course, Russian wages are a fraction of what they are in Britain. Average income per person is less than £14,000, compared to £33,000 in the UK, according to 2022 figures from the Office for National Statistics.

Britain remains the world's fifth-largest economy, while Russia, even with more than double the population, languishes at number 11 ""” behind Italy, South Korea and Canada. Sanctions are, however, having some effect on the Russian national economy: last year, it shrank by up to 3.9 per cent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), with further falls expected.

And, of course, many large Western firms have cut ties with Moscow in protest at the war. In Perm, most European-owned clothes shops and franchises have closed, to be replaced by Russian ones ""” with 'everything we need', say the residents we spoke to.

But the cost of living in Russia is far lower than in the UK and, given the country's abundant natural resources, that seems unlikely to change.

How the two compare 



Current Russian shop prices based on 40 cities: website 3Pulse.com and residents' receipts from Perm.

UK comparisons from online supermarket sites this week.

In the West, by contrast, costs and inflation have soared as the Kremlin 'weaponises energy', strangling supplies in retaliation against our sanctions. Putin has also refused to sell us agricultural fertilisers.

As the world's top exporter of this vital farming product, the price has spiralled. In short he has tried to ruin British farming, making it prohibitively expensive in many cases to grow vegetables, fruit, and salad products in the cold months.

The Left-wing British media have been quick to blame Brexit for the shortages on our shelves.

But farming experts have insisted it is a combination of factors ""” including the fact that weather in Spain and Morocco has caused poor harvests and reduced imports of fruit and vegetables. In Perm, the situation could not be more different. There were tomatoes aplenty. Raspberries, too, were available in abundance last week.

All this, of course, makes you wonder who is winning the economic war. From Perm, John told us: 'I have seen with my own eyes that sanctions are not hurting Russia. People on the street hardly notice anything. The shops are full of everything they want or need.

'The gas and oil export revenues are up massively to countries which have not imposed sanctions.'

He added: 'The bottom line is that more money is flowing into the country than flows out. Imports from Europe are down but Russian production is, ironically, increasing as it becomes more self-sufficient as a nation.

'There are no shortages here, ever. As a vegetarian, I miss Linda McCartney sausages or a strong Cheddar cheese.

'But there are plenty of alternatives, made in Russia, on our shelves.

'McDonald's has now been replaced by a Russian-owned 'Tasty, Full Stop', and all the younger Russians prefer their stuff.

'We have Heinz Baked Beans and still get imports, such as Corona Beer, from the local supermarket. There are plenty of wines from Spain, Portugal and Italy, too.

'We live the good life here.'

Nearly HALF of tap water in U.S. is laced with hormone-warping 'forever chemicals' linked to cancer and infertility, major government study finds - with worst-hit areas in Cali, Eastern Seaboard, Great Lakes and Great Plains

Almost half of all tap water sources in the US are laced with toxic PFAS ""˜forever chemicals', according to a major official study.

Experts said the findings were 'frightening' given the scale of the problem and the link between the toxins and serious health conditions like cancer, infertility, birth defects and hormone issues.

In the most comprehensive study of its kind, researchers from the US Geological Survey tested water sources at more than 700 locations across the country for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).

These microscopic, man-made chemicals can take thousands of years to break down in the environment or in the human body, hence the name 'forever chemicals'. 

The report found that 45 percent of drinking water sources contained at least one PFAS - with highest concentrations in the Great Plains, the Great Lakes, the Eastern Seaboard and Central/Southern California.

The map compiled by the US Geological Survey shows the number of PFAS detections across a sprawling number of sites nationwide between 2016 and 2021

PFAS is a common contaminant in many household items from cookware to hamburger wrappers. It can remain in the environment as well as human tissue for years, even decades, before being cleared out

The team's testing was limited to 32 types of PFAS out of more than 12,000 that exist, meaning thousands of the chemicals could have gone undetected. If that's the case, it may indicate that the problem is even larger than the study conveys.

Neighborhoods with the highest PFAS levels in drinking water 

Concentrations are measured in parts per trillion (PPT) 

Information courtesy of a separate report by the Environmental Working Group 

Researchers set out to determine levels of PFAS in water sources across 716 unique sites nationwide, including both urban and rural areas.

Over the course of five years spent collecting samples to detect PFAS levels, the team concluded that taps in densely populated urban centers were generally more laden with the forever chemicals than taps in rural parts of the country. 

This is due to the fact everyday home products from frying pans to food packaging contain PFAS that leach into the water supply, and urban areas tend to be situated closer to manufacturing plants.

The main purpose of PFAS compounds is to repel water and oil, which is what makes non-stick cookware so much easier to clean and why certain jackets and tents can withstand rain. 

PFAS can seep into the water supply by simply washing the dishes. The compounds can also seep into our food if the packaging is made to be grease-resistant - think fast food cheeseburgers - or if the non-stick coating on pots and pans begins to deteriorate. 

PFAS are also common in pesticides used to feed crops, which produces chemical-rich runoff that can enter the drinking water supply.

Last year, Texas Tech University researchers examined 10 common insecticides being used on cotton fields, but can work for food and other crops.

They found PFAS in seven of the 10 insecticides, with levels of PFOS - which has been strongly linked to cancer - as high as 19m parts per trillion (ppt) in one insecticide.

The Environmental Working Group, an activist organization centered on environmental pollutants, mapped out the communities and military sites confirmed to have PFAS contamination  

States in the Great Lakes region showed higher-than-recommended levels of PFAS

Locations on the eastern seaboard figured prominently in the report with some of the highest concentrations of PFAS

Most of the contamination was concentrated in densely populated urban areas, which the researchers concluded was due to increased industry and a greater number of waste sites overall, including manufacturing plants and landfills, which are known to generate PFAS.

'Screamingly high levels' of PFAS found in most US pesticides



Texas researchers found the chemicals in seven out of 10 insecticides - but six had extremely large quantities of a particularly dangerous type that has been strongly linked to cancer. 

And several distinct regions of the US had especially high concentrations of the poisonous compounds, including the Eastern seaboard and southern and central California, where many of the biggest cities are located.

They also detected elevated PFAS levels areas around the Great Lakes and in plains states. They did not offer an explanation as to why those particular areas, typically far from urban centers, showed such high levels of PFAS, though.  

Researchers taking part in the study represented disparate parts of the country, such as New Jersey, Wisconsin, and Oregon, in order to get the most comprehensive results possible. 

They sampled a total of 716 water sources including 447 that rely on public supplies and 269 using private wells.

While private wells are maintained by individuals or households on residential property, public water sources are owned by the state or local government which uses a centralized water treatment and distribution system.

The Geological Survey's study conducted from 2016 to 2021 highlights the alarming extent of the problem that PFAS contamination poses. 

About 270 million Americans rely on public sources for their drinking water, while another 40 million use private wells, and all of them could be affected.

The situation appears even more dire at the local level, with certain cities and neighborhoods' drinking water sources containting levels of PFAS that far exceed those that the Environmental Protection Agency deems is safe. 

Central California, where agriculture is a major industry, also showed high concentrations of PFAS in its water systems. This could be due to PFAS-laden insecticides used on farmlands leaching into the groundwater

Southern California, the home to several large well-populated cities including San Diego and Los Angeles, was among the areas singled out by the government surveyors 

The problem has received growing attention in recent years in part due to increased media attention, as well as advancing testing methods that can detect the chemicals in low levels in the environment and in people.

And an expanding body of research into the effects of PFAS exposure has driven home the fact that even low levels of the chemicals can prove toxic. Unfortunately, they are nearly everywhere, from non-stick cookware, fast food wrappers and popcorn bags, and stain removers, to cosmetics and firefighting foam.

The ""˜forever chemicals', nicknamed that because they break down in the environment incredibly slowly and can remain in the body for decades or even longer before being cleared.

Private and public water sources had similar concentrations of PFAS overall, although urban centers where private wells are less commonplace were found to be more densely contaminated than rural areas  

Some varieties of PFAS have been shown to increase levels of LDL or ""˜bad' cholesterol that contributes to plaque buildup in the arteries, slowly blocking blood flow in the arteries which greatly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, heart attack, and stroke.

Prolonged exposure to PFAS - which is not out of the realm of possibility given its constant presence in homes - can severely damage the liver. 

US government researchers concluded last year that when humans and rodents were exposed to the three common varieties of PFAS, they showed elevated levels of an enzyme called ALT, a marker of liver damage, in the blood.

PFAS also disrupts the delicate hormone balance that has profound effects on our mental and physical health. This includes sex hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone which, when tampered with, can impact reproductive health and fertility.

Women exposed to PFAS during pregnancy have higher risks of gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia, a type of high blood pressure. Babies exposed to the chemicals in utero, meanwhile, are at higher risk for low birth weight and increased risk of childhood obesity and infections down the line. 

The disruption to normal hormone regulation can also lead to severe damage to the thyroid.

There is also some evidence that exposure over a long period of time can contribute to cancer risk, particularly in the kidneys and testicles.  

The latest report signals that human involvement is a major if not the greatest contributor to the level of contamination detected in drinking water sources nationwide, which allows the chemicals to settle in the blood, liver, and kidneys.

In 2007, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that PFAS could be detected in the blood of about 98 percent of the US population.

The federal government has taken steps to intervene, most recently with the Environmental Protection Agency's decision to propose new, stronger restrictions on maximum permitted levels of the compounds in US drinking water.

The agency has not disclosed what those new limits would be and a final decision is not expected before 2024.

For some, the idea of mounting a horse is terrifying.

So spare a thought for our ancestors who, around 5,000 years ago, were the first to get astride.

Researchers say they have identified the oldest riders by looking for small changes in the skeletal structure of ancient human remains.

The team, from the University of Helsinki and Hartwick College in New York, analysed more than 200 Yamnaya individuals who dated as far back as 3000BC - the start of the Bronze Age.

This group, initially from the area around Ukraine and western Russia, spread out across Europe and were thought to be so successful due to the recent domestication of horses.

This allowed for carts full of food, weapons and other provisions to be transported long distances, as well as livestock to be herded more effectively.

But now, experts have been able to pinpoint the earliest evidence of individuals actually getting on-board their stallions.

The team identified five individuals who had the most ""˜reliable' evidence of being riders.

Their skeletal remains had been unearthed from kurgans - prehistoric burial mounds - in Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary.

Close analysis of their bones revealed all had at least four out of six skeletal traits which suggested ""˜horsemanship syndrome'.

Examples include stress reactions on the pelvis and femur - most likely a result of gripping to the side of the horse using the lower body and thigh muscles.

Some individuals also had ""˜stress-induced vertebral degeneration' - signs of vertical impact stress typically suffered by riders.

One poor rider also had injuries to their sacral vertebrae - a large, triangular-shaped bone positioned just above the tailbone.

""˜A forceful fall on the backside is the most likely trauma scenario', the researchers wrote in the journal Science Advances.

""˜Biomechanical stress markers on human skeletons provide a viable way to further investigate the history of horseback riding and may even provide clues about riding style and equipment.

""˜Later depictions of Bronze Age riders usually show a position called ""chair seat."" This style is mainly used when riding without padded saddle or stirrups to avoid discomfort to horse and rider.

""˜It is physically demanding, with the legs exerting constant pressure to cling to the mount's back and needs continual balancing, but would not preclude activities such as combat or the handling of herd animals.

""˜The osteological features described here fit well with this riding style and may have been typical for the earliest period of horsemanship.

""˜With the later introduction of shaped and padded supporting saddles and stirrups, other riding styles such as the so called ""split seat"", ""dressage seat"" and ""hunt seat"" evolved.

""˜Together, our findings provide a strong argument that horseback riding was already a common activity for some Yamnaya individuals as early as 3000BC.'

Their skeletal remains had been unearthed from kurgans - prehistoric burial mounds - in Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary

The skeletal remains found in the burial grounds dated as far back as 3000BC - the start of the Bronze Age

The researchers said they expect these early horses were ""˜probably hard to handle' due to a lack of specialised gear and short breeding history.

""˜A greater anxiety response in early Yamnaya horses probably made them even more likely to ""˜bolt' from violent or loud actions', they added.

""˜The military benefit of equestrianism may therefore have been limited, but nevertheless, rapid transport to and away from the side of raids would have been an advantage.'

Lead author Martin Trautmann said: ""˜Hopping on a horse's back may have been one small step for man 5,000 years ago, but a giant leap for mankind.'

Their findings suggest the Yamnaya people may have been ancient cowboys - the first people to herd livestock on horseback.

Volker Heyd, one of the authors of the study from the University of Helsinki said: ""˜These people were able to greatly enhance their mobility [and it] enabled them to keep large herds of cattle and sheep and, as we now know, to guide them on horseback.'

David Anthony from Hartwick College, who also worked on the study, said: ""˜It made herding cattle and sheep three times more efficient, it changed the human conception of distance and it was an aid in warfare.'

The researchers presented their findings at the annual conference of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington.

A step closer to British Baked Beans on the breakfast menu! The first haricot beans grown in the UK are canned

They have long been a national mealtime staple. 

But the great British weather has meant growing our own baked beans has been a farming fantasy - until now.

The first ever commercial crop of British-grown baked beans have been canned, after university boffins spent 12 years developing a bean able to cope with our cold, damp climate.

The specially modified haricot beans were harvested in September at a farm in Leadenham, Lincolnshire.

It is hoped the breeding of a UK-specific common dry bean variety could lead to the beginning of a new pulse market for UK farmers, with the aim to cut food imports.

The first ever commercial crop of British-grown baked beans have been canned, after university boffins spent 12 years developing a bean able to cope with our cold, damp climate

History: Traditionally, baked beans have been predominantly sourced from overseas markets in the US, Canada , Ethiopia and China because of the specific climate and soil requirements needed for their successful cultivation

THE HISTORY OF BAKED BEANS

Baked beans are believed to be based on a Native American dish in which beans were cooked with fat and maple syrup.

European settlers are thought to have adapted the recipe using pork and molasses.

There is another theory that the recipe can be traced to the classic French bean stew cassoulet.

Henry Heinz launched his baked beans in the U.S. in 1895 and brought them to the UK nine years later.

Beans became a staple of the British diet. Originally the product contained a small piece of pork. But Second World War rationing put paid to that.

The Beanz Meanz Heinz slogan dates from the mid-1960s. In 2006, Heinz headed off a threat by Branston to hijack it by reintroducing it to its marketing.

In the mid-1990s, a price war broke out, with some supermarkets selling their own brand beans for as little as 3p a can.

One enterprising independent grocer even gave consumers 5p every time they 'bought' a can.

More than 2million tins of beans are eaten in Britain every day, with all the beans grown in the US, Canada, Ethiopia and China.

The breakthrough came after scientists at the University of Warwick relaunched the work started under the then Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the 1980s. They evaluated descendants from the previous bean breeding work and selected a distinctive and stable variety of small white haricot bean.

A smaller-scale trial to grow the new early-maturing variety - called Capulet after one of the warring families in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet - failed in 2022 failed due to the summer heatwave.

But a new field trial this year was successfully harvested by farmer Andrew Ward, who then watched as some were tinned at the Princes canning factory in nearby Spalding. Most of the beans harvested will be used to grow another crop next year.

Mr Ward hailed the achievement as 'an absolute milestone'.

'As a nation, we import too much food,' he said.

'To be able to produce something that we consume in such great quantities in this country, it's just unbelievable.' He added: 'We have struggled in the past with the varieties that have been available to us and those varieties have come from other countries where the climate's different to ours.

'There were attempts at getting a British bean growing that didn't mature and didn't happen and then a few years ago Warwick University started to really get to grips with these beans and see why they weren't working and what needed to be done.'

Further trials will now take place, but Professor Eric Holub, a plant genetics expert from the university's School of Life Sciences, said the objective was to bring the Capulet bean into UK production for UK farmers.

The new variety of baked bean has been named the Capulet (middle, top uncooked and bottom cooked). Scientists also grew two other types of bean, Godiva (left) and Olivia (right)

The team behind the bean: Farmer Andrew Ward (pictured left) grew the legumes in a 13-acre field in Leadenham. Professor Eric Holub (right), from the University of Warwick, said the beans had been created from 'conventional plant breeding'

The beans were harvested on 28 September - almost a month before traditional crops are ready for harvest, when storms and heavy rainfall tend to become a fixture of the British weather.

Princes produce 264million tins of beans every year for Branston foods and supermarkets' own-brands.

David McDiarmid from the company said they were 'very proud' to have secured the first supply of British-grown haricot beans.

'There is a lot of work going on in the food industry in terms of alternate sources, particularly with one eye on greater self-sufficiency for the UK, or the environmental angle,' he said.

You've bean beaten! Supermarket own-brand baked beans defeat more expensive rivals in annual blind test... so which is your favourite?

Supermarket own-label baked beans have beaten their more expensive branded rivals in a blind taste test - with two cheaper cans being voted the best.

Asda's own-brand baked beans, costing 50p a tin, which is less than half the price of big competitors, achieved the top score of 77 per cent in the Which? test for flavour, appearance, texture and aroma.

Joint cheapest Aldi came second with a score of 75 per cent, while Branston's 90p cans took third place with 74 per cent, losing points for the pulses being 'too firm'.

Own-brand offerings from Co-op, M&S, Sainsbury's and Lidl all scored higher than Heinz and HP, which managed 71 per cent and 67 per cent respectively.

Tasters praised the texture of the Heinz sauce and beans but more than a third reported that the flavour was 'too weak'.

Shoppers in Newham eat the least meat, according to fascinating data that tracks London's diets.

Just 10.2 per cent of food purchases in the borough, home to the likes of Stratford and West Ham, are red meat, poultry or fish.

For comparison, the figure stands closer to 14.9 per cent in Enfield, in the north of the capital. 

Borough-by-borough figures ""” which MailOnline has compiled into a set of eleven interactive maps ""” are based on purchases of London residents who shop at Tesco.

It is based on the percentage of food purchased by weight. For example, if someone bought one kilogram of food and 500g was red meat, then half of their purchases would be made up of red meat. 

Your browser does not support iframes.

The NHS has warned for years that eating too much red or processed meat can raise the risk of bowel cancer. 

It urges Brits to only eat a maximum of 70g per day, equivalent to about 490g/week. This is the equivalent of 16 bacon rashers or roughly two pork chops a week.

As well as the gap in red meat, dairy intake varies quite drastically across the city.

The one-off data, based on 420million purchases by Clubcard users at 411 stores in 2015, revealed dairy accounted for just 5.7 per cent in Enfield and 5.8 per cent in Barking and Dagenham and Havering respectively. 

But it was as high as 8.3 per cent in the City of London. 

WHAT SHOULD A BALANCED DIET LOOK LIKE? 



Source: NHS Eatwell Guide 

It comes amid a backdrop of health-conscious consumers ditching dairy over environmental concerns and health fears including digestion or skin issues.

The data, published in the journal, CABI Agriculture and Bioscience, does not reflect trends over time.  

Newham was also among the boroughs with the fewest poultry purchases (4.1 per cent), joined only by Sutton and the City of London (both 4.3 per cent). 

At the other end of the scale came Enfield (6.1 per cent) and Lambeth (5.8 per cent). 

Kensington and Chelsea also accounted for the highest animal-product purchasing area, at 24.7 per cent. 

It was followed by Hammersmith and Fulham and Lambeth (both 24 per cent). 

Just under a fifth, or 19.5 per cent, of purchases were animal products in Newham, the data showed.  

Animal-heavy diets risk the health of our planet, experts say, as livestock farming on a massive scale destroys habitats and generates greenhouse gases.

However, some experts have claimed the impact of livestock on climate change has been overstated and that getting people to give up on meat is a 'fantasy'. 

The north London borough of Barnet and the City of London were the biggest fruit and vegetable consumers (both above 40 per cent).

On the opposite end of the scale were Newham (31.9 per cent) and Croydon (33.6 per cent). 

Researchers noted that older residents were more likely to eat less meat, contrary to previous research suggesting veggies are likely to be younger.

'This may be explained by older people tending to eat less overall. It may also be a case of meat-reducers ""” as opposed to strict vegetarians ""” being more likely to be older or middle-aged,' they said.

'Advocates should consider this when planning which groups to target for meat reduction advocacy.'

But residents with fewer educational qualifications and more conservative political views also purchased less meat, researchers discovered. 

'It was also somewhat surprising to see higher consumption of meat products associated with higher average education and a lower proportion of council seats belonging to the Conservative party,' they noted.

'Again, these associations are contrary to existing research, which generally shows that vegetarians, vegans, and meat-reducers are more likely to be more educated and left-leaning.' 

Spring and summer saw the highest sale of animal product across the capital, with May logging the highest overall food sales.

November, meanwhile, recorded the lowest consumption of meat (1.44 thousand Kgs) and animal products (2.49 thousand Kgs) by Londoners. 

It comes as data on Brits weekly food purchasing habits, gathered annually by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, last month also revealed Brits are eating less meat , potatoes and bread than ever before. Meanwhile, rice and pasta have enjoyed massive booms. Alcohol consumption has also increased over time but this data only goes back to 1992

The DEFRA data showed that red meat consumption has plunged by up to 81 per cent since the 70s, while sales of poultry and fish have doubled. This chart shows how much meat Brits have purchased on average each week, the most recent data for 2022 shows a massive drop compared to historic levels (data doesn't include fish)

But researchers acknowledged they only opted to use Tesco Clubcard data. Millions of Londoners also shop at other supermarkets and food stores. 

Other limitations also included the timeframe analysed, with trends on meat and animal product consumption likely to have slumped since 2015. 

Geographically, consumption of meat and animal products is likely to be lower in London compared to other regions of the UK, experts believe. 

A 2021 survey of UK diets found almost a quarter (24 per cent) of Londoners were meat-free, compared to just 14 per cent of the country overall. 

The Tesco categories of 'readymade', sweets, fats, oils and sauces may or may not have also contained animal products, researchers acknowledged. 

By failing to count them as either, some animal product may have been overlooked ""” particularly in the 'readymade' category which includes both meat-based and plant-based foods.

It comes as data on Brits weekly food purchasing habits, gathered annually by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, last month also revealed Brits are eating less meat, potatoes and bread than ever before.

I'm a vegan activist - I show McDonald's customers pictures of slaughterhouses and factory farms and ask them: 'How can you claim to love animals with the same mouth you chew their bodies with?'

A vegan activist who confronts McDonald's customers with pictures of factory farming and slaughterhouses has urged Brits to rethink their diet choices as 'we're a nation of animal lovers'.

Tarion Partridge, 25, has been vegan for over five years - an activist for three of those - and said that as we live in 'the easiest place to be vegan', it makes it even 'more of an injustice' to not be one yourself.

According to YouGov tracking, despite increasing commercialisation and accommodation of the vegan lifestyle, the proportion of the UK population has remained at roughly two or three per cent since records began in 2019.

Speaking to MailOnline, Ms Partridge asked: 'How can you claim to love animals with the same mouth you chew their bodies with?

'People are very ignorant to what happens. They don't witness the slaughter, they just see these packaged up bodies.'

Tarion Partridge (pictured) is a vegan activist who confronts customers and staff at fast food restaurants about the meat industry, as well as investigating the farms which provide its supply

The 25-year-old activist's social media platforms are flooded with videos of her debating the morality of eating meat with members of the public

Ms Partridge's TikTok and other social media pages are flooded with clips of her and meat-eaters clashing over the morality of eating animals.

Her posts range from confronting customers at fast-food chains, to discussing veganism on the street and even clashing with employees at fast-food restaurants who ask her to not show pictures of animals in factory farms or slaughterhouses to their customers.

Responses range from people trying to quietly brush her off, many seeming sympathetic with her motivations but not her cause and the occasional few who take real issue with being challenged.

In one video from November 2023, Ms Partridge stops someone on their way to order a meal at McDonald's and asks if she likes animals.

The customer replies to say 'I do but I'm not going to stop eating them'.

She continued: 'I like meat, it's just nature.'

As the woman leaves Ms Partridge tells her to order the chain's vegan burger: 'If you care about animals, you should live in alignment with that and be vegan.'

Some meetings are more confrontational than that.

'Most of the reactions I've had are pretty good,' she recounted, 'but I had a bit more of tougher one in KFC once where this lady was super unhappy, and was like, ""you know people are being killed in the world, and why would we care about chickens?""

'And I said to her that I don't kill people or chickens, because that doesn't really have any relevance.'

Staff at the chain were then asking her to leave, but she resisted until they threatened to call the police. 

But any of the more nerve-wracking interactions do not deter her, and she says that when she is feeling uncomfortable, 'I just have to think of the animals'. 

'You can't really spread a message without getting out there and sometimes pushing the boundaries, doing something a little bit controversial,' she said.

'People want activists to be silent. They don't want to feel guilty. But if you look throughout history activists are never silent.

'Those who have the privilege to know have the duty to act.' 

She also discusses the meat industry with people n the street, and says that most of her feedback from those she speaks to has been positive

Ms Partridge added that as the UK is one of the easiest places to be vegan, it is 'more of an injustice' not to be

Pictured: Ms Partridge as a teenager with her dog Saxon, when she had an 'epiphany' while eating chicken and wondered what the real difference was between that and her beloved pet

The 25-year-old was raised in Lincolnshire as a meat-eater, but had an 'epiphany' aged 15 when she was eating chicken and wondered what the real difference was between that and her beloved dog, Saxon.

She went vegetarian straight away and a few years later upon realising that much of the dairy industry involves calves being removed from their mothers within hours of their birth, she took the leap to go vegan.

'I think I'm a compassionate person,' she said, 'and I want to live in a line with that.'

But it took until January 2020, when Ms Partridge met her partner and vegan activist Joey Carbstrong, that she began going even further by protesting against and researching the meat and dairy industry. 

However, she pushes back on the common assertion that vegans are 'extreme' or 'overbearing'.

'I get called extreme and pushy and all things like that all the time,' she admitted, 'but I just think that you have to push back on that and think: What's more extreme, me showing the people what they pay for, or the fact that they pay for animals to be tortured in farms and violently executed in murder factories?

'If I was in a dog meat restaurant showing footage of dogs struggling in fear and being murdered, I'd be a hero. 

'Nobody would be saying, 'that's extreme,' but because I'm defending pigs, chickens and cows, all of a sudden I'm extreme?

'That highlights the speciesism in our society. People need to realise that there's no moral difference between a dog and the animals that people eat.'

One of Ms Partridge's views that people might find extreme, though, or at least counter-intuitive, comes in response to one of the replies she often gets from the public.

Animals eaten by consumers are bred specifically for that purpose - they would not exist if they were never going to be eaten - but she is would rather live in a world without those billions of animals altogether.

She said: 'I think if I was an animal I would rather not exist than exist in a body where I'm suffering and where I'm gonna be sent to a murder factory'

While Ms Partridge insists that 'there will be a day where we look back with pure shame and regret' at our meat consumption, meat-free enterprises are struggling to stay afloat, with Heather Mills' (pictured) VBites the latest business to fall into administration

'They shouldn't exist like this,' she asserted, 'chickens have been bred to grow at this accelerated rate, turkeys as well.

'I think if I was an animal I would rather not exist than exist in a body where I'm suffering and where I'm gonna be sent to a murder factory.'  

While Ms Partridge insists that 'there will be a day where we look back with pure shame and regret' at our meat consumption, meat-free enterprises are struggling to stay afloat.

The cost of living crisis has had a doubly bad effect on the industry, with consumers turning back to meat and dairy to save cash, at a time when business would have been more expensive anyway.

Heather Mills' VBites is the latest plant-based brand to fall into administration, following the falling sales of beyond meat and closures of roughly half of the UK's Veggie Pret stores.

Sir Paul McCartney's ex-wife Ms Mills blamed 'nefarious practices' and a 'litany of lies' from animal-related rivals for the collapse of her vegan food empire.

WILDLIFE

GHOSTS IN THE HEDGEROW 

by Tom Moorhouse (Doubleday £16.99, 263pp)

When did you last see a hedgehog? Unless you're very lucky, you probably haven't set eyes on one for years, possibly decades.

Once a familiar sight meandering down country lanes at dusk, or snuffling through gardens in search of food, hedgehogs are now classed as vulnerable to extinction in the UK. Children who have grown up reading Beatrix Potter's The Tale Of Mrs Tiggy-Winkle may never see a live hedgehog.

It's commonly accepted that hedgehog numbers have fallen from 36 million in the 1950s to 550,000 today, although author Tom Moorhouse, a conservation research scientist, points out that these figures are pretty unreliable. Stock image used

How did it come to this? After all, we are a nation of hedgehog lovers; a 2016 survey of Britain's favourite mammals put the hedgehog in first place.

They are tranquil, easy-going creatures who feel quite comfortable living close to humans, they don't dig up your lawn or eat your plants and there can be few people who wouldn't be delighted to have one ambling around their garden.

It's commonly accepted that hedgehog numbers have fallen from 36 million in the 1950s to 550,000 today, although author Tom Moorhouse, a conservation research scientist, points out that these figures are pretty unreliable.

Hedgehogs are notoriously difficult to count because they roam far and wide, and attaching a tracking device to them is tricky. Whatever the actual numbers, though, no one is in any doubt that there has been a calamitous collapse in the hedgehog population.

So who is to blame? Moorhouse's first suspect is the motor car. During the period when hedgehogs have declined most sharply, the number of cars went up sixfold. Male hedgehogs are particularly active on summer evenings in their search for a mate and as they're slow movers, many of them get squashed by cars.

Hedgehogs are notoriously difficult to count because they roam far and wide, and attaching a tracking device to them is tricky. Stock image used

Suspect number two is the badger. Badgers not only eat the same kinds of beetles, worms and caterpillars as hedgehogs do, depleting their food supply, they also eat hedgehogs.

Next, Moorhouse points the finger at agriculture. As the name suggests, the hedgehog is very partial to hedges, which are safe spots for nesting and hibernation, as well as being a good place to find food. In 1940, when hedgehogs were still a common sight, there were about a million kilometres of hedgerows in Britain.

Within 40 years, 60 per cent had been removed as part of a huge drive to increase field sizes, while the use of pesticides soared. The result was disastrous for birds, as well as hedgehogs.

In other words, Moorhouse says, 'Modern life has ganged up on a beloved animal'.

Yet there is a glimmer of hope, and it comes from Britain's 22 million gardeners. Surveys suggest the hedgehog population is gently increasing in urban areas. A quarter of the average village or town is made up of gardens, and by making small changes to our own plots we can make them hedgehog-friendly.

To ensure hedgehogs can travel between gardens, cut a hole the size of a CD case at the bottom of the fence. Put food down for them (meat-based cat and dog food does nicely); supplementary food results in bigger litters and increases their survival prospects. And pick up your postman's discarded rubber bands, as hedgehogs eat them, thinking they're worms, and avoid using chemicals. Above all, Moorhouse writes, we should stop being so tidy. A messy garden, with log piles and long grass to attract insects, plus water, is just what wildlife needs.

Behind Moorhouse's relentlessly jaunty tone, you sense his despair. Despite his best efforts, he admits, he hasn't managed to attract a hedgehog into his own garden.

Yet this inspiring book points out that plants and insects have the ability to bounce back quickly and if that happened, the hedgehogs would follow, with a little help from us.

It doesn't seem a lot to ask in return for the possibility of one day seeing a spiny rump disappearing into the undergrowth.

Time is running out for humanity to curb global warming that will plunge the planet into disastrous flooding, heatwaves and famines, a major UN report warns.

The study by hundreds of leading scientists says the world is 'nearing the point of no return' - but could still prevent catastrophe.

Deep cuts to greenhouse gas emissions need to start happening across the world, or temperatures on Earth will shoot past efforts to limit heating to 1.5C (2.7F), according to the report.

And every fraction of a degree of warming will 'intensify' the hazards to the planet, the report warns.

Devastating impacts will include melting of ice caps leading to rising sea levels, a loss of coral reefs and glaciers, as well as huge economic damage to agriculture, forestry, fishery, energy, and tourism.

Time is running out for humanity to curb dangerous global warming that will plunge the planet into disastrous flooding, heatwaves and famines, a major UN report warns

Every fraction of a degree of warming will 'intensify' the hazards to the planet, the report warns. Devastating impacts will include melting of ice caps leading to rising sea levels, a loss of coral reefs and glaciers, as well as huge economic damage to agriculture, forestry, fishery, energy, and tourism

The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) synthesis report has been agreed after a week of discussions in Interlaken, Switzerland.

How can we reduce carbon emissions? 

The way to cut carbon dioxide emissions, the report argues, is to expand solar and wind energy, encourage 'active travel', walking and cycling, planting trees and conserving 30-50 per cent of the planet for nature. 

It also calls for us to shift to 'healthy diets' in which we eat more vegetables, grains and beans and less meat.

It says the science is 'unequivocal' that humans have caused climate change.

The report warns that the Earth is currently on course for global warming of around 2.7C (4.8F) between 2081 and 2100 assuming an 'intermediate' level of greenhouse gas emissions, but it could be as low as 1.4C (2.5F) if emissions go 'very low' but as high as 4.4C (7.9F) if they go 'very high'.

But it says the damage can be halted by 'deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions would lead to a discernible slowdown in global warming within around two decades'.

To do so, the world will need to cut carbon dioxide emissions compared to 1990 levels by 48 per cent by 2030; by 65 per cent by 2035; by 80 per cent by 2040 and by 99 per cent in 2050. 

In effect, the report urges that the world has to get as close as possible to 'net zero' emissions in just 17 years time.

Governments agreed in Paris almost eight years ago to try to limit temperature rise to 1.5C (2.7F) or at least keep it well below 2C (3.6F).

Since then, scientists have increasingly argued that any warming beyond the lower threshold would put humanity at grave risk.

Average global temperatures have already increased by 1.1C (2F) since the 19th century.

The world will need to cut carbon dioxide emissions compared to 1990 levels by 48 per cent by 2030; by 65 per cent by 2035; by 80 per cent by 2040 and by 99 per cent in 2050

Met Office Climate Scientist Dr Chris Jones, one of the report's authors said: 'Today's report reveals the sheer scale of the ambition required to avoid the worst consequences of climate change.

'We know that climate change is already happening, and the world has already witnessed extreme events associated with the relatively modest warming we have seen so far. 

'In fact, the world now is the coolest it is going to be, at least for many decades.

'The report underscores the need for urgent action - today's decisions have implications for future generations. 

'Without immediate and equitable mitigation and adaptation, climate change increasingly threatens societies and human wellbeing. 

'But the report also shows the range of currently available and cost-effective mitigation and adaptation options. 

One hopeful note in the report is that health benefits from reducing the use of fossil fuels to stop global warming will provide economic returns greater than the cost of cutting emissions

'Renewed efforts to invest in sustainable development give us the best chance of a climate-resilient future.'

Earth's carbon dioxide SUPER-EMITTERS revealed: NASA map identifies the countries pumping out unprecedented levels of the greenhouse gas - READ MORE 

Earth's carbon dioxide super-emitters have been revealed in a new NASA map that shows just how much greenhouse gases are being pumped out by over 100 countries

One hopeful note in the report is that health benefits from reducing the use of fossil fuels to stop global warming will provide economic returns greater than the cost of cutting emissions.

Commenting on the report, Professor Bill Collins, Professor of Climate Processes, University of Reading, said: 'This latest report sets out the exciting possibility of a sustainable future. 

'While some have worried about the cost of this, a key finding from this report is that there will be substantial benefits to air quality (such as ground-level ozone) from moving away from fossil fuel economies.

'The economic returns from these immediate health benefits are assessed to be greater than the costs incurred even before accounting for all the future climate benefits.'

The way to cut carbon dioxide emissions, the report argues, is to expand solar and wind energy, encourage 'active travel', walking and cycling, planting trees and conserving 30-50 per cent of the planet for nature. 

It also calls for us to shift to 'healthy diets' in which we eat more vegetables, grains and beans and less meat,

Another key finding in the report is that carbon capture and storage - sucking carbon dioxide out of the air and holding it underground - will be vital in efforts to limit global warming.

The new synthesis report will play a crucial role when governments gather in Dubai in December for this year's U.N. climate talks.

The meeting will be the first to take stock of global efforts to cut emissions since the Paris deal, and hear calls from poorer nations seeking more aid.

Professor Pierre Friedlingstein, Chair in Mathematical Modelling of Climate Systems at the University of Exeter, said of the report: 'To me, the one single sentence from the report that says it all is the following: ""The choices and actions implemented in this decade will have impacts now and for thousands of years.""'

THE PARIS AGREEMENT: A GLOBAL ACCORD TO LIMIT TEMPERATURE RISES THROUGH CARBON EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS

The Paris Agreement, which was first signed in 2015, is an international agreement to control and limit climate change.

It hopes to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2°C (3.6ºF) 'and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C (2.7°F)'.

It seems the more ambitious goal of restricting global warming to 1.5°C (2.7°F) may be more important than ever, according to previous research which claims 25 per cent of the world could see a significant increase in drier conditions. 









The Paris Agreement on Climate Change has four main goals with regards to reducing emissions:

1)  A long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels

2) To aim to limit the increase to 1.5°C, since this would significantly reduce risks and the impacts of climate change

3) Governments agreed on the need for global emissions to peak as soon as possible, recognising that this will take longer for developing countries

4) To undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with the best available science

Greengrocers have 'queues out the door' despite veg crisis: Shops and market stalls are teaming with fresh fruit and vegetables - as shop boss warns supermarkets will be forced to hike prices

Independent greengrocers which have remained fully stocked despite the ongoing vegetable shortage say they have seen 'queues out the door' - while supermarket shelves are left bare. 

Thomas Hagon, 39, from Reg The Veg green grocers in Clifton, Bristol, claimed 'the produce is there for supermarkets to purchase but higher prices have turned the chains off'.

Meanwhile, Baz Dawson, owner of Fresh and Fruity, in Preston, revealed his salad stocks have not been directly affected because he buys locally, as he urged people to head to their local market stalls.

And Paul Semple, 43, manager at Lloyds Greengrocer, in Bristol, said his footfall is up 10 per cent, with new customers telling him they 'can't believe how stocked up' his shop is. 

It comes as the likes of Aldi, Morrisons, Asda and Tesco have limited sales of tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers as frosty weather in Spain and Morocco has hit imports - with customers in all four stores given limits to how much produce they can buy. 

But despite an increase in cost price, Mr Hagon claims greengrocers have been able to remain stocked up, and says he has fresh tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers because 'customers are happy to pay extra for them'.

He predicted supermarkets will be forced to increase prices in the near future - after Environment Secretary Therese Coffey warned the crisis could last for another month, as she advised struggling families to turn to British vegetables such as turnips. 

Meanwhile, some restaurants struggling to cope with the shortages have been forced to remove tomato-dependent items such as pizza and pasta from their menus.

Mr Hagon said Reg The Veg had a period of low stock a few weeks ago when supermarkets were selling the vegetables at a lower price.

But since the wholesale price has reportedly nearly doubled, averaging at £15 before and now as much as £30, Mr Hagon said supermarkets 'won't pay it', while greengrocers, like Reg The Veg, will.

He said: 'We had shortages due to availability and low numbers about three weeks ago and supermarkets were still pumping out vegetables at low prices.

'It's got to the point where now supermarkets can't buy it at the right price as it's increased so much.

'It is available they just won't pay the money for it.

'Whereas we can, and we can then supply our customers and pass on the slight increase in price.

'We've still had to increase our own prices in some areas - cherry vine tomatoes are now £9.99 a kilo which is around double the normal price.

'We do say to customers that these peppers or tomatoes for example can be quite expensive but they're happy to pay that.

'Of course, nationally it's very difficult because of the volumes that supermarkets get in, but if they're quoted £25 or £30 pounds for a wholesale shipment, and they wont pay for it.'

Why are there shortages of fruit and veg in the UK? Rising prices, heating costs and bad weather abroad are all blamed

What is causing the shortages? 

Cold weather in Spain and Morocco has drastically hit the availability of vegetables in British markets along with soaring energy prices.



The supply problems are blamed on bad weather and high energy costs making greenhouses more costly to heat.

Some critics have cited red tape on post-Brexit imports from the EU as an issue.

Tim O'Malley, of major importer Nationwide Produce, said volatile growing conditions had seen wholesale spot prices for fresh produce lines soar by as much as 300 per cent.

Growers in Spain and elsewhere on the Continent are reportedly sending produce to European supermarkets rather than to the UK because they are more willing to pay the higher prices.

High energy prices - linked to Russia's invasion of Ukraine - are also a factor because it has become more expensive to heat greenhouses.

Which fruit and veg are affected?

 The problem started with tomatoes but has since widened to peppers, cucumbers, lettuce, salad bags, broccoli, cauliflower and raspberries.

Is Brexit to blame? 

While some critics have cited red tape on imports from Europe, industry expert Mr O'Malley said the single biggest factor behind the crisis was 'Mother Nature'.

He said: 'I can honestly say that in the 40 years I've been in this trade, I've never seen such high spot prices across such a broad range of products for such a prolonged period of time.'

He added: 'It's not about Brexit - it's about different buying models'. 

Farming minister Mark Spencer said at the NFU conference yesterday: 'What has driven some of this is a frost in Morocco and Spain in November and December. 

'This can damage a lot of the salad and brassica crops, which we have traditionally relied on at this time of year so that has created a gap in the market.

'It's very difficult for UK producers to grow cauliflowers, for example over winter. They are not resistant to frost. It's not possible to grow cauliflowers in January in the United Kingdom unless you grow them in a greenhouse.'

Why are European supermarkets not suffering from shortages?

Experts say that it is because of the way that British supermarkets buy produce compared to those on the continent.

Tim O'Malley says retailers in the UK tend to agree prices once or twice a year so they and shoppers can get certainty on price.

This tends to be a winter deal for produce from Spain and Morocco and a summer deal for UK produce.

Mr O'Malley says that in Europe they tend to agree monthly prices, meaning that supermarkets find it easier to buy when prices change.



Adam Leyland, Editor-in-Chief of The Grocer, said that UK supermarkets are 'in denial' and need to be more nimble to avoid shortages like the current one.

What are the other factors? 

Travel disruption including ferry cancellations have also caused disruption.

There has been strong winds disrupting ferries from Morocco and flooding in the country. 

Frost has also slowed growth and damaged crops. 

How long will it last? 

Phil Pearson, group development director at APS Produce said delays are likely to continue until, 'the end of April into May.'

Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, which represents UK supermarkets, said: 'Difficult weather conditions in the south of Europe and northern Africa have disrupted harvest for some fruit and vegetables including tomatoes and peppers.

'While disruption is expected to last a few weeks, supermarkets are adept at managing supply chain issues and are working with farmers to ensure that customers are able to access a wide range of fresh produce.'

One of his colleagues said there were queues stretching out the door on Sunday after customers scrambled for tomatoes and peppers.

She initially wasn't sure why but then realised it may have been down to the supermarket shortage. 

Mr Hagon said he isn't sure what the solution to the problem is, but that it will probably result in supermarkets having to charge more.

He said conditions on the continent have left prices at an 'exceptionally high' rate.

He added: 'I don't know what the solution is to it, they'll just have to charge more - some fruit or veg hasn't gone up for a decade or more.

'When there's more competition from other European countries that supply produce it'll bring prices down - It's always high at this time of the year, it's just exceptionally high at the moment.

'We've seen the cold weather in Morocco. They've got snow - it's crazy.

'We've got used to eating what we want to eat all year round so when things go a bit short it can be a bit of a shock.'

Other greengrocers have also found themselves with no choice but to double their prices.

Paul Semple, 43, of Lloyds Green Grocers in Bristol, said: 'Tomatoes are hard to get, courgette, cucumbers all hard to get hold of.

'They're twice the price, that's how scarce they are.

'It's always hard to get produce this time a year but this year we're nearly at £10 a kilo for tomatoes when we rarely go above £5.

'We're still getting the gear, just prices are up and very expensive.'

Another fruit and veg trader urged people to head to their local market stalls for fresh groceries.

Baz Dawson, owner of Fresh and Fruity, in Preston, revealed his salad stocks have not been directly affected during the national shortage because he buys locally.

The Preston Market trader said that while big supermarkets will now struggle to get hold of their usual cheaper items from abroad, he will continue to buy from farmers in Lancashire and the surrounding areas.

Four of the UK's leading supermarkets - Tesco, Aldi, Asda and Morrisons - have put limitations in place on the amount of certain items customers can buy.

The problem started with tomatoes but has since widened to peppers, cucumbers, lettuce, salad bags, broccoli, cauliflower and raspberries.

Tesco and Aldi have introduced limits of three per customer on sales of tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers. Asda is limiting customers to three on sales of lettuce, salad bags, broccoli, cauliflowers and raspberry punnets, along with tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers. Morrisons has set a limit of two on cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce and peppers.

Mr Dawson says it is the international transportation that has got the supermarkets in a pickle, with fewer places for them to buy their goods.

But because traders like him keep things local, they are not worried about stocks lasting. 

He says every day can be different when it comes to buying locally and because of that, he is less worried he'll face what the supermarkets are currently dealing with.

Mr Dawson said: 'We only deal with top end fresh fruits, veg and salads. There's currently such a national shortage on salads and foreign vegetables.

'We go to the wholesalers and buy either direct or off the farmer or the wholesaler to cut costs, but to stick with the quality. 

'With it being such a struggle nationally, the supermarkets will struggle but with us going direct to the wholesalers, we can still get hold of limited salad stock.

'Most of our vegetables are grown and cut within a ten mile radius during certain seasons of the year. Even for us, when we're in the depths of winter we sometimes have to go for the cheaper produce too.

'Supermarkets have not got the stock of salads in now whatsoever but here we do have, from the wholesaler. 

'Because they haven't got it in the supermarket, like they didn't when the pandemic hit, they come to us in the market to buy fresh produce and salad. We keep going, like we did two years ago.'

Fluctuating stocks can occur daily in the market trade, Mr Dawson says, but having already dealt with it since the day he began selling, he says the fear of low stocks of certain items is less of a fear.

In the winter months the UK imports around 95 per cent of its tomatoes and 90 per cent of its lettuces, mostly from Spain and northern Africa. The British Retail Consortium said disruption was expected to last a few weeks.

Retailers have stressed that buying limits are temporary until supplies improve in the coming days or weeks, helped by the UK moving into its growing season.

It comes after the Environment Secretary suggested yesterday that Brits could consider eating turnips to ease the national vegetable shortage. 

Farmers also warned of a shortage of leeks that is likely to hamper St David's Day celebrations in Wales next week.

Therese Coffey told MPs the 'temporary' shortages were caused by 'very unusual weather' but were expected to end in another four weeks.

Ms Coffey said that consumers might want to turn to British 'specialisms' at this time of year to support domestic farmers.

She added: 'I am led to believe by my officials... we anticipate the situation will last about another two to four weeks.

'Even if we cannot control the weather it is important that we try and make sure the supply continues to not be frustrated in quite the way it has been due to these unusual weather incidents.'

Salad fans told to buy Micro Tom plant that can produce 6,000 cherry tomatoes in a year 

Salad fans are being urged to start growing a super plant that can yield thousands of tomatoes in case the fruit and veg shortage continues into summer.

The Micro Tom is a small plant that has been known to produce a staggering 6,000 cherry tomatoes in a single year.

In contrast, people can only expect to harvest 200 tomatoes from a regular plant.

Greenfingered Joy and Michael Michaud are encouraging growers to get hold of hanging baskets and start planting seeds now to enjoy a steady supply of tomatoes from June through to November.

Last year, Joy, from West Bexington, Dorset, kept a tally of the number she was picking and all her plants produced 5,000 to 6,000 tomatoes each.

She said they 'couldn't eat them fast enough' and had to give away bags of toms to neighbours to save them from the compost heap.

Joy, 64, said: 'We recommend that people enjoy the winter vegetables during this shortage and get planting to ensure a supply of delicious tomatoes in summer.

'If people can get hold of hanging baskets and polytunnels that will be the perfect environment to grow them in through March and April.

'Homegrown tomatoes always taste better than shop bought ones and this way people can make sure they have plenty to eat.

'Last year I was struggling to count the number I was picking off our Micro Tomato plants.

'Every plant we had produced around 6,000 tomatoes each. We couldn't believe it, they are miracle plants.

'I set an initial target of 1,000 tomatoes a plant but we quickly passed that and I set another one at 5,000.

'That is thousands more than you could expect to get from a normal tomato plant. It's just an incredible variety.

'While the tomatoes are small they're very tasty - they're little balls of flavour.'

Joy and Michael run Sea Spring Seeds and grow and sell seeds for 150 types of chilli.

Ms Coffey agreed with Tory MP Selaine Saxby who suggested eating seasonal vegetables could solve the issue. 

Ms Saxby said: 'We should be eating more seasonally and supporting our own British farmers', adding that if shoppers did so, 'a lot of these problems would be avoided'.

Ms Coffey said: 'It's important to make sure that we cherish the specialisms that we have in this country. 

'A lot of people would be eating turnips right now rather than thinking necessarily about... lettuce and tomatoes and similar, but I'm conscious that consumers want a year-round choice and that is what our supermarkets, food producers and growers around the world are trying to satisfy.'

Labour's environment spokesman Jim McMahon questioned suggestions that food shortages were entirely caused by external forces, claiming ministers could have done more to support farmers with access to 'the energy-intensive support scheme', and increased quotas on labour to help with workforce shortages.

Conservative former minister Sir Desmond Swayne ridiculed suggestions that Brexit was responsible for the shortages. 

He told the Commons: 'If only I had been told before I voted for Brexit that it was going to cause frosts in Morocco, I could have made a different decision, couldn't I?'

Asked about the turnip suggestion, a No 10 spokesman said: 'We don't believe it's for us to tell people what they should or shouldn't buy.' 

He added: 'What the Secretary of State was doing was setting out the importance of celebrating the produce that we grow here in the UK.'

Ms Coffey drew further criticism for suggesting people struggling to afford food bills could consider working more hours.

She said: 'One of the best ways to boost their incomes is not only to get into work if they're not in work already, but potentially to work some more hours.'

After the debate, Labour's Rachael Maskell accused Ms Coffey of 'shifting blame for food poverty on to people because they are on low wages and are poor'.

Budget supermarket food is seeing average annual price rises of an astonishing 21.5 per cent.

A Which? study found the poorest homes were the worst hit.

Some products have seen huge increases, such as tins of Growers Harvest sliced carrots up 63 per cent at Tesco to 33p, and packs of pork sausages at Asda up 58 per cent to £1.27. Budget Creamfields French brie also saw a 96.6 per cent rise at Tesco to £1.57.

Farmers are warning of an 'extraordinary' shortage of leeks which threatens St David's Day celebrations in Wales next week.

British producers of the much-loved seasonal vegetable, as well as onions, cauliflower and broccoli, have had to write off crops due to a lack of rain and deep frosts.

Supermarkets including Aldi Morrisons, Asda and Tesco have limited sales of vegetables, but Therese Coffey suggested people could use turnips as a substitute

Leek yields were down by as much as 30 per cent following the 'most difficult growing season ever'

Some supermarkets have already run out of leeks, while the ones that do reach the shelves are often of poor quality and stunted - bad news for anyone planning to serve up traditional dishes such as a Welsh cawl or Wrexham bake on March 1.

Leek Growers Association chairman Tim Casey said yields were down by as much as 30 per cent following the 'most difficult growing season ever'. He added: 'We are predicting the supply of home-grown leeks will be exhausted by April, with no British leeks in the shops during May and June.'

Reputedly introduced to Wales by the Phoenicians when they were trading for tin in the British Isles, the leek has long been associated with the Welsh Saint David.

In 640AD, according to legend, the Briton King Cadwaladr and his men wore leeks in their hats to distinguish themselves in battle against invading Saxons. The leek has remained a national symbol ever since.

Causing quite the buzz! Controversial hack for getting rid of wasps using GASOLINE goes viral - but sparks FURY from environmentalists who insist the insects should be 'left alone'

A controversial TikTok trend that involves killing wasps with gasoline has been slammed online.

Reddit users are in uproar over videos showing people using a cup of gasoline and holding it up over wasps' nests to trap the insects, with some clips getting millions of views.

The substance causes the wasps to flee their nest before falling into the cup and drowning in the liquid.

But the act has been deemed 'f***ed up' by Reddit users who have called on people to 'leave them alone' as wasps are highly important insects because they pollinate flowers and kill pests that carry disease which could pose a threat to humans.

TikTok users have been covering small wasp nests with cups of gasoline

One angry Redditor wrote: 'Wasps are a really important part of the ecosystem. Bees right get a lot of credit, but wasps are pollinators and pest controllers in their own right. Killing them en masse when they could be removed by someone who knows what they're doing is a shame really.'

Another wrote: 'Why kill them?!?! And people wonder why there's so many very important parts of our world's ecosystems just go extinct.' 

A third added sarcastically: 'Pretty dope to kill the animals keeping our planet alive.' 

'So are we just gonna genocide our pollinators like that?' someone else said.

A fifth person chimed in: 'They're only wasps. In fact they are pollinators. Just leave them alone, they are part of our ecosystem.'

But others defended the wasp killers, with one Redditor arguing: 'Wasps are aggressive and often make nests near entryways to houses. 

'I don't think we need a wasp genocide or anything like that, but there's nothing wrong with getting rid of the ones that build close to your home.'

Another person wrote: 'Don't need wasps on my house no. Not at all. They can make their nests in the trees, the bushes, whatever. Definitely don't need defensive, aggressive stinging insects in the immediate area I live and walk around in. 













Most Redditors were angry that wasps were being killed, but others didn't mind the trend 

'I'm the kind of person to catch all bugs and spiders and take them outside, but 100% of the time a wasp nest around my door, windows, etc is getting killed.'

A 2018 study, published in the journal Ecological Entomology, says both bees and wasps are two of humanity's most important organisms.

They both pollinate our flowers and crops - but wasps also destroy pests and insects that carry human diseases. 

In Germany, wasps are already on the extinction list, therefore, killing them is illegal and a person can be fined between $5,498 to $54,982, Euro News reported.

'If all the wasps in the world were to go extinct, pest insect populations would rise. These insects would have a more devastating effect on crops which over time would most likely diminish food sources for larger animals and in turn humans,' according to Forest Wildlife.

Instead of supporting an online trend that is harmful to wasps, there are other ways to safely coexist together.

This trend kills dozens of wasps and has sparked uproar on Reddit



When it comes to your next picnic wear light colors, avoiding purple and blue hues that intrigue wasps. 

When choosing sunscreen or perfumes don't go for a lemon scent because it comes off as a bee pheromone which draws in a wasp's attention.

If a wasp gets close, remain calm and collected because they are only inspecting their environment so stay still to signal that you are not a danger to them. 

Insects get an indication of your presence due to your breath, therefore, try holding it for at least 10 seconds so that they no longer sense your presence and leave you alone, Everyday Health suggested.

If you do end up getting stung, wash the area with soap and water, wrap a cold pack around your arm for 10-minute intervals to help prevent swelling, and take an antihistamine such as Benadryl or Claritin. 

If those options don't help and you are having a severe allergic reaction, use an EpiPen at your discretion and go to the hospital immediately for further assistance.

The science director of a biotech firm was sacked for smoking cannabis at work after colleagues smelt 'wacky baccy' in his company car and driving a colleague home whilst high, an employment tribunal heard.

Martyn Jutsum, 67, was fired after he ignored warnings about the need for him to have a 'clear head' at work - where they were handling potentially 'explosive' materials.

The final straw for bosses O3Biotech - a company Mr Jutsum co-founded - was when he 'erratically' drove a female colleague home from work, whilst under the influence of the drug.

During his suspension meeting, the scientist was asked to hand over the keys to the company car and the end of a joint fell out of his pockets which consolidated his bosses' decision to dismiss him, the tribunal heard.

Mr Jutsum - who admitted to using cannabis recreationally - tried to sue the tech firm for unfair dismissal, but his claims have been dismissed.

Martyn Jutsum, 67, was fired after he ignored warnings about the need for him to have a 'clear head' at work, a tribunal heard

Mr Jutsum's behaviour allegedly took place at the Dorset Innovation Park in Weymouth

The tribunal in Bristol heard Mr Jutsum had a background in scientific research and in 2016, he founded the tech company with Paul Draper, becoming science director the following year.

O3Biotech - based in Dorset - provides purification for air, feed and water supplies using ozone treatments to livestock in the agricultural sector.

The tribunal heard O3Biotech rented a five bedroom house near Dorset Innovation Park, Weymouth, which allowed employees to stay closer to work.

Mr Jutsum and his son Matthew were among a number of people to stay in the company house.

Also in the house was the company's Technical Director Erik Helmink.

It was heard Mr Helmink became concerned in early 2022 with what he described as 'excessive behaviour' at the house, in relation to the consumption of alcohol and cannabis.

The 57 year old said although this behaviour was happening outside of work, he was worried that it risked 'spilling over' into the workplace.

Mr Helmink decided to send an email to Mr Jutsum and other housemates, stating that there is a 'zero tolerance of alcohol and joints' in the weeks leading up to one of their projects at the time.

He informed them they would 'monitor each other' on that.

Mr Helmink was concerned that the nature of the company's work meant that they were working on a daily basis with explosive material - such as liquid oxygen - as well as heavy and dangerous machinery.

As such he deemed there was a significant risk to health and safety if something went wrong and he felt it was essential that those involved in the work had a 'clear head'.

Mr Jutsum tried to sue his former company for unfair dismissal however his claims were dismissed

Giving evidence at the tribunal, Mr Jutsum - who was representing himself - accepted that he uses cannabis recreationally and did not object to Mr Helmink's warning that using cannabis during work time could be dangerous.

Mr Helmink stated there were multiple occasions between May and June last year where he noticed a 'strong cannabis smell' on the science director.

In June 2022, Mr Jutsum gave a research analyst a lift back from the office and she told bosses that during this drive she was 'frightened'.

The research analyst reported Mr Jutsum 'drove erratically', appeared not to concentrate and that on a number of occasions, she had to 'draw his attention to cars braking in front of them'.

She was advised to write a statement and Mr Hemink, alongside Mr Draper, made the decision to suspend the science director pending further investigation.

On June 30 last year, they met with Mr Jutsum and told him he was suspended as they suspected he had used cannabis at work.

Mr Jutsum insisted 'he had not hurt anyone' and was surprised at the decision.

It was heard when he was asked to hand over the company car keys, a roach - the end of a joint - fell out of his pocket - but Mr Jutsum insisted this was the butt of an ordinary cigarette end.

At his subsequent disciplinary hearing it was heard that a security guard had made a reference to Mr Jutsum's car smelling of 'wacky baccy'

He denied smoking the drug at work and said the 'smell of cannabis' was in fact herbal cigarettes, but Mr Draper rejected this claim and fired him for misconduct.

Mr Jutsum tried to sue his former company for unfair dismissal.

However, these claims were dismissed.

'[O3Biotech's] disciplinary policy stated that being in possession of or under the influence of drugs at work would be regarded as serious misconduct,' the tribunal's judgement said.

'Mr Draper had reasonable grounds to conclude that Mr Jutsum had been using cannabis at work on 23 June 2023 and had driven the company car, with another employee in it, whilst under the influence of cannabis.

'He was entitled to view that as serious misconduct justifying summary dismissal, particularly given the nature of the work being carried out by [O3Biotech] and the risks to health and safety that this work could involve.'

MailOnline has approached Mr Jutsum for comment.

US finally cracks down on sugar and salt in school meals in new seven-year plan that will mean donuts and muffins can only be served twice a week

New guidelines will significantly reduce the amount of sugar and sodium US children are consuming in their school lunches and breakfasts.

Nutrition standards for school lunches proposed Friday will limit the amount of added sugars in cafeteria meals. It is the first time these types of restrictions will be put in place.

New standards will go into place in the 2025-26 school year. It will reduce sugar in goods such as chocolate milk, cereal and yogurt. It will also limit the number of times per week sweets such as pastries will be made available for breakfast. 

Officials say that more than 15million children eat breakfast and 30million eat lunch at school each day. They want these meals to meet national food guidelines.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports 19.7 percent of US children are obese, as many experts have described it as a crisis. 

Under new guidelines, the amount of sugar allowed in school lunches and breakfasts for children will be limited. Officials hope this will make it so school lunches follow nutrition guidelines (file photo)

The plan announced by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack also seeks to significantly decrease sodium in the meals served to the nation's schoolkids by 2029 while making the rules for foods made with whole grains more flexible.

'School meals happen to be the meals with the highest nutritional value of any meal that children can get outside the home,' Vilsack said in an interview.

The first limits on added sugars would be required in the 2025-2026 school year, starting with high-sugar foods such as sweetened cereals, yogurts and flavored milk products.

Do ultra-processed snacks make up half of YOUR diet? Scientists say you may be more likely to get cancer



Those who ate the most ultra-processed foods had the highest risk of developing all types of cancer.

Under the plan, for instance, an 8-ounce container of chocolate milk could contain no more than 10 grams of sugar. 

Some popular flavored milk now contain twice that amount. 

The plan also limits sugary grain desserts, such as muffins or doughnuts, to no more than twice a week at breakfast.

By the fall of 2027, added sugars in school meals would be limited to less than 10 percent of the total calories per week for breakfasts and lunches.

The proposal also would reduce sodium in school meals by 30 percent by the fall of 2029. 

They would gradually be reduced to align with federal guidelines, which recommend Americans aged 14 and older limit sodium to about 2,300 milligrams(mg) a day, with less for younger children.

Levels would drop, for instance, from an average of about 1,280mg of sodium allowed now per lunch for kids in grades 9 to 12 to about 935mg. 

For comparison, a typical turkey sandwich with mustard and cheese might contain 1,500 milligrams of sodium.

Health experts say cutting back on sugar and salt can help decrease the risk of disease in kids, including obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and other problems that often continue into adulthood.

The plan, detailed in a 280-page document, drew mixed reactions. 

Katie Wilson, executive director of the Urban School Food Alliance, said the changes are 'necessary to help America´s children lead healthier lives.'

But Diane Pratt-Heavner, spokeswoman for the School Nutrition Association, a trade group, said school meals are already healthier than they were a decade ago and that increased regulations are a burden, especially for small and rural school districts.

'School meal programs are at a breaking point,' she said. 'These programs are simply not equipped to meet additional rules.'

Vilsack emphasized that the plan phases changes in over the next six years to allow schools and food manufacturers time to adjust to the new standards.

The changes proposed Friday by the US Secretary of Agriculture will first go into effect during the 2025-26 school year (file photo)

'Our hope is that many school districts and food providers accelerate the timeline on their own,' he said.

Courtney Gaines, president of the Sugar Association, said the proposal ignores the 'many functional roles' sugar plays in food beyond sweetness and encourages the use of sugar substitutes, which have not been fully studied in children. 

Sugar substitutes are allowed under the new standards, Vilsack said.

As part of the plan, agriculture officials are seeking feedback about a proposal that would continue to require that 80 percent of all grains offered in a week must be whole grains. 

But it would allow schools to serve non-whole grain foods, such as white-flour tortillas, one day a week to vary their menus.

Another option suggests serving unflavored nonfat and lowfat milk to the youngest children and reserving chocolate and other flavored milks for high school kids.

A 60-day public comment period on the plan opens Febuary 7.

Shiriki Kumanyika, a community health expert at Drexel University´s Dornsife School of Public Health said if they're done right some of the changes will be hard for kids to notice. 

'They´ll see things that they like to eat, but those foods will be healthier,' she said.

Scientists reveal personality checklist for people who could colonize Mars - Do YOU have what it takes?

Bad news for those who struggle with anxiety, get too competitive or simply choke under pressure: new research suggests that you may have to stay home on Earth while other, more laid-back and 'agreeable' types colonize Mars.

A new study, which is still undergoing peer review, ran computer simulations tracking the progress of human settlements on the Red Planet through their first 28 years of virtual operation. 

'Agreeable personality types were assessed to be the most enduring for the long term,' the researchers found, across all four of the personality types used in their simulations, 'whereas neurotics showed least adaptation capacity.'

The researchers also discovered that the minimum number of settlers needed to operate a human colony on Mars successfully was much lower than expected: just 22 people.  

'Contrary to other literature,' they wrote of their simulated Martian colonies, 'the minimum number of people with all personality types that can lead to a sustainable settlement is in the tens and not hundreds.'

The new simulation drew from a wide pool of data: economics and agricultural papers; a review of the capabilities of the International Space Station; data collected from Antarctic outposts, submarines and more, but not from the 2015 Matt Damon film The Martian (above)

The Four Traits that Will Keep You Alive on Mars

Computational social scientists at George Mason University have zeroed-in on four key attributes that a Martian settler would need to have, if they hope to survive the hardships and sudden tragic surprises of life on the Red Planet. 

Which of these personality traits sound like you? 

Low Competitiveness. The 'agreeable' category, which fared best in the study's simulations, were more cooperative and less 'winner take all' than the 'neurotics' or 'reactives' who both fared the worse. A Martian base divided against itself cannot stand.

Adaptable to Change. The winning 'agreeables' were also programmed to be less obsessed with maintaining any 'stringent routine' ""” which helped make them better poised to handle the unexpected. They were always ready and willing to adapt and survive.

Neither Introverted nor Extroverted. The 'socials,' a category close to the 'agreeables' except for their tendency to 'require social interaction,' came shy of being the best suited to Martian habitation. The reason would appear to be that, while a colonist needs to be capable of working well with others, craving that comradery will inevitably hurt one's ability to accomplish critical tasks that require focus and solitude.

Low Aggressiveness. The 'neurotic' group fared worst, in part, due to their 'highly aggressive interpersonal characteristics,' which often proved fatal when the simulation faced them with a crisis. A colony, it would seem, lives and dies together. There is no 'I' in Mars Colony.

The study's authors, all computational social scientists at George Mason University, input data from a variety of related scenarios to better inform their computer model: economics research and agricultural data; a review of the resource storage and production capabilities of the International Space Station (ISS); data collected from Antarctic research outposts, submarine crews and more.  

'Establishing a human settlement on Mars is an incredibly complex engineering problem,' the researchers said in their draft, posted to arXiv for review. 

'Beyond the technical and engineering challenges,' they wrote, 'future colonists will also face psychological and human behavior challenges.' 

'Our goal is to better understand the behavioral and psychological interactions of future Martian colonists through an Agent-Based Modeling (ABM simulation) approach.'

A mixture of other computer simulation concepts, including game theory and 'evolutionary programming' used to study biological systems, the Agent-Based simulation divided the 'free agent' virtual humans into four basic personality types. 

Their model defined the 'agreeable' type as an individual with 'the lowest degree of competitiveness, low aggressiveness, and not fixated on stringent routine.' 

The 'social' type was defined as 'individuals with a medium degree of competitiveness, extroverted, require social interaction, but are not fixated on stringent routines.' 

By contrast, a personality dubbed 'reactive' has moderate competitiveness and fixation on following their strict routines. 

The model's fourth and final group, the 'neurotics,' had 'a high degree of competitiveness, highly aggressive interpersonal characteristics, and challenged ability to adapt to boredom or a change in routine' ""” making them the least adaptive to the surprise challenges that would come with maintaining a colony on Mars.

The George Mason researchers made a set of generous presumptions on their model, including routine supply shipments from Earth and a nuclear generator capable of supplying steady electricity to the settlement for at least seven years. 

Their Mars colony 'sims' were given the task of mining precious minerals for shipment back to Earth.

'The main focus is on the personality types of colonists selected and how they perform throughout their time on Mars,' they wrote, 'using their skills to mine minerals and react to random resupply shuttle accidents or habitat disasters.'

After running their 'MARS-COLONY Agent-Based Model' five times for 28 simulated years each, and varying the colony's population size from 10 to 170 settlers between runs, they found that the base could operate for decades with just 22 inhabitants. 

After running their 'MARS-COLONY Agent-Based Model' (above) five times for 28 simulated years each, and varying the colony's population size from 10 to 170 settlers between runs, the researchers found that the base could operate for decades with just 22 inhabitants

In future simulations, the researchers plan to experiment with the ratio of personality types among the Martian colonists. Their hope is to find out if a team composed of entirely laid-back 'agreeables' could really best the mixed groups composed of all types from their past trials

Across most of their simulation runs, the researchers found that their settlement could typically bounce back so long as its total population stayed at 10 colonists or above between tragedies and setbacks.  

This proved not to be true for cases where the colony could not bounce back on its own, in between supply missions from Earth that their simulation scheduled for once every 1.5 years.

'The inhospitable nature of the Martian environment requires any habitat to be largely self-sustaining,' they noted. 'The stress caused by accidents, as well as from interacting with other colonists, takes a toll.'

For the social scientists at George Mason, the simulation shows that 'success in extreme environments' can be broadly attributed to 'coping capacity' ""” how people go with the flow during hardship, adapt to unexpected changes, and improvise amid adverse conditions or disasters.

In future simulations, the researchers plan to experiment with the ratio of personality types among the colonists on each Martian base. 

They hope to find out if a team composed of entirely laid-back 'agreeables' could best the mixed groups composed of all types from their past trials.

Climate change is DECIMATING Britain and Ireland's wildlife: More than HALF of native plants including heather and harebell are now in decline, report warns

Climate change is responsible for the decline in 53 per cent of the plants native to Britain and Ireland, a new report has warned.

Continuously rising temperatures, which resulted in the UK's hottest day on record last summer, are forcing the retreat of species that evolved for cooler climates.

For example, the entire British population of Snow Pearlwort now lives only on the snow-capped peaks of Ben Lawers in the Scottish Highlands.

'Plant Atlas 2020', published by the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI), reveals the results of a 20-year study of the country's plant life.

The researchers say that non-native invasive species and intensive agricultural practices have also contributed to the decline of native species.

Nitrogen enrichment from fertilisers, habitat degradation and changes in grazing pressure have led to the decline of species such as Heather and Harebell (pictured)

Dr Kevin Walker, co-author and BSBI head of science, said: 'There are lots we can do to reverse these declines, but the most important are to increase the protection plants receive, extend the habitat available to them, and place their needs at the very heart of nature conservation.

WHY DO NON-NATIVE PLANTS OUTCOMPETE NATIVE SPECIES? 

Non-native plants tend to have escaped from gardens, farms or nurseries, after being imported for their aesthetic or economic value.

They can then out-compete native species, usually because they grow faster, have fewer predators or diseases or are better adapted to environmental conditions.

They may also be able to better tolerate disturbance, like fires or grazing, or more efficiently use natural resources like sunlight or soil nutrients. 

'We also need to ensure that our land, water and soil are managed more sustainably so that plants, and the species which rely upon them for food and shelter, can thrive.'

The report's authors surveyed 3,445 species of plants, ferns and algae in Britain and Ireland, using 30 million plant records collected by almost 9,000 botanists over 178,000 days.

Even though they excluded plants in gardens and crops, they were shocked to find that 1,753 of these wild-growing species were non-native - outweighing the number of native ones.

These foreign plants tend to have escaped from gardens, farms or nurseries, after being imported for their aesthetic or economic value.

They can then out-compete native species, usually because they grow faster, have fewer predators or diseases or are better adapted to environmental conditions. 

Across the Irish Sea, botanists found that 56 per cent of Ireland's native species have declined in range and abundance or both.

It was also found that nine species have been completely lost since 1930, including Summer Lady's Tresses in 1959, and Interrupted Brome in 1972.

A further ten species are known to have been lost before then, and two species went extinct since the survey started in 2000 - the York Ragwort and the Lesser Tongue Orchid.

The researchers said that 62 per cent of Britain's ancient arable wildflowers, such as Corn Marigold (pictured), have declined because grasslands have been reseeded or over-fertilised

DECLINING, THRIVING AND EXTINCT PLANT SPECIES

The report says that British flora has been negatively impacted by changes in agricultural practices since the 1950s, when the last survey was undertaken.

Nitrogen enrichment from fertilisers, habitat degradation and changes in grazing pressure have led to the decline of species such as Lousewort, Heather and Harebell.

Damp meadows being drained have caused a substantial decline in Devil's-bit scabious.

The researchers also said that 62 per cent of Britain's ancient arable wildflowers, such as Corn Marigold, have declined because traditional grasslands have been reseeded or over-fertilised.

Peatland habitats, which act as important stores of carbon, are being impacted by the spread of species such as the Sitka spruce.

This pine tree, first brought to Britain from Alaska in 1831, has spread from commercial plantations to peaty soils, particularly in the north and west of Britain and on high-altitude moorlands.

It is reducing the soil's ability to store carbon and harbour plant life, so the report's botanists said it will have to be carefully managed.

In Ireland, farming and forestry has destroyed many habitats on which wild grassland, wetland and lake plants depend.

The UK's annual average temperature topped 10°C for the first time in 2022, as last year was confirmed as the country's warmest on record. 

It meant that 15 of the country's top 20 warmest years on record have all occurred this century - with the entire top 10 within the past two decades.

This has caused mountain plants that rely on snow lasting late into the spring and summer, like the Highland Cudweed, Drooping Saxifrage and Alpine Lady-fern, to retreat.

But the results aren't all negative; climate change has also helped certain species, like the Bee Orchid, to spread further north.

Some native plants that were thought extinct were also found to still be growing, like the Ghost Orchid, while some non-native species are providing an essential source of nectar or pollen.

Sitka spruce (pictured) has spread from commercial plantations and is regenerating even at high altitudes. It is reducing the peatland soil's ability to store carbon and harbour plant life, so the report's botanists said it will have to be carefully managed

INVASIVE, NON-NATIVE PLANT SPECIES IN THE UK 

Craig Bennett, chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts, said: 'The decline of our beautiful native plants is heart-breaking and has consequences for us all.

'The loss of natural habitats due to modern farming methods over the last 70 years has been an unmitigated disaster for wildflowers and all the species that depend on them including insects, bats and birds. But it's not too late to stop this catastrophe.

'The Government's new farm environment schemes must do what was originally promised and reverse the decline of nature in our agricultural landscape.

'Also, protection for Local Wildlife Sites needs to be increased, and the promise made by the Government at the recent UN biodiversity summit to halve nutrient pollution by 2030 must be honoured.'

The National Farmers' Union (NFU) environment forum chair Richard Bramley said: 'Our farmers are committed to enhancing and improving our landscapes and working to benefit our soil, watercourses and wildlife in a rapidly changing world with huge external pressures.

'In recent decades, farmers have made huge improvements in several areas that this report highlights. 

'For example, more than 10,000 football pitches of habitat have been planted to benefit wildlife such as pollinators.

'It's in all our interests to ensure sustainable, climate friendly British farming in the future, with farmers producing food alongside their work in maintaining and protecting the environment.'

This has caused mountain plants that rely on snow lasting late into the spring and summer, like the Highland Cudweed, Drooping Saxifrage and Alpine Lady-fern (pictured), to retreat

It's a staple feature in kitchens around the world, but it turns out you might be using your fridge wrong.

A new report has revealed that 17 per cent of us keep our fridge at the wrong temperature.

Researchers from RMIT University in Australia say that while the recommended range is 2-7°C (35.6-44.6°F), almost a fifth of households keep their appliance warmer or cooler than this.

Dr Bhavna Middha, lead author of the study, said: 'When food is too warm, bacteria multiply too fast.

'When food is too cold, it can freeze or get freezer burn. Both conditions lead to food spoiling.'

According to Wrap, 9.5 million tonnes of food is wasted in Britain every year - 70 per cent of which was intended to be consumed by people.

'The food that could have been eaten would make the equivalent of over 15 billion meals - enough to feed the entire UK population 3 meals a day for 11 weeks,' it explains on its website.

With households known to be significant contributors to this food waste, the researchers set out to understand the role our fridges play in our food waste behaviours.

The team monitored the fridge and freezer temperatures in 56 households.

They found that 17 per cent of the fridges were warmer or cooler than the recommended range, and also recorded inconsistent temperatures across the different fridge levels.

Some shelves were found to reach 10°C (50°F), while others dropped as low as -1.1°C (30°F).

Strugglers - 20%

Slackers - 41%

'Our research found households in general are unaware their fridges could be making their food spoil faster, especially if the fridge temperature is warmer than the standard,' said Dr Middha.

'Most households blamed their own behaviours, such as reading the use-by date wrong, before considering their fridge might be the culprit.'

Things were even worse for freezers, which should be kept at between -15°C and -20°C (5°F and -4°F), according to the researchers.

Almost half (43 per cent) of the freezers tested were warmer or cooler than this range.

Based on the findings, the researchers are calling for better food storage information for consumers.

'Many households we interviewed said conflicting information about how long food can be kept in the fridge meant a lot of leftovers and uncooked meat was discarded just in case it was unsafe to consume,' said Dr Middha.

'A one-stop advice platform for food storage could be a really useful tool to combat all the conflicting food storage advice that's confusing households.'

According to Wrap, there are several other things your household can do to reduce your food waste. 

This includes using a portion planner and swapping out fresh foods for frozen options which last much longer.  

'By cutting food waste the average UK household can save £500 each year and positively contribute to the UK's waste reduction targets,' Wrap said. 

HOW MUCH FOOD DOES THE WORLD WASTE EACH YEAR?

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, about 2.9 trillion pounds (or a third of the food in the world) is lost or wasted every year.

Fruits, vegetables, roots, and tubers make up the most-wasted foods. 

In industrialized countries, this all amounts to $680 billion in food. In developing countries, it's $310 billion. 

The average waste per capita in Europe and North America is 95-115 kg, or 209-254 lb, ever year.    

The food lost or wasted in Latin America each year is enough to feed 300 million people. In Europe, it could feed 200 million people, and in Africa, it could feed 300 million people.

America's X-37B robot spaceplane blasts off from Florida on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket for secretive mission - two weeks after China launched its own 'Divine Dragon' space drone

The US military's secretive X-37B robot spaceplane blasted off from Florida on Thursday night on its seventh mission, the first launched atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket capable of delivering it to a higher orbit than ever before.

The Falcon Heavy, composed of three liquid-fueled rocket cores strapped together, roared off its launch pad from NASA's Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral in a spectacular liftoff carried live on a SpaceX webcast.

The launch followed more than two weeks of false starts and delays attributed to poor weather and unspecified technical issues, leading ground crews to roll the spacecraft back to its hangar before proceeding with Thursday's flight.

It came two weeks after China's own robot spaceplane, the Shenlong, or 'Divine Dragon,' was launched on its third mission to orbit since 2020, adding a new twist to the growing US-Sino rivalry in space.

The Pentagon has disclosed scant details about the X-37B mission, conducted by the US Space Force under the military's National Security Space Launch program.

The Boeing-built vehicle, roughly the size of a small bus and resembling a miniature space shuttle, is built to deploy various payloads and conduct technology experiments on years-long orbital flights.

At the end of its mission, the craft descends back through the atmosphere to land on a runway much like an aeroplane.

It has flown six previous missions since 2010, the first five of them carried to orbit by Atlas V rockets from United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, and most recently, in May 2020, atop a Falcon 9 booster furnished by Elon Musk's SpaceX.

Thursday's mission marked the first launched aboard SpaceX's more powerful Falcon Heavy rocket, capable of carrying payloads even heavier than the X-37B farther into space, possibly into geosynchronous orbit, more than 22,000 miles (35,000 km) above the Earth.

The X-37B, also called the Orbital Test Vehicle, has previously been confined to flights in low-Earth orbit, at altitudes below 1,200 miles. 

The Pentagon has not said how high the spaceplane will fly this time out. But in a statement last month, the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office said the mission, designated by the Space Force as USSF-52, would involve tests of 'new orbital regimes, experimenting with future space domain awareness technologies.'

The X-37B, also called the Orbital Test Vehicle, has previously been confined to flights in low-Earth orbit, at altitudes below 1,200 miles

Such comments have led industry analysts and amateur space trackers to speculate that the X-37B may be bound for a highly elliptical orbit around Earth or even a path that could swing it out to the vicinity of the moon, a region of space in which the Pentagon has taken an increasing interest.

'Maybe this thing's going go out toward the moon and drop off a payload,' said Bob Hall, director of space traffic monitoring firm COMSPOC, who analyses the trajectories of orbital objects. The closer the spacecraft flies to the moon, the more difficult it could be to safely return to Earth.

Left unclear from Thursday's webcast, which SpaceX said it curtailed at the military's request, was whether the X-37B reached its intended destination in space. 

But the company later posted photos of the liftoff on social media platform X with the headline: 'Falcon Heavy Launches USSF-52 to orbit.'

The X-37B also is carrying a NASA experiment to study how plant seeds are affected by prolonged exposure to the harsh environment of radiation in space. The ability to cultivate crops in space has major implications for keeping astronauts nourished during future long-term missions to the moon and Mars.

China's equally secretive Shenlong was carried to space on December 14 by a Long March 2F rocket, a launch system less powerful than SpaceX's Falcon Heavy and believed to be limited to delivering payloads to low-Earth orbit.

Still, Space Force General B. Chance Saltzman told reporters at an industry conference earlier this month he expected China to launch Shenlong around the same time as the X-37B flight in what he suggested was a competitive move.

'These are two of the most watched objects on orbit while they're on orbit. It's probably no coincidence that they're trying to match us in timing and sequence of this,' Saltzman said, according to remarks published in the journal Air & Space Forces Magazine.

The planned duration of the latest X-37B mission was not made public, but it will presumably run until June 2026 or later, given the prevailing pattern of successively longer flights.

Its last mission remained in orbit for well over two years before landing in November 2022.

This is the terrifying moment a huge landslide sent pedestrians racing for safety near an iconic landmark in Colombia - leaving 17 people injured, including two minors.

Dramatic surveillance footage showed tourists walking near the El PeÃ±Ã³n de GuatapÃ© (The Rock of GuatapÃ©) on Thursday afternoon when an avalanche of rocks suddenly came crashing to the ground.

Six people could be seen walking past when rocks started to rain over the pathway.

A woman began to run and stopped in front of a guardrail as the powdery debris fell over the area. She remained there for about five seconds before she fled.

The National Police said that the El PeÃ±Ã³n de GuatapÃ© will remained closed while a study is completed to determine if the site is safe

The El PeÃ±Ã³n de GuatapÃ©, said to be 65 million years old, receives an average of 1,000 visitors on weekdays and 3,500 on weekends

The area was cordoned off immediately as several minor landslides followed throughout the day and remained closed as of Friday.

The National Police said an inspection of the landmark had been scheduled to determine if it would pose any risks for visitors.

Antioquia Governor AnÃ­bal Gaviria said five people were rushed to a hospital in GuatapÃ© and four others received treatment at an El PeÃ±Ã³n care center.

The El PeÃ±Ã³n de GuatapÃ©, believed to be 65 million years old, is located in the Antioquia town of GuatapÃ©, 77 miles away from MedellÃ­n. 

The 656-foot high landmark is an outcrop of the Antioquia Batholith that is made up of granite, feldspar and quartz and was once worshipped by the TahamÃ­ indigenous people.

The site is frequented each day by at least 1,000 people and up to 3,400 visitors at the weekend - many of which scale 708 steps to the top of the rock.

Near the entrance of the rock stands a statue of Luis Villegas, the first person to reach the summit of El PeÃ±Ã³n in 1954 across a span of five days.

He ended up buying the rock from farmers, who considered the area surrounding it not suitable to grow crops. 

Villegas constructed the stairs and charged people interested in climbing it.

This is what it sounds like when plants CRY: Scientists find plants produce alarm sounds when they are cut (just like the mandrakes in Harry Potter!)

The idea of a plant making noises when in distress all sounds very Harry Potter. 

But a study now suggests that the plant kingdom is not as silent as we once believed as some really do produce noises when they're underwatered.

They also appear to make distress signals after being cut, with these sounds found to come from tomato and tobacco plants, as well as corn and the grapevines used to make cabernet sauvignon. 

Ultrasonic vibrations have been recorded from species previously, using sensors directly touching them.

But this new study provides the first evidence that plants emit airborne sounds, which researchers estimate could be heard by animals with sharp hearing, such as mice and moths, from up to 16 feet (5 metres) away.

A study has found that plants really do emit sounds when they're stressed - but it's more of a pop than a scream

The idea of a plant making noises may evoke a vision of the mandrakes from Harry Potter

How plants TALK to each other: Flowers and trees warn neighbours when they're under attack by releasing chemicals into the wind - READ MORE 

Flowers and trees warn neighbours when they're under attack by releasing chemicals into the wind

However, we can't naturally listen to the noises as humans cannot hear in the high-frequency 'ultrasonic' range. So researchers have lowered the frequency of the plant noises so we can listen.

Plants typically produce a noise similar to popcorn popping - thought to be caused by air bubbles bursting in their stem - less than once an hour.

But tomato plants which had not been watered for up to five days produced this popping sound much more frantically - more than once every two minutes on average.

And when they were cut, the tomato plants made an alarm sound around every two and a half minutes.

In the Harry Potter universe, mandrakes make a screaming noise when they are taken out of the soil - and a fully grown plant's squeal could be lethal.

Professor Lilach Hadany, an evolutionary biologist at Tel Aviv University and senior author of the study which looked at hundreds of plants, said: 'Our findings suggest that the world around us is full of plant sounds, and that these sounds contain information - for example about water scarcity or injury.

'We assume that in nature the sounds emitted by plants are detected by creatures nearby, such as bats, rodents, various insects, and possibly also other plants - that can hear the high frequencies and derive relevant information. 

'We believe that humans can also utilise this information, given the right tools, such as sensors that tell growers when plants need watering. 

Normally plants produce a noise rather like popcorn popping - thought to be caused by air bubbles bursting in their stem - less than once an hour

Do plants feel 'pain'? 

When a bug bites down on a plant leaf, the wound triggers the release of calcium, researchers at the University of Wisconsin said last year.

This sets off a chain reaction in the cells along the plant leaves and stem.

It takes about one to two minutes for the response to reach every part of the plant.

The calcium generates a hormonal response from the plant to protect its leaves.

Some plants release noxious chemicals that makes it taste bad to other invading bugs.

Others, such as grass, give off hormones that attract nearby parasitic wasps, which eat the attacking insects.

'Apparently, an idyllic field of flowers can be a rather noisy place. It's just that we can't hear the sounds!'

The ultrasonic recordings captured by two microphones positioned next to each plant in the study support the theory that they could use sound to warn each other of danger from drought or hungry animals.

If plants knew water is scarce ahead of time, they could close pores in their leaves to conserve water.

And if it heard a noise from another plant whose stem had been severed by an animal eating it, that plant could then emit volatile compounds to deter the hungry animal.

The researchers used artificial intelligence algorithms to compare the noises from healthy tomato and tobacco plants to those which had been cut or deprived of water for up to two weeks in a soundproofed acoustic chamber.

The team found plants which had not been watered began making distress calls before they were visibly dehydrated, with the noises peaking after five days without water, before decreasing before the plants dried up completely.

The noise could help growers use a sensor to tell when their house plants are unhappy and need water, or help farmers save water by irrigating crops only when they are becoming dehydrated.

The researchers also found plants including grapevines, wheat, corn and cacti made noises when they were cut or dehydrated.

The sounds lasted for longer when a plant was dehydrated compared to when it was cut, and different plants appeared to make different noises based on factors like noise frequency.

Experts suspect these noises may be helpful for creatures such as moths, which lay larvae on plants, so will find dehydrated ones unsuitable.

Octopuses can DREAM just like us! Incredible video shows a creature changing colour in its sleep - and scientists say they think it's dreaming

They're nightmare-inducing creatures for many people, but a new study suggests that octopuses can actually dream, just like humans. 

Researchers say the skin patterns the animals create while they are snoozing may indicate they are capable of something similar to dreaming.

Like people, octopuses transition between two sleep stages - a quiet stage and an active stage that resembles rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in mammals.

While awake, octopuses create a number of different skin patterns which they use to camouflage themselves in different environments, and in social or threat displays, such as warning off predators and communicating with each other.

The animals cycled through these same skin patterns during active sleep, the study found.

READ MORE: Scientists call for the world's first OCTOPUS FARM to be shut down amid concerns the 'sentient' animals can feel pain and emotions

Plans for the world's first commercial octopus farm should be scrapped on grounds of cruelty, according to campaigners (stock image) 

It could be that they are practising their skin patterns to improve their waking camouflage behaviour, or simply maintaining the pigment cells, one theory suggests.

However, another is that they could be re-living and learning from their waking experiences, such as hunting or hiding from a predator, and reactivating the skin pattern associated with each experience.

In other words, they could be doing something similar to dreaming.

Senior author, Professor Sam Reiter, who leads the Computational Neuroethology Unit at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST), Japan, said: 'In this sense, while humans can verbally report what kind of dreams they had only once they wake, the octopuses' skin pattern acts as a visual readout of their brain activity during sleep.

'All animals seem to show some form of sleep, even simple animals like jellyfish and fruit flies.

'But for a long time, only vertebrates were known to cycle between two different sleep stages.'

When octopuses sleep, their quiet periods of slumber are punctuated by short bursts of frenzied activity.

Their arms and eyes twitch, their breathing rate quickens, and their skin flashes with vibrant colours.

Researchers from OIST and the University of Washington, examined the brain activity and skin patterning in octopuses (Octopus laqueus) during this active period of sleep.

They found they closely resemble brain activity and skin patterning behaviour seen when awake.

Wake-like activity also occurs during REM sleep in mammals - the phase in which most dreams occur.

Researchers say the skin patterns the animals create while they are snoozing may indicate they are capable of something similar to dreaming 

The scientists started by checking whether the octopuses were truly asleep during this active period.

They tested how the octopuses responded to a physical stimulus and found that when in both the quiet and active stage of sleep, the animals required stronger stimulation before reacting, compared to when they were awake.

If the octopuses were prevented from sleeping, or were disrupted during the active phase of sleep, they later entered active sleep sooner and more frequently.

Aditi Pophale, co-first author of the study and PhD student at OIST, said: 'This compensatory behaviour nails down the active stage as being an essential stage of sleep that is needed for octopuses to properly function.'

According to the study, published in Nature, roughly once an hour, the octopuses entered an active sleep phase for around a minute.

During this stage, their brain activity very closely resembled their brain activity while awake, just like REM sleep does in humans.

OCTOPUS DEFENCE MECHANISMS

One of the most effective ways octopuses avoid predation is by camouflaging with their environment.

They have special pigment cells allow them to control the colour of their skin, much like chameleons.

As well as colour change they can manipulate the texture of their skin in order to blend in with the terrain. 

As well as camouflage they can escape predators by using a 'jet propulsion' method of escape, where they rapidly shoot out water to propel them through the water rapidly.  

The jet of water from the siphon is often accompanied by a release of ink to confuse and evade potential enemies.

The suckers on the tentacles of the eight-legged beasts are extremely powerful and are used to drag prey towards a sharp beak.

As well as protection from other animals, it has been recently found that octopuses can detect the ultrasonic waves that preempt a volcanic eruption or earthquake, giving them enough time to escape.

The picturesque ocean of New Jersey is set to feature hundreds of turbines that will provide millions with 'clean energy' - but it could be deadly for marine life.

Residents, lawmakers and activists are fighting against such projects, claiming companies blasting the seafloor with sonar are behind dozens of whales and dolphins in the past year.

Approximately 16 whales have died, and 72 were found stranded, along with 53 beached dolphins along the coast from December 2022, a New Jersey resident told DailyMail.com.

Sonar is used to map the seafloor for suitable windmill locations, but many believe the loud sound is disrupting animals' movements, sending them into boats or onto the shore. 

The deaths recently caught the attention of comedian and actor Jim Breuer, a former star of Saturday Night Live, who told DailyMail.com that the rotting carcass on beaches 'comes down to the root of all demonic evil - greed and money.'

'Sonar is how these mammals communicate, so you are paralyzing them,' Breuer said.

'I'm tired of politicians and any humanitarian cause that, at the end of the day, their true cause is greed and the love of money and the power of money to take advantage of humanity when they're slaughtering marine life.'

Approximately 16 whales have died, and 72 were found stranded, along with 53 beached dolphins along the coast from December 2022 - but more than double the numbers since 2016

The deaths recently caught the attention of comedian and actor Jim Breuer, a former star of Saturday Night Live, who told DailyMail.com that the rotting carcass on beaches 'comes down to the root of all demonic evil - greed and money'

Breuer released a new documentary with director James Malin called 'Big Wind & The Incidental Take, a story about New Jersey, Green Energy & Dead Whales.'

The pair spoke with New Jersey residents, activists and lawmakers about the link between whale deaths and offshore windfarms.

Toms River resident Trisha DeVoe, a conservation biologist and activist for Save our Whales, told DailyMail.com: 'Over the previous 10-year period, from 2013-2022, the average number of humpback whales to strand in New Jersey yearly was 2.6. 

'In the 12 months from December 22 to the present, there were 11 humpback whale strandings in New Jersey, more than four times the previous 10-year average.

'We hunted whales to near extinction, and scientists estimate that we only have about anywhere from 25 to 33 percent of the historical numbers before the whaling industry.

'Some scientists estimate that bringing our whale populations back to the pre-whaling levels would capture 1.7 trillion tons of carbon every year.' 

DeVoe said she and many other New Jersey residents are calling for a stop to the projects until independent research can determine what is killing the marine life.

New Jersey has some of the nation's most ambitious targets for building offshore wind as Democrat Governor Phil Murphy aims for 11 GW of capacity by 2040.

Many New Jersey residents are calling for a pause on off-shore wind construction until independent research can be done to show if sonar is linked to whale deaths

Murphy has also committed to having 50 percent renewable energy by 2030 and entirely powered by clean energy by 2035. 

DailyMail.com has contacted Murphy for comment. 

Mike Dean, a Mammoth County resident, told DailyMail.com: 'When you get down to what they provide because they're not clean green.

'When you look at what goes into building them, and how long it takes for them to produce energy that covers their construction costs.

'Even their documents say they don't provide a benefit environmentally, or, you know, to the fight against climate change.' 

Companies use sonar to map the seafloor to find suitable locations for turbines, which blow extremely loud air guns onto the ocean floor every 10 seconds.

According to Oceana, the sounds made by seismic blasting are one of the - so loud that they can travel 2,500 miles through water.

Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shows that at least 29 whales have died in New Jersey since 2016

While whales have washed up dead in New Jersey, New York (pictured) has also seen the same events on its beaches 

The sound can trigger a survival response among whales and dolphins as if a predator were chasing them, according to a US military study in 2013.

This sends them in a chaotic direction, sometimes into boats or onto the shore. 

'It's a behavioral impact. [Whales] get scared and run, and now they are running into ships, said Dean.

'They didn't run into ships previously.'

He explained that vessel traffic has increased in New Jersey, but with sonar blasting, 'the poor things don't have anywhere to go.' 

'That's not right. That is animal cruelty to me,' said Dean.

'I blame NOOA and federal agencies for this. They have rules to follow to grant leases, but they do not look at how many projects are in one area.

'They look at it project by project but don't take a step back for a cumulative view.' 

Two companies have leased the waters surrounding New Jersey: Dutch-owned Orsted and Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind. 

Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind, co-owned by EDF Renewables and Shell New Energies US, has requested to set up 200 wind turbines off the coast of Atlantic City and Sea Girt.

Breuer, who released a new documentary called 'Big Wind & The Incidental Take, a story about New Jersey, Green Energy & Dead Whales,' spoke with New Jersey residents, activists and lawmakers about the link between whale deaths and offshore windfarms

Orsted pulled out of its two projects, but a map showed the layout of its turbines. According to Cape May's official website, a study cited by Orsted itself indicates that an estimated 15 percent of tourists will not return once the windmills are installed 

Mike Dean (right), a Mammoth County resident, told DailyMail.com: 'When you get down to what they provide because they're not clean green. 'When you look at what goes into building them, and how long it takes for them to produce energy that covers their construction costs'

The company purchased a lease that covers 102,124 acres and is approximately 8.7 statute miles offshore of New Jersey at its closest point.

Orsted planned to develop the Ocean Wind 1 and Ocean Wind 2 projects for Southern New Jersey, which would erect 98 turbines 15 miles off the coast.

Construction was due to start this fall and was expected to be operational in 2025, but Orsted announced cancellations for both projects this month.

Orsted cited 'macroeconomic factors, including high inflation, rising interest rates and supply chain constraints' that led to the decision.

However, it is believed the two companies began blasting the seafloor with sonar as early as 2016 - the same time an unprecedented number of whales and dolphins began washing up on beaches, according to New Jersey Senator Mike Testa.

Dean also said companies are setting up compensation funds for local fishermen and businesses along the Jersey Shore.

According to Cape May's official website, a study cited by Orsted indicates that an estimated 15 percent of tourists will not return once the windmills are installed. 

Cape May County Board of Commissioners Director Len Desiderio said in a statement: 'We would like to see land-based offshore wind facilities and supply chain infrastructure built here in New Jersey since that would create good opportunities for trade workers and others. 

'But we cannot sit quietly by as hundreds of windmills are installed off our beaches as state and federal government agencies ignore our legitimate and serious concerns.'

Cape May County has a $7.4 Billion annual tourism economy. The website states that the negative impact could be a potential $1.11 billion loss in Cape May County across multiple sectors such as food service, hospitality, retail and rental housing.

'Governor Murphy signed an additional billion dollars in subsidies to Orsted instead of passing it through the ratepayers,' said Testa, featured in Breuer's documentary. 

'Murphy, in his avarice to become first in green energy, should have called their bluff.'

DailyMail.com has contacted Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind and Orsted for comment.

Companies have created models of how their turbines would look along the Jersey shore in several towns. Residents believe the fence of windmills could ruin their small businesses as tourists will not flock to the beaches 

The documents, collected by the Save Right Whales Coalition, claim the non-profit organization dedicated to ocean research, Woods Hole Oceanographic, received a donation of $500,000 from Orsted 'in or after 2018' 

National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) allegedly received $100,000 to $499,99 in 2019 and 2020 from Avangrid Renewables, also involved in an offshore wind project set for Massachusetts

 The documents also claim that the Environmental League of Massachusetts (ELM) received up to $9,000 from Vineyard Wind in 2020

'My understanding is they drag a sonar behind their boat to map the ocean floor, and they've certainly put out a blast of sonar so they can erect these turbines,' said Testa.

'They're saying this type of sonar is not causing any harm to marine life because it is used commonly by naval ships.

'I've been paying attention since 2016, and [the marine animal deaths] are awful close to the time you started your sonar testing.'

Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shows that at least 29 whales have died in New Jersey since 2016.

But a total of 209 have been found dead on beaches from Florida to Maine over the same period. 

However, NOAA states that 'there is no scientific evidence that noise resulting from offshore wind site characterization surveys could potentially cause mortality of whales.'

'We get this answer: 'We are not sure what is causing this anomaly, but it has nothing to do with the sonar mapping,'' said Testa.

Breuer likened the offshore wind energy projects to criminal activity.

'Mike Dean has awareness details and facts about who got paid and how much they got paid,' he said.

'He was the one that brought the documents of like this person got paid this, and this guy did this, and during the night they passed this law so they can jump over this and this amendment. 

'This constitutional amendment got squashed because this particular politician pulled this while everyone was sleeping.

'Just because you say you're a corporation or a politician doesn't mean you're allowed to get away with criminal business.'

Documents collected by the Save Right Whales Coalition, a non-profit organization dedicated to ocean research, show that Woods Hole Oceanographic (WHOI) received a donation of $500,000 from Orsted 'in or after 2018.' 

Suzanne Pelisson, a spokesperson with WHOI told DailyMail.com: 'WHOI was awarded a contract for research, not a donation, from Orsted to demonstrate, evaluate and improve on methods to detect North Atlantic right whales from acoustic buoys, a field in which WHOI scientists and engineers have unique expertise. 

'The research funding from Orsted supported the deployment and operation of two acoustic monitoring buoys for a two-year period, which listened for and alerted mariners to the presence of whales in the area. The whale detection data were made publicly accessible in near real-time at robots4whales.whoi.edu. 

'Orsted had no control over the research process, the conclusions reached during the course of the research, nor the dissemination or communication of research results. WHOI's research does not constitute endorsements of any company or industry.'

National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) allegedly received $100,000 to $499,99 in 2019 and 2020 from Avangrid Renewables, also involved in an offshore wind project set for Massachusetts.

The remaining six dolphins were euthanized several hours later, adding to the more than three dozen cetaceans that have washed up dead in recent months. 

The documents also claim that the Environmental League of Massachusetts (ELM) received up to $9,000 from Vineyard Wind in 2020.

DailyMail.com has contacted Woods Hole Oceanographic, NFWF and ELM for comment. 

When asked why environmental groups are not sounding the alarm about the dead marine life, Dean responded: 'They're all receiving some sort of compensation.

'Forget about offshore wind; how is the Autobahn Society not against windmills? 

'They kill millions of birds a year. They say nothing about it; [companies] are paying for their silence. There is so much money involved.

According to a 2022 press release from Save Right Wales, 'Orsted is the official sponsor of the New Jersey Audubon Society's fundraiser.'

'These projects are funded with our money, after-tax money,' said Dean.

'They are taking that money and funding the policy goals to change our energy from traditional fossils to something out. They shouldn't have full range on my after-tax cash flow.'

Dean told DailyMail.com that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has not formally approved the Atlantic Shores Project but released an environmental impact showing unavoidable harm.

DailyMail.com contacted BOEM, which refused to comment.  

The environmental impact report predicts the turbines will be twice as tall as the Washington Monument and visible up to 40 miles off the shore.

'Wind Turbines planned to be constructed off the New Jersey Coast will cause potential 'unavoidable' harm to New Jersey's shore ecosystem, communities, and economy,' the document reads.

The unavoidable harms listed include 'irretrievable loss of jobs, marine mammal and bird mortality, major impacts to historic properties, accidental chemical spills, beach closures, compounded health issues of local environmental justice communities, navigational issues for military or national security vessels, among others.'

'Increased risk of injury (TTS or PTS) to individuals due to underwater noise from pile-driving activities during construction,' reads the report.

'Increased risk of individual injury and mortality due to vessel strikes during construction and installation, O&M, and decommissioning.'

'We have to say 'what's different in our oceans,' said DeVoe.

'You don't have to be a marine biologist or a rocket scientist to know, you know, that having this many whales die in our little area is not normal, and people lived here their whole lives, 50 or 60 years, would see one dead whale.'

REVEALED: More than 1.8 MILLION bacteria linked to miscarriages and respiratory infections may be lurking in your fridge - here are the filthiest spots

Spring has sprung, which means the seasonal cleaning of the home is in full swing, but it is not just cluttered you should be worried about - more than 1.8 million bacteria units are lurking in your refrigerator. 

These invisible microbes are linked to respiratory and urinary infections, food poisoning and miscarriages among pregnant women. 

And the filthiest spots in the fridge are the veggie and meat drawers and shelves where dairy products are kept.

Most bacteria thriving in refrigerators develop from unwashed vegetables or cross-contamination, so experts recommend covering all food before placing it inside.

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) notes that leftovers should be placed in airtight containers to avoid bacterial growth and placed on the upper shelves.

The agency warns not to store eggs on the door but in the carton and on a shelf.

More than 1.8 million bacteria units are lurking in your refrigerator. These invisible microbes are linked to respiratory and urinary infections, food poisoning and miscarriages among pregnant women

Spring cleaning dates back 3,000 years ago, when ancient Persians participated in a spring tradition called KhÄne-takÄnÄ«, meaning 'shaking the house.' 

It was believed that sweeping up dust and removing clutter from one's home would prevent ill fortune in the upcoming year.

And people are still upholding the tradition thousands of years later.

Nearly eight in ten Americans report spring cleaning at least once a year, typically around or after the first day of spring, March 20.

The refrigerator may be one of the last places people think to attack with a scrubber, but the container houses bacteria that lead to illnesses.

The average refrigerator size is 62 inches in height and 29 inches wide, and previous research has found that there are more than 1,200 bacteria units living on every square inch of the container.

Two different families of microbes live in your refrigerator: pathogenic bacteria and spoilage bacteria.

Pathogenic bacteria flourish in the 'Danger Zone,' between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit.

This group causes foodborne illnesses but typically does not impact food's taste, smell or appearance.

Spoilage bacteria can grow at low temperatures, such as in the refrigerator, and are detected when the food spoils.

Listeria is a pathogenic bacteria that primarily impacts pregnant women, children and the elderly.

In pregnant women, listeriosis can cause miscarriage, stillbirth and severe illness or death of newborn babies. 

Listeria is a pathogenic bacteria that primarily impacts pregnant women, children and the elderly. In pregnant women, listeriosis can cause miscarriage, stillbirth and severe illness or death of newborn babies (pictured is a 3D illustration of the bacteria on meat)

The refrigerator may be one of the last places people think to attack with a scrubber, but the container houses bacteria that lead to illnesses

Symptoms of the infection include fever, stiff neck, confusion, weakness, and vomiting, sometimes preceded by diarrhea. 

The incubation period can be 3 to 70 days, and the illness may last days or weeks, depending on the person's health before the illness settles in. 

Listeria can survive on cold surfaces and multiply slowly at 24 degrees Fahrenheit. 

And this deadly bacteria can be found throughout the fridge, specifically where meats and dairy items are stored. 

A study conducted in 2019, in which scientists took five swabs from different locations in 10 refrigerators, found 19 of the 50 samples contained Aeromonas bacteria, Enterobactera clocae and Klebsiella oxytoca.

Aeromonas bacteria is linked to gastrointestinal infections, which result in watery diarrhea to dysenteric or bloody diarrhea.

Enterobacter cloacae can cause bone and heart infections, while Klebsiella oxytoca is linked to severe infections that lead to septic shock.

However, the refrigerator is not the only playground for germs - they thrive on kitchen countertops, sponges and rags, and the more than 500,000 units live in sink drains.

Moonchester United! Scientists reveal the first ever football kits for games on the lunar surface - which they claim could be as soon as 2035

No human habitat would be complete without somewhere to play football - not even the moon. 

In recognition of this, experts have revealed home and away kits for what they envisage will be the first ever lunar football club, 'Moon United'.

Rather than being splashed with the names of big corporate sponsors, the vivid space-inspired designs include colourful illustrations of the solar system. 

However, the swish kits would have to be fashioned into Apollo-style space suits if they were ever to be worn on the moon. 

Scientists believe the beautiful game could be played on the moon as early as 2035, although it will look very different to a match here on Earth. 

The winning designs would have to be fashioned into Apollo-style space suits that would have internal cooling and heating systems

READ MORE The moon could host its first FOOTBALL match by 2035, scientists say

Could football soon extend to another planetary body?

The two new kit designs are the result of a UK children's competition run by Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET), based in London. 

The winning designs - which show a 'mix of striking design work and scientific thinking' - were picked by a panel of judges from more than 500 entries and manufactured into real attire. 

Winners Erim Ali, 13, and Ishaani Nair, 7 were presented their kits by Tottenham Hotspur forward Beth England and British aerospace engineer Sophie Harker. 

'There's so much potential for engineering to help make things we only dream of, like playing football on the Moon, a reality,' said Harker

'With imaginative, inventive children like Erim and Ishaani I'm hopeful that the next generation will be the ones to make it happen.' 

Erim's grey unisex design - the home kit - has 'geometric, molecule-inspired shapes' and would turn sweat into usable water. 

Meanwhile, the more colourful away kit deigned by Ishaani has a space theme, with illustrations of the sun to represent the 'positivity of the game' and the shooting stars represent the speed and spirit of football. 

In the centre is a football with a ring around the middle - a reference to the planet Saturn. 

The new designs are the result of a competition run by Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET). Pictured are the young winners with professional footballer Beth England (left) and British engineer Sophie Harker (right)

The grey kit is the home kit for Moon United, while and the pink/blue kit is the away kit

Experts believe the beautiful game could be played on the moon as early as 2035, although it will look very different to a match here on Earth 

What would lunar football look like?

THE GAME

- Five-a-side game and one hologram referee to provide space and avoid collisions

- Four 10-minute quarters with 20-minute intervals between each to refuel and repair equipment

- Red and yellow cards displayed virtually in players' visors

THE PITCH

- Laser sintering can turn the lunar soil into an even surface 

- Nets, closed sides and a roof should also be intact due to the lack of gravity

THE BALL

- Nearly twice the size of a terrestrial football which is strictly black and white to contrast with the lunar soil



THE KIT

- Slimmed down version of Apollo spacesuits with heating systems

- These would have increased flexibility and in-built padding around the knees and elbows

If humans really were to set up a habitat on the moon, IET wants to establish Moon United as the first ever club.

The institute has already published a rulebook outlining what the sport will look like on the lunar surface - and there are several tweaks that would be made to our beloved sport. 

Firstly, each player would have to carry their own oxygen tank attached to their airtight Apollo-style spacesuit, which would have internal cooling and heating systems. 

The pitch would be eight times smaller than that of a football pitch on Earth and would be surrounded by netting to stop the ball or players from floating away. 

The ball would be nearly twice the size of a normal football and mainly black to contrast with the grey lunar soil, which would be treated with a laser to make it flatter. 

The ball would also have a spongey centre, as a ball filled with air would likely leak or burst due to the pressure difference between the ball and the vacuum of space. 

What's more, there would be only be five players on each side and rather than two halves there would be four 10-minute quarters with 20-minute breaks between each quarter for players to recover. 

The offside rule would also be scrapped, which will be music to the ears for the many fans who can't stand the tedious VAR checks to determine if a goal stands.

Lunar football would also be a 'strictly no contact' sport, although due to the lack of gravity any close control or sophisticated dribbling that we expect from the likes of Lionel Messi would be out of the question anyway. 

Although much of IET's rulebook is written in a tongue-in-cheek style, scientists really are preparing for human life on the moon and looking at typical activates that would or would not be possible there, from growing crops to having sex. 

NASA's early Artemis missions should lay the groundwork for bases on the moon later this decade (pictured is artist's impression) 

NASA is spending billions on efforts to get humans to the moon for the first time since the 1970s - but this time to stay there.  

A key part of NASA's Artemis programme is sending humans back to the lunar surface in 2025 - which would be the first time human boots have touched the moon since 1972. 

Although this would only be a fleeting visit of around a week, it would lay the groundwork for building lunar bases by the late 2020s.

These would be complete with living quarters for long-term stays and research facilities for explorers to study the lunar rocks. 

Eventually, the moon could be a thriving metropolis complete with hotels and other businesses for 'space tourists' paying thousands of dollars for a exclusive holiday. 

Humans will be living on the MOON by 2030, NASA official claims following the launch of Artemis 1 

Man could be living on the moon before the end of the decade, a leading Nasa official has said following the successful launch of Artemis 1.

Howard Hu, Orion manager, told the BBC the launch was 'historic for human space flight' and an early step towards long-term deep space exploration. 

After a series of failed launch attempts earlier in 2022, Artemis 1 took off on November 21 from the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida.

The uncrewed mission around the moon will pave the way for a crewed flight test around the moon in 2024 (Artemis 2).

Then in 2025, humans would actually land on the to the lunar surface (Artemis 3) for the first time since 1972.

Getting high on the taxpayer dime: Government to spend $5m on 'safe injection' program in NYC and Rhode Island where users are given needles to shoot up fentanyl

The US government will study whether 'safe infection sites' for drug users can prevent overdoses, despite critics warning America is getting soft on drugs.

More than $5million will be given to New York University and Brown University to study two sites in NYC and Providence, Rhode Island.

Around 1,000 current drug users will be enrolled with the aim of studying the sites' cost and potential savings for healthcare and criminal justice systems.

Volunteers will be given the tools they need to inject drugs like fentanyl and heroin, including clean needles, and will be supervised by medical experts. 

Safe injection sites ""” which offer drug paraphernalia to users no questions asked ""” first began cropping up across the US during Covid, but have been criticized for not offering counseling or challenging addicts.

The federal government will invest $5million over the next four years to study safe drug injection sites in New York and Rhode Island. Pictured: Homeless people in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, use drugs openly on the street 

New York City's rollout of safe drug injection sites has been slammed. Some argue the advertising for the site promotes drug use (pictured), while residents who live near the sites complain the local area has deteriorated

One now-infamous poster advertising 'safe' drug use in NYC read: ''Don't be ashamed you are using, be empowered that you are using safely.'

A record 107,000 Americans died from an overdose that year, with a majority of those deaths having been caused by fentanyl.

The Biden Administration, which this grant was given under, has been accused of surrendering to the deadly drug, refusing to implement policies that would prevent it from coming over the southern border and instead investing in programs to limit its impact.

'There is a lot of discussion about overdose prevention centers, but ultimately, we need data to see if they are working or not, and what impact they may have on the community,' said Dr Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), which is funding the new research.

Proponents of safe injection sites argue these sites allow for drug users to safely take the substance they are hooked on without fear of overdose, or contracting a disease such as HIV from using a shared needle.

The drugs are provided for free too, which could potentially reduce criminal activity some addicts will resort to in order to get enough money to afford the drugs.

There are two officially sanctioned sites in New York City - In Washington Heights and East Harlem - both of which opened in 2021. Both facilities are operated by nonprofit group OnPoint NYC.

The East Harlem site is located on Lexington Ave and 126th St, and many social media users on TikTok and Instagram have referred to the nearby subway station, Lexington and 125th, as a 'zombieland' in the year since it opened.

The drug was responsible for a record 75,000 US deaths in 2021 ""” fueling a crisis in the nation.

The area was already well known as a site where the trade of drugs and other illicit material thrived, but local residents complain the situation has gotten worse.

David D'Alessio, who has lived near 126th St and Lexington for a decade, told The City: 'I have witnessed things I've never seen before. Including brazenly open dealing, people defecating (in broad daylight), users with needles openly using injection drugs ""¦ and even a man receiving oral sex between parked cars.'

Rhode Island, which will be home to a site in NIDA's study, authorized its program that same year. The Brown University site will be the state's first.

Legislatures in California and Vermont passed bills to allow safe injection sites, though they were vetoed by Gov Gavin Newsom and Gov Phil Scott respectively.

Pennsylvanian legislators have voted to ban the sites. 

Internationally, there are nearly 200 sites operated in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland, Holland, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and Ukraine, according to the Drug Policy Alliance.

Critics argue that giving addicts drugs without any stipulation just leaves them wallowing in their addiction.

Many also fear opening these sites will attract addicts and homeless people to the neighborhood, deteriorating conditions for locals. 

While there are a limited number of drug injection sites in the US, there are many 'harm reduction' programs in major cities already assisting addicts.

Deaths caused by fentanyl in the US surged in the 2010s. At the start of the decade, 2,666 Americans died of a fentanyl overdose. This figure shot up to 19,413 by 2016. Covid made the situation worse, with a record 72,484 deaths recorded in 2021

In cities such as Portland, Philadelphia and San Francisco, non-profits offer users the anti-overdose medication Narcan and materials like pipes and straws they can use to smoke with.

In many of these cases, users are addicted to the highly addictive ""” and deadly ""” synthetic opioid fentanyl. 

Fentanyl has torn through the US in recent years. The drug killed a record 75,000 Americans in 2021 ""” rising five-fold from the 19,000 deaths it was responsible for five years earlier in 2016.

Fentanyl is up to 100 times more potent than morphine, one of the most commonly used pain-reliever in the world.

It takes just a small dose of fentanyl to cause an overdose. Just two milligrams - the equivalent of five grains of salt - is enough to cause death.

Because it is cut into other popular drugs, many people who die of overdoses do not know they are taking fentanyl.

Horses have distinct facial expressions for disappointment and frustration, according to a study.

Researchers at the University of Lincoln put 30 horses through a food-reward task, which made them either disappointed or frustrated.

When disappointed, the horses tended to blink a lot, lift their nostrils, stick their tongue out and make chewing movements.

When frustrated, they showed more of the whites of their eyes and rotated their ears backwards.

Dr Claire Ricci-Bonot, lead author of the study, said that horses are ""˜are generally gregarious animals, living within a complex social system'.

Horses have distinct facial expressions for disappointment and frustration, according to a study

She added: ""˜They are able to communicate with other horses with subtle visual signals such as position of the ears.

""˜These signals will play an important role within a group, especially during social interactions.'

The team hope their research will enable riders to better look after the mental health of their animals by understanding their emotions.

Dr Ricchi-Bonot added: ""˜It is easier to assess the physical health of a horse. It is, however, more difficult to do it for the mental health.

""˜A better recognition and understanding of horses' emotions thanks to their facial expressions can lead to an improvement in the management of these animals - that is to say to try to remove situations which can generate negative emotions in horses.

""˜From the point of view of the riders, to be able to interpret the horses' facial expressions, would enable to avoid situation which can compromise the safety of the rider e.g recognise that the horse is afraid of something.'

For the study, 30 male - intact and castrated - and female horses were trained by the researchers to follow a task in which they expected a food reward.

A feeder was attached to the outside of their stable, closed with a transparent Perspex panel. 

Dr Claire Ricci-Bonot, lead author of the study, said that horses are ""˜are generally gregarious animals, living within a complex social system'

A researcher poured food into the feeder, with the horse watching, and after ten seconds, the transparent panel was pulled back for the horse to access the food.

This was repeated so that the horse learned to expect the food after a ten-second wait.

Next, the trials begun. For some of them, the transparent panel stayed in place after the ten seconds, so the horse could see the food but could not access it, prompting frustration.

In the other trials, the transparent panel was removed but an opaque panel remained, so it looked like there was no food at all, prompting disappointment.

The horses were videoed throughout so that the researchers could analyse their facial expressions and behaviours.

The findings were published in the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science.

Amateur makes 'gold find of the century' in a farmer's field after buying a metal detector because his doctor told him to get more exercise

An amateur metal detectorist in Norway has made the gold 'find of the century' including coins dating back around a millennium and a half.

Erlend Bore, 51, believed he had come across some chocolate money when he made the find in a farmer's field on Rennesoey island, near Stavanger, in late August.

He was shocked to learn he had in fact dug up nine pendants, three rings and 10 gold pearls - some of which date back as far as the fall of the Roman Empire.

Mr Bore said that he had bought his first metal detector only this year after his doctor ordered him to get out more instead of sitting on the sofa at home.

Ole Madsen, director at the Archaeological Museum at the University of Stavanger, said that to find 'so much gold at the same time is extremely unusual'.

'This is the gold find of the century in Norway,' he said, announcing the find today.

Archaeologists working on the site on the island of Rennesoy in Stavanger where a gold treasure was found by an amateur archaeologist with the help of a metal detector, August 30

Mr Bore first began walking around the mountainous island with his metal detector in August. 

A statement issued by the university today Mr Bore first found some scrap, but soon after uncovered something 'completely unreal' - the treasure weighing a little more than 100 grams (3.5oz). 

Under Norwegian law, objects from before 1537, and coins older than 1650, are considered state property and must be handed in.

Associate professor Hakon Reiersen, from the museum, said the gold pendants - flat, thin, single-sided gold medals called bracteates - date from around 500ad.

This dates them to what was known as the Migration Period in Norway, a period of European history marked by large-scale migrations that led to the ultimate fall of the western Roman Empire in 476ad. 

The pendants and gold pearls were part of 'a very showy necklace' that was made by skilled jewellers and worn by society's most powerful, said Professor Reiersen.

He added that 'in Norway, no similar discovery has been made since the 19th century, and it is also a very unusual discovery in a Scandinavian context'.

An expert on such pendants, Professor Sigmund Oehrl, also from the museum, said about 1,000 golden bracteates - thin, flat gold medals - have so far been found in Norway, Sweden and Denmark.

He said symbols on the pendants usually show the Norse god Odin healing his son's sick horse.

On the Rennesoey ones, a horse's tongue hangs out on the gold pendants, and 'its slumped posture and twisted legs show that it is injured', Professor Oehrl said.

'The horse symbol represented illness and distress, but at the same time hope for healing and new life,' he added.

The Archaeological Museum in Stavanger, about 200 miles (300km) south-west of Oslo, plans to exhibit Mr Bore's finds.

Yesterday, Israeli archeologists announced the discovery of four extremely rare Roman swords found in a cave overlooking the dead sea.

Experts from the Israel Antiquity Authority found weapons they linked to the Bar Kokhba Revolt in 132-135ad.

They said they believed the weapons could have been stolen from Roman soldiers by Jewish rebels, hidden for nearly two millennia.

The migratory period around the time the coins were found in Norway coincides with Germanic tribes moving north as the Huns swept through Europe.

There, the tribes consolidated power around local chieftains and leading to the construction of Norway's first forts.   

By the 8th century, these groups were able to project enough power to oversee the conquest of Britain.

The oldest known Norwegian coin - minted in Norway - is a penny attributed to Olav Tryggvason, dating to 1000ad.

For much of its history, Norway had no need to mint its own coins and relied on the import of foreign currencies.

Bill Gates defends his use of a polluting private jet after flying to Australia to lecture about climate change and reveals why he is 'not part of the problem'

Bill Gates has told Australia that it has a 'huge role to play' in combating climate change despite flying down under in a fuel-guzzling private jet.

But he insists he is not part of the problem regarding private jets polluting the world because of the effort he puts into offsetting his carbon emissions.

The Microsoft co-founder travelled to Australia at the end of last month on board a $70 million Gulfstream private jet that burns around 1,700 litres of fuel per hour.

After arriving on the private jet, Gates went on to preach about the dangers of climate at the big business-funded Lowy Institute think-tank and on the ABC's 7:30 report show,

He told the Lowy Institute: 'Climate change is not yet having the negative effects of a disease like malaria, which kills 400,00 children a year.

'The reason why climate change is worth investing in massively is because it will get worse and worse over time.'

'If you allow the warming to go to an extreme level, then all sorts of natural ecosystems disappear and all sorts of places in the world you can't do outdoor work.

'So the tropical areas, agriculture would be impossible, outdoor work during large parts of the year would be impossible.'

Then the following week, during an interview with the ABC's 7:30 report he warned: 'We will have to adapt while we do our very, very best to bring our emissions to zero as fast as we can.

'Australia has a huge role to play. It's very lucky, it'll have some of the cheapest renewable energy in the world.'

Bill Gates flew his $70million Gulfstream, which burns about 1,700 litres of fuel per hour, to Australia to tell Aussies they have a 'huge role to play' in climate change (pictured, Gates boarding a private plane)

When asked how Australia could rank as a global climate leader while remaining one of the world's biggest exporters of fossil fuels, Gates said: 'I think Australia will be able to export green hydrogen and other clean products.

'It's certainly a country where the opportunity in a green economy is greater than it has been in the past.'

However, Gates' climate philanthropy versus his taste for luxury travel on private jets has seen him called a 'climate hypocrite' with critics stumped on how the multibillionaire can preach about lowering emissions while choosing to jet around the world privately.

During an interview with the BBC's Amol Rajan earlier this month, Gates was asked how he answered people who called him a hypocrite for his jet use. 

'What do you say to the charge that if you are a climate change campaigner, but you also travel around the world in a private jet, you're a hypocrite,' the BBC's Amol Rajan asked Gates.

The billionaire answered by telling how he throws money at the problem. 

'Well, I buy the gold standard of funding Climeworks to do direct air capture that far exceeds my family's carbon footprint,' he said. 

Gates then went on to talk about all the money he has put into climate research, and that his work is better done when he visits the places his companies are studying first hand.  

'I spend billions of dollars on climate innovation,' he said. 'So, you know, should I stay at home and not come to Kenya and learn about farming and malaria. Anyway.' 

 He added that he was 'part of the solution.'

'I mean, I'm comfortable with the idea that not only am I not part of the problem - by paying for the offsets, but also through the billions that my Breakthrough Energy group is spending, that I'm part of the solution.'

'I mean, I'm comfortable with the idea that not only am I not part of the problem - by paying for the offsets, but also through the billions that my Breakthrough Energy group is spending, that I'm part of the solution.' 

A single private jet emits as much carbon dioxide in an hour as the average person does in an entire year, with private flights 14 times more polluting (per passenger) than a commercial plane. 

Gates, the fourth richest person in the world, visited Australia in January with representatives from his organisation Breakthrough Energy, which aims to drive innovation in sustainable energy to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 

Gates was seen relaxing on Lizard Island on Queensland's Great Barrier Reef before flying his Gulfstream jet, one of two he owns, to Sydney for a meeting with Anthony Albanese.

An interactive map reveals the parts of the UK with the highest emissions of toxic pollutants - including lead, arsenic and mercury. 

Updated yearly by the government's National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory, the map shows the highest emissions in red and lowest emissions in violet for each pollutant, based on the latest data. 

Some of the worst areas for emissions are London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Newcastle and Glasgow, due to road transport, combustion plants, the manufacturing industry and more. 

Generally, northern and central Scotland, rural Wales and national parks such Dartmoor are among the least polluted areas, although this depends on the type of toxin.

It follows another interactive tool that lets the public check what the air pollution levels are at their address, as well as its ranking relative to other addresses in the country. 

The interactive map show parts of the UK that have the highest emissions of dangerous and toxic pollutants in red - including lead, arsenic, mercury, carbon monoxide and particulate matter 

The NAEI team rely on hundreds of data sources including statistics, measurements and other research to estimate emissions from each source that occurs in the UK. Pictured, concentrations for arsenic, which are high around London, Birmingham, Manchester and more

NAEI is a database run by the National Environmental Technology Centre on behalf of the government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). 

The NAEI team relies on hundreds of data sources including statistics, measurements and other research to estimate emissions from each source that occurs in the UK. 

'NAEI calculates and reports on the quantity of pollutants that are emitted to air,' it says on its website.

'This impacts on the concentrations of pollution in the air, although there is not a direct relationship between the two as concentrations can be affected by weather patterns, chemical transformations and pollutants emitted elsewhere.' 

Using the map, the public can switch between several pollutants - such as lead, ammonia, methane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, benzene, arsenic, nickel, mercury, particulate matter and much more - to see where emissions are worse for each.

Users can also select the sources that are to blame for the emissions - including road transport, combustion plants and the manufacturing industry - and highlight a particular portion of the map to see emissions within.

For example, highlighting a circle of central London with a 5km (3 mile) radius shows lead emissions of around 440 kg - around 50 times an equivalent circle in rural Kent (8.7kg). 

For some pollutants, such as ammonia and nitrous oxide, the map shows the rim of the UK smattered with violet patches, although some coastal towns and cities such as Liverpool, Kingston upon Hull, Cardiff, Southampton and Plymouth are red. 

Pictured, emissions for lead in southern England according to the map. Lead used to be added to petrol before its phase-out in 2000 - many decades after its disastrous effects on public health were known about

Highlighting a circle of central London with a 5km (3 mile) radius shows lead emissions of around 440 kg - around 50 times an equivalent circle in rural Kent (8.7kg)

NAEI stresses that where emissions are at their highest is not necessarily the same thing as where the air is most polluted, although the two are very much correlated. 

London is plagued by lead from petrol 20 YEARS after it was phased out - READ MORE 

Imperial College London experts analysed lead concentrations at two central London locations with heavy traffic

For example, some areas with the most polluted air can be due to a relatively low level of emissions occurring in a 'canyon', such as a street with high buildings, trapping the pollution. 

Many of the sources of pollutants - such as road traffic, commercial fuel use and construction - occur in urban areas, so the map shows a lot of red around cities.

But there are some exceptions - for example, the vast majority of ammonia emissions come from agriculture via the spreading of manures, slurries and fertilisers, which is predominantly done in rural areas. 

One of the pollutants with shocking amounts of red up and down the country is lead, a known neurotoxin that kills brain cells and comes from human activities including the use of leaded gasoline.

Lead was added to petrol a century ago to make car engines more efficient, but a growing body of evidence linked changes to behaviour and mental health to exposure.

Lead from leaded petrol settled in the environment before its phase-out in 2000 - but it is still suspended in the air and moves about due to wind and vehicle movement, an Imperial College London study revealed.

In similar distributions is arsenic, which is used industrially in the processing of glass, textiles, paper and more, as well as in pesticides, feed additives and pharmaceuticals. 

Long-term exposure to arsenic can cause cancer and skin lesions, and it's been associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes. 

Among the other pollutants highlighted are particulate matter - microscopic solids or liquid droplets that are so small that they can be inhaled.

Sources of carbon monoxide (CO) a colorless, odorless gas that can be harmful when inhaled in large amounts. The greatest sources of CO to outdoor air are cars, trucks and other vehicles or machinery that burn fossil fuels

Pictured, levels of PM 10 (particulate matter with diameter of 10 micrometres or less) with the borders of local authorities marked out in black. Across all pollutant types, Scotland has less emissions than England, the map shows

PM, which can easily enter the lungs and then the bloodstream, is classified based on its diameter - for example, PM 2.5 has a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers, which is about 3 per cent the diameter of a human hair. 

PM can have a natural origin - for example, wildfires or volcanic eruptions - but the majority comes from burning coal, wood stoves, forest fires, smokestacks and other human processes that involve burning. 

The map shows most of the particulate matter is the largest classification, PM 2.5, which is still invisible to the naked eye and small enough to pass through the lungs, into the bloodstream and to organs. 

According to the government, top tips for reducing exposure pollutants are not using your car for short journeys and turning off your car engine when your vehicle is stationary.

Also recommended is reducing how much you burn in your home and garden (such as wood fires) and staying away from traffic if you're walking or cycling.

The NAEI team publishes a methodology report for its UK emissions estimates on the government's website. 

Six common air pollutants identified that harm your health and the environment 

According to the Environmental Protection Agency, there are six major pollutants which can impact on human health and well-being. 





EPA calls these pollutants 'criteria' air pollutants because it regulates them by developing human health-based and environmentally-based criteria for setting permissible levels. 

Particulate matter: Particulate matter is the term for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air.

These particles come in many sizes and shapes and can be made up of hundreds of different chemicals.

Some are emitted directly from a source, such as construction sites, unpaved roads, fields, smokestacks or fires.

Fine particles (2.5 parts per million)are the main cause of reduced visibility (haze) in parts of the United States, including many of our treasured national parks and wilderness areas. 



Carbon monoxide: Breathing air with a high concentration of CO reduces the amount of oxygen that can be transported in the blood stream to critical organs like the heart and brain.

At very high levels, which are possible indoors or in other enclosed environments, CO can cause dizziness, confusion, unconsciousness and death.  



Nitrogen dioxide: Nitrogen dioxide primarily gets in the air from the burning of fuel. NO

It forms from emissions from cars, trucks and buses, power plants, and off-road equipment.

Breathing air with a high concentration of NO can irritate airways in the human respiratory system. Such exposures over short periods can aggravate respiratory diseases, particularly asthma, leading to respiratory symptoms (such as coughing, wheezing or difficulty breathing).   

Sulfur dioxide: The largest source of Sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels by power plants and other industrial facilities.

Short-term exposures to SO can harm the human respiratory system and make breathing difficult. Children, the elderly, and those who suffer from asthma are particularly sensitive to effects of SO.



Ground-level ozone: The ozone layer in the lower area of the lower portion of the stratosphere, approximately 12 to 19 miles above the surface of the planet (20 to 30 km). 

Although ozone protects us against UV radiation, when it is found at ground level it can cause health problems for vulnerable people who suffer from lung diseases such as asthma. 

It is created by chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) - that are found in exhaust fumes - in the presence of sunlight.

Lead: Major sources of lead in the air are ore and metals processing and piston-engine aircraft operating on leaded aviation fuel. 

Other sources are waste incinerators, utilities, and lead-acid battery manufacturers. The highest air concentrations of lead are usually found near lead smelters.

 Depending on the level of exposure, lead can adversely affect the nervous system, kidney function, immune system, reproductive and developmental systems and the cardiovascular system.

Infants and young children are especially sensitive to even low levels of lead, which may contribute to behavioural problems, learning deficits and lowered IQ.

A resurfaced tweet from animal rights organization PETA that claimed cow's milk is a 'symbol of white supremacy' has gone viral and amassed millions of interactions.

In a 2017 tweet, the activist group said that dairy milk is a common drink among white supremacists because 'the dairy industry inflicts extreme violence on other living beings.'

'Cow's milk has long been a symbol used by white supremacists. One more reason to #DitchDairy,' People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) said. 

The tweet was picked up and reshared at the weekend and got 4.2 million views. 

PETA also claims on its website that 'drinking dairy milk is bad for human health', but studies increasingly show that switching to plant-based versions can have lasting health consequences.

In a resurfaced tweet, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) said that dairy milk is a common drink among white supremacists because 'the dairy industry inflicts extreme violence on other living beings'

'Aside from ""lactose-tolerant"" white supremacists, cow's milk really is the perfect drink of choice for all (even unwitting) supremacists, since the dairy industry inflicts extreme violence on other living beings,' PETA wrote on its website

In a longer article on PETA's website, the agency pointed to research that has found that white Europeans can digest lactose better. 

They said that white supremacists have used that as an excuse to consider themselves the 'master race.'

'Aside from ""lactose-tolerant"" white supremacists, cow's milk really is the perfect drink of choice for all (even unwitting) supremacists, since the dairy industry inflicts extreme violence on other living beings,' the agency wrote.

'PETA is trying to wake people up to the implications of choosing this white beverage and suggesting that they choose something else pronto.' 

However, science has repeatedly shown that cow's milk has more nutritional benefits than plant-based alternatives like oat and almond milk. 

Earlier this summer, a major study found that nine out of 10 plant-based milks are 'nutritionally inferior' to cow's milk. 

These milks contained less of at least one of three vital nutrients than cow's milk: calcium, vitamin D, and protein.

Dr Abigail Johnson, the epidemiologist who led the study, said: 'Our results provide evidence that many plant-based milk alternatives are not nutritionally equivalent to cow's milk.'

Dietitian says that cow's milk is best



Dr Duane Mellor, one of Britain's top dietary researchers, told MailOnline that it is cow's milk that offers the most nutrients, protein and natural sugars. 

She even said people who drink plant-based milk exclusively should consider supplements to ensure they do not miss any vital vitamins and minerals. 

Overall, the plant-based milks had about 350 milligrams (mg) of calcium and three micrograms (mcg) of vitamin D per 8.1 fluid ounces (fl oz) (240 milliliters, ml) on average.

They also contained about two grams (g) of protein per 8.1 fl oz (240ml).

For comparison, the US Department of Agriculture says that whole milk contains about eight grams of protein per 8.1 fl oz (240ml).

It also has about 306mg of calcium and nearly three mcg of vitamin D per serving.

Additionally, a report from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which looked at more than 500 studies, concluded that animal sources of food offer 'crucial sources of much-needed nutrients.'

These include protein, fat and carbs, iron, calcium, and zinc.  

Not getting enough calcium has been linked to several health issues, including brittle nails, slower hair growth, and thin skin.

It can also increase the risk of osteoporosis, brittle or weakened bones, because when the body doesn't get enough calcium, it has to draw it from the bones. 

In kids, calcium is essential for growth and development.

This isn't the first time PETA has tweeted strong opinions about dairy with little evidence to back them up. 

Also this weekend, the agency posted: 'Drinking dairy milk is so embarrassing.' 

They did not give any explanation. When a user asked what other kinds of milk are out there, PETA responded: 'Oat, pea, macadamia, soy, tigernut, cashew, almond, coconut, rice, hemp, hazelnut, flax milk... all great alternatives.'

The organization also tweeted a video last week claiming that 'cheese destroys families' of cows because calves are 'pulled away' so their milk can be turned into cheese.

Ultra-processed foods (or UPFs) make up a shocking 60 per cent of the average diet in the UK - and increasing evidence links their high consumption with the rise in obesity, type 2 diabetes and other diseases. 

Here, in the second part of our serialisation of his new book which started in yesterday's Daily Mail, TV doctor Chris van Tulleken warns of the hidden dangers behind food which we find so tasty.

On a freakishly warm autumn day, I headed with my family to a North London park and bought our three-year-old daughter Lyra a treat. 

It was a giant scoop of pistachio ice cream - from which her one-year-old sister, Sasha, managed to scrounge a few licks. But it didn't distract Lyra for long: spotting two friends, she handed me her tub and ran off to play on the swings.

Her ice cream, I noticed, was a glistening green ball of pistachio. It took a moment to dawn on me that this was most peculiar. How was it still a ball? The sun was blazing and the outside of the tub was warm to the touch. Something had clearly stopped the ice-cream from melting.

Back home, I looked up the ingredients online. Some were what you'd expect: fresh milk and double cream, sugar, salt, a tiny dash of pistachios. 

Others, however, rang alarm bells: soy protein, soy lecithin, coconut oil, sunflower oil, chlorophyll, glucose, dextrose, stabilisers (locust bean gum, guar gum, carrageenan), emulsifier (mono and fatty acids).

These are all hallmarks of ultra-processed food (UPF). Far from buying my little daughter a proper ice cream, I'd given her what one scientist later memorably described to me as 'an industrially produced edible substance'. 

'Far from buying my little daughter a proper ice cream, I'd given her what one scientist later memorably described to me as 'an industrially produced edible substance'' (file pic)

Did it matter? After all, nobody has yet dropped dead immediately after eating an ultra-processed dessert. The answer, I'm afraid, is that it matters a great deal.

There's now a huge volume of carefully collected and analysed data that exposes the inherent dangers in consuming complex mixtures of substances that humans have never encountered before.

These substances can't even really be called 'food'. Increasingly, the calories we consume come from modified starches, from invert sugars, hydrolysed protein isolates and seed oils that have been refined, bleached, deodorised and hydrogenated.

Added to these are synthetic emulsifiers, low-calorie sweeteners, stabilising gums, humectants [moisturising agents], flavour compounds, dyes, colour stabilisers, carbonating agents, firming agents and bulking - and anti-bulking - agents.

What this means is that everything from chicken nuggets to ice cream can be made from the same base liquids and powders. 

And bear in mind that UPF is not the same as junk food (though all junk food is UPF). It's far more insidious.

Ultra-processed food makes up an incredible 60 per cent of the average diet in the UK. For one in five Britons, it's 80 per cent of what they eat

Ultra-processed food makes up an incredible 60 per cent of the average diet in the UK. For one in five Britons, it's 80 per cent of what they eat. 

Many children, including my own, get most of their calories from these substances. In short, UPF has become our national diet. It's now the main stuff from which we construct our bodies.

Yet, since 2010, a vast body of data has emerged which indicates that UPF increases rates of cancer, metabolic disease, dementia and mental illness. 

We also know that it damages our gut lining and the all-important microbiome - the bacteria that live in our intestines.

Our rate of consumption is causing a pandemic of malnutrition - caused by the lack of nutrients in UPF - and obesity. Studies suggest it's stunted the growth of children.

Five-year-olds in the UK don't just have some of the highest rates of obesity in Europe, they're also among the shortest by a significant amount - more than 5cm shorter than Danish and Dutch children of the same age, for instance.

'In the UK, we eat more ready meals than any other European country. And almost 90 per cent of us eat them regularly'

Without volunteering for it, we've become participants in a vast food experiment. New substances - the cheaper, the better - are being tested on all of us all the time.

Can a synthetic emulsifier be used instead of an egg? Can an industrially altered seed oil replace a dairy fat? Can a bit of ethyl methylphenylglycidate be chucked in instead of a strawberry? By buying UPF, we're driving its evolution.

At the same time - without most of us being aware of it - we're taking huge risks with our health.

The impact on children is a particular concern. Typically, 60 per cent of the food they eat is UPF, and they're consuming the stuff while their brains are still developing.

Will their IQ be affected? We simply have no way of knowing.

I started studying the impact of UPF at University College London Hospital, where I do medical research. 

Along with other colleagues, I was keen to find out more. That's why I agreed to become the first patient in a preliminary study. 

The plan was to get data from my experience that would help us win funding for a much larger study (which we're now undertaking).

The idea was simple: I'd quit all ultra-processed food for a month. Then, the following month, I'd eat a diet where 80 per cent of my calories came from UPF - just like a fifth of UK residents.

But, initially, I kept a food diary of a typical week. That was the first surprise: it turned out that I was generally getting about 30 per cent of my calories from UPF.

After years of writing and broadcasting about food, I'd imagined I had a pretty reasonable diet. It looked something like this: black coffee for breakfast, a sandwich and crisps for lunch and a fairly healthy home-cooked dinner (chicken, rice and broccoli is a staple), followed by a supermarket dessert.

Every few nights, rather than cooking the main course, we'd have a UPF microwave lasagne or a UPF pizza. 

I'd have a takeaway about once a week, usually UPF thanks to liberal use of modified starches and flavour enhancers.

Anyway, when I started on my first month without any UPF, I found it surprisingly hard. Suddenly I had a craving for those microwave meals, supermarket desserts and takeaways.

It was also difficult to find anything non-UPF to buy for lunch.

Most food from the hospital canteen and nearby shops were ruled out. I couldn't buy a sandwich because of the emulsifiers in the bread and the maltodextrin and preservatives in the spreads.

So I had to make my own sandwiches - mainly cheese, butter and proper sourdough bread from a local bakery. 

I couldn't even add my favourite Hellmann's mayonnaise (rapeseed oil, water, pasteurised egg & egg yolk, spirit vinegar, salt, sugar, flavourings, lemon juice concentrate, calcium disodium EDTA, paprika extract). 

My belt got looser, sure, but I started looking forward to my UPF diet.

I even began obsessing over stuff I didn't typically think about, such as takeaways from the McDonald's and KFC across the road from the hospital.

Finally the great day arrived when I embarked on the kind of ultra-processed diet that's totally normal for one in five people in the UK.

I didn't try to force-feed myself - this wasn't Super Size Me. I just ate UPF whenever I felt like it. At the same time, I was continuing my research by speaking to the world's leading experts on food, nutrition, eating and ultra-processing.

Remember my daughter's pistachio ice cream? Still wondering why it had so many ingredients, and was so reluctant to melt, I contacted a food-industry insider.

Paul Hart worked for 20 years at Unilever, as a biochemist and then as a designer of food production systems. There's almost nothing he doesn't know about UPF or the industry that makes it.

By the time I met him - appropriately enough, at a KFC outlet - I'd had a look at the ice creams on sale at my local Tesco.

Almost all, I noted, contained xanthan gum, guar gum, emulsifiers and glycerine. 

Could he explain why? 'We can use ice cream as an example to explain nearly everything about UPF,' he told me. 'It's all about price and costs - those ingredients save money.'

This is important to British consumers. In 2017, before the current cost-of-living crisis, we were spending just eight per cent of our household budget on food, less than almost anywhere else in the world. 

Germany, Norway, France and Italy, for instance, spend 11 to 14 per cent of their budget on food.

You don't get much whole food, such as meat and broccoli, for eight per cent of your budget. UPF, however, is quite a bit cheaper.

That's one of the reasons why, apart from the US, we eat more of the stuff than any other country.

Imagine you're in the poorest half of all UK households. If you wanted to adhere to our national healthy-eating guidelines, you'd need to spend almost 30 per cent of your disposable income.

But back to ice cream. How, I asked Paul, do UPF ingredients stop it quickly melting into a puddle? First, he explained, they make the ice cream tolerant of warmth. The gums, glycerine and emulsifiers stop ice crystals forming, which means it can be easily transported without the need for very low temperatures at all times.

Contrast that with what I'd call real ice cream. Cream o' Galloway vanilla ice cream appears to be made from the same ingredients that you might use at home: milk, cream, sugar, skimmed milk powder, egg yolk, vanilla essence. 

That's great, but the result is that the product can't be sold nationwide. Real ice cream is less tolerant of all that transporting around.

The ingredients used in Cream o' Galloway vanilla ice cream are also reflected in the price: £3.60 for 500ml. That's about 14 times more expensive than, for example, Ms Molly's Vanilla, exclusive to Tesco, which is £1 for two litres. 

Unsurprisingly, Ms Molly uses very different ingredients: reconstituted skimmed milk concentrate, partially reconstituted whey powder (milk), glucose syrup, sugar, dextrose, palm stearin, palm oil, palm kernel oil, emulsifier (mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids), stabilisers (guar gum, sodium alginate), flavouring, colours (carotenes).

According to Paul, many of these - palm stearin, palm kernel oil, the reconstituted milks, the emulsifiers - are simply mimicking real and expensive ingredients such as milk, cream and eggs. This molecular replacement is key to all UPF.

Traditional food (or, as we might more properly call it, food) is made from three broad categories of molecules that give it its taste, texture and calories: fats, proteins and carbohydrates.

The secret to ultra-processed ice creams is that they're constructed from the cheapest possible versions of those three essential molecules.

And not just ice creams. Pies, fried chicken, pizza, butter, pancake mix, pastries, gravies, mayonnaise - all began as real food.

But the non-UPF versions are expensive, so their traditional ingredients are often replaced with cheap and sometimes entirely synthetic alternatives. 

Usually, these are extracted from crops grown for animal food. The molecules are then refined and modified.

'We can replace almost any ingredient with a cheap modified alternative,' said Paul.

Take starch, which is extracted from cheap crops. Once modified, there's little you can't do with a starch. 

It can give a 'milkshake' a surface sheen and creamy texture. It can replace expensive dairy fats. Thin starch with acid and it's useful for textiles and laundry. 

Treat it with propylene oxide and you get that gloopy feel for salad dressings. Mix it with phosphoric acid and you can improve stability through multiple cycles of freezing and thawing - perfect for pie fillings.

What about the gums in my daughter's ice cream? If you look at food labels, you'll see lots of these, including guar gum, locust-bean gum, alginate, carrageenan and the near-ubiquitous xanthan gum.

The last of these is quite revolting. It's the slime that bacteria produce to allow them to cling to surfaces. Think of xanthan gum next time you scrape the gunk from your dishwasher filter.

Like the modified starches, gums are used to replace more expensive molecules and give food a longer shelf-life. This reminded Paul of a tortilla conference he'd attended.

'One company was boasting, in jest, that their products were essentially embalmed, with a shelf-life extending for years,' he said.

I must have looked horrified, because he quickly clarified that 'everyone was delighted!'

Even that session with Paul didn't manage to put me off my UPF diet.

At the end of Week Two, I was still looking forward to Morrisons All Day Breakfast, a frozen meal that comes in a three-compartment plastic tray with a film lid - 768 calories of baked beans, hash browns, pork sausages, omelette and bacon.

Oven-ready in minutes.

In the UK, we eat more ready meals than any other European country. And almost 90 per cent of us eat them regularly.

One day, while my All Day Breakfast sat in the oven, my wife Dinah and I cooked some salmon, rice and broccoli for her and the kids. 

This involved 20 minutes of preparation, using knives, three pans and a chopping board, resulting in a pile of washing-up and fishy hands.

When we finally sat down to eat, Dinah read out the ingredients of my ready meal: 'Dextrose, stabiliser (diphosphates), beef collagen casing, capsicum extract, sodium ascorbate, sodium nitrite, stabilisers (xanthan gum and diphosphates), flavourings.' She looked up. 'Why are you eating diphosphates?'

Forget exercise to lose weight - cut the UPFs

Lack of exercise has long been assumed to be a main reason for obesity. 'Eat less, move more,' is the mantra we're encouraged to adopt.

Makes perfect sense, doesn't it? If you move more, you'll burn more calories and lose weight. Unfortunately, we now know this isn't true.

Exercise won't burn any extra calories from your daily total, not even if you walk ten miles after breakfast.

Herman Pontzer, from Duke University in the US, is one of the scientists who's transformed how we think about diet and metabolism.

For his seminal study, he spent time with the Hadza, a tribe of hunter-gatherers in northern Tanzania, measuring the total number of calories they burned daily. 

The results were contrary to expectations.

Even though the Hadza were walking miles each day, the 2,500 calories they burned were almost exactly the

same as those burned by the average UK office-worker.

The same thing has been reported in monkeys and apes: whether they're in the wild or captive in zoos, they burn the same number of daily calories.

The significance of this is immense: it means we cannot lose weight just by increasing activity. 

So how do we square this with previous studies showing that coal-mining burned eight times as many calories as office work? 

Well, it turns out that no one actually took measurements from coal miners. The data was all based on surveys and assumptions.

When a team from the US and Turkey finally did proper measurements, they found that miners burned between 2,100 and 2,800 calories per day. 

The same as the rest of us. It seems impossible, I know, but there's a simple explanation: when we take exercise, our bodies compensate by using less energy on other things, so our overall calorie-burning stays the same. 

We can be very active for a period of time but we claw back that energy debt later. 

Partly we do this through rest and partly our bodies are doing it for us subconsciously.

After you've burned a lot of calories by being active, your body scales back on routine non-essential processes, reducing the amount of energy spent on your immune, endocrine, reproductive and stress systems.

But what about office workers - how do they manage to burn up 2,500 calories without moving much?

Scientists believe we expend those spare calories on other things - such as getting stressed, leading to increased levels of adrenaline, cortisol and white blood cells.

A sedentary lifestyle will also lead to higher levels of testosterone and oestrogen, which can lead to increased risk of cancer. In short, don't stop exercising!

If you really want to lose weight (without medical intervention), there's one sure-fire solution - cut down as much as you can on ultra-processed food.

The diphosphate stabilisers hold everything together through the freezing process so the water doesn't form crystals on the surface.

They're just one aspect of what makes the All Day Breakfast such an enjoyable product, with the hash browns a little crispy and just the right level of salt and pepper.

Above all, it's an easy meal. Easy to prepare and easy to eat fast. While Dinah was still chewing her second mouthful, I was licking the container. 

Things started to change during the third week of my ultra-processed diet, by which time I was speaking to dozens of experts. 

I'd come off a phone call to an academic in France or Brazil, then sit down to a banquet of UPF.

Often, I'd even be eating UPF during the call. But it felt increasingly like reading about lung cancer while smoking a cigarette. 

By that third week, I was struggling to eat the UPF without thinking about what the experts had told me. 

One of these was Nicole Avena, a visiting professor at Princeton whose research focuses on food addiction and obesity. 

Without additives, she told me, the base industrial ingredients of UPF would probably not be recognisable as food by our tongues and brains.

'It would be almost like eating dirt,' she said.

After that, I started to notice that much of what I was eating had little more than a veneer of food. 

This was especially true of the snacks and cereals manufactured from pastes of raw materials, which had been fried, baked or puffed.

For example, I'd come to enjoy a Grenade Carb Killa Chocolate Chip Salted Caramel Bar as a mid-morning snack. It seemed a little healthier than a simple chocolate bar.

After speaking with Avena, I inspected the ingredients. Like many other bars, it's constructed from very modified carbohydrates, protein isolates from milk and beef (calcium caseinate, whey protein isolate, hydrolysed beef gelatine) and industrially processed palm fat, all bound together with emulsifiers. 

Without salt, sweetener and flavouring, I realised, my mid-morning snack would probably be unpleasant to eat.

So would Maryland Minis Chocolate Chip Cookies, a favourite in the tea-room at work.

Again, they contain modified carbs (refined flour and invert sugar syrup), plus industrial fats (palm, sal, shea), plus added protein (whey), glued together with soy lecithin emulsifier.

All made palatable with salt, sugar and flavouring.

As if this wasn't off-putting, a Brazilian academic, Fernanda Rauber, talked to me at length about the plastics in UPF packaging. 

Especially when heated, she said, they significantly decrease fertility - and according to some experts, may even cause shrinkage of the penis.

It was Rauber who told me that 'most UPF is not food - it's an industrially produced edible substance'.

These words began to haunt my every meal. They echoed and underlined Avena's idea that without the colouring and flavouring, UPF would most likely be inedible.

As I ate, there was a tussle in my brain. I still wanted this food that, according to Rauber, wasn't really food, but at the same time I was no longer enjoying it.

Meals took on a uniformity: every­thing seemed similar, regardless of whether it was sweet or savoury. I was never hungry, but I was also never satisfied.

Suddenly there was nothing I wanted more than fresh vegetables, a few slices of free-range chicken and a tart-tasting apple.

Why small dogs like Chihuahuas live LONGER than big breeds like Great Danes, according to science

Our furry friends come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, from the tiny, handbag sized Chihuahuas, to the house-trained horses that are Great Danes. 

Sadly, it is fairly common knowledge that the life expectancies of the larger breeds tend to be much shorter than smaller ones.

Many different explanations have been put forward for this, but scientists from the University of Adelaide think they have finally found the real answer.

After analysing the common causes of death in 164 dog breeds of varying size, they found that larger animals are more susceptible to cancer.

They say this is because natural canine cancer defences have not been able to keep up with the selective breeding of giant dogs.

Scientists from the University of Adelaide think that larger dog breeds have shorter life expediencies because they are more susceptible to cancer at a younger age

'When we analysed these data sets, we discovered that larger dogs were more likely to die from cancer at a younger age when compared with smaller dogs,' said study author Dr Jack da Silva.

WHY DO SMALLER DOG BREEDS LIVE LONGER? 

After studying the common causes of death in 164 dog breeds, the researchers found that larger dogs are more likely to die from cancer at a young age.



They say this is because, over time, humans have selectively bred dogs to be as big as possible so they could guard livestock or hunt large game.

Furthermore, many of these breeds are now popular as pets because they appear impressive, majestic and intimidating.

But, as a result, dog breeds have evolved to be extreme sizes much faster than natural evolution would permit.

This has meant that their bodies' cancer defences have not had the chance to evolve in proportion to their size, so giant breeds are more susceptible to the disease.

'Larger dogs didn't necessarily age faster than the smaller breeds, but the research did show that as the breed's average body weight increased, so did the rates of cancer.

'We believe the relationship between a dog's body size and their lifespan may be caused by an evolutionary lag in the body's cancer defences, which are unable to keep up with the rapid and recent selective breeding of bigger dogs.'

A Yorkshire Terrier, which can grow to a maximum of seven pounds (3.17 kg), can live for up to 16 years.

But an English Mastiff, a gentle giant that can weigh a massive 250 pounds (113 kg), only tends to live for between six and ten years. 

For their study, published in The American Naturalist, the researchers wanted to find out why there is such a huge and consistent difference in lifespans of large and small dog breeds.

They analysed published data on the lifespans and causes of death of different breeds from around the world.

Previous studies put the shorter life expectancy of bigger dogs down to the higher metabolic rate and their increased risk of certain health conditions.

Some also said that their body size causes them to age more quickly than smaller dogs. 

However, the team found this was not the case, and instead revealed that the larger the dog, the more likely it is to die from cancer at a young age.

Two-year-old Pearl (pictured) measures just five inches in length (12.7 cm) - less than a £20 note - and weighs 1.22 lb (553 g)

They say this is because, over time, humans have selectively bred dogs to be as big as possible so they could guard livestock or hunt large game.

Furthermore, many of these breeds are now popular as pets because they appear impressive, majestic and intimidating.

But, as a result, dog breeds have evolved to be extreme sizes much faster than natural evolution would permit.

This has meant that their bodies' cancer defences have not had the chance to evolve in proportion to their size, so giant breeds are more susceptible to the disease.

The conclusion is consistent with a theory of ageing known as 'life history optimisation' or the 'disposable soma'.

'This theory is based on the idea that if you invest most of your resources and energy into growth and reproduction, you can't also invest them in cell repair and cancer defences,' said Dr da Silva.

'In all organisms, the focus is on reproducing early, even if it comes at the expense of maintaining and repairing the body and living longer.'

While this is sad news for big dog lovers, Dr da Silva is optimistic that large breeds will eventually develop cancer defences that match their smaller counterparts.

'This may occur naturally or through selective breeding, as people focus on breeding larger dogs that have lower cancer rates and thus greater longevity,' he said. 

'Most of the 400 or so dog breeds we know today have only been established in the past 200 years.

'Larger dogs haven't had time to evolve better cancer defence mechanisms to match their size. 

'This could still happen, but it may come at a cost to reproduction.'

This is due to the life history optimisation theory, as the larger energy investment in cancer defences will mean they have less available to produce large litters.

The researchers hope that their findings could eventually benefit human health as well as dogs.

Dr da Silva concluded: 'Dogs represent a good model for studying ageing in humans.

'Dogs, like humans in the industrialised world, live in an environment that tends to protect them from accidental and infectious causes of death and are thus more likely to die from age-related diseases, such as cancer.'

Gentle giants! Heavier dogs are significantly LESS likely to be aggressive, study finds 

If you're afraid of dogs, you may find yourself wary around large pooches such as Dobermans or Great Danes.

But the results of a new study could refocus your attention away from these breeds, and towards smaller pups.

Researchers from the University of Sao Paulo have revealed that heavier dogs tend to be more obedient than lighter pets.

In contrast, small, short-snouted breeds such as Pugs, Bulldogs and Shih Tzus are the most badly behaved breeds, according to the study.

A serial puppy farmer making more than $180,000 per year of breeding dogs in the most horrific living conditions has been convicted.

Kathryn Lisa King, 51, from Bullsbrook in Perth's north, faced Perth Magistrates Court charged with 17 counts of animal cruelty over her illegal dog farming operation.

Most of the animals were highly sought-after breeds and were brought up in filthy conditions at properties acting as squalid dog farms.

These dogs were bred by King and sold at exorbitant prices solely to make money.

The RSPCA believe King was racking up at least $180,000 per year in profit, which they claimed was a 'conservative' estimate.

A dog farmer has been convicted of animal cruelty after authorities discovered more than 30 dogs and puppies living in squalid conditions at her properties 

In an effort to thwart the suspicions of local authorities, King went so far as to move the dogs between three different houses. 

But a member of the public became sceptical of her operations after King refused to let them come to her home to see a puppy that she had advertised on Gumtree.

The dog farmer was reported and the WA branch of the RSPCA launched an investigation.

It led to authorities discovering 32 dogs, including four adult males, 19 adult females, and nine puppies at her properties in June 2020. 

These dogs were sick and showed signs of serious health issues including heart disease, breathing problems, skeletal issues, and skin allergies. 

They were also malnourished, underweight and unkempt.

King's dogs were all living in unhygienic, dirty and cramped conditions. 

Many were kept in cages, some of which were built for smaller animals such as rabbits and guinea pigs, or rooms that were covered in urine and faces. 

These cages were found on multiple floors at all three of her properties.

Four puppies were squeezed together into a single cardboard box with no food or water that was uncovered at one of the addresses. 

Five of the dogs were pregnant at the time. They gave birth to 22 puppies in the weeks following their seizure.

Two of the dogs and their puppies died afterwards, while the remaining dogs are in foster care.

The RSPCA launched an investigation and seized all 32 dogs and puppies at King's properties. The organisation has implored future dog owners to consider adoption or do extensive research before purchasing a pet

King was convicted and received a 10-month prison sentence suspended for 18 months, a $25,000 in fines and an 18-month Intensive Supervision Order.

She was also ordered to pay legal costs of $24,279 and care and treatment costs of $18,241.

King has previously been convicted in 2000, 2004 and 2014 for a range of criminal offences including animal cruelty, fraud, hindering an inspector, and breaching an animal ban.

She was last convicted for animal cruelty in 2014 when the RSCPA found 50 dogs at her home. A dozen of these dogs were kept in an underground bunker.

The RSPCA WA executive manager of animal and enforcement operations, Hannah Dreaver, said King's actions were 'a case of greed, pure and simple'.

'This woman was breeding large numbers of dogs with absolutely no concern for their welfare, health or safety,' she said. 

'All were popular breeds selling for thousands of dollars. These dogs were making her a fortune and she was treating them as nothing more than money-making machines, having litter after litter without proper care.'

The RSPCA has implored future dog owners to consider adoption or do extensive research before purchasing a pet.

Earth is on the brink of a global WATER CRISIS: 2 billion people still lack access to safe drinking water - and urgent action is needed, experts say

Earth is on the brink of a global water crisis, a new UNESCO report has warned.

Globally, two billion people - a quarter of the population - lack access to safe drinking water, while almost half the population (46 per cent) do not have access to safely managed sanitation, according to the report.

Worrying, experts say that without urgent action, things are set to get much worse.

'There is an urgent need to establish strong international mechanisms to prevent the global water crisis from spiralling out of control,' said Audrey Azoulay, Director-General of UNESCO.

'Water is our common future and it is essential to act together to share it equitably and manage it sustainably.'

Globally, two billion people - a quarter of the population - lack access to safe drinking water, while almost half the population (46 per cent) do not have access to safely managed sanitation, according to the report.

UK is LAST in Europe for bathing water quality, new report claims - READ MORE 

Just 17 per cent of Britain's bathing sites were classified as excellent quality, compared to 22 per cent for Poland

The report has been published on World Water Day by UNESCO on behalf of UN-Water. 

It reveals that between two and three billion people experience water shortages for at least one month per year.

This poses a serious risk to their livelihoods, through both food security and access to electricity.

The authors say the water scarcity is the result of a combination of two key factors - the local impact of physical water stress, coupled with the acceleration and spreading of freshwater pollution.

And worryingly, it could get even worse thanks to climate change. 

'As a result of climate change, seasonal water scarcity will increase in regions where it is currently abundant - such as Central Africa, East Asia and parts of South America - and worsen in regions where water is already in short supply - such as the Middle East and the Sahel in Africa,' the report reveals. 

Both low- and high-income countries are showing signs of risks related to water quality, according to the report.  

'Poor ambient water quality in low-income countries is often related to low levels of wastewater treatment,' it explained. 

'Whereas in higher-income countries runoff from agriculture is a more serious problem.'

Looking ahead, the report predicts that up to 2.4 billion people in urban areas could face water scarcity in 2050 - more than double the number in 2016.

Based on the findings, the authors are calling on governments to take immediate action to improve access to safe water. 

'There is much to do and time is not on our side,' said Gilbert F. Houngbo, Chair of UN-Water and Director-General of the International Labour Organization. 

'This report shows our ambition and we must now come together and accelerate action. 

'This is our moment to make a difference.'

HOW DO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES BALANCE RESOURCES WITH LIVING A 'GOOD LIFE'?

No country on Earth currently meets its citizens' needs at a sustainable level of resource use, a new study led by University of Leeds researchers has found. 

To conduct the study, the researchers analysed how the 150 countries fared with respect to 11 social indicators and seven environmental indicators used for measuring the achievement of basic needs within planetary boundaries.

The study mapped each country's resource use against planetary boundaries that, if persistently exceeded, could lead to catastrophic change. 

The mapping showed no country performed well on both the planetary and social thresholds because, in general, as a country achieves more social goals, it more likely exceeds planetary boundaries. 

Out of roughly 150 countries studied, Austria, Germany and the Netherlands provide their citizens with all 11 items on the list.

Denmark, Australia, Belgium, Finland, France, Japan and Sweden provide 10 out of 11 and the United States and Canada provide nine.

But none can do so sustainably, and all meet only a few of seven environmental requirements.

The US meets none.  

The country with the best balance is Vietnam, the researchers claim.

VIetnam meets six of its 11 social goals, but it meets all but one sustainability goal

Thirty five countries out of the 150 only meet one or none of the 11 necessities for a good life. 

Each country's resource use and well-being achievements are available as a website built by the academics involved in the study, allowing users to compare and contrast each country's resource use.   

The mapping showed no country performed well on both the planetary and social thresholds because, in general, as a country achieves more social goals, it more likely exceeds planetary boundaries.

Inside Queen Maxima's life: from a fairy tale romance to sister's tragic death. And how her father's links with the junta that killed thousands in Argentina's 'dirty war' threatened to wreck her royal wedding

Queen Maxima of the Netherlands is one of the most popular royals Europe, applauded for intelligence, charisma, humanitarian work - and an impressive collection of hats!

Maxima was not born in Holland. Rather, she grew up tens of thousands of miles away in Argentina before moving to New York, where she was a high-flying investment banker, working 16 hours a day.

But all that changed when she met an unassuming Prince at a party in Spain, leading to what seemed to be a fairy tale romance.

Queen Maxima and King Willem-Alexander have now been married for more than two decades - with a decade on the throne. But there have been plenty of obstacles to overcome along the way, including the tragic death of a sister and Dutch public anger about her father's involvement in the military junta responsible for the 'dirty war' than killed thousands.

The Mail's new Royals section looks back on the life of Queen Maxima as she is prepares to turn 52 in May.

The future Queen was educated at the English-style Northlands school in the city where she received a bilingual baccalaureate in 1988, speaking fluently in her native Spanish and English. Pictured: Maxima in her childhood years, around 1977

Maxima graduated with a degree in economics from the Universidad CatÃ³lica Argentina before moving to the United States to work in a number of banks in New York

Maxima Zorreguieta was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina on May 17 1971 to Jorge Horacio Zorreguieta and Maria del Carmen Cerruti de Zorreguieta. Pictured: Queen Maxima in the Netherlands in 2017

Maxima Zorreguieta was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina on May 17, 1971 to Jorge Horacio Zorreguieta and Maria del Carmen Cerruti de Zorreguieta.

Her father was an established politician, serving as the Minister of Agriculture under the regime of General Jorge Rafael Videla, commander in chief of the army and a member of the right-wing junta than ran Argentina.

His involvement in the dictatorship would later become an issue for Maxima to confront. 

It is remembered as the period of the ""˜dirty war' against political opponents in Argentina. Up to 30,000 people died.

 Maxima spent her childhood in Buenos Aires with two brothers, one sister and three half-sisters.

The future Queen was educated at the English-style Northlands school in the city, where she received a bilingual baccalaureate in 1988, speaking fluently in her native Spanish and English.

She later learned to speak Dutch as well as conversational French.

She went on to study at the Universidad CatÃ³lica Argentina, where she graduated with a degree in economics in 1995.

While at university, Maxima revealed her strong-willed nature by confronting a priest in a theology class who said 'women should serve men' to which she retorted 'why am I actually studying then?' leading her to be removed from the class.

After graduating, she had a brief stint working in Buenos Aires before relocating to the United States where she took on a series of high-flying roles.

These included being vice president of Latin American Institutional Sales for the finance house HSBC James Capel Inc. in New York before moving to Deutsche Bank, where she became vice president of Institutional Sales.

Little did she know that in April 1999, while on holiday in Seville, she would meet the love of her life.

The pair had both been attending a party at the annual Seville Spring Fair where she bumped into her future husband Prince Willem-Alexander.

During their chance encounter, the future King decided to keep his royalty a secret, not disclosing to Maxima he was a prince until later on.

When he declared his royal status, she thought it was a joke.

The fact Maxima was unaware of his royal ties, however, did not seem to put a dampener on their relationship as two weeks later Willem had flown out to New York to meet her.

Although they were in a serious relationship, Maxima did her best to keep the prince's identity secret.

She said: 'I would tell them something different (about Willem) every time, but at some point, there was nothing for it other than to say: ""He's the Prince of the Netherlands.""'

The next year, in May 2000, Maxima relocated to work at the European Union Representative Office of Deutsche Bank in Brussels, Belgium.

Soon after the move, in 2001, Willem proposed to Maxima while ice-skating on a pond near Huis ten Bosch Palace.

The couple were married on February 1 2002 at Amsterdam's Nieuwe Kerk, however, it was not straightforward leading up to the wedding and her father's past threatened their marriage.

It became a point of national debate in the Netherlands whether Maxima could become part of the royal family because of her father's ties with the junta.

Maxima's father, born on January 18 1928, into a wealthy farming family, served as the Minister of Agriculture in the 1976-83 dictatorship.

During the period of 'The Dirty War' up to 30,000 people are believed to have been tortured and killed.

It is estimated that between 7,000 and 9,000 political prisoners 'disappeared' under Videla's charge, with many being dumped in the Rio de la Plata River from airplanes.

During the dictatorship, up to 400 babies of political prisoners were stolen, being put up for adoption or given to military police couples.

The junta pursued political opponents, union members, student activists and social workers, rousting people from their homes and torturing them in clandestine detention centres.

Known as a technocrat while heading the Agriculture Ministry, Maxima's father was one of the longest-serving civilian Cabinet ministers during the regime.

But he denied knowing anything about the human rights abuses committed under the regime.

While he was shamed for his role in the regime he was never convicted unlike the leader Videla who was convicted of 66 murders, 306 kidnappings, 93 cases of torture and a number of child kidnappings. He died in 2013 in jail.

Maxima and Willem were only allowed to marry after the Dutch parliament investigating her father's past concluded that the future Queen had known nothing of the war atrocities. She had been in primary school during the junta years.

The controversy almost led to King Willem to renounce the throne to ensure he could be with Maxima, Hello! Magazine reported in 2016.

But the Dutch royal family backed Maxima in the months leading to their wedding, with Queen Beatrix famously defending her future daughter-in-law when questions were raised about whether Maxima was suitable for the royal family.

Throughout the dispute, Beatrix continued to welcome Maxima into her family, even including her in official royal photos leading up to their marriage.

Her late husband, Prince Claus, called Maxima an ""˜intelligent, modern woman' in a rare television address made to announce the engagement.

While the wedding was able to go ahead, Maxima's father was neither invited nor welcome on Dutch soil. Her mother, too, stayed away.

Speaking about the issue ahead of her big day, Maxima said: 'As a daughter I find it terrible that my father won't be there but that's the way it is, and I understand the feelings of the Dutch on the question.

'When we're in the church, we have to say, ""This is our day"". I think I won't see anyone there but Alexander.'

After marrying into the royal family, she continued to keep her Argentinian citizenship alongside her Dutch citizenship.

She said: 'I am Latin, and I will continue being Latin. I dance, I sing, and I will keep on dancing and singing.'

Her husband said at the time: 'I fell in love with this Maxima: spontaneous, interesting, nice.

'It wasn't always, nor will it be easy, but I hope that she stays the same person as she is now.'

Maxima overcame the controversy surrounding their marriage amazingly, winning over the Dutch people with her smile, charisma and intelligence.

The couple celebrated their 21st wedding anniversary earlier this year.

The most recent polls suggest that Queen Maxima is the most popular member of the royal family.

In 2013, Queen Beatrix stepped down after 33 years on the throne, making way for Williem and Maxima to take her place.

Maxima became the first Dutch Queen Consort since 1890.

Throughout her two decades in the royal family, Maxima has taken on a number of official roles.

This includes being a patron, along with her husband, of the Orange Fund, an organisation created by the couple to provide 'social welfare and cohesion in the Netherlands'.

Queen Maxima is also a member of the Council of State, which provides independent advice on legislation and governance.

Alongside her royal duties, the Queen has also put her economic skills to good use.

In 2009 she was appointed the UN's Secretary-General's Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development (UNSGSA).

Through this role, she advises the Secretary-General on how to make financial services accessible to all, including those on low income.

This helps small businesses across the world open banks or savings accounts, as well as get insurance or loans.

In 2011 she was also made an honorary chair of the G20 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI), where she looks to build relationships between the UN and G20, to once again improve inclusive finance across the world.

The couple have three children together, Princesses Amelia, 19, Princess Alexia, 17 and Princess Ariane, 15.

Her father, who died of cancer at age 89 in 2017, was permitted to attend the three christenings of his granddaughters as the Dutch government considered these a private event, rather than a state matter.

A year after her father died, Maxima was hit with another tragedy when her sister InÃ©s Zorreguieta, 33, took her own life.

This led to Maxima cancelling her royal visits to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, leaving her husband to carry out the duty alone.

Speaking on her return to royal duties, two weeks after her sister's sudden death, the Queen made a tearful statement to the press.

Following a visit to Proton Therapy Center in Groningen she said: 'People who are sick, yet who hope for a cure. My dear, gifted little sister InÃ©s was sick too. She could find no joy, and she could not be cured.

'Our only comfort is that she has now at last found peace. And I would like to say how very grateful we are for the countless letters, messages and tokens of sympathy that we have received.

'They have really helped us. I'd also like to say thank you for the respect that everyone has shown my family in this very dark period.'

Last year, Maxima shut down any perceptions that marrying into the royal family was a 'fairy tale', adding that life as a modern Queen is a lot of hard work.

She told Al Jazeera: 'I don't think this fairytale exists. I think it is more hard work than anything else I have ever done, and I was a banker in New York working 16 hours a day.

'It is a lot of responsibility and there is a responsibility for us to make a change somewhere, which is something I take very seriously.'

Are these Europe's oldest pair of shoes? Pair of grass-woven sandals at least 6,000 years old found in a Spanish bat cave

The oldest pair of shoes in Europe has been discovered in a cave in southern Spain.

About 20 pairs of the sandals are at least 6,200 years old and possibly older as other woven objects in the cave dated back to 9,500 years.

They measured around 20.5cm and would be UK child's size 13.5 today.

A pair of 5,500 year-old leather shoes were discovered in a cave in Armenia back in 2008 and Britain's oldest are 3,000-year-old, late Bronze Age toddler's shoe in north Kent.

However, the oldest footwear in the world dating back approximately 10,000 years were found in Fort Rock, Oregon amazingly preserved under a layer of volcanic ash from nearby Mt Mazama.

Twenty pairs of sandals estimated to be over 6,000 years old have been discovered in a cave in southern Spain

The latest find was made after carbon dating 76 objects from the Cueva de los MurciÃ©lagos, AlbuÃ±ol, near Granada, dug out by miners in the 19th century.

The baskets are the first direct evidence of the skill in Mesolithic hunter-gatherer societies in southern Europe.

The objects, made of wood, reed and esparto grass, date to the early and middle Holocene period, between 9,500 and 6,200 years ago.

The study from the Universidad de AlcalÃ¡ (UAH) and the Universitat AutÃ²noma de Barcelona (UAB), was published in the journal Science Advances.

Researcher at the Prehistory Department of UAH, Francisco MartÃ­nez Sevilla, said: 'These are the earliest and widest-ranging assemblage of prehistoric footwear, both in the Iberian Peninsula and in Europe, unparalleled at other latitudes.

'The new dating of the esparto baskets from the Cueva de los MurciÃ©lagos of AlbuÃ±ol opens a window of opportunity to understanding the last hunter-gatherer societies of the early Holocene.

'The quality and technological complexity of the basketry makes us question the simplistic assumptions we have about human communities prior to the arrival of agriculture in southern Europe.

'This work and the project that is being developed places the Cueva de los MurciÃ©lagos as a unique site in Europe to study the organic materials of prehistoric populations.'

The objects, made of wood, reed and esparto grass, date to the early and middle Holocene period, between 9,500 and 6,200 years ago

Cueva de los MurciÃ©lagos is located on the coast of Andalucia in the province of Cordoba, to the south of the Sierra Nevada and it is believed the finds were well preserved thanks to the low humidity levels.

The cave opens on the right side of the Barranco de las Angosturas, at an altitude of 450 meters above sea level and about seven kilometres from the current coastline.

It is one of the most emblematic prehistoric archaeological sites of the Iberian Peninsula due to the rare preservation of organic materials, which until this study had only been attributed to the Neolithic.

Study co-author MarÃ­a Herrero Otal, said: 'The esparto grass objects from Cueva de los MurciÃ©lagos are the oldest and best-preserved set of plant fibre materials in southern Europe so far known.

'The technological diversity and the treatment of the raw material documented demonstrates the ability of prehistoric communities to master this type of craftsmanship, at least since 9,500 years ago, in the Mesolithic period.

'Only one type of technique related to hunter-gatherers has been identified, while the typological, technological and treatment range of esparto grass was extended during the Neolithic from 7,200 to 6,200 years before the present'.

Now there's a catchy title: The Capitalist Manifesto. The reference by the author, Johan Norberg, is clear.

Karl Marx wrote The Communist Manifesto, and through his multi-volume Das Kapital, effectively invented the term capitalism ""” a word which ever since has had a pejorative tone. 

I would refrain from using it at all, since it conjures up an outdated image of a bloated plutocrat in a top hat and smoking a fat cigar. 'The free market' would be better, especially for proselytisers of this model: not only do people like markets, the term describes the process in which we are free to choose, ourselves, and thereby, collectively, wield more power than any business.

Now there's a catchy title: The Capitalist Manifesto. The reference by the author, Johan Norberg (pictured) is clear

But in respect of the facts, rather than terminology, Norberg's paean of praise for the market economy (as opposed to those dominated by governments) is compelling.

With masterful command of statistics, he demonstrates just how much the global switch away from state domination, chiefly through the collapse of Communism ""” but also an abandonment of measures such as foreign exchange controls in Western economies ""” has led to as rapid a decline in levels of absolute poverty as has been witnessed in human history.

At the turn of the century, almost 40 per cent of the world's population was in extreme poverty, as measured by the World Bank. That figure is now 8.5 per cent.

And ""” in a shattering refutation of the misanthropic Malthusians, who believe population growth will inevitably outstrip agricultural capacity ""” this has happened while the population of the planet has increased by 1.5 billion. It is a tribute to the astonishing market-led improvements in agricultural technology.

And, as Norberg points out: 'Higher agricultural productivity has probably saved around three billion hectares of forest and grassland since 1961. Without it, an area equivalent to the size of two South Americas would have had to be put under the plough.'

The point is that in the market economy, businesses have a vested interest in using as few resources as possible in the production process, as this reduces their own costs.

You can see this, trivially, in the way the aluminium can in which you might buy your drinks seems to get thinner and lighter every year.

It is true that some of the individuals who have led the greatest technological developments ""” notably in the U.S. ""” have become multi- multi-billionaires: so the top 0.1 per cent of the population has a much higher share of wealth than was the case through much of the previous century.

But in respect of the facts, rather than terminology, Norberg's paean of praise for the market economy (as opposed to those dominated by governments) is compelling. ""Leonardo DiCaprio pictured in Wolf of Wall Street)

But the wages of the lowest paid tenth in the U.S. have actually increased, in real terms, by 36 per cent, since 1990 and, as Norberg notes, 'if you look at income after taxes and transfers... income for the poorest fifth of households increased by 66 per cent.

'There are many ways to describe a 66 per cent increase in a quarter of a century, but stagnation is not one of them.'

What has changed since Norberg wrote his first defence of free markets a quarter of a century ago is that attacks on what is sometimes called 'the global market economy' now come as much from the Right in the U.S. ""” hello, Donald Trump ""” as the much less popular Left.

This, I'm afraid, is much to do with race. It is the ethnic minority population which has made the most progress, in material terms, in the U.S. over this period, while among the least educated of the white population, there has been a form of relative decline.

Or as Norberg puts it, 'when you are accustomed to privilege, equality can feel like oppression'.

But, in general, are the more redistributionist nations ""” such as Norberg's own Sweden, over many decades of social democrat rule ""” happier than those where the welfare state is less dominant? Or to put in another way, does relatively greater 'equality' create more wellbeing?

What has changed since Norberg wrote his first defence of free markets a quarter of a century ago is that attacks on what is sometimes called 'the global market economy' now come as much from the Right in the U.S. ""” hello, Donald Trump ""” as the much less popular Left

Norberg cites the interesting case of Ruut Veenhoven, the leading researcher into what is termed 'wellbeing', via the World Values Survey. Veenhoven, who was active in the Dutch social democrats when he first started work on his scientific study of happiness, had believed high levels of income redistribution contributed to 'wellbeing'.

But as he developed his project, he discovered that European nations with much smaller welfare states, such as Ireland, Switzerland and the Netherlands, with around half the share of social spending relative to GDP as, for example, Belgium, Italy and France, were ""” in responses to his survey questions ""” much happier.

Correlation is not the same as causation: there are many other factors at work. But Veenhoven has changed his mind: 'Happiness is not greater in welfare states. I was simply wrong.'

My own guess for the reason is that for most people a high degree of control over their life choices is vital to their wellbeing. And the market economy, for all its insecurities, remains its purest expression.

That takes the biscuit! Penguin and Club multi-packs are to shrink from eight bars to seven

Shrinkflation has struck the nation's tea-breaks as shoppers will get less for their money when buying McVitie's Digestives or picking up a Penguin.

Standard packs of McVitie's Digestives are being cut from 400g to 360g, which means customers will get three fewer biscuits for dunking.

Multi-packs of Penguin and Club biscuits are also being cut from eight bars to seven.

It is bad news for those who look forward to p-p-p-picking up a Penguin or are fans of the Club with its promise of lots of chocolate.

And manufacturers and supermarkets tend to charge the same despite cutting pack sizes in what amounts to a price rise by stealth.

Shrinkflation has struck the nation's tea-breaks as shoppers will get less for their money when buying McVitie's Digestives - which now contain three fewer biscuits

Multi-packs of Penguin and Club biscuits are also being cut from eight bars to seven.

The tactic has been stepped up by leading brands and stores against the background of the soaring cost of raw ingredients, energy, fuel, pay and other costs.

The biggest factor in the rise has been Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has pushed up the cost of commodity crops such as wheat and vegetable oils, which are widely used in the manufacture of Britain's most popular biscuits.

Just this week, analysts Kantar said grocery price inflation hit a record of 16.7 per cent in January, potentially adding £788 to annual shopping bills.

Separate research by Which? put the annual inflation figure at 14.9 per cent for biscuits with 16.4 per cent for cakes and cookies. It said essentials, such as butters and spreads, milk, cheese and bread, are up by over 20 per cent.

History suggests the prices in the supermarket will not fall in line with the smaller packs.

This means a pack of digestives is unlikely to cost any less, despite dropping from 27 biscuits to 24.

But it does not just happen to our snacks. Everything from toilet rolls, to fairy liquid, to ready meals have been subject to the grocery shrink ray in recent years.

Fairy Non Bio Pods use to contain 38 pods but now they only have 36

Last year, Tesco joined other supermarkets in cutting 50g from the weight of each of the ready meals from its own label range - from cottage pies to curries.

And Fairy Non Bio Pods Sensitive 38-packs are now 36-packs.

McVitie's confirmed its biscuit packs will be shrinking. It is expected that the smaller ones will be appearing on shelves in the next few weeks.

McVitie's, Penguin and Club's parent company, Pladis, said the content changes in response to external factors, including 'inflationary pressures', adding: 'Like many businesses, we continue to see an unprecedented rise in input costs.'

Formula One of the SKIES! Watch the incredible moment an AI pilot BEATS three human champions in a drone race

Artificial intelligence (AI) in sport may sound like something from a science fiction movie.    

But unbelievable footage has captured the moment an AI pilot overthrows three human champions in a fierce drone race.

Drone racing world champion, Alex Vanover, was among the trio of professionals thrashed by AI as it won an impressive 15 of 25 trials in a Swiss-based study.

The so-called 'Swift' technology mastered speeds of over 62mph (100kmh), with a reaction time that was 120 milliseconds faster than humans on average.

Its impressive track record is a milestone for scientists at the University of Zurich, who sought to move this pioneering technology beyond board games. 

Drone racing world champion, Alex Vanover, was among the trio of professionals thrashed by AI as it won an impressive 15 of 25 trials in a Swiss-based study 

'Deep RL (deep reinforcement learning) has enabled some recent advances in artificial intelligence,' scientists say. 

SWIFT VERSUS HUMANS SCORES 

Total games: 25

Alex Vanover, 4 - Swift, 5

Thomas Bitmatta, 3 - Swift, 4

Marvin Schaepper, 3 - Swift, 6

'Policies trained with deep RL have outperformed humans in complex competitive games, including Atari, Go, chess, StarCraft, Dota and Gran Turismo.

'Swift competed against three human champions, including the world champions of two international leagues, in real-world head-to-head races.

'This work may inspire the deployment of hybrid learning-based solutions in other physical systems, such as autonomous ground vehicles, aircraft and personal robots, across a broad range of applications.'

The Swift technology uses a complex combination of learning-based algorithms to map sensory information of a drone while controlling its commands.

As part of this study, experts put Swift head-to-head with Vanover as well as the two-time MultiGP International Open World Cup champion, Thomas Bitmatta, and 16-year-old Swiss national champion Marvin Schaepper.

The study track was set up with seven square gates that players had to pass through in order to complete each 246ft-long lap.

To win a race, a competitor was required to complete three consecutive laps before its opponent in 25 rounds.

Each pilot wore a headset that showed a video stream in real-time aboard their aircraft, providing a similarly immersive first-person experience.

Augmented reality will offer soldiers and pilots 'superhuman' senses 

Footage shows Swift - illuminated with blue lights - often rocketing past red, human-piloted drones through each gate.

The AI-powered drone outperformed all three champion flyers - scoring five, four and six wins against Vanover, Bitmatta and Schaepper respectively.

Swift's completion of three laps also took around 16.98 seconds on average - 0.4 seconds faster than runner-up Vanover at 17.38 seconds.

Scientists attribute Swift's speed to its longer-term thinking style, helping it make sharper turns and more efficient moves.

On the flip side, it's claimed that human pilots only plan their course of action up to one gate into the future.

Despite this, Swift does have its disadvantages as scientists believe it isn't as resilient as humans.

'Human pilots are impressively robust: they can crash at full speed, and""”if the hardware still functions""”carry on flying and complete the track,' scientists say.

'Swift was not trained to recover after a crash. Human pilots are also robust to changes in environmental conditions, such as illumination, which can markedly alter the appearance of the track.'

Even still, Swift is a milestone in robotics, and experts hope it will inspire other technologies in future.

'Swift won several races against each of the human champions and demonstrated the fastest recorded race time,' they wrote.

'This work represents a milestone for mobile robotics and machine intelligence, which may inspire the deployment of hybrid learning-based solutions in other physical systems.'

MailOnline asked Professor Stefan Doerr, a professor of wildland fire science at Swansea University, whether any of these technologies could be implemented in the UK.

He revealed that while wildfires are more difficult to predict here, as they are largely ignited by humans, there is more that can be done to prevent them.

He said: 'Vegetation fires destroy crops, lead to loss of carbon stored in the soil and peatlands, the loss of vegetation can promote erosion and landslides during heavy rains, and the ash from wildfires can contaminate rivers and drinking water reservoirs. 

'Where fires are natural part of the ecosystem, for example in western USA, southeast Australia and African savannas, they maintain ecosystem diversity unless they are too frequent, too large or too severe. 

'Elsewhere they may also have some benefits by generating ecological niches, but are generally detrimental to the environment. 

'Their effects on wildlife and fauna may last from a few months to many years.'

She was recently voted the most popular member of the Royal family for her ferocious work ethic, dedication to duty and 'keep calm and carry on' attitude.

Princess Anne follows the example set by her late mother, the Queen, performing her public role uncomplainingly while carefully protecting her personal life behind the scenes.

It is in the privacy of her home in Gloucestershire that she relaxes, enjoying time with her loved ones and horse riding - a place where, she says, ""˜it's really nice to come back and just be yourself.'

Although she maintains a residence at St James' Palace for use when in London, the rest of the time she can be found ensconced at her country home, the 700-acre Gatcombe Park in the Cotswolds.

At Gatcombe, located between the villages of Minchinhampton and Avening in Gloucestershire, the Princess Royal is surrounded by everything she loves: her extended family - complete with more than one former royal spouse - horses and bull terriers.

 Princess Anne's home at Gatcombe Park is a 700-acre Cotswolds estate. It is also a working organic farm with livestock including sheep, horses and rare-breed cattle 

The interior is relaxed, as this picture she posed on the Royal Family's Twitter account shows. Here, the Princess Royal, a patron of the Scottish Rugby Union, is watching England play Scotland with husband Vice-Admiral Sir Tim Laurence

Princess Anne's family live on the Gloucestershire estate. Daughter Zara and husband Mike Tindall are at Aston Farm with children, Mia, Lena and Lucas

Gatcombe Park is quite a contrast with the immaculately presented Highgrove House nearby, pictured, owned by brother Charles

Where Highgrove, the home of her brother King Charles in nearby Tetbury, boasts immaculately manicured gardens and carefully curated decor, the glimpses we've seen of the Princess Royal's Grade II listed home reveal it as refreshingly cosy, even cluttered. 

Her living room, seen in a photograph posted to Instagram during lockdown, is a comfortable jumble of family photographs, glass cases filled with animal ornaments, dog beds, distinctly 1970s-patterned floral sofas and garish lime green curtains.

Decidedly more rural than royal. 

And while the divisions within the King's family are all-too-well documented, Anne's family ties are so close that her son and daughter, Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall, still live with their children on the estate.

Even her former husband, Captain Mark Phillips, spent many years living at Gatcombe's Aston Farm following their split and is still often to be found there.

Following Peter's divorce from Autumn Phillips in 2021, both he and Autumn remained living in the grounds for a number of months to make it easier to co-parent their two children, Savannah and Isla.

Gatcombe has been Anne's since 1976, when it was bought as a wedding present for her and her then-husband Captain Phillips by the Queen. Its previous owner, the former Conservative home secretary Lord Butler, sold it for between £500,000 and £750,000 - equivalent to almost £6million today.

The 18th century manor house comprises five main bedrooms, four secondary bedrooms, four reception rooms, a library, a billiards room and a conservatory, as well as staff accommodation.

Anne is now married to second husband Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence who helps run the estate. They are pictured here with their dog Eglantyne in 1993

Anne's former husband, Captain Mark Phillips moved to Aston Farm, next to the Gatcombe Park estate, after their divorce. Today the farm is occupied by daughter Zara and her family

Gatcombe Park, with its acres of land, was the ideal home for two dedicated equestrians. Anne won medals at the European Eventing Championships and, in 1976, became the first member of the British royal family to compete in the Olympic games, while her husband won an Olympic gold.

However, the couple's marriage was plagued by infidelity on both sides. Phillips reportedly had ""˜semi-public' affairs with 'society call girl' Pamella Bordes, a Canadian public relations executive and with an anchorwoman from a British television show. In 1985, he fathered a love child with a New Zealand art teacher, Heather Tonkin.

Princess Anne, meanwhile, was romantically linked to the actor Anthony Andrews as well as her bodyguard, Peter Cross.

She and Phillips separated in 1989 and eventually divorced in 1992, the Queen's ""˜annus horribilis' in which three out of four of her children's marriages ended. 

That year, Princess Anne remarried to Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, a former Royal Navy officer with whom she had been involved for years.

Today, Sir Timothy helps the Princess maintain the estate, which is run as a working organic farm with a range of livestock, including breeding horses and cattle.

""˜Being able to take on a place like this - for me, I've got to make it work,' she has said. ""˜This is not something that comes for free, this has got to pay its way, otherwise I can't stay there.'

No wonder the back of her Range Rover is said to be full of hedge-cutting equipment.  

The princess has said she is devoted to her flock of Scots Dumpty hens and her cultivation of White Park cattle has helped an endangered breed survive.  

Princess Anne's home at Gatcombe Park in Gloucestershire is not far from King Charles's Highgrove. But royal watchers say they rarely pay visits to each other's houses

Captain Mark Phillips was often spotted supporting Zara at competitive events

The couple enjoy watching the Scottish rugby team together and Sir Timothy has said of their similarities: ""˜We are both map and chart people. We like to know where we are and see where we are going.' 

However, Sir Timothy admits he does not share his wife's passion for horses. ""˜She grew up with horses, horses have been part of her life, but it's not something I share with her,' he said. ""˜Sadly I've never been bitten by the horse bug.'

It's perhaps their shared love for all things equestrian that has helped Anne and her first husband, Mark Phillips, to remain civil since their separation. Zara has said: ""˜When they separated it was obviously sad, but the way they did it was not.'

Phillips moved to Aston Farm, the seven-bedroom farmhouse next to the Gatcombe Park estate, where he continued to live for many years with his second wife Sandy Pflueger and their daughter Stephanie, who grew up there.

Phillips has continued to be the subject of several scandals, including when he moved in with a woman 28 years his junior, showjumper Lauren Hough, after splitting from Pflueger in 2012.

Princess Anne helps to teach her grandchildren to ride in their very own paddocks and is often seen cuddling them or holding their hands

Anne's son Peter divorced his wife Autumn in 2021 (pictured together)

Throughout it all, however, he has remained a central figure at Gatcombe. During Zara's competitive career, he was often spotted supporting his daughter with his former wife at equestrian events.

To this day, he organises the annual Festival of British Eventing with Anne in the grounds of the Park - an event which attracts the world's top equestrians, over 40,000 paying spectators and coverage on the BBC.

Last year, the Princess Royal made the magnanimous gesture of accompanying Zara, 41, and Peter, 44, to the wedding of Phillips's daughter Stephanie to William Hosier at a church in Tetbury.

The Princess Royal offered another glimpse into Gatcombe when she made a broadcast during lockdown. The study seen in the background was another illustration of her practical taste, with off-white wallpaper, soft watercolour paintings and solid wood furniture. 

Just the odd small touch - a large, ornate mirror, for example - hint at a grander royal setting.  

When Zara, an Olympic equestrian - and silver medallist - married rugby player Mike Tindall, they initially lived in a £1.2 million home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, but in 2013 they moved into Aston Farm after Zara's father moved out. They have carried out extensive renovations and now have an impressive home gym, as well as adjoining stables for Zara's horses.

Mike is known to get along famously with his mother-in-law, whose sharp wit is well documented. He recently revealed that he once did a ""˜slut-drop' in front of her, ripping his trousers to reveal boxer shorts with the slogan ""˜Nibble my nuts'. ""˜As I've turned around, she's gone, ""I'd rather not"",' he said.

The Tindalls now have three children, Mia, Lena and Lucas, who was born in 2021 at home. Princess Anne helps to teach her grandchildren, including Savannah and Isla, to ride in their very own paddocks and is often seen cuddling them or holding their hands.

Autumn Phillips now has a new partner, Donal Mulryan, and Peter has a new girlfriend, Lindsay Wallace (Pictured: Peter Phillips and lindsay Wallace with Savannah and Isla) 

Autumn Phillips now has a new partner, Donal Mulryan, and Peter has a new girlfriend, Lindsay Wallace, but they all appear to be on good terms. All four were all seen attending Stephanie's wedding last year.

Despite the clamour of children, grandchildren, an ex-husband and his partner, there is one surprising absentee from the family gatherings: Anne's older brother and neighbour King Charles, who royal watchers suggest is not a regular visitor.

(Not that Anne spends much time at Highgrove). 

Perhaps that is due to change - as Anne's position grows ever more prominent in the slimmed-down monarchy.

Will her careful older brother brave the dog hair and the mud at the surprisingly relaxed court of the Princess Royal?

Mysterious engraved rock that lay unstudied for 4,000 years could be a TREASURE MAP for lost monuments in France, scientists say

For 4,000 years the meaning of mysterious markings on a Bronze Age stone slab have remained a secret.

Not anymore, however.

That's because scientists are now treating the engraved rock as a 'treasure map' to hunt for lost monuments in France.

Dubbed the Saint-BÃ©lec slab, it was claimed as Europe's oldest map by researchers in 2021 and they have been working ever since to understand its etchings.

These include elements the team said they would expect in a prehistoric map ""” including 'repeated motifs joined by lines to give the layout of a map'. 

Decoded: For 4,000 years the meaning of mysterious markings on this Bronze Age stone slab have remained a secret. Not anymore, however

Hard at work: That's because scientists are now treating the engraved rock as a 'treasure map' to hunt for lost monuments in France

WHAT IS THE SAINT-BÃ‰LEC SLAB?

The so-called Saint-BÃ©lec slab was claimed as Europe's oldest map by researchers in 2021.

Its mysterious markings have remained a secret for 4,000 years, but scientists are now starting to put together their meaning.

They are treating the Bronze Age engraved rock as a 'treasure map' to hunt for lost monuments in north-western France.

However, they say the ancient map covers an areas roughly 18.6 miles (30km) by 13 miles (21km), so it would take researchers around 15 years to properly cross reference its markings with possible sites. 

The engraved surface suggests that the slab's topography was purposely 3D-shaped to represent the valley of the River Odet in Western Brittany, while several lines appear to depict the river network.

The stone was first discovered in France in 1900 but then sat in a castle cellar until 2017, when researchers began studying it in detail for the first time.



'Using the map to try to find archaeological sites is a great approach. We never work like that,' said Yvan Pailler, a professor at the University of Western Brittany.

More commonly, archaeologists rely on radar equipment and aerial photography to discover ancient sites, while some are uncovered by chance during construction work.

'It's a treasure map,' said Pailler.

The only stumbling block is that it's going to take the researchers a long time to decode it ""” possibly up to 15 years to be exact.

That's because the map marks an area roughly 18.6 miles (30km) by 13 miles (21km), meaning that to cross reference all the markings with a survey of the area will take almost two decades.

Pailler and his colleague Clement Nicolas, from the CNRS research institute, were part of the team that rediscovered the slab in 2014.

It was initially uncovered in 1900 by a local historian who did not understand its significance, then sat in a castle cellar for more than 100 years.

That meant it wasn't until six years ago that researchers began studying the 5ft x 6ft stone in detail for the first time.  

Pailler and Nicolas were then joined by experts from universities in France and across the world in a bid to decode the mysterious rock's secrets.

'There were a few engraved symbols that made sense right away,' said Pailler.

These included coarse bumps and lines which the researchers said represented rivers and mountains in Roudouallec, which is part of the Brittany region about 310 miles (500km) west of Paris.

What the etchings mean: Coarse bumps and lines in the stone represent rivers and mountains in Roudouallec, the researchers said. Pictured top left is the team's interpretation of the engravings on the Saint-BÃ©lec slab when compared with the early Bronze Age structures known in the Montagnes noires area (top right) and known river and princely barrow features (bottom left). The final map (bottom right) shows the area of France depicted on the map with respect to other barrow locations and their corresponding theorised territories

The rock also has tiny hollows which the experts think could point to burial mounds, dwellings or geological deposits.

If these can actually be deciphered then it could lead to a load more discoveries beyond what has already been uncovered, they added.

The researchers have also scanned the slab and compared it with current maps, allowing them to establish an 80 per cent match with natural landmarks in the area of Western Brittany.

Among their other discoveries is that the topography was purposely 3D-shaped to represent the valley of the River Odet, while several lines appear to depict the river network.

However, there is a lot more work to go. 

'We still have to identify all the geometric symbols, the legend that goes with them,' said Nicolas.

Location: French scientists say the markings depict an area in Western Brittany in France

The archaeologists are also carrying out excavations at the spot where the slab was uncovered more than a century ago, seen as one of the biggest Bronze Age burial sites in Brittany.

'We are trying to better contextualise the discovery, to have a way to date the slab,' said Pailler.

This dig has already turned up some previously undiscovered fragments from the stone, which had been broken off and repurposed as a tomb wall.

The discovery, Nicolas said, hints that a once thriving ancient kingdom collapsed in a series of revolts and rebellions thousands of years ago, leading to the engraved rock being damaged.

'The engraved slab no longer made sense and was doomed by being broken up and used as building material,' he added.

When first unearthed in 1900, experts moved the stone to the Museum of National Antiquities in 1924, before it was relocated to a caste in France and eventually rediscovered by scientists in 2014. 

WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT EUROPEAN MIGRATIONS DURING THE BRONZE AGE? 

Experts combine data from data from archaeology, anthropology, genetics and linguistics to determine likely migration patterns.

Most modern Europeans are descendants of a mixture of European hunter-gatherers, Anatolian early farmers and Steppe herders. 

However, the DNA of ancient Siberians can also be found in European speakers of Uralic languages, like Estonian and Finnish.  

A 2015 study in Nature suggested that there was a large migration of people from north of the Black Sea into Eastern, Central and Western Europe that started at around 2,800 BC.

Preservatives in cured meats could raise the risk of type 2 diabetes by more than half, a study suggests.

Researchers say they have found a link between nitrites - used to add colour and flavouring to meats such as sausages and bacon - and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.

The team accessed data collected from more than 100,000 people in France who have been tracked since 2009.

Participants enrolled voluntarily and self-reported their medical history, diet, lifestyle and major health updates, and were followed for around seven years.

What are nitrites? And how do they differ from nitrates?

Nitrites and nitrates are commonly used for curing meat and other perishable produce.

They are also added to meat to keep it red and give flavour.

Nitrates are also found naturally in vegetables, with the highest concentrations occurring in leafy vegetables like spinach and lettuce.

It can also enter the food chain as an environmental contaminant in water, due to its use in intensive farming methods, livestock production and sewage discharge.

Nitrites in food (and nitrate converted to nitrite in the body) may contribute to the formation of a group of compounds known as nitrosamines, some of which are carcinogenic - ie, have the potential to cause cancer.

In 2015 the World Health Organization warned there were significant increases in the risk of bowel cancer from eating processed meats such as bacon that traditionally have nitrites added as they are cured.

The current acceptable daily intake for nitrates, according to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), is 3.7 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day.

The EFSA's acceptable daily intake for nitrites is 0.07mg per kilogram of weight each day.

Source: EFSA

Analysis suggests those who had the highest total dietary nitrite intake had a 27 per cent increased risk of developing the reversible condition.

The scientists also discovered people with the highest intake of sodium nitrite - the most important additive responsible for the characteristic colour and flavour associated with cured meats - had a 53 per cent higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

Lead author Dr Bernard Srour, from Sorbonne Paris Nord University, said: 'These results provide a new piece of evidence in the context of current discussions regarding the need for a reduction of nitrite additives' use in processed meats by the food industry.

'In the meantime, several public health authorities worldwide already recommend citizens to limit their consumption of foods containing controversial additives, including sodium nitrite.'

The amount of nitrites that people consumed from food additives in the study was, on average, 0.51mg per day.

The group who consumed the most nitrites had, on average, 0.62mg per day.

One rasher of bacon contains around 0.25mg of nitrites, according to previous research.

Roughly one in 12 adults in the UK and US has type 2 diabetes and of these, 90 per cent are overweight or obese.

Previous studies have shown eating a lot of red and especially processed meat is linked with a greater risk of the obesity-driven condition.

However, other experts have raised concerns about the most recent findings and how food additive intake was assessed.

They also warned that nitrites from food additives only contribute to around 4 to 6 per cent of total nitrite intake, with the rest coming from other sources such as drinking water.

Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London, said: 'Estimates were based on recalls of dietary intake on two separate occasions at the beginning of the study with no further estimates in the follow up period of over seven years.

'The researchers had to guess which foods contain the various nitrite additives, the levels used in the products and the amounts of the food consumed.' 

Dr Duane Mellor, a registered dietitian and senior lecturer at Aston University, said: 'When considering the meaning of this data, it is perhaps worth noting that the use of nitrites as an additive is often as sodium nitrite which is used to cure meats like bacon, which if someone is seeking to reduce their risk of type 2 diabetes would be something people would be encouraged to eat less of.

'The best way to reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes is to be physically active, maintain a healthy weight for you and eat a varied diet based on vegetables, pulses, nuts, seeds and fruit along with wholegrain and moderate intakes of dairy foods and meat - especially processed meats.' 

The findings were published in the journal Plos Medicine.

'Green' Keir Starmer plans to cut red tape to fast-track the building of onshore wind farms and nuclear power plants if Labour are elected

Labour would cut red tape to fast-track construction of onshore wind farms and nuclear power plants, it has emerged.

The party would prioritise projects judged critical to national energy infrastructure as Labour hopes to reaffirm its commitment to green energy.

The 'fast-track' green scheme - set to be announced by leader Sir Keir Starmer later this month - would see national planning policy statements updated to promote clean power development.

The proposals come after a humiliating few days for Labour during which Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves had to water down a pledge to spend £28billion a year on green industry and jobs after the Tories claimed the idea was unaffordable.

Labour climate change spokesman Ed Miliband said of the new plan: 'The Conservative ban on cheap, clean onshore wind has cost families £180 on their energy bills every year since 2015.

Sir Keir Starmer is set to announce 'fast-track' green scheme later this month

'Labour will bring down energy bills for the British people by backing clean, cheap home-grown power for all.'

The party plans to impose tough targets and a framework for decisions on plans to ensure construction can take place without delays.

But towns and villages - many in rural areas who overwhelmingly vote Labour - would not lose a veto on new developments, a party source insisted.

They told the Mail: 'We want to do it in conjunction with communities - bringing them into the process early, working with local people, and making sure they get perks if infrastructure is built close to them.

'We're not looking to override communities or remove their ability to say no if there are concerns, but we do want to speed things up.'

Last year Rishi Sunak ended a de facto ban on new onshore wind developments after a row with Tory backbenchers. However, researchers have warned that planning restrictions must be eased on renewable energy developers after the IPPR think-tank warned that at the current rate it will take almost 4,700 years for England to build enough onshore windfarms to help meet the UK's clean energy needs.

Labour climate change spokesman Ed Miliband said of the new plan: 'Labour will bring down energy bills for the British people by backing clean, cheap home-grown power for all.'

A Labour source said: 'Every clean energy infrastructure investor we speak to tells us the biggest barrier they face is the planning system. It's fast becoming a national embarrassment. We're determined to fix this - and, in contrast to the Tories, we have the political will to do it.

'Businesses know this too, which is why they're so enthusiastic about the prospect of a Labour government. We're speaking their language. That's why, as part of the launch of our climate mission - which includes our target to get clean power by 2030 - we're going to set out a fast-track scheme for critical energy infrastructure that will speed up decision times and make the process easier, while working with communities.

'As Keir said, we're on the side of the builders, not the blockers.'

Last week Mr Sunak suggested 'eco-zealots' from Just Stop Oil and other environmental protest groups were writing Labour's energy policy.

The Prime Minister said that Sir Keir was putting 'ideology ahead of jobs, ahead of investment, and ahead of our energy security'.

Two million species of plants and animals are now threatened with EXTINCTION, report warns - twice as many as previously thought

As many as two million plant and animal species are now threatened by extinction worldwide, scientists have revealed.

The study, led by Dr Axel Horchkirch of the Luxembourg MusÃ©e National d'Histoire Naturelle, found that twice as many species were at risk as had previously been estimated.

An analysis of 14,669 species, which accounts for approximately 10 per cent of Europe's biodiversity, found that a fifth of European species are at risk.

The list includes several animals such as the Blue Wale, Angelshark, European Mink, and La Gomera Giant Lizard. 

Meanwhile, many plants are also at risk of being wiped out, ranging from the beautiful Aster des Pyrenees to the towering Spanish Fir. 

A fifth of of all European species are at risk of extinction, meaning that animals like the critically endangered La Gomera Giant Lizard might not be around for much longer 

Europe's biodiversity is under threat from a number of sources, but the areas of the Mediterranean and Alps maintain the highest density of different species

The study found that invertebrates - a diverse group including insects, bivalves and cephalopods - were far more at risk than previous estimates had suggested.

Dr Horchkirch says that changing agricultural land use, including tree plantations, is now the biggest threat to Europe's flora and fauna. 

Of the species assessed, 2,389 were classed as threatened by extinction by the IUCN Red List which is considered to be the most comprehensive source of conservation information.

This includes 18 per cent of vertebrates, 24 per cent of invertebrates, and 27 per cent of plants.

These results more than double previous estimates which suggested that only 10 per cent of invertebrates were threatened by extinction.

The study notes that vertebrates, the group including birds, mammals, fish and reptiles, received 'substantially more conservation attention'.

Dr Hochkirch told MailOnline that more action was needed to protect invertebrate species.

'We need more conservation efforts to preserve insect species. For highly threatened species, we need to develop and implement conservation action plans,' he said.

'The conservation success for many formerly threatened vertebrate species shows that conservation works - but it must be done.'

Invertebrates like this Blue-eyed Goldenring are far more at risk than previous estimates had thought, nearly a quarter of invertebrate species are threatened by extinction 

This graph shows how different threats affect species on the red list, agriculture remains the biggest threat to biodiversity for most species 

The study found that the biggest threats to Europe's biodiversity were changes to agricultural land use, but cautioned that stopping farming could hurt biodiversity even more.

Species were threatened by the conversion of natural land into farmland and the intensification of farming practices, but also the abandonment of agricultural land.

The EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) favours larger farms while pushing out smaller businesses.

The report's authors write: 'Smallholder farming is in decline, leading to the abandonment of marginal lands, which are often particularly species-rich and reliant on extensive agricultural land use.'

Many species require the specific conditions of arable farmland to grow, meaning that the decline of smallholding has actually contributed to species becoming endangered

It is also noted that many threatened species are adapted to grasslands which can only be maintained by livestock grazing or mowing.

Dr Hochkirch told MailOnline that working together with farmers is the best way to protect Europe's endangered species.

'If we better promote small-holder farming, we would restore a higher diversity in land-use in Europe and this would benefit many species and farmers,' he said. 

'If we would create larger no-take-zones in marine areas, this would help to recover fish populations and make fisheries sustainable.'

This study comes amid mounting concerns around the impact of human activities on the world's biodiversity.

Salt and fresh water environments are also under threat, but the researchers say that responsible fishing practices can benefit animals and the fishing industry 

Last month the US Fish and Wildlife Service declared that 21 species were now considered officially extinct, including 10 birds and two fresh water fish.

The government body called the announcement a 'wakeup call' for the damage being caused by human activity.

Likewise, recent studies have suggested that humanity might miss out on half of all future medicines due to the extinction of so many plants.

Scientists estimate that 45 per cent of flowering plants worldwide are endangered, putting a valuable source of future medicines at risk of being lost.

Dr Hochkirch and his co-authors also stress the importance of biodiversity to humanity's health and economic success. 

They write: 'Biodiversity is the foundation underpinning food security, human wellbeing and wealth generation'.

Which European species are threatened by extinction?

Mammals (41) including:

In Europe 41 members of the mammal family are considered to be at risk of extinction including this Long-fingered Bat

Reptiles (26) including:

The IUCN lists 26 reptiles as being vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered 

Birds (72) including:

Amphibians (24) including:

Plants (1107) including:

Arthropods (858) including:

 Blue-eyed Goldenring - Endangered

Splendid Cruiser - Vulnerable

 Epirus Dancing Grasshopper - Critically Endangered

Extraordinary story of how a remote section of Australia's Outback almost became a Jewish homeland - a decade before Israel's creation

Western Australia's remote but spectacular Kimberley region was almost turned into a Jewish homeland during the Holocaust - and more than a decade before Israel became a nation.

If history had turned out differently, the Jewish people could have lived far away from the restive Middle East and established their homeland within Australia.

Battles for sovereignty would have been of the legal native title variety rather than the military kind, well away from the disputed holy city of Jerusalem, where both Jews and Muslims claim a religious connection. 

Just four months before World War II broke out in 1939, the Freeland League for Jewish Territorial Colonists sent Russian-raised socialist Isaac Steinberg - a former Soviet justice minister - to Western Australia to investigate the idea of buying 2.8million hectares of land in the state's north-west to settle 75,000 Jewish refugees.

Western Australia 's remote but spectacular Kimberley region was almost turned into a Jewish homeland during the Holocaust - and more than a decade before Israel became a nation

This idea, known as the Kimberley Scheme, proposed to allow Jewish refugees to develop pastoral and agricultural industries in a remote and sparsely populated area, stretching from Wyndham in Western Australia to the Northern Territory's Victoria River.

Pro-Palestine supporters protested against the Sydney Opera House landmark being lit up in blue and white as a show of support for Israel following Hamas terror attacks that killed 1200 civilians.

During the rally attracting 1,000 people, some were seen chanting 'gas the Jews' and other anti-sematic slogs, as well as burning the Israeli flag.

The Project's Waleed Aly highlighted how pro-Palestinian rallies could be banned in Australia following an ugly demonstration on the steps of the Sydney Opera House

The Connor, Doherty and Durack Ltd company's managing director Michael Durack was willing to sell the land at a 'reasonable price'.

This followed discussions between the league and Australian government representatives in London. 

While the Kimberley is remote, it is fertile and productive. 

Israel, in spite of having hostile neighbours, has been a paragon of agricultural innovation, pioneering drip irrigation and vertical gardens to grow wheat and strawberries in the Negev Desert.

The Kimberley is now home to the Ord River scheme, which has flourished since the 1963 opening of the Kununurra Diversion Dam and the 1971 creation of Lake Argyle, the largest freshwater storage on mainland Australia.

It grows tropical fruits, chickpeas and sugarcane. 

When Steinberg landed in Perth in May 1939, the Holocaust had already been going for six years.

Jews were being murdered after Adolf Hitler's Nazis spearheaded the boycott of Jewish businesses and the seizure of property in Germany.

By 1940, Western Australia's state Labor government, led by then premier John Willcock, was fully supportive of the Kimberley Scheme, as was the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, as the ACTU was then known.

Australian National University visiting fellow Dr Brian Wimborne, a research assistant with the Australian Dictionary of Biography, noted the Jewish people were pleasantly surprised.

'Australia did not have a tradition of extreme anti-Semitism that in much of Europe was characterised by pogroms and massacres; and the delegation was pleasantly surprised by the sympathy and understanding it received from non-Jewish organisations and individuals,' he said.

The left of politics during that time was supportive of the Jewish people, and the Kimberley Scheme proposal was modelled on the kibbutz, based on a collectivist model of agriculture that had been practised by Jewish farmers in the Middle East since the early twentieth century.

But there was opposition from the popular Smith's Weekly tabloid, founded by journalist Robert Clyde Packer, the great-grandfather of former media and casino mogul James Packer - a billionaire who is now an ardent supporter of Israel.

In the later war years, Labor prime minister John Curtin in July 1944 informed Steinberg the Australian government would not 'depart from the long-established policy in regard to alien settlement in Australia' and could not 'entertain the proposal for a group settlement of the exclusive type contemplated by the Freeland League'.

The Kimberley Scheme proposed to allow Jewish refugees to develop pastoral and agricultural industries in a remote and sparsely populated area, stretching from Wyndham in Western Australia to the Northern Territory's Victoria River

Curtin's Labor successor Ben Chifley didn't support the idea either, even after Steinberg published the book Australia - The Unpromised Land.

On May 14, 1948, Israel became a nation with David Ben-Gurion from the Labour Party its founding prime minister.

That occurred three decades after the signing of the 67-word Balfour Declaration committing the British to 'the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people' during the height of World War I in November 1917.

That document was signed by UK foreign secretary Arthur Balfour, a former Conservative prime minister, and Lord Lionel Walter Rothschild, a British banker and leader of the Zionist movement. 

Instead of fighting Islamist group Hamas on the Gaza Strip, the world's Jews could have established their own version of Israel in Australia alongside Aboriginal people (pictured is a strike on Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip as Israel retaliates against Hamas militants)

Rise of the super fungus: Diseases from ringworm to deadly lung disease are becoming untreatable because of these new infections

An old infectious foe is returning with a vengeance: it's called ringworm. Despite the name, it is not a worm but a contagious skin fungus that can disfigure ""” and it has learnt how to defeat our best medicines.

Doctors are reporting multiple cases of drug-resistant infections ""” which cause large, itchy red rashes and are spread by 'intimate contact' ""” across the UK.

More worrying still, Good Health can reveal that this resurgent ringworm is only the latest in a growing series of fungal infections to emerge with drug-resistant powers ""” and some can be lethal.

Despite ringworm's reputation as a scalp disease of Victorian slum-dwellers, it is a common fungal infection today, estimated to affect between 10 and 20 per cent of the population, mainly children. While very contagious, it has been regarded as benign.

Yet the infection sparked global alarm last month when doctors in the U.S. reported that two women, aged 28 and 47, in New York had been diagnosed with a worrying new drug-resistant strain called Trichophyton indotineae; the first known cases in the country.

Jill Fairweather (pictured), a 66-year-old from Maidenhead, in Berkshire, has lived with an aspergillus lung infection for more than four decades 

Now UK experts have told Good Health that there are multiple patients suffering with the same drug-resistant strain of ringworm here.

There have been at least 40 new cases of the drug-resistant ringworm diagnosed in UK hospitals, a spokesman for the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) told Good Health, adding: 'these are predominantly in the London area'. However, the number could be significantly higher, partly because there is no mandatory, official reporting system for the infection.

Dr Alireza Abdolrasouli, a clinical scientist in medical mycology [the study of fungal infections] at King's College Hospital, London, told Good Health: 'There are multiple cases of Trichophyton indotineae across London and the UK.

'The infection primarily affects the body, including the trunk, groin and buttock areas and is mostly transmitted by direct skin-to-skin contact. Such skin infections can be chronic and disfiguring and cause affected people psychological distress.'

Crucially, Dr Abdolrasouli warns: 'This infection is resistant to the antifungal drug terbinafine [the first-line NHS medication] and is difficult to treat.'

Similar cases have been reported by Dr Richard Barton, the principal clinical scientist in mycology at the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. 'I'm aware of seven cases of Trichophyton indotineae in the Leeds area,' he told Good Health. 'Most of the cases I've seen are from GPs.

'If a patient's infection is resistant to terbinafine, then testing usually shows us that it is susceptible to [another antifungal] itraconazole.'

However, he adds: 'We have found that even after treatment with itraconazole, the infection can come back again'. This suggests some resistance to some of our best antifungal meds.

'If we increase the itraconazole dose, we may get side-effects such as gastrointestinal upsets, rashes and liver-function problems. Yet we don't have many other drug options.'

An old infectious foe is returning with a vengeance: it's called ringworm. Despite the name, it is not a worm but a contagious skin fungus that can disfigure ""” and it has learnt how to defeat our best medicines

For patients, he says, 'the worst-case scenario is that the skin infection persists and causes disfiguring and itchy lesions'.

It can also spread and 'sometimes there is a lot of skin area affected, including the groin,' he adds.

'Most of the treatment-resistant ringworm infections we've seen have involved a link to travel from countries such as India or the Far East, but not all, so there is probably some spread within the UK.'

And thanks to its infectiousness, 'we will probably see more of this', adds Dr Barton.

The news of ringworm's treatment resistance comes in the wake of increasing cases of treatment-resistant athlete's foot.

Athlete's foot can become 'untreatable' even with the strongest over-the-counter creams, due to the rise of drug-resistant strains of the fungus Trichophyton rubrum, which most commonly causes the skin infection, it was reported last month.

Previously, one application of the antifungal terbinafine (found in most over-the-counter creams) was sufficient to clear athlete's foot infections ""” but now around a third of NHS patients need to use multiple doses, experts say.

If it becomes untreatable, then patients would have to stay on antifungal medications almost continuously to keep their infections under control: even then, the infection might not respond and could get worse (In the case of athlete's foot, it can affect the toenails ""” which may thicken, become discoloured or crumble ""” and even spread to your hands or groin. Athlete's foot can also make you more vulnerable to bacterial infections, such as cellulitis.)

It's not just fungal skin infections that are becoming resistant to available treatments. The same resistance is being seen with potentially lethal fungal infections caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, which targets our airways, and Candida auris, which affects the blood.

Aspergillus fumigatus is found widely in the air, soil, food and in decaying organic material such as garden compost.

It spreads via microscopic airborne spores and primarily infects the lungs, where it can cause life-threatening chronic pulmonary aspergillosis ""” this kills around 60 per cent of those affected.

Candida auris can live on our skin and on hospital and domestic surfaces ""” but it can enter the bloodstream and spread through the body, killing 30 to 60 per cent of infected people.

Both of these are 'opportunistic' fungi, meaning they prey on people with vulnerable immune systems who can't fight them off.

At the height of the pandemic, for example, researchers at Exeter University warned that as many as a third of patients with severe Covid-19 who were admitted to intensive care became infected with Aspergillus fumigatus.

And in 2019, evidence published in the journal Lancet Respiratory Medicine revealed how aspergillus had evolved into a super-fungus that could afflict otherwise healthy people with viral infections, particularly flu.

One patient in five with severe flu in intensive care gets infected with aspergillus, with the same proportion of immunocompromised people affected, says Darius Armstrong-James, a professor of infectious diseases and medical mycology at Imperial College London. Also, he adds, 'up to 10 per cent of severe asthma sufferers get aspergillosis'.

The fungus Trichophyton rubrum causes ringworm. the high number of cases of Trichophyton indotineae appearing in India 'probably relate to a lack of drug regulation there'

And increasing resistance to drugs is a significant part of the reason why the five-year mortality rate for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis is so high, with around 60 per cent of patients dying, he says.

What's more, the problem threatens to worsen.

'We're definitely seeing an increase in fungal infections,' says Professor Armstrong-James.

And with that inevitably comes an increase in drug-resistant infections (the more antifungals are used, the greater the chance of fungi becoming resistant to them).

'The Netherlands has 25 per cent resistance to antifungal drugs,' says Professor Armstrong-James. 'We're not yet as high as that, but if things don't change we'll be in the same situation.

'At the moment, with the best aspergillosis medication we're looking at a 50 per cent response rate.'

For some patients, aspergillosis treatment becomes a gruelling cycle of trips to hospital for intravenous infusions of strong antifungal drugs.

This is the prospect that faces Jill Fairweather, a 66-year-old from Maidenhead, in Berkshire, who has lived with an aspergillus lung infection for more than four decades.

'I'm having a rough time at the moment,' Jill told Good Health.

'Aspergillosis is a horrible condition where you cough up blood and you sound like you smoke 40 a day.'

Jill had suffered with severe asthma since she was four; her mother was diagnosed with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis when Jill was 17.

'They say it's not hereditary, but my mother told the doctors that my asthma had become uncontrollable and perhaps I had the condition too,' says Jill.

Her mother died shortly afterwards, in her 50s. Jill was put on the steroid drug prednisolone to calm her lungs' inflammatory reaction to the aspergillus.

'Steroids made me balloon in weight,' she says. 'I went from a size 8 to a size 16, which was horribly stressful.'

At the end of the 1980s, she was taken off steroids when a new antifungal drug, itraconazole, appeared. It works by slowing the growth of fungi that cause infection. 'My body couldn't tolerate it,' she says. 'The drug put dangerous pressure on my heart [a rare side-effect] and made my ankles swell.'

Instead, Jill had to stay on large doses of steroids, which caused her to develop type 2 diabetes (a recognised side-effect) but which 'kept me alive until finally I was put on a new drug called Fungizone in 2014 ""” which worked wonders,' she says. It also helped her lose weight, as she stopped taking steroids.

Fungizone works by interfering with the membranes of the fungus cells. 'Then last year the Fungizone stopped working,' says Jill. 'The infection seems to have become resistant to the drug.

'Hospital scans showed that I had started to develop aspergillomas ""” fungal balls ""” in my lungs.'

These occur as the fungus multiplies inside the lung, forming a ball-shaped clump which incorporates dead tissue from the surrounding lung, mucus and other debris.

UK figures suggest that the chances of a patient diagnosed with an aspergilloma dying within the next five years is between 50 and 85 per cent.

Doctors then tried to treat Jill's resistant infection with antifungal posaconazole tablets, which work by preventing fungi producing a substance called ergosterol, a component of the cell membranes.

'However, I had another lung scan which showed the fungal balls have only got bigger and thus apparently developed resistance to a new drug again,' says Jill.

Now she has been told she will have to go regularly into hospital for intravenous infusions of Caspofungin, one of a new class of antifungals, echinocandins, that also attack fungal cell walls.

Jill says: 'I had one course last year. I had to stay in hospital for more than two weeks.

'I had six months of feeling quite good, but in February my breathing worsened again. My lung scans show the disease has progressed again. It looks as though I will have to go into hospital for three weeks every three months for more Caspofungin treatment.

'I'm not looking forward to it. And if that treatment stops working, I've run out of options.' Nevertheless, she adds: 'I try to keep positive. My husband Martin helps when I'm struggling to cope with daily life.'

In 2018, Jill co-founded the Aspergillosis Trust, a charity that runs an online support group for patients and their relatives. 'Running the charity helps me to keep going,' says Jill.

Scientists are trying to fathom what is driving fungi to become more infectious and to resist our best medicines.

Dr Rebecca Drummond, a fungal immunologist at Birmingham University, says global warming seems one likely culprit. 'Climate change already seems to have affected Candida auris,' she told Good Health.

'We had not heard of this species until 2009. Genetic analysis suggests it emerged on different continents at the same time.'

Dr Drummond says climate change may have driven fungi such as Candida auris to adapt to living in warmer situations: 'Normally fungi don't like temperatures as warm as the human body. Being hot is one of our best defences against fungal infection.

'If they are learning to overcome this, there may be a real concern that more of these infections will be likely to afflict us.'

Overuse of current antifungal medicines worldwide is another problem, according to Dr Barton.

He says the high number of cases of Trichophyton indotineae appearing in India 'probably relate to a lack of drug regulation there'.

'In India, people use a lot of non-prescription skincare products that contain the antifungal drug terbinafine,' he says. 'This may have driven the fungus to develop resistance.'

Such overuse problems have also been seen in Europe, particularly in countries such as the Netherlands, which uses high levels of the 'azole' class of antifungals to prevent fungi attacking flower crops ""” essentially the same drugs are being used on crops as humans.

Numerous reports suggest that this constant exposure has enabled fungi such as aspergillus, which thrive in garden compost and leaf piles, to learn to resist the azole drugs that doctors use as first-line medical treatments for these infections.

Now this story threatens to be repeated. In response to the azole-resistance problem, researchers have developed a promising new antifungal called olorofim, which is in its final clinical trials and could be deployed for use within 12 months.

There are high hopes for olorofim, as it has already shown high effectiveness against fungal infections including azole-resistant aspergillosis. However, a new antifungal ""” ipflufenoquin ""” has meanwhile been developed for use in agriculture. Both drugs target the same molecule.

Studies at the University of Manchester have shown that exposure of aspergillus to ipflufenoquin actually spurs the rapid evolution of resistance to olorofim.

As Professor Armstrong-James warns: 'With olorofim, agricultural use may rapidly cause a repeat of the azole problem. It's a serious worry.'

His answer, controversially, is to allow the use of genetically modified crops which have DNA that has been artificially engineered to fight off fungal infection.

More immediately, Dr Abdolrasouli says we must have better monitoring of drug-resistant fungal infections in the UK.

'There is a pattern appearing here with increasing resistance,' he says. 'The numbers are growing, so it is very important for us to monitor what's going on. If we don't monitor closely, we may

face a major problem that we don't see coming.'

The emergence of new drug-resistant fungal infections such as ringworm, along with the persistent growth of lethal fungi such as aspergillus and Candida auris, should surely put the world on alert to the growing threat.

But worryingly, we can't be fully certain from officially released figures how many cases involving these dangerous contagions there are in the UK.

That's because, as with the ringworm fungus, there is currently no routine system for reporting patient cases of aspergillus infection, as they don't have a 'specific reporting code'. This is a code given to an infection for logging it on a central NHS database. If a disease is not coded, its incidence cannot be easily monitored.

Figures from the NHS suggest that there are now as many as 10,000 aspergillosis infections diagnosed in the UK each year, while a 2018 report by the UKHSA indicated that Candida auris had caused large outbreaks in at least three hospitals, with sporadic cases in more than 20 NHS trusts.

But no official body is actively monitoring the actual numbers ""” and experts fear the true picture may be much worse.

Dr Barton says: 'We need funding to look at the extent of the infection in the population, as well as studies looking at the sensitivity of the fungus to various drugs and at patient outcomes.'

The health service also needs to be more focused on this ""” Dr Abdolrasouli warns that currently it is not sufficiently alert to the emerging dangers of drug-resistant fungi.

'Most of the routine NHS diagnostic laboratories around the country may not be looking at anti- fungal sensitivity testing,' he says.

'Major centres in large cities are not performing these tests routinely. It is crucial to introduce national and regional surveillance programmes both in hospitals and in the environment.'

Otherwise we may belatedly wake up to a whole new level of pandemic.

The ten foods in your shopping cart that are most likely to make you sick have been revealed.

Researchers at Consumer Reports ranked regularly purchased foods based on how many outbreaks, deaths and illnesses they had caused in the US between 2017 and 2022.

Their list included more than 200million units of recalls and 5,000 food poisoning cases. They found that leafy greens were the worst offenders, alongside cheeses and deli meats, ground beef and chicken and turkey.

But there were also some surprises ""” including onions and flour ""” with researchers saying outbreaks in these products were linked to contaminated irrigation water.

Brian Ronholm, the director of food policy at the New York-based group, said: 'We aren't saying people need to avoid these foods entirely. After all, these foods are all usually safe and many of them are in fact important parts of a healthy diet. 

Shown above are the ten foods that are most likely to make you sick. The list is based on the number of recalls, illnesses and deaths linked to foods commonly bought in grocery stores between 2017 and 2022

'But the list underscores the importance of following best food safety practices with all of your foods, including knowing how to track, and respond, to food recalls as they happen.'  

About 48million Americans fall sick from salmonella, listeria and E.coli picked up in foods every year. 

Most recover on their own after a few unpleasant days, but nearly 130,000 are hospitalized and 3,000 die from foodborne illnesses annually. 

Children under five years old, older people and pregnant women are at greatest risk beause they have a weaker immune system.

Outbreaks are often linked to E.coli, listeria and salmonella, bacteria which are often found lurking in the guts of animals. They can get into food via contaminated irrigation water or machinery in factories.

Below is the list of foods most likely to make you sick:

Leafy greens came top of the list for the food most likely to make you sick

Leafy Greens

Number of deaths: 11

Number of illnesses: 614

Outbreaks and units recalled: 50 and 4,390,638 cases.

Leafy Greens came top of the list for foods that are most likely to make you sick after consumption.

They were behind the most deaths out of all the items on the list and the second highest number of outbreaks ""” behind only cheese and deli meat.

Researchers said that lettuces, arugula, kale and others tend to get contaminated by dirty irrigation water.

Cows hold billions of dangerous bacteria like E.coli and listeria in their guts. When the animals defecate, these are released onto the soil where they can be washed into the groundwater supply.

These 'dirty' waters can then be sucked up by machines and used to irrigate crops, spraying the bacteria directly onto greens.

Contamination can also happen during packaging, researchers said, because should the bacteria get onto machinery it can quickly be spread to many leafy greens.

There are also few packaging centers in the salad industry, raising the risk of widespread contamination.

Machinery contamination was likely behind the 2021 outbreak when a major recall by Dole saw 76 products recalled while Fresh Express had to recall more than 100 products.

Farmers in California and Arizona ""” where most US greens are grown ""” are trying to reduce the risk by grazing cattle away from their crop fields.

But Consumer Reports said there are also several steps consumers can take to limit their risk of infection.

This includes buying whole-head lettuce instead of mixed products because this has not been exposed to as much machinery cutting the risk of contamination.

They said it would also be worth removing the outer leaves on greens before eating them, as this is where most bad bacteria will be lurking.

Cheese and deli meats were second most likely

Cheese and deli meat

Number of deaths: 7

Number of illnesses: 409

Outbreaks and amount recalled: 122 and 16,925,594lbs

Listeria can be accidentally introduced to delis by contaminated meat or cheese.

Once there, the bacteria are adept at surviving in cool and damp conditions meaning it will flourish and start to spread between products. Handling the foods further helps it spread between foods.

Listeria is particularly dangerous, with 90 percent of people infected ending up in hospital. In pregnant women, an infection can lead to miscarriage or deaths.

In an outbreak late last year linked to deli meat, one person died and another 13 were hospitalized as well as a pregnant woman who miscarried. 

To limit the risk of catching listeria, Consumer Reports recommended avoiding deli counters altogether.

They said the meats in them are often 'nutritional nightmares', being high in salt and made of processed meat ""” linked to cancer and heart disease.

To further limit exposure, they also recommended buying pre-packaged cooked meats instead as this limits the risk of infection.

Ground beef, which is usually made up of seveeral animals, was third

Ground beef

Number of deaths: 2

Number of illnesses: 643

Outbreaks and amount recalled: 22 and 13,744,438lbs

Ground beef came third on the list of foods most likely to make someone ill, with two deaths and 643 illnesses linked to it since 2017.

Bacteria within cows' guts ""” E.coli and salmonella ""” can get into their meat, researchers warned.

This can happen with steaks, but the bacteria is usually on the outside and is quickly killed during cooking.

But with processed meat, the bacteria can end up anywhere within the mince ""” which is often made up of several animals.

To avoid illness, Consumer Reports said the ground beef would need to be entirely cooked through to ensure any lurking bacteria were killed.

They also suggested keeping meats in bags within the refrigerator and to have a separate chopping board for meat and vegetables.

The meat should be stored at 40F (4C) they added to limit bacteria growth while frozen foods should be thawed in a refrigerator.

Onions also made the list, which the reseaerchers said was linked to major recalls due to contaminated irrigation water

Onions

Number of deaths: None since 2017

Number of illnesses: 2,167

Outbreaks and amount recalled: 13 and 78,015,814lbs

Onions are often added to meals as a way to increase their volume, texture or, for some people, flavor.

But research by Consumer Reports found the seemingly benign vegetable was the fourth most likely food to make someone ill.

Their report found that it was behind the most food poisoning cases since 2017 out of all items on the list, with some 78million lbs of onions having to be recalled.

Like leafy greens, they can get contaminated with salmonella after they are irrigated with water that contains droppings from wild birds.

In 2020 and 2021, two large recalls of red, white and yellow onions had to be called because of contamination with salmonella.

Consumer Reports said that in most cases salmonella is killed during cooking.

But they said that in order to further avoid the bacteria, shoppers should not purchase bruised onions ""” because the damage makes it easier for bacteria to enter the vegetable.

They also suggested not washing onions if you are not going to cook them for hours because this can help drive the growth of bacteria. This should only be done just before cooking.

Chicken and turkey were also linked to food poisonings

Chicken and Turkey

Number of deaths: 3

Number of illnesses: 588

Outbreaks and amount recalled: 8 and 584,711lbs

Also on the list were chicken and turkey due to previous recalls over contamination with salmonella.

This micro-organism lives in the guts of the birds and can be transferred between them via contact with droppings.

It often lives among the poultry thanks to the filthy and crowded conditions that they are reared in and can then contaminate carcasses while they are processed in a factory.

The bacteria is a known risk with the birds that is accepted by the US Department of Agriculture.

Their guidelines state that salmonella can be in up to 9.8 percent of chickens tested, 15.4 percent of chicken parts and 25 percent of ground chicken.

Salmonella can be killed when chicken or turkey are heated during cooking.

But to further limit risk, Consumer Reports says not to wash any poultry before cooking.

They said this could wash any salmonella on them onto the sink which can then be transferred into other foods.

Papayas can become contaminated when they are chopped by machines

Papayas

Number of deaths: 2

Number of illnesses: 332

Outbreaks and amount recalled: 12 and 600,974lbs

Coming seventh on the list were papayas which are often imported into the United States from Mexico.

These fruits can become contaminated with salmonella via irrigation systems that are frequented by waterfowl.

Previous investigations showed that the papayas could also be contaminated in factories.

They may be washed in water containing too little chlorine, providing an opportunity for the bacteria to spread, or factories may keep reusing pallets that could have become contaminated.

Consumer Reports said it was best to avoid pre-cut papaya to limit the risk of catching salmonella from the fruit.

Peaches can also be contaminated by machinery

Peaches

Number of deaths: 0 since 2017

Number of illnesses: 101

Outbreaks and amount recalled: 6 and 113,062,324lbs

Peaches ranked eighth on the list of foods that are most likely to make you sick.

The fruits are often grown near animals, researchers said, raising the risk of bacteria like salmonella getting onto their surfaces.

During processing in factories where the fruits are cut up, this can then be transferred onto its flesh causing illnesses.

An investigation by the FDA in 2020 led to 113million pounds (lbs) of peaches being recalled after they were found to have been grown in orchards near feedlots for animals.

Testing by the agency revealed salmonella both in the animal pens and on the fruits in the orchard.

They suggested the bacteria may have reached the fruits via irrigation or been picked up in the wind by dust and 'blown' onto them.

Consumer Reports recommended avoiding purchasing cut peaches to limit the risk of infection.

Cantaloupes also pose a risk of bacterial infection

Cantaloupes

Number of deaths: 0 since 2017

Number of illnesses: 302

Outbreaks and amount recalled: 4 and 279,205 'retail units' and 946 one gallon tubs of cantaloupe balls and chunks

For cantaloupes and other melons, the researchers said contamination tends to happen when the fruits are prepared.

There may be salmonella on the skin on the outside of the fruit, they said.

But when the fruits are cut into cubes or balls before sale, this risks transferring the bacteria onto the chunks ""” raising the risk of illness.

Consumer Reports recommended avoiding buying pre-cut cantaloupes or other melons.

Flour also made the list of the top ten foods most likely to make you sick

Flour

Number of deaths: 0 since 2017

Number of illnesses: 44

Outbreaks and amount recalled: 22 and no unit given

Innocuous flour used in cookie and brownie mixes and premade cake batter was also added to the list.

A survey of recalls by Consumer Reports found that it had been linked to some 22 outbreaks of E.coli and salmonella since 2017.

These bacteria are normally found in animals' guts and droppings.

But while wheat is growing in the field, this can get onto the grain surface either via contaminated water or wild animal droppings, such as from deer and birds.

When the grains are ground down into flour the bacteria are not killed but end up mixed into the mixture.

Consumer Reports said that when flour is cooked before consumption the bacteria are killed, avoiding infection.

But they said that to further limit risk, people should also avoid consuming raw homemade dough or batter. This is yet to have been cooked and could still contain salmonella.

They also suggested keeping ready-to-eat fresh produce away from flour because this could pass on bacteria.

More signs the obsession with veganism has had its day? People more likely to eat food if it's NOT labelled meat-free, study shows

The best way to encourage people to eat vegan might be not to mention the concept at all, a new study suggests.

Scientists in the US found people are far more likely to choose a vegan option if the food wasn't actually described as such.

Across two separate experiments, involving more than 150 people in total, the researchers presented prospective diners with a menu featuring two meals, one vegetarian, the other vegan. 

The vegan option was a hummus wrap, while the vegetarian was a Greek salad wrap featuring feta cheese.

In one version, the menu was labelled like many in the UK, with each meal being labelled either vegan or vegetarian as appropriate.

US scientists found people were more likely to choose a vegan option for dinner if the dish wasn't labelled as such (stock image) 

But in the other the labels were removed and instead each meal was simply described with its ingredients. 

The researchers, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found in both experiments only about 35 per cent of diners chose the vegan option when it was labelled.

But when the vegan label was removed the number choosing the hummus wrap jumped to above 60 per cent.

The diners did not know they were participating in an experiment at the time, choosing a food option from a registration form for an event. 

These results were also replicated in a separate experiment conducted online.

Made with alternative flours like buckwheat and teff ""” a type of grass seed ""” as well as chia seeds, ground linseed, nuts, eggs, lemon juice, cinnamon and apple cider vinegar, it certainly contains more than your average loaf

In this version, 750 participants who were asked if they were vegetarian or vegan, were asked to pick from two hypothetical menu options five times.

Each question presented different meal options, a mix of vegan or meat, vegetarian or meat, or vegetarian or meat, with two dishes per category.

Like the previous experiment, participants were randomly allocated a menu which labelled meals as vegetarian or vegan or one that did not.

The results showed when labels were present only 36.6 per cent of participants chose a vegan option.

However, when they were removed this rose to 42.7 per cent. 

Critically, the researchers found the removal of the labels didn't lead to participants who said they were vegetarian or vegans choosing meat options.

The scientists, who published their findings in the journal Appetite, said the results have important implications for encouraging people to eat a more sustainable diet. 

'Overall, our results showed that vegetarian and vegan labels negatively impact consumers' likelihood to choose the labelled option,' they wrote. 

'The present studies demonstrate how a simple and low-cost change to typical menus could help nudge these consumers to reduce meat consumption, towards more plant-based alternatives, without reducing their freedom of choice.'

This, they claimed, would both benefit the environment and people health. 

Meat and dairy consumption have a greater environmental impact compared to veganism.

Livestock, and the supply chain to get animal products to consumers, contributes to climate change through producing greenhouse gases and making land for grazing can lead to deforestation.

While meat and dairy are good sources of protein, vitamins and minerals, eating too much red or processed meat can increase the risk of disease like bowel cancer.

Russia may have put sleeper explosives on Britain's offshore wind farms to knock out power in a conflict, ex-head of Royal Navy warns

Russia may have already put sleeper explosives on critical infrastructure in Britain's North Sea, the former head of the Royal Navy has warned. 

Admiral Lord West warned offshore windfarms and undersea cables are at risk of attack as fears grow that Putin could wipe out the UK's power supply and cut off its telecommunications infrastructure.

'There's a risk as soon as you put critical infrastructure on the seabed,' the former Royal Navy chief said, adding that the Kremlin 'may have already put down sleeper explosives'.

Admiral Lord West's warning's come after Russian ships were spotted stalking UK waters earlier this month. 

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace on Thursday also warned Russia has the 'intent and ability' to sabotage the UK's underwater energy and communication lines. 

Russia 'have a specific naval programme designed to both look at and potentially sabotage or attack critical national infrastructure belonging to its adversaries,' Mr Wallace said. 

'It has a number of submarines and other pieces of equipment and spy ships and everything else specifically designed for that purpose.'

Fears are growing that Russia could target British energy cables and data cables, effectively cutting it off from the global grid and putting lives in the United Kingdom at risk as hospitals lost power, wiping billions off the economy as banks were unplugged from the global system, cutting off remote communities, and potentially sparking riots

UK defence secretary Ben Wallace said Vladimir Putin's (pictured) Russia has the 'intent and ability' to sabotage the UK's underwater energy and communication lines

Attacks on the UK's wind farms could cause blackouts that could take weeks to fix

Experts previously warned Russian attacks on wind farms and undersea cables could lead to riots and civil unrest in Britain.  

Dr Dwayne Ryan Menezes, of the Polar Research & Policy Initiative, said an attack on the UK's critical infrastructure could 'cause internet outages and power blackouts.'

'As damage to cables can take days or weeks to fix, it could even lead to potential civil unrest and riots,' Dr Menezes said. 

Any damage to the UK's critical infrastructure could also cost billions to fix, he warned, as he noted electricity and communications blackouts would hit the UK economy. 

Russia's underwater threat is nothing new, and researchers have been warning about potential sabotage attacks since at least 2015.

But back then the main concern was undersea internet cables, through which 95 per cent of the world's internet traffic and $10trillion of financial transactions pass every day.

In 2017, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak - then a backbench MP - wrote a report warning of the 'existential' threat faced by the UK in the event of a coordinated attack on these cables, most of which are no thicker than a hosepipe.

The pipes are poorly protected, would take only basic skills to find and break, and have no backup system because satellites cannot handle the volume of data they carry.

'Short of nuclear or biological warfare, it is difficult to think of a threat that could be more justifiably described as existential than that posed by the catastrophic failure of undersea cable networks as a result of hostile action,' Mr Sunak wrote.

Former Royal Navy chief Admiral Lord West (pictured) warned Russia 'may have already put down sleeper explosives' 

Last September, three quickfire explosions tore open the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipes and destroyed the main gas links between Russian and Europe. Pictured: The gas leak at Nord Stream 2 is seen from a Danish helicopter in September 2022

Six years on, fresh fears are now growing as the threat has evolved.

Russia has since invested heavily in sea-bed warfare technology and owns ships and submarines capable of operating mini-subs and robots to work at great depth, that could potentially carry out sabotage attacks.

And in October last year, Ministers ordered an urgent survey of undersea power and internet cables amid fears Russia may have already targeted them with mines.

This came a month after three quickfire explosions tore open the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines and destroyed the main gas links between Russian and Europe in September.

Many suspected Kremlin sabotage, and in April a team of investigative journalists from Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland claimed to have uncovered evidence that at least three Russian vessels were operating in the area in the lead-up to those blasts.

One, a research vessel called the Sibiryakov which has extensive underwater capabilities, allegedly toured the northern blast zone in late June last year.

A second, a tugboat called SB-123, was tracked to an area between the northern and southern zones in late September having earlier set off as part of a six-vessel Russian navy mission from Kaliningrad.

A third unidentified ship was in the same area as the Sibriyakov in early June.

Separately, the same team of investigators tracked another vessel - the Admiral Vladimirski - as it scouted infrastructure in the North Sea, including the locations of UK wind farms.

It was the first time analysts had seen such behaviour, and means that vital energy infrastructure is now a potential target along with internet links.

HÃ¥vard Gulldahl, one of the journalists, was left in no doubt that Russia intends to sabotage those links 'should the current conflict [in Ukraine] escalate.'

Being an island, the UK is particularly vulnerable to such attacks and will only become more vulnerable as time passes.

Around a third of the gas we use each year comes to the UK via a pipe from Norway that runs under the North Sea. This is set to increase in the coming years as our own gas fields run dry.

Admiral Lord West argued the UK should invest more heavily in onshore wind, to avoid the threats posed by hostile powers. 

'It's much harder for any hostile power to target onshore wind,' the former Royal Navy chief said. 

Rod Wood, the managing director of renewables developer Community Windpower, called on the UK government to remove blocks to the buildout of onshore wind capacity. 

'The destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines starkly demonstrates how exposed subsea infrastructure assets can be,' Mr Wood said. 

'As Lord West highlights, geopolitical risks must now be front and center of energy policy.' 

'The Government needs to lift the onshore wind planning moratorium in England and axe the windfall tax on new solar and wind generation to deliver safe and secure home-grown energy supplies,' he said.

Your trendy oat lattes aren't as healthy as you think: Dietitians rule that plant-based milks are 'nutritionally inferior' to dairy version

The vast majority of plant-based milk alternatives are not as good for you as the real thing, according to a major study.

Scientists analyzed more than 200 brands of almond, oat and soy milk sold in the US for their calcium, vitamin D and protein content.

Nearly nine in ten were found to be inferior nutritionally containing less of at least one of the three nutrients compared to cow's milk.

Dr Abigail Johnson, the epidemiologist who led the study, said: 'Our results provide evidence that many plant-based milk alternatives are not nutritionally equivalent to cow's milk.'

She even said people who drink plant-based milk exclusively should consider supplements to ensure they do not miss any vital vitamins and minerals. 

Scientists at the University of Minnesota looked at 233 plant-based milk alternatives to check how well they measured up to animals

She added: 'Based on these findings, consumers should look for plant-based milk alternative products that list calcium and vitamin D as ingredients. 

'They may also want to consider adding other sources of calcium and vitamin D to their diets.

'Product labeling requirements and dietary guidance to the public are among the approaches that may be helpful in alerting and educating consumers.'

Dietitian says that cow's milk is best



Dr Duane Mellor, one of Britain's top dietary researchers, told MailOnline that it is cow's milk that offers the most nutrients, protein and natural sugars. 

In the study, scientists looked at 233 brands of plant-based milk, which also including hazelnut, rice and cashew milk, made by 23 companies.

Overall, the plant-based milks had about 350 milligrams (mg) of calcium and three micrograms (mcg) of vitamin D per 8.1 fluid ounces (fl oz) (240 milliliters, ml) on average.

They also contained about two grams (g) of protein per 8.1 fl oz (240ml).

For comparison, the US Department of Agriculture says that whole milk contains about eight grams of protein per 8.1 fl oz (240ml).

It also has about 306mg of calcium and nearly three mcg of vitamin D per serving.

Results showed only 28 of the plant-based alternatives had similar amounts or more of each substance compared to cow's milk.

And only 38 ""” 16 percent ""” had the same amount of protein as that found in cow's milk, with soy and pea milk being most likely.

The nutritional gap is why dairy manufacturers have spent years urging authorities to ban plant-based alternatives from calling themselves 'milk'.

But in draft guidance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released this year, they said the products could continue to use the term 'milk'.

They argued that plant-based beverages don't pretend to be from animals and that consumers are not confused by the difference.

But they did say that the products should include a nutrient composition table showing how they compared with milk. 

This left the dairy industry disappointed which had been expecting a stronger ruling after the previous FDA director Dr Scott Gottlieb famously declared in 2018 that 'an almond doesn't lactate'.

Milk alternatives have soared in popularity in recent years amid concerns over climate change, lactose intolerance and animal welfare.

The FDA says adults should consume about 50 grams of protein per day for those that need to consume 2,000 calories. 

This would mean an adult of this size would need to drink about 1.5liters of cow's milk ""” equivalent to six glasses ""” to hit their protein target. 

But if they were to rely solely on plant-based milk alternatives, they would need to get about 6.2liters ""” equivalent to 25 glasses ""” to reach the same level.

Adults also need about 1,000 milligrams of calcium per day and 15mcg of vitamin D.

Protein is essential for building and maintaining muscle, prompting repair work to the body and keeping someone fit as they age.

Calcium and vitamin D are used for building strong healthy bones and maintaining nerves.

The study results were entered into the University of Minnesota's Nutrition Coordinating Center database which holds dietary information on more than 19,000 foods.

Dr Johnson added: 'We know from our dietary assessments for nutrition studies that consumers are choosing more plant-based milk alternatives.

'This project aimed to increase the number of these milk alternatives available in the Nutrition Coordinating Center's database of foods.

Next, the researchers plan to explore other nutrients in plant-based milk alternatives that make them different from cow's milk.

The study was presented at the NUTRITION 2023 conference organized by the American Society for Nutrition, taking place this week in Boston, Massachusetts.

Would YOU swap suburbia for self-sufficiency? As families face sky-high mortgage rates and inflation, these couples reveal how they chose to live off the grid

Mortgage rates are sky-high, rents are worse and even the price of eggs have shot up by 60 percent in a year.

So, maybe it's no wonder more and more Americans are choosing to opt out of mainstream living and are going off-grid. 

A 'self-sufficiency' movement is rocketing in popularity across the continent, with fed up families ditching their homes and relocating into the wilderness where they generate their own power and even, in some instances, source all their own food. 

The trend has been accelerated not only by rising living costs but also by the pandemic which caused many to reflect on their own resilience in the face of disaster.  

'We're not crazy preppers or anything like that,' says Maylin Luke, 36, who moved off-grid to a ranch in Texas which her partner Blakely, 37, last year. 

Maylin Luke, 36, and her partner Blakely, 37, sold their three-story home in Dallas, Texas, to move 'off-grid' to a 60-acre plot of land

The couple invested in their own $113,000 'tiny home', building their own water infiltration unit and installing an electricity pole nearby

The couple had their 'tiny home' custom-made by a company and frequently share photos of it on social media

'But lockdown did make us reflect more on what we wanted from life. And how we could be more independent.'

The couple had been living in a three-story home in Dallas, Texas, when they decided to invest in a 60-acre piece of land last year. 

They then had a small cabin - or 'tiny home' as they call it - which cost them around $113,000. 

They are not entirely 'off-grid' yet as they use an electricity pole and still buy groceries from their nearby town.

But soon they plan to start growing their own fruit and vegetables in a bid to become more self-sufficient.

And they have already slashed their property tax bill from around $10,000 a year to $130 as Texan law means they get an agriculture and wildlife exemption - subject to several conditions. 

We sold our home in the city & bought 60 acres! Follow along while we make it a place we call home! #landowners #offgrid #westtexas #tinyhomeliving

The couple say it was lockdown that made them reflect on the way they lived 

Maylin said: 'We just wanted to get out of the city, get rid of our things and really slow down to minimize our carbon footprint' 

Maylin, who quit her job in marketing to set up her own business Resting Plant Face, says: 'Before we just filled with so much stuff.

'We just wanted to get out of the city, get rid of our things and really slow down to minimize our carbon footprint.'

Around 180,000 US citizens were living off-grid in 2020, claims Home Power magazine - though some estimates put this figure as high as 250,000. 

And this figure is only growing. 

Consulting company Accenture forecasts that 12 percent of American households will be reliant on off-grid energy - including solar power - by 2035. 

The trend is being accelerated by global energy insecurity sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

What's more the threat of climate change and more extreme weather has resulted in more power outages. 

Analysis from non-profit research group Climate Central last year found that outages had increased by 64 percent between 2000 and 2021. 

That revelation has spooked not just consumers but businesses too who are also moving off-grid in their droves.

'Off-grid is becoming huge in America,' says Nick Rosen, founder of Off-grid.net. 

'But much of that growth is from big businesses and the military.'

Californian fresh food producer Taylor Farms, manufacturer Bimbo Bakeries and refrigerated cold storage developer Almond World are among several big businesses to have already announced plans to create their own standalone power supplies - or 'micro-grids.'

The system of 'micro-grids' has been deployed for years in the US military, where camps need to minimize power losses.

But the transition is more difficult for the everyday individual. 

Danyelle Ellis, 31, and her husband Doug moved to a ranch in Arizona around 18 months ago

Mother-of-two Danyelle Ellis moved off-grid around 18 months ago and says the transition has not been without its challenges.

But in all she describes the experience as 'freeing.'

'Everything had just gotten so expensive and the world was so chaotic with the pandemic. We wanted a change,' says Danyelle, 31. 

She and her husband Doug, 32, ditched their five-bedroom home in New Mexico and moved out to land they already owned in Arizona.

Now they homeschool their children - who are 13 and nine - generate all their own power using a self-built solar system and collect water from the nearest town using their water truck. 

Their nearest neighbors are two miles away and, while Doug continues to commute to work in the city as a heavy equipment operator, Danyelle spends her day tending to horses on a nearby ranch. 

The pair are currently living in their RV while they build their forever home on the land. 

'We're saving at least $3,000 a month,' says Danyelle, 31. 

'The solar system cost $25,000 but once that is in place there are no more costs.

'And my children love it. I didn't want them to be like every other kid in the city glued to their mobile phones.'

EXCLUSIVEPanama Canal backlogs threaten £22m worth of Christmas supplies from Peru: Experts warn availability of fresh fruit, vegetables, tea and meat in UK supermarkets could be hit due to drought crisis in shipping route

Shipping delays in the Panama Canal threaten £22million worth of fruit, vegetables, coffee, tea and meat from Peru bound for Britain this Christmas, experts said today.

Britain relies heavily on imports from the South American country, according to a study of UK-bound ships using the canal by data and analytics firm Russell Group.

Researchers claimed the products may be in short supply in shops this month. Most of the disruption will be related to fruit, with £18million worth coming from Peru.

They issued a warning over fears the ongoing disruption - due to a drought - may result in 'empty or reduced quantities of these items on the supermarket shelves'.

It comes after the Panama Canal Authority began restricting vessel transits in the summer as the drought limited supplies of water needed to operate its lock system.

Only 22 daily transits are now allowed, down from about 35 in normal conditions - and the situation will worsen in February when transits will fall further to 18 a day.

How the Panama Canal was a long and deadly construction project 

The Panama Canal was a marvel of engineering opened in 1914 that created a 50-mile shortcut between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

It meant vessels travelling from one side of the Americas to the other no longer had to make an 8,000-mile detour lasting two months around the southern tip of Chile.

The US began construction in 1904 following a failed attempt by the French in the 1880s, although the idea of such a passage was first explored by King Charles I of Spain in the 1500s.

The canal cost more than $350million (£280million), making it the most expensive construction project in US history at that time.

However it was also extremely dangerous work, with at least 5,600 people killed while it was being built out of a total of 56,000 employed between 1904 and 1913.

By 2010, the canal had seen one million ships pass through. American vessels are the most common users of the canal, followed by ships from China, Chile, Japan, Colombia and South Korea.

With many UK consumers starting to shop for perishable items ahead of Christmas - now less than a fortnight away - concerns are building that the disruption may stop such exports from Peru and other South American countries such as Chile and Ecuador making the journey.

Suki Basi, managing director and founder of Russell Group, told MailOnline today: 'The current crisis in Panama could not come at a worse time for the UK.

'With the economy suffering from a lack of consumer confidence due to the cost-of-living crisis, another supply chain crunch will do little to boost that confidence.'

He added that shipping companies 'face a dilemma now, as they are forced to wait in the queue and see their perishable items become ruined, pay a higher fee, or navigate alternative routes, extending delays and increasing emissions', adding; 'It is a difficult dilemma, and one that has no easy solution.'

Russell Group's figures were based on current and forecast trade data from investment experts Moody's and marine intelligence service IHS Markit.

Its analysis comes after concerns reported in MailOnline last week that presents heading to Britain on container ships may not arrive in time for Christmas because of the drought.

Water levels in the 50-mile canal from the Pacific ocean to the Atlantic have fallen to their lowest since the mid-1900s.

Scores of massive container ships carrying gifts such as the new iPhone, TVs, bikes and clothes are being delayed by up to four weeks - and the crisis could last for several months.

Congestion in the canal could have a wider impact across the global supply chain - with experts also warning that Christmas in the UK and Europe could be affected.

Marco Forgione, director general of the London-based Institute of Export and International Trade, has called on the Government to introduce a formal import strategy linked to the export strategy.

The average wait time in the queue has risen from 4.3 days on November 7 to 11.7 this month, data revealed. Before the route experienced delays, some 38 ships passed through each day

He said the strategy 'must establish a diverse supply chain for the UK - ensuring that we are not reliant on one route for our imported goods which will help to mitigate the impact of delays such as those we are currently seeing in the Panama Canal'.

Mr Forgione continued: 'Delays like this ripple across the whole supply chain and have a catastrophic impact - which is concerning for both businesses and consumers during the busiest retail period of the year.

'There are supplies, such as iPhones, that won't be here in time for Christmas, however, many retailers have planned in advance after the disruption to the Panama Canal back in August.

'However, during the vital months of November to March, much of South American shipping is focused on exports of fruit and vegetables, generally via refrigerated containers.'

He said that much of the produce from Peru, Chile and Ecuador will be routed via the Panama Canal.

Mr Forgione added: 'What is a major concern is post-Christmas If these issues continue, not only could the export of fruits and vegetables be impacted, but we could see extended transit times and squeezing up costs even more for UK importers.

'If vessels miss scheduled port stops due to delays, products will need to take longer alternative routes to reach their final destinations.

'The commercial impact on businesses will also be significant if fresh produce is spoiled and wasted, delivery deadlines are missed, and cargo is stuck in ports. Not just retailers, but the firms entrusted with shipping these good as well.

Food costs and energy prices could rise because grains and fuels are on ships also stuck in the canal. Nearly 80 ships have suffered significant delays.

Some companies have reportedly paid as much as $4million (£3million) to move to the front of the queue to get free.

This is compared to an average auction price of about $173,000 (£137,000) just one year ago.

Other options include sailing south around South America or Africa, or via the Suez Canal.

But those longer routes can add up to two weeks to shipping times, elevating costs for fuel, crews and freight leases.

Economist Inga Fechner of ING Research told Bloomberg: 'It's getting more costly, and looking for alternative routes will increase costs and maybe also weigh on prices in the end.'

The average wait time in the queue has risen from 4.3 days on November 7 to 11.7 this month, Panama Canal Authority data revealed.

Before the shipping route experienced delays, some 38 ships passed through each day. A total of more than 14,000 ships crossed the canal in 2022.

The shipping snarl through one of the world's main maritime trade routes also comes at the peak season for US crop exports.

Ships moving crops have waited up to three weeks to pass through the canal as container vessels and others that sail on more regular schedules are scooping up the few slots available.

The restrictions could continue to impede grain shipments well into 2024 before the region's wet season should begin to recharge reservoirs and normalise shipping in April or May, analysts said.

'It's causing quite a disruption both in expense and delay,' said Jay O'Neil, proprietor of HJ O'Neil Commodity Consulting, adding that the disruption is unlike any he's seen in his 50 years of monitoring global shipping.

Grain ships are often at the back of the line as they usually secure their slots only a few days before arriving, while others including cruise and container ships book months in advance.

The Authority also offers the rare available slots to its top customers first, none of which are bulk grain haulers, Mr O'Neil said.

Any scheduled slots that come available are auctioned off, but demand is exceptionally high.

Mark Thompson, senior trader at Olam Agri, said: 'The grain trades and the bulk carrier segment are going to be the last customers to go through the Panama Canal. I would not rely on the Panama Canal any time soon.'

Wait times for bulk grain vessels ballooned from around five to seven days in October to around 20 days by late November, Mr O'Neil said, prompting more grain carriers to reroute.

Scientists discover a 'gruesome' wasp species which hatches INSIDE other insects and eats its way out, as well as a gorilla-sized penguin in record annual haul

A ""˜gruesome' wasp which hatches inside other insects, and eats its way out, is one of a record 815 new species discovered by the Natural History Museum this year.

Scientists have also found the largest penguin ever known to exist, a fearsome armoured dinosaur and a new moth species discovered in Ealing which is actually native to Western Australia.

London's Natural History Museum has counted the number of new species it has described each year since 2018, and 815 is the record so far.

The total includes 619 new species of wasps, including 14 which have been given the group name Dalek after the villains in Dr Who.

That is because they are short, sturdy and metallic in colour, as well as having a murderous lifestyle.

This 'gruesome' wasp, called the Dalek nationi, was one of the 815 new species discovered by the Natural History Museum this year

The Museum also named 58 new species of beetle including a number of vivid green and pinkish-orange darkling beetles from China and Laos

How many new species have been discovered? 

In total 815 new species have been named by the Natural History Museum in 2023. 

This includes:

Of the 24 new frogs found this year, 20 are miniature species. Pictured, Hyperolius ukaguruensis

 

Describing the Dalek wasps, the Natural History Museum's resident wasp expert, Dr Gavin Broad, said: ""˜These wasps are a little bit sci fi, as they rather gruesomely lay their eggs inside an insect called a plant louse.

""˜When the eggs hatch, the baby wasps eats their way out of the louse from the inside, ensuring they get a food supply of fresh meat.

""˜It just shows how ingenious wasps are, as other parasitic wasps which use insects in this way can paralyse their hosts or even use mind control - manipulating spiders to spin different webs, which are more beneficial for the wasps.'

Last year, when the Natural History Museum revealed 351 new species, wasps made up the majority of new discoveries. 

In 2022, 85 new species of wasp were discovered including some that could prove useful as a biological control agent in agriculture.

One tiny parasitic wasp with feather-like wings was one is one of the smallest insects ever discovered and infests the eggs of 'thrips' - an insect which damages crops.

The new species discovered in 2023 also include the largest penguin ever known to exist, Kumimanu fordycei, which weighed about as much as a gorilla, tipping the scales at an estimated 330 pounds (150kg).

The giant penguin, which roamed the seas and beaches of New Zealand more than 50 million years ago, was three times as heavy as a modern emperor penguin.

One of the species discovered was the Kumimanu fordycei, the largest penguin ever to exist at an estimated 330 pounds (150kg).

Another surprising discovery was a new species of moth, found by an amateur in Ealing which turned out to be native to Western Australia 

Meanwhile, last month an amateur enthusiast discovered a tiny brown moth in her moth trap in a park in Ealing which turned out to be a new species from Western Australia, which has also established itself in part of west London.

The insect was named Tachystola mulliganae after the moth-lover, Barbara Mulligan, who found it.

The 619 new wasp species, including the tiny Dalek wasps measuring no more than 0.08 inches (2 millimetres) are largely the result of a research trip to Costa Rica, which found more than 550 new wasps.

Experts say wasps are vital in killing pest insects, such as the mealy bug, which would otherwise threaten to destroy vital food supplies like the cassava crop in Africa.

In total, 619 new species of wasp were discovered including this Anicetus lysithe which is believed to parasitise gall-forming insects

There are 58 new species of beetle named, including a number of vivid green and pinkish-orange darkling beetles from China and Laos, and four new long-snouted weevils from South Africa.

Other insects include six stick insects from Australia, one of which was found for the first time on the side of a bin, and nine new species of bristly worms, including two which eat bones.

There are 24 new species of frogs, of which 20 are miniature species from the forests of Madagascar.

The total includes Hyperolius ukaguruensis, a reed frog from Tanzania that's known as 'voiceless' because it's among the few frogs that do not vocalize to other frogs. 

This year has also seen four new fossil bird species, including an ancient, toothed bird called Janavis finalidens which was flying around at the time an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs, and a species of Mauritius ground thrush that likely went extinct in the 1600s after the introduction of black rats.

A number of the Museum's discoveries are long since extinct just like this ground bird which quickly succumbed to the introduction of black rats 

The Natural History Museum also found a new type of armoured dinosaur called the Vectipelta barretti which was found on the Isle of Wight

Also discovered infecting the roots of 400-million-year-old plants, was the earliest ever disease-causing fungus ever discovered, which was named Potteromyces asteroxylicola after Peter Rabbit author and fungi enthusiast Beatrix Potter.

There were also 14 new meteorites described by museum scientists.

As part of The Darwin Tree of Life project, any new species found in the UK will have its DNA fingerprint sequenced and uploaded onto an extensive database.

Britain's cheapest supermarket for November has been revealed by consumer watchdog Which?. 

The organisation has revealed that Aldi has taken the top spot as the UK's best budget retailer, stealing the crown from fellow German supermarket Lidl. 

Which? compared the prices of 47 popular grocery items such as potatoes, chicken and milk, every day last month, revealing their average costs at each of the UK's biggest supermarkets. 

Aldi was the cheapest overall, with the items costing £76.77 on average, while Lidl was just 79p behind, with an average cost of £77.56. 

It comes after Lidl stole the title of cheapest supermarket from Aldi in October, ending its 16 month stint at the top of the list.

According to the analysis, Asda ranked third, with an average cost of £82.42, with Tesco's basket cost of £87.42 landed it in fourth place. 

Sainbury's was narrowly behind it with an average basket of £87.79, while Morrisons came in sixth with its basket costing £89.54 on average. 

Which? found that Ocado and Waitrose were the UK's most expensive supermarkets with a basket costing £93.40 and £97.39 on average, respectively. 

The consumer champion also compared the cost of a larger trolley of 134 items, which included the original 47 as well as more branded groceries. 

Aldi and Lidl weren't included in the analysis as they don't always stock branded products. 

Asda was the cheapest for this larger trolley at £328.15, more than £10 less than its rival Morrisons, which was the next cheapest at £338.16.

Following behind was Tesco at £354.53, Ocado at £356.78 and Sainsbury's at £360.26. Waitrose was most expensive at £369.80.

Which? compared the prices across the UK's eight biggest supermarkets, including Lidl and Aldi, with the 47 items costing almost £100 on average at the priciest retailer. 

The analysis includes special offer prices but not multibuys or loyalty discounts such as those offered by Sainsbury's Nectar and the Tesco Clubcard.

Which? says that this is because not all shoppers are prepared to sign up to loyalty schemes, and therefore it is fairer only to include prices available to all.

It comes as it was revealed that the cost of vegetables for Christmas dinner has soared by up to 60 per cent in one year with carrots, potatoes, parsnips and brussels sprouts all hit by soaring inflation.

Prices have risen by an average of 7 per cent over the past year across 208 lines of parsnips, carrots, potatoes and brussels sprouts at Aldi, Lidl, Co-op and Waitrose.

Data from retail research firm Assosia revealed annual price rises of at least 10 per cent on more than a third of products, while 24 increased by more than 20 per cent.

The analysis of supermarket prices revealed in trade journal The Grocer also found the cost of some vegetables had risen by more than a tenth in just the past month.

Soaring production costs and poor weather affecting growing conditions were said to be partly behind the increases, as well as low supermarket returns for many crops.

Asteroid or supervolcano? New study says dinosaurs were wiped out by BOTH

Repeated 'volcanic winters' may have left the dinosaurs hungry, shivering and vulnerable to a fatal 'final blow' by the asteroid that ultimately did them in. 

At least, an international team of researchers from Italy, Norway, Canada and the US has reached that conclusion in a new study, which analyzed sulfur and fluorine gases trapped in ancient volcanic rocks from the infamous Deccan Traps supervolcano.

This sulfur and fluorine ""” belched out by the Deccan Traps over 200,000 years before the extinction-level event ""” would have dropped global temperatures by as much as 18 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius), their new study determined.

The findings add further clarity to the raging debate between paleontologists and other scientists over what actually drove the dinosaurs to extinction.

Their work aligns itself with a compromise theory: the 'press-pulse extinction model.'

Repeated 'volcanic winters' may have left the dinosaurs hungry, shivering and vulnerable to a fatal 'final blow' by the asteroid that ultimately did them in, according to a new study 

An international team of researchers from Italy, Norway, Canada and the US analyzed sulfur and fluorine gases trapped in layers of ancient volcanic rocks (labelled above right) from India's Deccan Traps supervolcano. The volcanic gases likely led to temperature drops globally

'Our research demonstrates that climatic conditions were almost certainly unstable,' said study co-author and geologist Don Baker, 'with repeated volcanic winters that could have lasted decades, prior to the extinction of the dinosaurs.' 

'Our work helps explain this significant extinction event that led to the rise of mammals and the evolution of our species,' according to Baker, who teaches at Canada's McGill University in Montreal.

The group analyzed trapped sulfur and fluorine compounds in samples taken from the Deccan Traps 'lava pile' in India's Western Ghats mountain range, near Bombay. 

The compounds' minute concentrations, measured in parts-per-million, were determined via synchrotron radiation x""ray fluorescence spectrometry ""” which bombards samples with magnetized corkscrews of radiation and then records how that radiation bounces and scatters back.

Some of the 'volcanic winters,' according to study co-author, geologist Don Baker, 'could have lasted decades' each, prior to the meteor that led to the dinosaurs' extinction

Baker drew a cooking analogy to explain the process of calculating atmospheric sulfur and fluorine volume from the small percentages held within these lava rocks. 

'Imagine making pasta at home. You boil the water, add salt, and then the pasta,' Baker began in a statement.

'Some of the salt from the water goes into the pasta,' he said, 'but not much of it.'

Baker and his team worked with similar known ratios to estimate how much sulfur and fluorine gas compounds had flooded into Earth's atmosphere during the Cretaceous period. 

A steady drop in temperature during the late Cretaceous period, as estimated by past paleoclimate studies, happened to track with higher concentrations of the Sulfur compounds in several layers of ancient lava from the Deccan Traps: layers known as the Thakurvadi through Bushe rock formations. 

Sulfur content was found to be as high as 1,800 parts-per-million in these layers.  

By the researchers' calculations, that would indicate that a volume of sulfur gas somewhere between 86,000 and 466,000 cubic-kilometers in size erupted into the prehistoric atmosphere.

When it came to the fluorine gasses, Baker and his colleagues do not believe it contributed to major climate change, but that its concentrations had other, more local, toxic effects.

'There is historical evidence for local impacts of fluorine degassing,' they wrote in their study, published in the journal Science Advances, 'as readily deposited from the volcanic haze.'

Huge regions of western India were carved and grooved by the lava flows of the Deccan Traps supervolcano over 66 million years ago. Above, a SkySat satellite image of the Deccan Traps taken in March of 2018 over Maharashtrain in India

The 'the final blow' in the researchers' view was almost assuredly the well-known Chicxulub impact, when a carbon-rich asteroid crashed into Mexico's YucatÃ¡n Peninsula roughly 66 million years ago. The impact led to trillions of metric tons of dust clouds and a new Ice Age

Those local impacts included, 'acid rain, crop failure, and livestock poisoning' after Iceland's Laki volcano eruptions in 1783 and 1784. 

In essence, the researchers speculate that the Laki volcano's fluorine episode might be a good example of how the Deccan Traps' supervolcanic activity could have further harmed the dinosaurs over 66 million years ago.

'Deccan Traps volcanism set the stage for a global biotic crisis,' as the team put it in their new study, 'repeatedly deteriorating environmental conditions by forcing recurring short volcanic winters.'

But the 'the final blow' in their view was almost assuredly the well-known Chicxulub impact, when a carbon-rich asteroid crashed into Mexico's YucatÃ¡n Peninsula roughly 66 million years ago.

The impact, which left a six-mile-wide crater visible to this day, devastated the planet smashing up a hot cloud of dust, ash and steam and spreading 25 trillion metric tons of material into the atmosphere, some of which even escaped Earth's orbit.

The heated rentry of the rest of that material caused forest fires across 70 percent of the planet and left massive dust clouds that hastened a new Ice Age, scientists say. 

But the dinosaurs were already struggling with bad weather by that time, based on Baker and his teams' new work.

'Our dataset,' they wrote, 'indicates that volcanic-driven climate disturbance was already underway.'

HOW THE DINOSAURS BECAME EXTINCT AROUND 66MILLION YEARS AGO

Dinosaurs ruled the Earth around 66million years ago, but suddenly disappeared in what is known as the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction.

It was believed for many years that the changing climate destroyed the food chain of the huge reptiles. 

However, in the 1980s paleontologists discovered a layer of iridium - an element that is rare on Earth but found in vast quantities in space.  

When this was dated, it coincided precisely with when the dinosaurs disappeared from the fossil record. 

A decade later, scientists uncovered the massive Chicxulub Crater at the tip of Mexico's YucatÃ¡n Peninsula, which dates to the period in question. 

Scientific consensus now says that these two factors are linked and they were both probably caused by an enormous asteroid crashing to Earth.

With the projected size and impact velocity, the collision would have caused an enormous shock wave and is likely to have triggered seismic activity. 

The fallout would have created plumes of ash thought to have covered the whole planet, making it impossible for dinosaurs to survive. 

Other animals and plant species had a shorter time-span between generations which allowed them to survive.

There are several other theories as to what caused the demise of the dinos. 

One early theory was that small mammals ate dinosaur eggs and another proposes that toxic angiosperms (flowering plants) killed them off.

Australians are typically earning six-figure salaries in jobs that don't require a university degree.

From police detectives to train drivers, diesel mechanics, crane operators, cattle auctioneers and wharf labourers, new Australian Taxation Office data has revealed the occupations where average incomes are above $100,000.

Anyone earning a six-figure salary was among the top 17.8 per cent of income earners in 2020-21, with 2,691,226 people in this category out of Australia's 15,134,189 taxpayers.

Someone on a six-figure salary is now among the 44.5 per cent or 6,736,313 of taxpayers in the $45,000 to $120,000 bracket where they pay the federal government 32.5 cents in the dollar on their earnings.

Australians are typically earning six-figure salaries in jobs that don't require a university degree. Police detectives are typically paid $122,732, with men making $126,791 and women earning $109,772 (pictured are NSW Police Force academy recruits in Goulburn)

Crane operators (stock image) with an average taxable income of $108,073

They are in the same category as someone on an average taxable income of $68,289, which is slightly above the national middle income of $65,000 but below the average, full-time salary of $94,000 as measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

Australian tax brackets

$18,200 or less: 2,236,047 individuals or 14.8 per cent of individuals - no tax 

$18,201 to $45,000: 4,385,353 individuals or 29 per cent of taxpayers - 19 cents in the dollar 

$45,001 to $120,000: 6,736,313 individuals or 44.5 per cent of taxpayers - 32.5 cents in the dollar

$120,001 to $180,000: 1,150,084 individuals or 7.6 per cent of taxpayers - 37 cents in the dollar 

$180,001 or more: 626,392 individuals or 4.1 per cent of taxpayers - 45 cents in the dollar

TOTAL: 15,134,189 individuals paid $236.669billion in net tax in 2020-21

The average taxable incomes are based on salaries minus work expenses. 

Police detectives are typically paid $122,732, with men making $126,791 and women earning $109,772.

Those in law enforcement can do a degree in policing and often need a university qualification to become a detective, depending on the state.

But those in blue can also complete a vocational course to join the force and progress up the ranks.

Proving state government jobs pay, railway station managers were well remunerated with an average taxable income of $113,579. 

This occupation doesn't require a university degree but the federal government's Your Career website noted it was necessary to have 'relevant experience to work as a railway station manager'.

'While formal qualifications aren't essential, a Vocational Education and Training course in rail operations management may be useful,' it said, adding the job was 'stressful'.

Train examiners had an average taxable salary of $114,929 in an occupation requiring a Vocational Education and Training course in rail safety.

Railway signal operators typically get $119,915, while train drivers are on $127,932 in a job requiring a Certificate IV in Train Driving.

Diesel motor mechanics are also typically paid six-figure salaries with average incomes of $100,105, which is significantly higher than $67,147 for a garage mechanic.

Railway signal operators typically get $119,915, while train drivers (Queensland Rail employee, pictured) are on $127,932 in a job requiring a Certificate IV in Train Driving

Railways offer a range of jobs with six figures from station managers ($113,579) to railway signal operator ($119,915)

Unlike mechanics working in suburban garages, diesel mechanics often work on mine sites repairing and maintain large dump trucks in a sector that is well remunerated. 

Australian jobs with average taxable incomes in the six figures

DIESEL MOTOR MECHANIC: $100,105 

REAL ESTATE AGENT COMPANY REP: $100,223

PAPER MILL OPERATOR: $102,053 

WHARF LABOURER: $102,840 

SECURITY CONSULTANT: $107,119

CRANE OPERATOR: $108,073 

STOCK AND STATION AUCTIONEER: $113,459 

RAILWAY STATION MANAGER: $113,579

TRAIN EXAMINER: $114,929 

RAILWAY SIGNAL OPERATOR: $119,915 

REAL ESTATE AGENCY MANAGER: $124,276

COAL MINER: $125,856 

TRAIN DRIVER: $127,932

TRAIN CONTROLLER: $134,903 

POLICE DETECTIVE: $122,732

This occupation servicing trucks and buses requires a  Certificate III in Heavy Commercial Vehicle Mechanical Technology or a Certificate III in Automotive Diesel Engine Technology.

Those using the heavy machinery are well paid with crane operators getting $108,073, in a dangerous job requiring a heavy rigid truck licence and a Certificate III in Construction Crane Operations.

Coal miners also are well paid, having an average taxable income of $125,856, compared with paper mill operators on $102,053.

Wharf labourers who unload imported freight at Australia's ports make $102,840, with this year marking the 25th anniversary of the heated dispute between Patrick Stevedores and the Maritime Union of Australia.

Security consultants were earning on average $107,119, with those in this role offer advice on design features to ward off intruders.

This role requires a Certificate IV in Security and Risk Management.

Stock and station auctioneers, who take bids on livestock like cattle, typically earned $113,459.

This role requires an auctioneer accreditation in the state where they practise, along with a station agent licence.

Real estate managers earned on average $124,276, in an occupation requiring a state licence and a Certificate IV in Real Estate Practice.

Another job advising investors on buying houses doesn't typically pay six figures unless a man is doing it.

Male real estate consultants had average salaries of $112,720, compared with $69,953 for women doing the same role, which put the total average for the two genders at $90,213.

Stock and station auctioneers, who take bids on livestock like cattle, typically earned $113,459 (pictured is a livestock auctioneer in Ballarat in central Victoria)

In the building sector, consultant construction managers typically made $115,151 (pictured is a Sydney apartment site)

Australians earning six-figure salaries will, from July 1, 2024, be the biggest beneficiaries of the stage three tax cuts that will reduce the number of tax brackets from five to four for the first time since 1984

It was a similar story for clothing designers with men on average making $214,170, compared with $74,894 for women, putting the occupational average at $89,958.

But in one surprising occupation thought to be male dominated, women made more.

Female bulldozer operators had an average taxable income of $100,253, compared with $92,407 for men.

Only 21 women in Australia listed this as their occupation, compared with 541 men, which meant the average income for this job was $92,700.

In the building sector, consultant construction managers typically made $115,151.

Australians earning six-figure salaries will, from July 1, 2024, be the biggest beneficiaries of the stage three tax cuts that will reduce the number of tax brackets from five to four for the first time since 1984.

Those on $120,000 will pay $1,875 less tax, compared with now, which is better than the $875 in relief going to those on $80,000.

Amanda Owen and her ex-husband Clive became familiar faces thanks to their Channel 5 programme Our Yorkshire Farm.

But it wasn't only the parents-of-nine who were popular with audiences at home, since for many, their children - aged from 21 to six - proved to be the real stars of the show. 

This was especially true of their eldest son Reuben, 18, who delighted viewers with his farming knowledge and enthusiasm, so much so, that after five seasons on Our Yorkshire Farm, he joined father Clive, 67, on a spin-off show. 

The father-and-son duo appeared on Channel 5's Beyond The Yorkshire Farm, which saw them embark on a digging business venture; it charted the challenges Reuben faced, supported by his father Clive, best friend Tom and girlfriend Sarah Dow.

Reuben and Sarah - who are thought to have started dating in December 2021 - often share snaps with one another on their Instagram accounts to the delight of fans.  

Reuben, 18, (pictured with his partner) delighted viewers with his farming knowledge and enthusiasm, so much so, that after five seasons on Our Yorkshire Farm, he joined father Clive, 67, on a spin-off show

In June, Reuben marked their six-month anniversary by posting a series of sweet images of them together. He captioned the photographs: 'Can't believe you have put up with me for 6 months... #ily.'

Meanwhile, in February, newly-released audience figures revealed that Amanda's new Channel 4 show attracted less than half the viewers of Clive and son Reuben's Yorkshire Farm spin-off.

An industry insider described the figures for the first episode of Amanda Owen's Farming Lives as 'solid.'

Viewing peaked at 610,000, with 329,000 watching the show live on More 4 when it aired on January 25.

The show topped the ratings for More 4, almost doubling the audience share of the channel's next most popular airing that week, Grand Designs.

However it was still a long way behind the 1.7m who tuned in to watch Beyond The Yorkshire Farm in December.

A source in the Dales farming community said: 'This is not what was expected. Amanda is the TV star and Clive is a farmer who somehow ended up on the telly.

'I don't think anyone expected his and Reuben's show to do better of the two, least of all Amanda.'

 Amanda and Clive (pictured with their children) - who were married in 2000 - met in 1996 when he was already divorced with two children, after she arrived at his farm as a 21-year-old trainee shepherdess

Clive and Reuben's show was based around the teen's new contract digging business and was a surprise ratings hit for Channel 5.

During Our Yorkshire Farm viewers saw Reuben, who was raised on the farm, helping birth lambs, plough fields and hand-feed cows since a very young age, gain an apprenticeship to learn how to fix tractors.

During their 21-year marriage, Amanda, 48, and Clive, 67, welcomed Raven, 21, Reuben, 18, Miles, 16, Edith, 14, Violet, 12, Sidney, 11, Annas, nine, Clemmy, seven, and Nancy, six.

Most the youngsters help out on the family's 2,000-acre Ravenseat Farm in the Yorkshire Dales, where they take care of a thousand sheep, forty cows, several dogs and four horses.

But eldest Raven has started carving out her own career, away from the spotlight, by gaining a degree in biology with First Class Honours.

In February, Amanda welcomed her eldest daughter back to her family farm after years of living away during her time at university.

In June, Reuben marked their six-month anniversary by posting a series of sweet images of them together

He captioned the photographs: 'Can't believe you have put up with me for 6 months... #ily.'

Meanwhile, in February, newly-released audience figures revealed that Amanda's new Channel 4 show attracted less than half the viewers of Clive and son Reuben's Yorkshire Farm spin-off. Pictured, Reuben and his girlfriend

Father and son duo Clive and Reuben Owens now have their own Channel 5 series Beyond the Yorkshire Farm

The TV shepherdess took to Instagram to share the exciting news that Raven had returned after recently graduating from York St John University. 

Raven - who is now helping out with the animals, especially lambing season - celebrated her graduation back in November with both her parents, who confirmed their split last June. 

Amanda's rise from farmer to household name  

2000 - Clive and Amanda get married 

2011 - Clive and Amanda appear in The Dales

Amanda begins making more media appearances, offering interviews about giving birth on the farm and motherhood in remote Yorkshire

2019 - Amanda released a third book Adventures of the Yorkshire Shepherdess and was the subject of Radio 4's On Your Farm.

Meanwhile she also appeared on the podcast Trees A Crowd with David Oakes.

2020 - Our Yorkshire Farm becomes a runaway hit in lockdown, with millions tuning into each episode on Channel 5. 

Amanda begins making solo appearances on a variety of TV shows, becoming a regular guest on programmes such as Lorraine and This Morning to offer comment on parenting and life on the farm 

2021 - Channel 5 broadcast the first episode of series 14 of Ben Fogle: Return to the Wild, which saw Fogle back at Ravenseat Farm. 

Meanwhile Amanda was featured as one of the four celebrities travelling with a 360 degree camera in series two of BBC 4's Winter Walks.

She also released two further books Tales From the Farm and Celebrating The Seasons, both of which she spent time heavily promoting. 

November - Neighbours told MailOnline Amanda and Clive had been living apart for months after she 'got caught up in the spotlight' of her Channel 5 programme 

June 2022 - Amanda and Clive announce their break up 

July - Amanda makes her first TV appearance since the break up 

She wrote: 'Raven is back in the thick of it this weekend. Everyone's hands-on getting the yows [ewes] through the pens for ultrasound pregnancy scanning.

'A lot of hands make light work. It didn't take long to get the sheep through the pens and scanned. A smooth operation with little stress for everyone.' 

In the first picture, Raven and her sister checked on a cow while they were seen holding a sheep for an ultrasound pregnancy scan in another. 

In August 2022, Amanda revealed that Raven was working as an NHS volunteer in a post shared to Twitter. 

Sharing a gorgeous photo of the 21-year-old proudly displaying her certificate for the camera while looking chic in a light blue floral mini dress, Amanda wrote: 'Considerate and kind. â¤ï¸ That'll do. #NHS #nationalvolunteersweek #proud.'

The certificate from her local NHS trust read: 'Thank you for your dedication to both our staff and patients. Please find enclosed a special volunteering pin to recognise and thank you for your contribution to our Trust.' 

Raven - who wants to be a vet - also regularly updates her 39.6K followers on Instagram, often sharing monthly highlights to the delight of her fans.

For November, she posted snaps of her graduation, alongside other pictures of her day-to-day life - including a psoriasis flare-up.

'November = busy. A graduation, work and a psoriasis flare up, nothing much else to report,' Raven wrote in her post caption. 

One photograph showed the 21-yer-old taking a selfie at home, with a septum ring and fishnet tights. 

Raven also shared a glimpse of what living with psoriasis is like, with a snap taken at home showing her arms and legs as she suffered a flare up from the skin condition. 

Many of the Owen children help out on the farm when they are not at school - or travelling to and from as the journey takes an hour and a half each way.

'In order to make a big family work they all need to tow the line. It's not about child labour - it's about pulling together,' Amanda told the Daily Mail in an article in 2018.

The Owens are both still working at Ravenseat in Swaledale, North Yorkshire, but are no longer living as a couple.

Amanda and Clive - who were married in 2000 - met in 1996 when he was already divorced with two children, after she arrived at his farm as a 21-year-old trainee shepherdess.

After first appearing on ITV's The Dales, the couple shot to fame in 2018 when they bagged their own series Our Yorkshire Farm on Channel 5.

The show - which ran for four seasons - followed the family-of-11 in their day-to-day running of the remote farm. 

In June last year, the couple left fans of the hit series stunned when they announced their split. 

Amanda has since been accused of 'living a lie' by the jilted wife of her 'businessman lover' Robert Davies.

Yasumi Davies, 56, discovered the affair only a year ago when a love letter from the Yorkshire Shepherdess was found inside a paper bag in the boot of Mr Davies' car as she cleaned it.

 Amanda Owen and her ex-husband Clive (pictured on their eldest daughter's graduation day) became familiar faces thanks to their Channel 5 programme Our Yorkshire Farm

The wife, an investment banker from Tokyo, recognised the handwriting from a signed copy of Owen's new book. 

According to The Sun, she then discovered some of Owen's jewellery hidden in a box in their bedroom, including a necklace she had worn on TV which read: 'Together forever.'

Yasumi, who married Mr Davies on Christmas Day in 2011 following a whirlwind romance, later uncovered a key chain which said: 'Unbridled love. R & A.'

Mr Davies, whose eldest daughter is the same age as Amanda, instantly confessed to the affair when Yasumi confronted her husband, who has had five wives. 

Details of the shocking affair came out almost a year after Amanda and her co-star husband Clive announced their unanticipated split. 

In an interview with The Sun, Yasumi said: 'He rang Amanda in front of me and told her I knew about their affair and that it was over. He said they'd been having an affair for a few years. 

'But instead of acknowledging the pain I was suffering, he was more concerned about protecting her TV career. She didn't care how I felt and didn't show any compassion.

'I'd watched Our Yorkshire Farm and couldn't help but be impressed by her. She portrayed herself as a wife and a mother, devoted to family, hard-working and an inspiration to others. But she's been lying to the British public and living a double life.'

Mr Davies then ended the phone call and seemingly his relationship with Amanda, but was seeing the shepherdess again within a month. 

The father has since moved away from his family home with Yasumi in Malton, North Yorkshire, and was pictured with Amanda at an event in Folkestone, Kent.

Biden's alcohol czar warns Americans could soon be told to limit themselves to just two beers per WEEK under strict new booze guidelines

Americans could be urged by officials to drink no more than two beers a week as part of strict new alcohol guidelines.

Biden's health czar told DailyMail.com the USDA could revise its alcohol advice to match Canada's, where people are advised to have just two drinks per week.

Dr George Koob ""” who admits enjoying a couple of glasses of Chardonnay a week ""” said he was watching Canada's 'big experiment' with interest. 

'If there's health benefits, I think people will start to re-evaluate where we're at [in the US],' he told DailyMail.com.

Current US recommendations say women can have up to one bottle of beer, small glass of wine or shot of spirit a day while men can have two. 

But those guidelines are up for review in 2025. 

Dr George Koob, who directs the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, said the US could lower its alcohol recommendations to match those in Canada

Per the US guidelines, a drink is defined as containing 0.6 fluid ounces of alcohol, equivalent to one beer, one glass of wine at 12 percent alcohol or one shot. 

Asked in what direction the guidelines could change, Dr George Koob, the director for the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), said: 'I mean, they're not going to go up, I'm pretty sure.

New York woman, 104, reveals secrets to a long life ""” including a beer every night to unwind



Antoinette Inserra, from Staten Island, credited her long years to putting on makeup and making sure she gets out the house every day. She also has one beer every night to unwind. 

'So, if [alcohol consumption guidelines] go in any direction, it would be toward Canada.'

The guidelines are currently under review, although the updated versions may not be published until the end of 2025.

The debate about whether alcohol is good in low amounts has been around for decades, but increasingly studies show that even a small amount can harm your health.

A major study from this June warned that drinking any amount of alcohol raised the risk of someone suffering 60 diseases, including 33 that had never been linked to booze before.

Liver cirrhosis ""” scarring caused by continuous, long-term liver damage ""” strokes and cancer are already well-established risks of excess boozing.

But the Oxford University-led study, which analyzed data from half a million men living in China, also drew links to other conditions like gout and cataracts.

Dr Koob told DailyMail.com that there were 'no benefits' to drinking alcohol in terms of physical health.

He said: 'Most of the benefits people attribute to alcohol, we feel they really have more to do with what someone's eating rather than what they're drinking.

'So it really has to do with the Mediterranean diet, socio-economic status, that makes you able to afford that kind of diet and make your own fresh food and so forth.

'With this in mind, most of the benefits kind of disappear on the health side.'

But he did give ground to social benefits, describing alcohol as a 'social lubricant'.

Dr Koob said he consumes around two glasses of white wine per week, usually a 'buttery Californian Chardonnay'.

College girls are more likely to binge drink than boys for the first time in American history, Biden's alcohol czar revealed earlier this year

Canadian health chiefs admitted their new rules may be a 'bit shocking' when they were announced earlier this year.

The review process for Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2025 to 2030 has already begun ""” although the final version may not be published until the end of 2025.

America has been recommending a safe limit of up to two drinks per day for adult men and one for women since the 1990s.

In the past, studies suggested there may be some benefits to drinking ""” with resveratrol in red wine linked to a reduced risk of cancer and improved heart health.

In more recent years, the research has gone the other way, warning even consuming a small amount of alcohol is dangerous for health.

A report released in 2020 from a federal committee of experts warned that drinking raised the risk of cancer, saying limits should be slashed to just one beverage a day.

And in 2021 a report from the American Cancer Society warned alcohol was behind as many as one in 20 cancer cases in the US ""” or 25,000 annually.

It found alcohol raised the risk of both rarer cancers, like those of the throat, and more common ones such as breast cancer ""” the most common in women.

More recent research involving 370,000 people warned that drinking more led to a 1.4-fold rise in someone's risk of heart disease.

Top authorities including the World Health Organization have seized on the studies to warn that drinking even a small amount puts someone's health in danger.

It was this growing body of evidence ""” and their own analysis of 6,000 studies ""” that convinced Canadian health chiefs to overturn their alcohol guidelines in favor of up to two drinks per week earlier this year.

Previously, they had suggested women could have up to ten drinks per week while men could have 15 ""” similar to the limits set in the US.

The move quickly came in for criticism from some quarters, however, who accused authorities of 'ignoring' the benefits of drinking ""” including how it can help in social situations and with combatting loneliness.

Dr Dan Malleck, a health sciences expert at Brock University in Canada, said: 'Alcohol infuses many lives in many positive ways.

'We celebrate accomplishments, mark occasions, bring wine to parties, meeting with friends, commiserate, relax, blow off steam... these are important activities, and part of the texture and tone of many lives.'

Experts have previously argued that studies into the risks of alcohol are flawed because they fail to examine these social benefits.

The NIAAA does not set alcohol policy, with this instead being done by the US Department of Agriculture and US Department of Health and Human Services.

Dietitians reveal a specific type of milk could be slowing your metabolism and making you fat

Plant-based milks are all the rage right now, but doctors warn one type in particular could make people fat.

Coconut milk is filled with saturated fats which can raise levels of bad cholesterol and be dangerous for the heart.

But this type of fat is also high in calories, with a 3.5oz serving of canned coconut milk containing three times as many calories as whole milk.

Dietitians also warn the milk's rich and creamy flavor 'encourages larger portion sizes, further increasing calorie consumption', according to dietitian Trista Best from US-based supplements company Balance One. 

Plant-based milks are all the rage right now, but doctors warn one type in particular could make people fat

She told online news organization She Finds: 'Coconut milk, while rich and flavorful, can contribute to weight gain and potentially slow metabolism due to its high-fat content. 

'Although these fats are primarily saturated, which can impact cardiovascular health, they are calorie-dense.

'Excessive calorie intake, regardless of the source, can lead to weight gain.'

Plant-based milks are 'nutritionally inferior' to dairy version, says study 







She added: 'Coconut milk's rich texture might encourage larger portion sizes, further increasing calorie consumption.'

Dairy farmers have been arguing that plant-based milks should not be allowed to use the 'milk' label for years because they are not nutritionally equivalent.

Studies have shown how the alternative milks are often nutritionally inferior in at least one of three key nutrients ""” protein, calcium and Vitamin D.

They can also have higher levels of other nutrients such as fat.

A 3.5oz serving of canned coconut milk contains about 197 calories and 0.74oz of fat, according to the United States Department of Agriculture.

It also contains about 0.07oz of protein.

For comparison, the same size serving of whole milk contains 60 calories, 0.1oz of fat and 0.1oz of protein.

This means whole milk has lower calorie and fat content than coconut milk while also having a higher protein content, with this being important for the growth and maintenance of cells.

The USDA says a standard 3.5oz portion of coconut milk contains 31 calories, 0.07oz of fat and 0.007oz of protein ""” making it nutritionally inferior on all three counts.

Despite calls from the dairy industry to strip plant-based beverages of the title 'milk', in draft guidance released earlier this year, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said the products could continue to use the moniker.

They argued that the beverages were not pretending to be from animals and that consumers were not confused by the difference. 

They did say, however, that plant-based milks should start to include a nutrient comparison table, to show how they differed from whole milk.

This left the dairy industry disappointed, especially after former FDA commissioner Dr Scott Gottlieb declared in 2018 that an 'almond doesn't lactate'.

Milk alternatives have soared in popularity in recent years amid concerns over climate change, lactose intolerance and animal welfare.

The FDA says adults should consume about 1.8oz of protein per day for those who need to consume 2,000 calories.

This would mean an adult of this size would need to drink about 1.5liters of cow's milk ""” equivalent to six glasses ""” to hit their protein target.

But if they were to rely solely on plant-based milk alternatives, they would need to get about 6.2liters ""” equivalent to 25 glasses ""” to reach the same level.

Adults also need about 1,000 milligrams of calcium per day and 15mcg of vitamin D.

Scientist sets the record for living UNDERWATER: 'Dr Deep Sea' has spent 74 days in a cramped pod under the Atlantic Ocean (although his bunker is fitted out with a TV, microwave and SWIMMING POOL)

The idea of living alone underwater for 74 days may sound like an obscure form of torture for many people. 

But a US university professor has voluntarily done just that - and even broken a world record in the process. 

Professor Joseph Dituri, who has become widely known as 'Dr Deep Sea', has broken the record for the longest time living underwater without depressurisation at a Florida Keys lodge for scuba divers.

His cramped pod is 30 feet below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean and measures just 100-square-feet.

But while the lodge is small, he's managed to squeeze in a work area, kitchen, bathroom, two bedrooms, and even a small 'swimming pool' that acts as the exit and entrance.

Joseph Dituri is spending 100 days 30 feet below the surface

Professor Dituri's 74th day in Jules' Undersea Lodge was not much different to his previous days there since he submerged on March 1.

He ate a protein-heavy meal of eggs and salmon prepared using a microwave, exercised with resistance bands, did his daily push-ups and took an hour-long nap.

Unlike a submarine, the lodge does not use technology to adjust for the increased underwater pressure.

The previous record of 73 days, two hours and 34 minutes was set by two Tennessee professors - Bruce Cantrell and Jessica Fain - at the same location in 2014.

But Professor Dituri is not just settling for the record and resurfacing - he plans to stay at the lodge until June 9, when he reaches 100 days and completes an underwater mission dubbed Project Neptune 100.

The mission combines medical and ocean research, along with educational outreach and was organised by the Marine Resources Development Foundation, owner of the habitat.

'The record is a small bump and I really appreciate it,' said Professor Dituri, a University of South Florida educator who holds a doctorate in biomedical engineering and is a retired US naval officer.

'I'm honoured to have it, but we still have more science to do.'

Professor Dituri's home away from home is located at Jules' Undersea Lodge in Key Largo

His research includes daily experiments in physiology to monitor how the human body responds to long-term exposure to extreme pressure.

'The idea here is to populate the world's oceans, to take care of them by living in them and really treating them well,' he said.

The outreach portion of Professor Dituri's mission includes conducting online classes and broadcast interviews from his digital studio beneath the sea.

During the past 74 days, he has reached more than 2,500 students through online classes in marine science and more with his regular biomedical engineering courses at the University of South Florida.

While he says he loves living under the ocean, there is one thing he really misses.

'The thing that I miss the most about being on the surface is literally the sun,' Professor Dituri said.

'The sun has been a major factor in my life - I usually go to the gym at five and then I come back out and watch the sunrise.'

Professor Dituri gave DailyMail.com a tour of his 'home away from home' in March.

'There is a TV, although I really do not know how to turn it on. I have a small freezer like in a hotel room,' he said, while also noting he keeps a stash of chocolate in the pod.

There is a small microwave on a shelf, the only thing that can be used for cooking.

'Every good hotel has to have a pool, and my hotel has a teeny little pool outside,' said Dituri.

'This is how we enter and exit from the habitat. So when I go for a scuba dive with all my scuba diving gear, I get it on. I go out of the hole, and then I dive around. So that's how people come in and come out.'

WHAT ARE MARINE HEATWAVES AND WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THEM?

On land, heatwaves can be deadly for humans and wildlife and can devastate crops and forests.

Unusually warm periods can also occur in the ocean. These can last for weeks or months, killing off kelp forests and corals, and producing other significant impacts on marine ecosystems, fishing and aquaculture industries.

Yet until recently, the formation, distribution and frequency of marine heatwaves had received little research attention. 

Long-term change 

Climate change is warming ocean waters and causing shifts in the distribution and abundance of seaweeds, corals, fish and other marine species. For example, tropical fish species are now commonly found in Sydney Harbour.

But these changes in ocean temperatures are not steady or even, and scientists have lacked the tools to define, synthesize and understand the global patterns of marine heatwaves and their biological impacts.

At a meeting in early 2015, we convened a group of scientists with expertise in atmospheric climatology, oceanography and ecology to form a marine heatwaves working group to develop a definition for the phenomenon: A prolonged period of unusually warm water at a particular location for that time of the year. Importantly, marine heatwaves can occur at any time of the year, summer or winter.

Unusually warm periods can last for weeks or months, killing off kelp forests and corals, and producing other significant impacts on marine ecosystems, fishing and aquaculture industries worldwide (pictured)

With the definition in hand, we were finally able to analyse historical data to determine patterns in their occurrence.

Analysis of marine heatwave trends

Over the past century, marine heatwaves have become longer and more frequent around the world. The number of marine heatwave days increased by 54 per cent from 1925 to 2016, with an accelerating trend since 1982.

We collated more than 100 years of sea surface temperature data around the world from ship-based measurements, shore station records and satellite observations, and looked for changes in how often marine heatwaves occurred and how long they lasted.

This graph shows a yearly count of marine heatwave days from 1900 to 2016, as a global average.

We found that from 1925 to 1954 and 1987 to 2016, the frequency of heatwaves increased 34 per cent and their duration grew by 17 per cent.

These long-term trends can be explained by ongoing increases in ocean temperatures. Given the likelihood of continued ocean surface warming throughout the 21st century, we can expect to see more marine heatwaves globally in the future, with implications for marine biodiversity.

 'The Blob' effect

Numbers and statistics are informative, but here's what that means underwater.

A marine ecosystem that had 30 days of extreme heat in the early 20th century might now experience 45 days of extreme heat. That extra exposure can have detrimental effects on the health of the ecosystem and the economic benefits, such as fisheries and aquaculture, derived from it.

A number of recent marine heatwaves have done just that.

In 2011, a marine heatwave off western Australia killed off a kelp forest and replaced it with turf seaweed. The ecosystem shift remained even after water temperatures returned to normal, signalling a long-lasting or maybe even permanent change.

That same event led to widespread loss of seagrass meadows from the iconic Shark Bay area, with consequences for biodiversity including increased bacterial blooms, declines in blue crabs, scallops and the health of green turtles, and reductions in the long-term carbon storage of these important habitats.

Examples of marine heatwave impacts on ecosystems and species. Coral bleaching and seagrass die-back (top left and right). Mass mortality and changes in patterns of commercially important species s (bottom left and right)

Similarly, a marine heatwave in the Gulf of Maine disrupted the lucrative lobster fishery in 2012. The warm water in late spring allowed lobsters to move inshore earlier in the year than usual, which led to early landings, and an unexpected and significant price drop.

More recently, a persistent area of warm water in the North Pacific, nicknamed 'The Blob', stayed put for years (2014-2016), and caused fishery closures, mass strandings of marine mammals and harmful algal bloom outbreaks along the coast. It even changed large-scale weather patterns in the Pacific Northwest.

 As global ocean temperatures continue to rise and marine heatwaves become more widespread, the marine ecosystems many rely upon for food, livelihoods and recreation will become increasingly less stable and predictable.

The climate change link 

Anthropogenic, that is human-caused, climate change is linked to some of these recent marine heatwaves.

For example, human emissions of greenhouse gases made the 2016 marine heatwave in tropical Australia, which led to massive bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, 53 times more likely to occur.

Even more dramatically, the 2015-16 marine heatwave in the Tasman Sea that persisted for more than eight months and disrupted Tasmanian fisheries and aquaculture industries was over 300 times more likely, thanks to anthropogenic climate change.

For scientists, the next step is to quantify future changes under different warming scenarios. How much more often will they occur? How much warmer will they be? And how much longer will they last?

Ultimately, scientists should develop forecasts for policy makers, managers and industry that could predict the future impacts of marine heatwaves for weeks or months ahead. Having that information would help fishery managers know when to open or close a fishery, aquaculture businesses to plan harvest dates and conservation managers to implement additional monitoring efforts.

Forecasts can help manage the risks, but in the end, we still need urgent action to curb greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming. If not, marine ecosystems are set for an ever-increasing hammering from extreme ocean heat.

Life on Mars? Four volunteers are spending a YEAR living in a fake 'Red Planet' in Houston - complete with a gym and plush leather sofas (but NO windows!)

While Mars and Earth are similar in many ways, living on the Red Planet would be far from easy.

Dust devils, dangerous radiation and harsh temperatures are among its numerous challenges - and that excludes the complete lack of oxygen. 

But now, four volunteers will battle these for themselves, having entered a Texas-based Mars simulation where they will spend the next year.

NASA launched its 'CHAPEA' (Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog) project just yesterday in a major step towards rocketing to Mars.

A four-person crew will now spend 378 days in a 1,700 square-foot home dubbed the 'Mars Dune Alpha' equipped with four rooms, a gym and even leather sofas - but no windows.

Here, the group of volunteers will conduct an array of 'mission activities', such as robotics operations, growing crops and maintaining hygiene amid 'extraterrestrial' obstacles.

'They are about to embark on an analogues mission that encompasses Operation Logistics and research of living and working on Mars. The importance of this study cannot be understated,' said Judy Hayes, Chief Science Officer of CHAPEA.

WHAT DOES 'MARS DUNE ALPHA' HAVE? 

 

'As the journey unfolds over the coming year, it's through the stealth of this stellar crew that NASA scientists will learn critical insights on the physical and behavioural aspects of a mission on Mars.'

Microbiologist Anca Selariu, research scientist Kelly Haston, engineer Ross Brockwell and medic Nathan Jones are among the four-person crew in the CHAPEA habitat.

Their new home hosts four small rooms, two bathrooms and a lot of red sand as the US space agency has attempted to replicate Martian conditions.

While you may not expect life on Mars to be luxurious, their living space is also complete with a living area, TVs and several workstations. 

It even has an airlock which leads to an 'outdoor' reconstruction of the Martian environment, although this is still located inside the hangar where the facility is housed.

Various pieces of equipment are also scattered around the sandy floor, including a weather station, a brick-making machine and a small greenhouse.

The home is equipped with a treadmill too, on which the volunteer astronauts will walk suspended from straps to simulate Mars' lesser gravity.

As the mission goes on, NASA intends to monitor the crew's physical and mental health to better understand humans' ability to endure such a long isolation. 

Researchers will regularly test the crew's response to stressful situations, such as restricting water availability or equipment failures.

NASA's lead researcher on the project, Grace Douglas, said this data would allow the agency to better understand astronauts' 'resource use' on Mars.

'We can really start to understand how we're supporting them with what we're providing them, and that's going to be really important information to making those critical resource decisions,' she said during a previous press tour of the habitat.

Nathan Jones, among the crew, also added on Sunday: 'Humanity yearns to reach higher than ever before. Metaphorically and physically we seek to climb the highest of mountains.

The habitat was created for three planned experiments called the Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog (CHAPEA). Pictured is a floor plan for the facility

'So, we set our sights on a distant tomorrow when we might stand upon mountains such as Olympus Mons which is the tallest mountain in our solar system - as far as I'm aware. That is a mountain on Mars. 

'But I believe that tomorrow will only be possible because we step into Mars Dune Alpha today.' 

Another interesting feature about the habitat, which the team have worked on since 2019, is that it is 3D-printed.

This comes at a time when NASA is looking at potential ways to be self-reliant and build habitats on other planetary surfaces. 

Although NASA is currently in the early stages of preparation for a mission to Mars, its primary focus is the upcoming Artemis missions.

These aim to return humans to the moon for the first time in half a century, and will kick off in 2024 with Artemis II  flying around our lunar satellite.

The first woman and first person of colour is set to walk on the Moon's surface a year later for Artemis III.

NASA plans to send a manned mission to Mars in the 2030s after first landing on the Moon

Mars has become the next giant leap for mankind's exploration of space.

But before humans get to the red planet, astronauts will take a series of small steps by returning to the moon for a year-long mission.

Details of a the mission in lunar orbit have been unveiled as part of a timeline of events leading to missions to Mars in the 2030s.

Nasa has outlined its four stage plan (pictured) which it hopes will one day allow humans to visit Mars at he Humans to Mars Summit held in Washington DC yesterday. This will entail multiple missions to the moon over coming decades

In May 2017, Greg Williams, deputy associate administrator for policy and plans at Nasa, outlined the space agency's four stage plan that it hopes will one day allow humans to visit Mars, as well as its expected time-frame.

Phase one and two will involve multiple trips to lunar space, to allow for construction of a habitat which will provide a staging area for the journey.

The last piece of delivered hardware would be the actual Deep Space Transport vehicle that would later be used to carry a crew to Mars. 

And a year-long simulation of life on Mars will be conducted in 2027. 

Phase three and and four will begin after 2030 and will involve sustained crew expeditions to the Martian system and surface of Mars.

It is branded the most dangerous plant in Britain because of the poisonous sap coursing through its stem, yet it was introduced by Victorian gardeners keen to display its size. 

Heracleum mantegazzainum gives a clue to the plant's size, which regularly can grow between 10-16-feet in height, which is why it was popular with ornamental gardeners, looking for an impressive centrepiece for their displays. Yet, the plant, which is more commonly known as Giant Hogweed, contains a highly dangerous sap which when spread on human skin and exposed to sunlight can cause horrific burns. 

Ironically, the hogweed, which was imported from the Caucus Mountains and Central Asia, is part of the same family as parsley, carrots, parsnips, cumin and coriander. 

The first wild colony of giant hogweed in Britain was reported in Cambridgeshire in 1828, around a decade after it was first introduced into the country. 

Each hogweed plant can release 10,000 seeds which can be spread on the wind or by rivers. The plants are often found near railway lines or waterways.

Giant Hogweed, pictured, was first introduced into Britain in 1817 and sped into the wild within a decade

Even dogs can be affected by the deadly plant.  

Children are at particular risk from the leafy menace, which will begin to flower across the country in the coming weeks. The plant's giant stems - which contain the toxic sap - are hollow on the inside and make tempting swords or telescopes which can lead to horrific damage. 

Brushing against the stems can lead to excruciating pain if the victim's skin is exposed to the sap. Even professional gardeners can be caught out and badly injured by the 'Taliban terror weed'. 

According to the Royal Horticultural Society: 'The giant hogweeds were introduced into Britain and Europe from the Caucasus Mountains in the nineteenth century. The earliest documented reference to their introduction into Britain that has been traced is from the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew Seed List of 1817 where giant hogweed, under the name of Heracleum giganteum was listed among seeds supplied to Kew by the Russian Gorenki Botanic Gardens.

'They were soon introduced into the horticultural trade and being aesthetically impressive plants, were widely planted in ornamental gardens throughout Britain. Unfortunately they quickly escaped from cultivation with the first naturalised (""˜wild') population recorded in Cambridgeshire in 1828, and are now widely naturalised as invasive species throughout much of Britain and Europe.'

Experts warn that the plant continues to spread dramatically and is known to thrive in hot weather, where people wearing summer clothes are at especial risk of exposure to the deadly sap. 

In December 2015, Nathan Davies from Ammanford, Wales, almost had a leg amputated after his wound got infected having been badly burned when exposed to the plant's poisonous sap. 

In the House of Commons in 1970, Tory MP Carol Mather said there was nothing to be afraid from the Giant Hogweed. He was complaining about people seeking to eradicate the plant. . 

Mr Mather, who was a founding member of the SAS said: 'Even the giant hogweed, which has just raised its head, is threatened. People are already shouting for us to provide stronger poisons to destroy it. I assure hon. Members, having one of these plants in my garden, that if one does not frighten it, it will not do one any harm.' 

During the 1970s, despite growing reports of the harm done to children by the plant, successive governments refused to act against giant hogweed, or even to issue advice about its control. In a written parliamentary answer in November 1976, under-secretary of state at the department of Agriculture, Gavin Strang said: '[The] powers to prescribe weeds as injurious and to take action against them are intended primarily to safeguard food production. There is no evidence that this plant is either common on agricultural land or a threat to agriculture.' 

Hot weather promotes the growth of giant hogweed which can leave sufferers with these painful injuries

Lauren Fuller suffered these injuries while building a den along the banks of Loch Lomand. She had used the plant's stems containing the deadly sap

Dog walker Christina Sabina suffered terrible blisters on her hands after brushing past a plant 

Deliberately sewing giant hogweed seeds in the wild was banned in 1981 under the Wildlife and Countryside Act. Although landowners are not obliged to remove the plants from their land. 

GIANT HOGWEED: THE DANGERS 

Giant hogweed sap contains toxic chemicals known as photosensitising furanocoumarins, which react with light when in contact with human skin, causing blistering within 48 hours.

Effectively the toxic sap prevents the skin from protecting itself from sunlight, which can lead to very bad sunburn and scarring.

If accidentally rubbed in the eyes, the sap can cause temporary or even permanent blindness.

Anyone who comes in contact with the weed is advised to cover up the affected area, to prevent the sap reacting with sunlight, and to wash it with soap and water.

Many local authorities have schemes to eradicate hogweed populations in public areas such as parks, allotments and riverbanks. 

According to the RHS, gardeners must be incredibly careful if they have giant hogweed around their homes.  

Its experts recommend considering non-chemical methods of control such as digging out the plant's roots or suppressing it with mulch. 

According to the RHS: 'When controlling giant hogweed always wear gloves, cover your arms and legs, and ideally wear a face mask when working on or near it. Cut plant debris, contaminated clothing and tools are potentially hazardous too. 

'Wash any skin that comes in contact with the plant immediately. Ensure that contractors working on your land are aware of the risks and are competent to deal with this weed.'

It is possible to pull out young giant hogweed plants by hand in May while the soil remains most. Larger plants will require digging out. 

'Never let hogweed set seed, but allow the flower spike to form and then remove it before the flowers fade. At this stage, the plant is less likely to survive trimming than earlier in the year. Remember that perennial forms have been identified by RHS research and preventing them from setting seed will not reduce giant hogweed populations quickly.'

When tackling giant hogweed, the RHS advises gardeners to cover up, including your face, which cutting stems. It is also advisable to work in overcast conditions and it is important to wash off any sap as soon as possible with cold water. 

What is Giant Hogweed? 

'Britain's most dangerous plant': Found across the country the Giant Hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum) looks harmless enough but can deliver life-changing injuries

 Giant Hogweed is a non-native species to the UK.

It was first introduced to the UK as an ornamental plant in the 19th century after being discovered in the Caucasus Mountains and Central Asia.

The plant escaped and naturalised in the wild and can now be found throughout much of the UK - especially on river banks as its seeds are transported by the water. 

It has been spreading uncontrollably across Scotland for decades, producing up to 50,000 seeds which can survive for many years. 

But the sap of the weed, which looks like a giant version of the harmless plant cow parsley, is extremely toxic to humans and animals, causing horrific burns on the skin.

The skin remains sensitive to UV light for many years - and can even cause blindness if near the eyes.

Every year, thousands of people, including children and pets, suffer life-changing injuries from Giant Hogweed after accidentally coming into contact with it out in the wild.

Animal lovers will be dancing for joy over the birth of this rare lemur baby at Chester Zoo.

Adorable photos of the bright-eyed baby Coquerel's sifaka lemur show it clinging tightly to mum's fur as she leaps from tree to tree. 

Chester Zoo is currently the only zoo in the UK, and one of just three in Europe, to care for the Coquerel's sifaka in a bid to prevent its extinction.

This species of primate, originally from Africa, is critically endangered and has been nicknamed the 'dancing lemur' because of its distinctive sideways gallop. 

Their prancing movement allows them to cross long distances while only using the minimum amount of energy. 

This critically endangered 'dancing' lemur has been born at Chester Zoo. The tiny new arrival was born to parents following a five-month pregnancy

This is the second baby born to parents Beatrice, 11, (pictured) and Elliot, 10. Primate experts at the zoo say the baby will begin to branch out and explore on its own at around three months old, which is when they will reveal if it's male or female

WHAT ARE COQUEREL'S SIFAKAS? 

In the wild, Coquerel's sifaka lemurs grow to up to 18 inches (46cm) tall and weigh up to 13 pounds (6kg).  

They are native to the northern region of Madagascar and are unusual among lemurs in the way they walk.

They move through trees by vertical clinging and leaping, and can spring over distances of up to 30 feet (9m).



On the ground, the sifakas are known for their extravagant dance - maintaining an upright posture and springing sideways using only their back legs.

Sifakas have distinctive vocal calls which they use to ward off predators and locate each other, and have a scent gland in their throat which they rub along branches to mark their path and attract mates.

Primate experts at the zoo say the baby will begin to branch out and explore on its own at around three months old, which is when they will reveal if it's male or female. 

Born to parents Beatrice, 11, and Elliot, 10, Dr Nick Davis, primatologist at Chester Zoo, says that the baby will be a big boost for the species. 

'A new arrival into the conservation breeding programme is a huge boost for the species, ' says Dr Davis.

He adds: 'The little one will be joining only five other Coquerel's sifaka living in zoos across Europe, so every addition is very special. 

'The new baby was born with a thick fuzzy white coat, just like its parents, and is already wide-eyed and full of personality. 

'Mum Beatrice is being kept very busy with her playful arrival who is feeding from her regularly and has, so far, showed great signs of development.' 

The baby, who was born on September 21, marks the latest success of the conservation breeding programme.

In the last 30 years, the wild population of Coquerel's sifaka lemurs has declined by 80 per cent due to widespread habitat loss on the island of Madagascar. 

As a result, the species has become classed as critically endangered according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. 

Mike Jordan, Director of Animals and Plants at Chester Zoo says: ' These unique primates are found in only one place on Earth, the northwestern forests of Madagascar. 

'Sadly, their population is in sharp decline and their habitat has become increasingly fragmented as more than 90 per cent of the island's forest has been wiped out to make way for agricultural farming and human activities.' 

Mr Jordan adds that the zoo has been working with non-governmental organisations in Madagascar to develop an area of protected forests over more than 100 square miles. 

Chester is now the only Zoo in the UK and only one of three in Europe to care for these rare creatures 

The zookeepers will be unable to determine the newborn's gender until after three months when it stops clinging to its mother

'We're hopeful that the work here at the zoo in the UK, as part of the coordinated efforts with other European zoos, paired with our efforts in Madagascar to protect the forests, will ensure species like the Coquerel's sifaka can thrive for generations to come,' he adds. 

In their native habitats, Coquerel's sifaka lemurs can grow as big as 18 inches (46cm) tall, while their tail alone measures another 18 inches. 

This tail helps them hold their balance as they spring between 20 and 30 feet (6-9m) through the trees. 

On the ground, however, their very short front legs make it impossible to run on all fours so use their unique dancing bounce. 

Unique among lemurs, this walk is believed to allow them to cross long distances while only using the minimum amount of energy.

It is thought that, by crossing one leg in front of the other, the momentum from landing can help generate some of the energy for the next take-off.

Sifakas have distinctive vocal calls which they use to ward off predators and locate each other, and have a scent gland in their throat which they rub along branches to mark their path and attract mates.

Coquerel's sifaka lemurs are considered critically endangered as their wild population has declined by 80 per cent in the last 30 years 

Their decline has mainly been driven by deforestation in their native home of Madagascar 

The tiny new arrival weighed 120g - around the same as a medium-sized tomato

Coquerel's sifaka lemurs are known for their distinctive dancing jump which they use to move around on the ground

This latest edition to the family comes after the first ever birth of a Coquerel's sifaka in Europe at Chester Zoo a year ago. 

The 4 oz (119g) baby lemur had been born to Beatrice and Elliot, but unfortunately she passed away at around two-and-half-months old due to an underlying health condition. 

Before her birth, no Coquerel's sifaka had ever been successfully bred in captivity in Europe. 

With the latest edition to the family, the zoo is once again home to three of these extremely endangered animals.  

NEARLY ALL SPECIES OF LEMUR ARE AT RISK OF EXTINCTION 

There are more than 100 species of lemur in Madagascar - the only place where lemurs are found in the wild.

Sadly, IUCN primate experts report that destruction of their forest homes, caused by people for agriculture and timber, as well as hunting for their meat, has led to lemurs being considered the most endangered group of mammals in the world.

Nearly all lemur populations (94 per cent) are at risk of disappearing forever, and many larger lemur species have already become extinct.

Lemurs play a huge role in maintaining forest diversity, structure and dynamics through dispersing seeds and pollen from one area to another.

They are very unusual in the mammal world as they share a trait with only a handful of other species: female dominance.

More than half of the mammals (120 species) in Madagascar are included on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species.

Around 90 per cent of plant and animal species on this island cannot be found anywhere else on Earth.

A recent study found that it may take around 23million years for evolution to replace Madagascar's endangered mammals if they go extinct.

Things have got £100MILLION better for Sir Tony Blair after his think tank reaps rewards of the City's bet that Labour will come to power

Tony Blair's think tank made a record £100million in turnover last year as he reaped the financial rewards of the City's bet that Labour will come to power after the next General Election.

With Sir Keir Starmer well ahead in the polls, the proximity of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (TBI) to the likely next Government has proved highly attractive to wealthy clients.

But while the TBI's revenues have increased in line with its growing influence over Sir Keir's party, Labour Left-wingers have been angered by what they describe as 'an organisation bankrolled by billionaires, which continues to advise and take money from the murderous Saudi government'. 

They also accuse the former PM of offering advice which 'reflects these corporate interests'.

Tony Blair (pictured) has said he wants the outfit to 'be entrepreneurial, agile and give governments good solid advice'

The TBI, which - like its chairman - was a fierce critic of Brexit, provides guidance to governments on issues such as how to use technology in health services, manufacturing and agriculture, and on conflict in the Middle East.

Mr Blair has said he wants the outfit to 'be entrepreneurial, agile and give governments good solid advice'.

Employing 500 staff in 30 countries, according to the latest accounts, the TBI works with partners including the United Nations, Elon Musk's internet satellite company Starlink, and the Anti-Defamation League, which combats antisemitism. It also publishes research on topics such as the Northern Ireland Protocol.

Its backers have included the US government, Lloyds Banking Group, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Asda. But it also has extensive ties to the controversial American billionaire Larry Ellison, who co-founded the software group Oracle - and according to Forbes magazine overtook Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in June to become the world's third-richest man.

TBI notes Ellison's foundation as a backer, with his Ellison Institute for Transformative Medicine listed as a partner.

Blair serves as executive chairman but the institute has been run on a day-to-day basis by his former chief of staff Catherine Rimmer since it was formed in 2016.

The accounts show that staff were paid around £42million last year. Over the same period, the institute made a surplus of £21million - up from just under £17million in 2021.

Is this the beginning of the end for low-calorie food and drink? Artificial sugar replacement aspartame, found in thousands of 'diet' replacements - like Diet Coke, Extra chewing gum and even toothpaste - to be declared 'possibly carcinogenic to humans'

An artificial sweetener added to thousands of fizzy drinks, chewing gums and low-calorie foods will be declared a potential cancer risk, a bombshell report claimed today.

Aspartame is set to be listed as 'possibly carcinogenic to humans' in a World Health Organization reclassification, according to insiders. It follows a major safety review into the artificial sugar replacement involving 1,300 studies. 

Particular products containing aspartame ""” which entered the market in the 1980s ""” include Diet Coke, Dr Pepper and some Fanta flavours, as well as Extra chewing gum and Muller Light yoghurts. Some toothpastes, dessert mixes, and sugar-free cough drops also contain it.

The move will send shockwaves through the global food manufacturing market, with some of the world's best-loved brands affected. A huge push to crackdown on sugar over the past few decades has led to the mass usage of artificial sweeteners such as aspartame. 

Experts immediately questioned the International Agency for Research on Cancer's (IARC) decision, calling the classification system used by the WHO's subsidiary body 'dumb' and arguing that 'the dose makes the poison'. Cancer Research UK explicitly states that artificial sweeteners such as aspartame don't cause cancer.

Meanwhile, industry bodies claimed the IARC review consisted of 'widely discredited research' which 'contradicts decades of high-quality evidence'. 

Similar WHO-backed cancer warnings slapped on red meat, working overnight and using mobile phones have faced criticism for sparking needless alarm over hard to avoid substances or situations.

Particular products containing aspartame ""” which entered the market in the 1980s ""” include Diet Coke, Dr Pepper as well as Extra chewing gum and Muller Light yoghurts. Some toothpastes, dessert mixes, and sugar-free cough drops also contain it

Diet Coke was launched in 1982 as a healthier alternative to its original recipe and has been the subject of numerous marketing campaigns such as this example with model Kate Moss

The IARC ruling, yet to be publicly announced, is only intended to assess whether something is a potential hazard or not, based on all the published evidence.

It does not take into account how much of a product a person can safely consume.

That advice comes from the Joint WHO and Food and Agriculture Organization's Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), alongside national regulators.

JECFA is also reviewing aspartame use and will announce its findings on the same day that the IARC makes public its decision ""” on July 14, it was claimed.

Since 1981, the JECFA has said aspartame is safe to consume within accepted daily limits. 

For example, an adult weighing 60kg (132lbs) would have to drink between 12 and 36 cans of diet soda ""” depending on the amount of aspartame in the beverage ""” every day to be at risk. 

Aspartame what you need to know as reports say WHO could declare it a cancer-risk

Reports suggest the World Health Organization could declare aspartame as 'possibly carcinogenic to humans' meaning it increases the risk of developing cancer.

What is aspartame?

Aspartame is an artificial sweetener that was first developed in the 60s and is approximately 200 times sweeter than sugar.

This means less is needed gram per gram than sugar to achieve the same sweet result, making products that contain it have fewer overall calories.

Unlike sugar it also does not raise blood-sugar levels and thus can be used as alternative source of sweetness for diabetics.

Chemically it is made up of three substances aspartic acid (40 per cent), phenylalanine (50 per cent) and methanol (10 per cent).

What is it found in?

In a wide variety of products that market themselves as being 'diet' or 'sugar-free'.

The most famous examples are soft drink giant Coca-Cola's diet sodas, Diet Coke and Coke Zero as well as sugar-free gums like Extra's.

Other examples include low fat yogurts. 

Is there aspartame in Coke Zero and Pepsi Max too?

Yes. Both products list aspartame in their ingredients list.

Other soft drink brands like some Fanta flavours, Lucozade and Dr Pepper also contain the artificial sweetener.

What are its dangers?

Aspartame has been linked to a host of general medical issues including headaches, dizziness and stomach upsets.

However blind trials, where participants don't know if the product they consume has the sweetener, have failed to replicate this.

But there have been broader health concerns for years, including that they cause cancer, alter the gut biome, cause depression, and paradoxically even contribute to obesity by increasing people's appetites.

However, health and food regulators have repeatedly declared them safe to use following 'a rigorous safety assessment'.

There is one exception, which is for people with phenylketonuria, a rare inherited condition. 

People with phenylketonuria cannot process phenylalanine, an amino acid that is one of the building blocks of aspartame.

If people with phenylketonuria consume phenylalanine it can build up in their blood eventually damaging their vital organs. 

It's for this reason that aspartame must be listed as an ingredient on products that contain it.  

Only about one in 10,000 people have the condition.  

What does the potential ruling mean?

If confirmed it would see the WHO body, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), link aspartame consumption to cancer.

However, there are several degrees of the strength of the cancer risk it could be given.

According to reports it could be listed as 'possibly carcinogenic to humans' a status shard by substances like Aloe vera extract, the metal lead, and several colouring agents. 

For comparison the IARC has declared red meat as 'probably carcinogenic to humans', one stage above the status aspartame could be given.

However, even if found to be 'possibly carcinogenic' to humans an individual's risk could vary immensely.

The IARC establishes its rating based on evidence linking a substance to cancer, not the actual risk itself. 

This would be determined by a separate body, the Joint WHO and Food and Agriculture Organization's Expert Committee on Food Additives, who would provide advice on individual consumption levels alongside national health bodies.

In theory, this could see the NHS, for example, advise a healthy limit of consumption of products containing aspartame, similar to those it does for red and processed meat.

More broadly an IARC ruling on aspartame's cancer risk could see consumer backlash, with customers shunning products containing them over cancer fears.

Similar boycotts have occurred from other IARC rulings.

This could lead to companies changing the formulation of their products.

Could this see products like Diet Coke be given a cancer warning?

Unlikely. Such rules are left up to individual countries.

But no similar warnings have been placed on red or processed meats in the UK despite stronger links to cancer being found according to past IARC rulings.



Its view has been widely shared by national regulators, including in the US and Europe.

An IARC spokesman said that both the IARC and JECFA committees' findings were confidential until July.

But they added they were 'complementary', with IARC's conclusion representing 'the first fundamental step to understand carcinogenicity'. 

The additives committee 'conducts risk assessment, which determines the probability of a specific type of harm (e.g. cancer) to occur under certain conditions and levels of exposure'.

However, industry and regulators fear that holding both processes at around the same time could be confusing, according to letters from US and Japanese regulators seen by Reuters.

'We kindly ask both bodies to coordinate their efforts in reviewing aspartame to avoid any confusion or concerns among the public,' Nozomi Tomita, of Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, wrote in a letter dated March 27 to WHO's deputy director general, Zsuzsanna Jakab.

The letter also called for the conclusions of both bodies to be released on the same day, as is now happening. 

The Japanese mission in Geneva, where the WHO is based, did not respond to a request for comment.

The leaked finding puts the sweetener below two more serious categories ""” 'probably carcinogenic to humans' and 'carcinogenic to humans' ""” suggesting evidence is limited. 

IARC rulings can have a huge knock-on impact. 

In 2015, its committee similarly concluded that glyphosate, a herbicide, is 'probably carcinogenic' ""” one grade above the expected aspartame ruling. 

Years later, even as other bodies such as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) contested this assessment, companies were still feeling the effects of the decision. 

Germany's Bayer in 2021 lost its third appeal against US court verdicts that awarded damages to customers blaming their cancers on use of its glyphosate-based weed-killers.

The IARC's decisions have also faced criticism for sparking needless alarm over hard-to-avoid substances or situations. 

It has previously put working overnight and consuming red meat into its 'probably cancer-causing' class, and using mobile phones as 'possibly cancer-causing', similar to aspartame.

The IARC rankings list substances/hazards based on the evidence that they can cause cancer not of how high the risk of cancer is from exposure to a substance/hazards. 

Frances Hunt-Wood, the secretary general of the International Sweeteners Association (ISA), said: 'IARC is not a food safety body. 

'The JECFA is currently conducting a comprehensive food safety review of aspartame and no conclusions can be drawn until both reports are published.

'Aspartame is one of the most thoroughly researched ingredients in history, with over 90 food safety agencies across the globe declaring it is safe, including the European Food Safety Authority, which conducted the most comprehensive safety evaluation of aspartame to date.'

The body, whose members include Mars Wrigley, a Coca Cola unit and Cargill, added that it had 'serious concerns with preliminary speculation' of the IARC review, which 'may mislead consumers'.

The International Council of Beverages Associations, a body that includes Coca-Cola in its members, also said the leak was concerning. 

Its executive director Kate Loatman said: 'Public health authorities should be deeply concerned that this leaked opinion contradicts decades of high-quality scientific evidence and could needlessly mislead consumers into consuming more sugar rather than choosing safe no- and low-sugar options - all on the basis of low-quality studies.

'Even IARC agrees it is not the appropriate authority to undertake risk assessment based on actual consumption and that it ""does not make health recommendations"".

'We remain confident in the safety of aspartame given the overwhelming weight of scientific evidence and positive safety determinations by food safety authorities in more than 90 countries around the world.'

Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, an epidemiologist who regularly debunks questionable health studies has criticised the IARC's rating system as 'dumb'.

Writing on Twitter, he said: 'No one really cares if it is POSSIBLE that a substance causes cancer. Acrylamide, which is in coffee and toast, causes cancer.'

'They care if it's LIKELY that something causes cancer.'

Other experts also highlighted the safety of aspartame.

Dr John Sievenpiper, an expert in medicine at University of Toronto, said: 'Aspartame has proven to be a safe tool to reduce calories and sugars in the diet and is one of the most extensively studied ingredients with over 40 years of high-quality science supporting its safety.

'The best available evidence from large population studies shows that low and no-calorie sweeteners as a replacement strategy for added sugars is associated with reductions in important public health outcomes such as obesity, cardiovascular disease and death.'

Aspartame is used to sweeten a variety of food and drinks, including sodas, both diet, and regular, as well as chewing gums and some desserts (stock image)

Professor Tom Sanders, an expert in nutrition at King's College London, said: 'Aspartame had been used safely in the UK for over 30 years. 

'As far as I am aware there is no evidence from human prospective studies linking aspartame use to cancer and regulatory authorities have extensively reviewed the toxicological data and given aspartame a clean bill of health.'

He added that animal studies had also delivered mixed results on aspartame, with the quality of the data used being 'questioned'. 

Professor Oliver Jones, an expert in chemistry at the RMIT University in Melbourne, said: 'It is also important to note that just because something may possibly cause cancer does not mean that it automatically does if you are exposed to it. 

'The dose makes the poison.

'For example we know UV light in sunlight causes cancer, that's why we put on sunscreen at the beach - but we don't put on sunscreen when we go outside in winter even though we are still exposed to sunlight, why? Because the dose is lower in winter.'

But the news from the IARC is a vindication of UK academics, such as Professor Erik Millstone at the University of Sussex.

A research paper by Professor Millstone and Dr Elisabeth Dawson argued that - since 1974 - scientists have warned of the risks of liver and lung cancer, and brain lesions.

He said: ""˜Evidence showing that we could not be sure that aspartame is safe has been available since the mid-1980s, and reliable evidence that it can cause cancer in laboratory animals emerged in 2005 and has subsequently strengthened.

""˜It is sad that several large food and beverage companies, and their trade associations, have been trying to discredit the IARC.

""˜They are attacking the messenger for providing a message that they don't welcome.

""˜IARC is more reliable that almost all other official bodies because it excludes individuals with commercial conflicts of interest, while many governments do not.'

Meanwhile, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) said it would examine the JEFCA report before deciding ""˜whether any further actions are needed.'

Deputy Chief Scientific Adviser, Rick Mumford, said: ""˜Our view is that the safety of this sweetener has been evaluated by various Scientific Committees and it is considered safe at current permitted use levels.'

The IARC's potential ruling follows an observational study in France among 100,000 adults last year, which showed people who consumed larger amounts of artificial sweeteners ""” including aspartame ""” had a slightly higher cancer risk.

The paper itself followed an Italian study the early 2000s, which reported that some cancers in mice and rats were linked to aspartame.

However, the first study could not conclusively prove aspartame caused the raised cancer risk. 

Questions have been raised about the methodology of the second study, including by EFSA, which assessed it.

Aspartame is authorised for use globally by regulators who have reviewed all the available evidence, and major food and beverage makers have for decades defended their use of the ingredient. 

The IARC said it had assessed 1,300 studies in its review.

Listing aspartame as a possible carcinogen is intended to motivate more research, said the sources close to the IARC, which will help agencies, consumers and manufacturers draw firmer conclusions.

But it will also likely ignite debate once again over the IARC's role, as well as the safety of sweeteners more generally.

Last month, the WHO published guidelines advising consumers not to use non-sugar sweeteners for weight control. 

The guidelines caused a furore in the food industry, which argues they can be helpful for consumers wanting to reduce the amount of sugar in their diet.

Men are less likely to be vegans than women because the diet is not seen as masculine, a study suggests.

There is evidence that men are far less willing than women to give up steaks and barbecues for a trendy vegan diet.

To understand why, researchers asked 539 people to rate four vegan meals on a scale of how suitable they were for men or for women.

The vegan burger, carbonara, goulash and salad were described, on average, as being more appropriate for women to eat than men.

But the study suggests a vegan diet could appear less emasculating for men if it used more red-blooded language.

Half the people in the study were given masculine descriptions of the food, like a 'beast burger' rather than a 'wow-factor burger' or a hearty goulash instead of a gourmet one.

The man-friendly descriptions of the food included the words smoky, greasy and juicy, with the burger and carbonara described as coming in a 'massive portion' for 'even the biggest appetite'.

People given manly descriptions of the vegan meals rated them as less suitable for women than men given neutral descriptions like 'creamy' and 'delicious'.

This suggests more masculine marketing of vegan foods could make them seem less girly.

But even though people saw vegan foods as less feminine when they had masculine names and descriptions, they still rated the meals as slightly more suitable for women than men.

Unfortunately they were also no more likely to say they would like to eat the vegan meal, would be willing to try it, or thought it would taste good.

Alma Scholz, who led the study from the University of WÃ¼rzburg but is now based at Stockholm University, said: 'Men might be less inclined to consume vegan food due to the need to appear masculine.

'Perhaps if we used even more masculine language to describe this food, we could make men more willing to eat it.'

Figures show that just 3.82 per cent of men are vegan, while almost one in 10 (9.4 per cent) women now follow the diet

The study, published in the journal Frontiers in Communication, asked people to rate the suitability of vegan food for men of women from one to seven.

A score of four meant it was not particularly suitable for either sex, with a higher score meaning it was more suitable for men and a score below four meaning it was more suitable for women.

When a burger was described to half the volunteers using neutral words, the average rating was 3.68.

But the rating rose to 3.98 from people, to whom it was described using more masculine words - meaning it was almost seen as a meal equally suitable for both men and women.

Men appear very sensitive to whether food might make them look like less of a man, based on the study findings.

Women's ratings of whether vegan food is more suitable for males or females did not significantly change when masculine descriptions were used - but men's did.

The study authors note that meat is culturally associated with strength and masculinity, which might make a vegan diet a hard-sell.

Switching to plant-based meat can help the environment, experts say

According to scientists, switching to plant-based products that mimic real meat can help the planet. 

Livestock farming at the current rate hurt the environment in a number of different ways.

Cows, pigs and other farm animals release huge amounts of methane into the atmosphere, which is a greenhouse gas and contributes to global warming.

Raising livestock also means converting forests into agricultural land, meaning CO2-absorbing trees are being cut down, further adding to climate change.  

Juicy Marbles is just one firm creating plant-based vegan products, which are increasingly taking space on the supermarket shelves  

Factory farms and crop growing also requires massive amounts of water, with 542 litres of water being used to produce just a single chicken breast.

As well as this, the nitrogen-based fertiliser used on crops adds to nitrous oxide emissions. 

Nitrous oxide is around 300 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere.

These fertilisers can also end up in rivers, further adding to pollution. 

Scientists have recently suggested that bringing plant-based meat to public institutions such as schools and prisons can help trigger a wider transition amongst the general public. 

'Favouring alternative proteins in public procurement policies globally could help to bring forward tipping points in their adoption,' they say in a report.

Mount St. Helens is starting to rumble again in Washington with a spike in seismic activity recorded at the volcano more than four decades after its deadly eruption. 

More than 400 earthquakes have been detected beneath the surface of the volcano in recent months. There have been more than 2,000 earthquakes recorded at the site since 2010. 

Specialized equipment has detected that magma has been flowing through chambers deep underground, causing the volcano to recharge.

There are fears the earthquakes could lead to another massive explosion reminiscent of 1980s eruption that left 57 people dead and permanently altered the area's ecosystem. 

More than 400 earthquakes at Mount St. Helens have been reported in recent months sparking fears of another erruption

The volcano fatally exploded (pictured) on May 18, 1980 and took the lives of 57 people. Just two days before small earthquakes were recorded at the site

'Short-term increases in earthquake rates are common at Mount St. Helens and are considered part of the background seismicity,' the US Geological Survey said, trying to calm fears. 

Officials added there were no signs of an impending eruption. 

Concern is spiked when earthquakes happen near the Mount, but the recharges can happen for many years without an eruption. 

Many of the recently recorded quakes registered at less than one on the Richter scale, meaning they were too small to be felt on the Earth's surface. The largest earthquake that recently took place measured at a 2.4 magnitude on August 27, 2023.

However, in 1980, small earthquakes were recorded at the site just before the deadly eruption.   

More than 400 earthquakes have been detected beneath the surface of the volcano in recent months. There have been more than 2,000 earthquakes recorded at the site since 2010

At the time of the 1980 eruption only one monitoring system (pictured) was in place, but currently there are 20 systems

On May 18, 1980, residents flooded the area as they sat in open fields and rooftops as rumors of a volcanic eruption spread. Millions all over the world waited around for two months to see what would happen next. 

But on that morning, at 8.32am, the results turned out to be deadly as a magnitude-5 earthquake struck, causing the volcano to lose its cryptodome and erupt. 

Those in the area had nowhere to take cover. 

The volcano exploded sideways and sent an enormous landslide of a super-heated mix of ash, rock fragments and gas flowing downslope. The ash and gas then rose and blocked the sun, turning the sky completely dark. 

Venus Dergan told Portland Monthly she and her boyfriend, Roald Reitan, were camping on the south fork of the Toutle River, just 30 miles from the volcano. 

They woke up to a blaring alarm from the nearby town of Toutle and said they didn't hear the eruption but saw water rush toward them. 

'We were lucky that we got out of the tent when we did. They probably would have never found us.

'We would've been buried alive,' Dergan said.  

Destructive mudflows, also known as lahars, swept up homes and trucks as officials closed bridges and stalled railroad track operations. 

Most of the debris from the seismic event turned westward, down the North Fork Toutle River and formed a mound of deposit.

Loads of volcanic ash and blistering hot lava erupted from the summit and caused health issues for those in the area at the time

The total avalanche volume equaled a measurement of 1million Olympic-sized swimming pools. 

THE CATACLYSMIC ERUPTION OF MOUNT ST. HELENS, 1980

On May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens in southwest Washington erupted.

The cataclysmic event killed 57 people and blasted more than 1,300 feet off the top of the mountain.

The eruption was trigged by a magnitude 5+ earthquake, which was accompanied by a debris avalanche.

This abruptly removed the pressure at the top of the volcano, allowing hot water to quickly become steam, expanding ""˜explosively,' according to USGS.

A wave of decreasing pressure travelled down the volcano to the magma reservoir lying below. The magma then began to rise and bubble, creating a massive eruption which lasted for nine hours.

The debris avalanche travelled westward as far as 14 miles down the North Fork Toutle River valley, with a total volume equal to 1 million Olympic swimming pools.

And, the lateral blast devastated the surrounding area nearly 19 miles west to east, and 12.5 miles to the north.

In less than 15 minutes after the blast of hot material began, an eruption cloud had reached a height of more than 15 miles.

Roughly 520 million tons of ash were blown across the United States, causing complete darkness in Spokane, Washington - 250 miles away from the volcano.

The cloud circled the Earth in 15 days. 

Trees were also blown to the ground or scorched by the brutally hot lava, leaving the once-dense forest virtually empty. 

The volcanic ash fell like snow throughout Washington, Idaho and western Montana. Officials had to close highways for weeks and airlines canceled more than 1,000 flights. 

In the days following the devastation, an estimated 540million tons of ash drifted up from the structure and settled over a total of seven states. 

The aftermath also drew researchers from around the world as they began to study the impacts of the ash, and navigated ways to clean up the farmlands, roads and water treatment facilities. 

The ash itself left a lasting impact on human, animal and plant life. When volcanic ash is dispersed it can cause respiratory and eye issues, along with skin irritation. 

Toxic gases like carbon dioxide and fluorine commonly found in ash directly affected crops, animals and caused human illness. 

The disastrous eruption also caused large amounts of mud, water and debris to intrude on banks and flooded low-lying valleys. Rock sediment clogged channels in the Toutle, Cowlitz and Columbia Rivers. 

To this day, those rivers continue to transport this sediment downstream ten times greater than before the 1980 eruption, the United States Geological Survey reported. 

The natural disaster killed thousands of animals and caused over $1billion in damage.

Researchers and scientists flocked in after the gigantic eruption and have studied the summit ever since

The largest earthquake that recently took place at Mount St. Helens (pictured) measured at a 2.4 magnitude on August 27, 2023. In 1980, an earthquake measured at a 5+ magnitude 

One of the people killed that day was Robert Landsburg, a 48-year-old photographer who was just a few miles from the summit. 

The Seattle-born man dedicated himself to his craft up until the very moment he died, as he knew there was no way out of the catastrophic event. 

Instead of trying to escape, he continued to take photographs and made sure that he protected his camera and film from the blistering hot lava and ash that consumed him. 

The photographs captured in his final moments were published in the January 1981 issue of National Geographic and are still admired to this day.   

Another volcano eruption at Mount St. Helens took place from 2004 to 2008 and allowed scientists to investigate just how it works. It also allowed them to advance their monitoring systems that detect when the next explosion might take place. 

At the time of the 1980 eruption only one monitoring system was in place, but currently there are 20 systems.

Crisp fans are baffled by packets claiming contents are made from 100 per cent British potatoes - while also stating ingredients include non-British potatoes

Crisp enthusiasts were left stunned to see the back of contradictory crisp packets, which claimed to simultaneously contain British and non-British potatoes.

The crisp packet from Lidl's deluxe range states in bold white letters, '100% British potatoes,' next to a Union Jack flag.

But in the lower right and corner, tucked underneath the best before date eagle-eyed customers spotted: 'Contains non-British potatoes.'

The same contradiction was also spotted on a yellow-coloured packet of Kettle crisps. 

Crisp fanatics have been befuddled by the Lidl crisp packet (pictured) which claims to contain 100% British potatoes whilst also stating there are non-British potatoes inside

Closely to the right of the mature cheddar and red onion crisps' boast of being hand cooked, and a 100% British was the sentence: 'Contains non-British potatoes.'

READ MORE: Marks & Spencer admits its 'hand cooked British' crisps were actually made with potatoes from OUTSIDE the UK

The discovery of these 100% British but also non-British potatoes comes after M&S admitted their potatoes were made from non-UK potatoes, despite claiming they were 'hand cooked British' crisps.

The retailer cited a summer drought in 2022 as why they had to find alternatives to the British potato 'for a few weeks'. 

But crisps fans were not happy after discovering the contradiction on the packets of crisps on two separate Reddit threads. 

One person said: 'What a tangled web of lies they weave.' 

Others were furious querying if it was even in line with the law to have with such conflicting statements.

Another added: 'Is it even legal for them to do this? Sounds like it could fall under false advertisement.' 

Others argued that it was a technicality, stating: 'No lies there. They 'select' British potatoes, but that doesn't mean they use them.'

One user quipped: ' I have chosen a British potato! Now, pass me three dozen of those Portuguese ones.'

One individual said the Kettle crisp company were taking the 'American approach on labelling.' 

But not everyone was bewildered about the contradicting labelling. Some foodies found the fun in the miscommunication.

One poster joked: 'I wouldn't consider it 100% unless it was grown by a Druid.'

One jested: 'Bloody non-British potatoes, comin' over 'ere...' whilst another answered: 'Taking our crisps.'

The yellow-orange Kettle crisp packet also had the same contradiction as the Lidl crisp packet. Pictured: the back of a mature cheddar and red onion Kettle Crisp packet

The Chartered Trading Standards Institute said fewer potato growers and poor growing conditions for potatoes in 2022 cause the befuddling labels. Similar issues occurred with free range eggs

Whilst others speculated as to why the conflicting statements were even on the packet to begin with.

'Probably had to mix in foreign potatoes because of the droughts last year affecting British crops.'

The confusing labels are a result of poor growing conditions for potatoes during the 2022 growing season alongside fewer potato growers in the UK over the last few years, according to the Chartered Trading Standards Institute.

The institute also said there were similar issues with free range eggs. 

A Lidl spokesperson said: 'As was reported by the MailOnline last month, crisps containing British potatoes were temporarily impacted by crop shortages, impacting multiple retailers. 

'In line with our commitment to customer transparency the inkjet mark on the pack, which is completed at the production stage, was updated to reflect the temporary change in origin to the potatoes. 

'This was a very short concession, with only a small number left in stores and we are pleased to confirm that production has now returned to using 100% British Potatoes.'

MailOnline has approached Kettle Foods for comment.

New footage shows India's moon rover starting to explore the lunar surface, just one day after its arrival at the moon's south mole.  

Chandrayaan-3, which landed at the moon's south pole on Wednesday, consists of a stationary four-legged lander and a smaller rover within.

The new clip shows the plucky four-wheeled rover going down the lander's ramp and starting to roam the dusty ground, leaving track marks in its wake.

Chandrayaan-3 already beamed back its first photo of the moon's surface yesterday, as well as four amazing snaps of the moon from above during descent. 

Although India's space agency is yet to confirm the exact spot Chandrayaan-3 landed, it's thought to be the same intended landing site of the failed Chandrayaan-2 craft of 2019 - between the southern craters of Manzinus C and Simpelius N.

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has confirmed its historic mission is all going to plan and systems are working as they should. 

'All activities are on schedule. All systems are normal,' ISRO posted on X, formerly Twitter.

'Rover mobility operations have commenced.' 

There are two scientific instruments in the rover (nicknamed 'Pragyan') and three instruments on board the lander ('Vikram') and all of them have been switched on sequentially.

They will study the atmospheric and mineral composition of the moon, including the patches of water ice that are common around the lunar region's south.

The science instruments will be active for roughly one lunar day, or 14 Earth days, before losing power - a relatively short mission. 

ISRO chairman Sreedhara Somanath admitted there are 'many issues' on the moon's surface, such as lunar dust and frigid temperatures, that could impact the rover's moving parts during the 14-day period.

'The mechanisms, the moving items...can get entangled with the dust there,' he told India's CNN News 18 TV channel.

'It can get into the moving parts and jam them, the bearings of the system may not work, the motors may not work.'

'All this creates problems in those mechanisms...so let us see how it goes.

'We will face it...that's why we are exploring. If everything is known, what is the fun in doing it?' 

The south pole is as yet unchartered territory for humankind, and far from the equatorial region targeted by previous moon missions such as the crewed Apollo landings of the 1960s and 1970s.

It's not only full of dramatic craters and deep trenches, but extremely cold temperatures (as low as -410°F/-246°C according to NASA), which can put stress on any spacecraft's power systems.

But such temperatures also mean the south pole has a particular abundance of water reserves frozen as ice, which is of great interest to scientists. 

These pockets of water ice, known as 'cold traps', have the potential to exist for thousands of years on 'airless bodies' that don't have an atmosphere, like the moon.

Therefore, they could provide a record of microbial life, lunar volcanoes, material that comets and asteroids delivered to Earth or the origin of former oceans. 

They could even provide a source of water for any future human outposts on the moon, either for drinking or irrigation of crops. 

Chandrayaan-3 already beamed back its first photo of the moon's surface yesterday, as well as four amazing snaps of the moon from above during descent. This is one of them

The unforgiving southern region of the moon is also generating great interest among space agencies in Russia, China and the US. 

Russia tried to land a spacecraft on the lunar south last weekend but spectacularly failed when it spun out of control and smashed - leaving the path free for India to seal the achievement instead. 

Although India is the fourth country after the US, Russia and China to safely land a craft on the moon, it made history as the first to do so on the moon's south pole. 

Chandrayaan-3 actually left Earth more than a month ago, aboard a rocket from Satish Dhawan Space Centre north of Chennai on July 14. 

India's spacecraft has taken much longer to reach the moon than the Apollo missions, which arrived in a matter of days, because the Asian nation is using much less powerful rockets.

This meant Chandrayaan-3 had to orbit Earth several times after blast-off to gain speed before embarking on its month-long lunar trajectory.

Chandrayaan-3 was then in orbit around the moon for over two weeks before its successful landing on Wednesday - sending India into jubilation. 

India Prime Minister Narendra Modi also praised a 'historic day' for his country's space sector, adding that 'India is now on the moon'.

India has a comparatively low-budget aerospace programme, but one that has grown considerably in size and momentum since it first sent a probe to orbit the moon in 2008 (Chandrayaan-1). 

The latest mission comes with a price tag of $74.6million - far lower than those of other countries, and a testament to India's frugal space engineering. 

Experts say India can keep costs low by copying and adapting existing space technology, and thanks to an abundance of highly skilled engineers who earn a fraction of their foreign counterparts' wages.

In 2014, India became the first Asian nation to put a satellite into orbit around Mars and is slated to launch a three-day manned mission into Earth's orbit by next year.

India is also working with the Japanese Space Agency (JAXA) on Chandrayaan-4, which would also land at the moon's south but have a much longer lifespan. 

Launch of Chandrayaan-4 is tentatively scheduled for 2025 or 2026. 

China and US will follow India's success with their own attempts to land at the moon's south pole

Along with India and Russia, China and the US are also part of the race to put spacecraft on the moon's south pole.

Although India has won the race to be the first, the other three nations are expected to become the second to do it later this decade

China's Chang'e 7 robotic exploration mission, scheduled for 2026, has the lunar south pole as its destination. 

Meanwhile, the US's Artemis programme run by NASA, not content just with landing an uncrewed robotic gadget at the lunar south, wants to send humans instead. 

The Artemis III mission, which will land the first woman and the first person of colour on the moon, is planned for 2025, but NASA recently admitted this could be pushed back. 

Russia's attempt to be the first to land at the south pole - Luna 25 - failed just days before India took the record. 

Russia's mission - a follow-up to Luna 24 back in 1976 - failed when it spun out of control and smashed. 

Valery Yegorov, a former researcher with Russia's space programme who now lives in exile, said the crash would severely affect Roscosmos's future missions, with the next one not planned until 2028 or 'even later'.

Iceland volcano: Are flights affected and is it safe to travel?

Scientists anticipated the eruption of a volcano in southwestern Iceland for weeks, so when it happened on the night of December 18, it was no surprise. 

The region had been active for more than two years and thousands of small earthquakes rattled the area in recent weeks.

Here MailOnline takes a look at what happened and what may be ahead.

How the eruption unfolded 

It started at about 10:20 p.m. local time on the night of December 18 north of Grindavik, a fishing town of 3,400 people on the Reykjanes Peninsula. 

The town is about 50 kilometers (31 miles) southwest of Iceland's capital, Reykjavik, in an area known broadly as Fagradalsfjall volcano.

First there was a series of small earthquakes. Then lava that's some 1,200 degrees Celsius (2,192 degrees Fahrenheit) began pouring out of a fissure about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) long. 

The Icelandic Meteorological Office estimated that hundreds of cubic meters of lava per second flowed out in the first two hours of the eruption, though the activity had significantly subsided by the afternoon of December 19.

First aerial footage of the eruption shows nearly two miles of lava coming out of the fissure near Grindavik on Iceland's Reykjanes Peninsula on the night of December 18, 2023

Was it expected?  

In short, no - scientists had expected the eruption for several weeks and in November, authorities evacuated Grindavik after thousands of small earthquakes shook the area for more than two weeks. 

Scientists said their monitors showed that a corridor of magma, or semi-molten rock, was spreading toward the town and could reach the surface imminently.

The nearby Blue Lagoon geothermal resort, one of Iceland's best-known tourist attractions, had to close temporarily as a precaution after a magnitude 4.8 earthquake hit the area last month.

Fagradalsfjall had been dormant for some 6,000 years but it flared to life in March 2021, when hundreds of people flocked to the Reykjanes Peninsula to see spectacular lava flows that lasted for months. The red glow from the lava could be seen from the outskirts of the capital.

Will this eruption affect flights?  

None of the recent eruptions on the Reykjanes Peninsula caused damage or disruptions to flights, despite the area's proximity to the country's main Keflavik Airport. 

And though the eruption on December 18 appears to be larger and more powerful than those in recent years, forecasters and scientists say it's unlikely to impact air travel.

Many still recall the huge disruptions to international aviation in 2010, when a different Icelandic volcano, the Eyjafjallajokull, spewed giant clouds of ash high into the atmosphere over Europe. 

Some 100,000 flights were grounded, millions of international travelers stranded and air travel was halted for days because of concerns the fine ash could damage jet engines.

Experts say the location and features of this eruption mean it isn't expected to produce much ash or cause a similar scale of disruption.

AccuWeather, a U.S.-based weather forecasting firm, said on December 19 that initial information shows no ash cloud has yet been observed. 

'Over the next several days, any ash is expected to remain many thousands of feet above the ground,' the firm said.

What other impacts could this eruption have?  

Scientists say that there is no current threat that the lava will reach the town of Grindavik or key structures like nearby power plants. The residents from the area have been evacuated and most surrounding roads remain closed.

But the scientists warn the situation could change and that it's too early to say how long the eruption will last or when local residents could move back into their homes.

'Even though the lava did not erupt into the town of Grindavik or at the nearby power plant and popular tourist destination, the Blue Lagoon, the lava flows are still only a few kilometers away and there is still concern of lavas reaching these key locations,' said Sam Mitchell, a researcher in volcanology at the University of Bristol.

The molten lava flowing above ground can also heighten the risk of poor air quality in the region because of the increased sulfur dioxide content in the air, AccuWeather said.

One volcanologist, Ãrmann HÃ¶skuldsson, told Iceland's state broadcaster RUV that he expected the eruption could last from a week to 10 days. 'If everything is normal, this will subside in the afternoon tomorrow,' he said.

How common are volcanic eruptions in Iceland?  

Iceland is one of Earth's most volcanically active areas, with 32 active volcanic sites. It averages an eruption every four to five years - though the frequency has increased closer to every 12 months since 2021.

The country sits on top of a volcanic hotspot and what's called the mid-Atlantic ridge, a huge crack in the ocean floor caused by the separation of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates. 

As the plates pull apart, new magma rises up to fill the gaps, triggering earthquakes and volcanic activity.

One of the country's largest active volcanoes is Katla, which is closely watched because it lies under thick glacial ice, meaning that any eruption could melt the ice and trigger widespread flooding. 

Katla last erupted in 1918, and that eruption lasted almost a month, starving crops of sunlight and killing some livestock.

Will Iceland weather affect pollution risk?

The eruption is taking place on a fissure that was last active about 2,000 years ago. 

Lava flows had decreased from 200-250 cubic meters per second in the first two hours of the eruption to around a quarter of that on the morning of December 19. 

It is normal for fissure eruptions to subside after an initial burst, but it could still go on 'for some time', Geirson said. 

The crack that opened up in the earth's surface was about 4 km long, with its southern end some 3 km from Grindavik, Iceland's Meteorological Office said.

If the eruption maintains the current intensity, it will produce significant air pollution, volcanology researchers at the University of Iceland said on Facebook.

'The good news is that the wind is northwesterly and according to the forecast it will stay northerly for the next few days. Hence the eruption plume is likely to be blown away from inhabited areas,' the researchers said.

First aerial footage shows the volcanic fissure, which is estimated to be nearly two miles long on December 18, 2023

Will there be an ash cloud like Eyafjallajokull eruption? 

Located between the Eurasian and the North American tectonic plates, among the largest on the planet, Iceland is a seismic and volcanic hot spot as the two plates move in opposite directions. 

The eruption late on December 18 is the fourth on Reykjanes in recent years and largest in the area since 2021. 

In 2021, volcanic activity in the area continued for six months, prompting thousands of Icelanders and tourists to visit the scene. 

In August 2022, a three-week eruption happened in the same area, followed by another in July 2023. 

In 2010, ash clouds from eruptions at the Eyafjallajokull volcano in the south of Iceland spread over large parts of Europe, grounding some 100,000 flights in Europe and beyond, and forcing hundreds of Icelanders to evacuate their homes. 

Unlike Eyafjallajokull, the Reykjanes volcano systems are not trapped under glaciers and are thus not expected to cause similar ash clouds.

AT moments of reflection, Professor Sir Ian Wilmut would often remark how impossible it was to predict where the biggest breakthroughs would lead mankind.

""˜One misconception is that scientists are any more farsighted than anyone else,' he said. ""˜We are not. Most of the things this technique will be used for have not yet been imagined.'

In truth, Sir Ian could scarcely have anticipated the furore that erupted one chilly day in February 1997 after his research team at the Roslin Institute, near Edinburgh, confirmed that ""˜this technique' had created a cloned sheep called Dolly.

Her arrival - the first mammal cloned from an adult cell - would become headline news around the globe. It raised the possibility that genetic engineering could one day be harnessed to eradicate degenerative conditions including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

It also provoked a fierce ethical and religious debate about ""˜playing God' and the prospect of human cloning, with the softly-spoken scientist behind it Frankenstein and Dolly a ""˜wolf in sheep's clothing'.

Such febrile attacks left him, he reflected in his book, After Dolly, feeling somewhat bruised. ""˜Although I knew that some of the possibilities raised by this form of cloning are indeed worrisome,' he wrote.

Professor Ian Wilmut, the scientist who led the team that cloned Dolly, with her at the Roslin Institute

Sir Ian could scarcely have anticipated the furore that erupted after his research team confirmed that ""˜this technique' had created a cloned sheep called Dolly.

I expected Dolly's birth to be celebrated because many more applications of cloning in the farm, clinic and hospital are wonderful. How naive I was!'

How times change. As his death at the age of 79 was announced yesterday, colleagues hailed him as a ""˜titan of the scientific world'. And even as humankind continues to benefit from the scientific secrets that flow from her birth 27 years ago, so Dolly the Sheep altered irrevocably the life of her creator. Just as he made her, she made him: a scientist of international repute sought out by international symposiums and US presidents alike.

The research he led continues to spin off dizzyingly, leaving a scientific legacy still shaping our world and our future.

In January, surgeons in the US used a genetically modified pig's heart to save the life of a 57-year-old man in a last-ditch operation. Such advances in biotechnology stemmed from the world's most famous sheep. It is hard to overstate the importance of the Roslin cloning project. Aside from re-programming genes to grow organs in the lab to replace faulty ones, such as hearts, scientists are looking at ways to simply ""˜switch off' the genes that cause cystic fibrosis, haemophilia, sickle cell disease and a host of other conditions.

No one, least of all Sir Ian, was under any illusions about the occasionally controversial nature of their work.

In the seven months after her birth, only around a dozen people were aware of Dolly's existence. Derived from the mammary gland of a six-year-old Dorset Finn ewe, Dolly was named after the country singer Dolly Parton, pictured left, as Sir Ian impishly explained, ""˜we couldn't think of a more impressive pair of glands than Dolly Parton's'.

Almost 20 years after her birth, Prof Sir Ian was joined by experts to discuss how Dolly still influences cutting edge scientific research in Edinburgh and beyond

The worlds first cloned sheep is now stuffed and on display at the Royal Museum in Edinburgh

Although Ms Parton was reportedly ""˜flattered', not everyone saw the joke. Eco-warrior Mark Lynas and three activist comrades tried to kidnap Dolly, breaking into the sheep shed where she was housed but could not work out which one she was because sheep all look the same. ""˜The scientists had outfoxed us by hiding Dolly in plain sight,' said Lynas.

Sir Ian found himself giving evidence to the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee, and questioned by Congress in Washington DC. The Vatican wanted to have the moral meaning of cloning clarified.

Asked about using similar techniques to produce a human clone, Sir Ian said the idea was ""˜repugnant' and ""˜illegal'. ""˜The objectives we had with this project were to produce methods for making precise genetic change in livestock and for making copies of embryos,' he said. ""˜It is legitimate to do things in farm animals you would not do in humans.'

Fortunately, perhaps, little about Sir Ian conformed to the stereotype of mad scientist immersed in morally ambiguous work.

Bearded and bespectacled with a balding pate and a fondness for real ales and single malts, he was most at home when talking science. ""˜I am trying my best to get [cloning] launched without getting my own life all tangled up in it,' he once said.

Scholastically, he was not a genius, managing only four O-levels on his first attempt, but passed chemistry and biology at A level. After school, he worked on farms before attending agricultural college at Nottingham University.

Farming was the original plan, but with no head for the business side, he diverted into research.

He set up home near Peebles with his mathematician wife, Vivienne, and they had two daughters, a son and a spaniel, and worked away quietly as a ""˜boffin' until Dolly's arrival changed everything.

A taxidermied Dolly - she died in 2003 - remains on show at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.

By 2018 Sir Ian was suffering from Parkinson's disease. He became patron of a research programme set up to enable trials of a new generation of therapies that aim to slow the progression of the disease. Sadly, he died too soon to benefit from its work.

But one day countless others may benefit from treatments which owe a debt to a great scientist - and to a sheep called Dolly.

Blueberries, spinach and kale ""” each usually recognized as among the healthiest foods one can eat ""” have been named among produce with the most pesticides. 

The Environmental Working Group (EWG), based in Washington DC, named its 'dirty dozen' produce foods this week, a dubious honor reserved only for fruits and vegetables in America laced with the most chemicals.

Alongside the antioxidant-rich blueberries and leafy greens are other snacktime favorites such as strawberries, grapes, apples, nectarines, pears and cherries.

Peppers and green beans ""” which often find themselves into health-conscious recipes ""” were named on the ignominious list too.

The EWG studied 46 produce aisle staples for its study, and found that 75 percent of freshly grown produce in America contain residue of harmful pesticides. Human ingestion can damage the nervous system or even cause cancer.

More than 90 percent of samples of strawberries, apples, cherries, spinach, nectarines and grapes had at least two pesticides on them, the EWG found

Over 250 different pesticides were discovered on the fruits and vegetables, some of which have been barred in the US or Europe because of the effect they have on human health. 

For example, the neurotoxic organophosphate insecticide acephate, which was banned from use on green beans in 2011 showed up on six percent of green bean samples.

The insecticide is listed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a possible human carcinogen.

Both blueberries and green beans harbor worrying levels of organophosphate insecticides.

These can damage the human nervous system and is particularly poisonous for children's developing brains. 

Almost 10 percent of the blueberry samples contained the pesticide phosmet, and 9 percent had traces of malathion. 

Fetuses exposed to pesticides used on citrus and apple trees 87% more likely to develop rare eye cancer

 

Fetuses exposed to pesticides used on citrus, apple trees 87 percent more likely to develop eye cancer, study

Both are organophosphates and malathion was categorized as probably carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2015. 

More than 90 percent of samples of strawberries, apples, cherries, spinach, nectarines and grapes had at least two pesticides on them.

Over 50 pesticides were detected on every kind of crop on the dirty dozen list, apart from cherries.

Kale, collard and mustard greens and hot and bell peppers had the most pesticides of any crop ""” 103 and 101. 

The EWG compiled their 'dirty dozen' and 'clean 15' lists ""” fruits and vegetables with the least detectable pesticides ""” using data from 46,569 samples.

On the Clean 15 list, less than two percent of the avocado and sweet corn samples had detectable levels of detectable pesticides.

The data came from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), which peels or scrubs its produce samples before testing, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which only gets rid of the dirt prior to testing.

Even after these steps, 251 pesticides were lingering on the produce.

The clean 15 list contains fruits and vegetables tested which have very low or zero traces of pesticides. 

EWG toxicologist Alexis Temkin said: 'Despite the abundance of science linking exposure to pesticides with serious health issues, a potentially toxic cocktail of concerning chemicals continues to taint many of the non-organic fruits and vegetables eaten by consumers.'

The EWG emphasized that people should continue to eat fruit and vegetables, even if they are not organic.

Mr Temkin said: 'Everyone - adults and kids - should eat more fruits and vegetables, whether organic or not. A produce-rich diet provides many health benefits.'

Almost ALL peaches, grapes and strawberries sold in UK contain a 'cocktail of pesticides' as research singles out 'dirty dozen' fruit and veg

Among the worst offenders included grapes and strawberries at 84 and 83 per cent respectively. Cherries followed at 81 per cent. The proportion of apples containing multiple pesticide residue has almost doubled in five year, rising to 72 per cent in 2022, from the 44 per cent logged in 2018

Virtually every peach, grape and strawberry sold in Britain contains a 'cocktail' of pesticides, analysis suggests.

The data singles out the 'dirty dozen', or the 12 most polluted fruit and vegetables found in our shopping trolleys. 

Eighty-five per cent of all peach and nectarine samples tested in 2022 had residues of at least two different pesticides. 

Similar figures were seen for grapes (84 per cent), strawberries (83 per cent) and cherries (81 per cent). 

Under a decades-old testing programme, the government checks around 3,000kg of grocery samples each year for traces of chemicals.

Campaign group Pesticide Action Network UK (PAN UK) then analyses the annual reports.

Pesticide prevalence in 2022 was the highest since it began its own assessments in 2018, it said. 

Before 2022, the percentage of all food tested containing multiple pesticide residues had never exceeded 32.5 per cent, but last year it jumped to 39 per cent.

Equally, the total percentage of fruit and vegetables containing multiple pesticides residues had never exceeded 48 per cent. But in 2022 this rose to 53 per cent. 

The levels of individual pesticides, however, were mostly within legal limits. Levels in beans and spinach were among the worst offenders for levels above the limit.

Nick Mole, policy officer at PAN UK said: 'This year's results show that, just like our rivers, much of our food is increasingly contaminated with pesticide cocktails. 

'We have no idea what this ongoing exposure to tens ""” or even hundreds ""” of different chemicals is doing to our health over the long-term.' 

Across every fruit and veg sample tested in 2022, researchers logged 134 different pesticide residues. 

Half of these were classified as 'highly hazardous' by the UN.

Forty-five had links to cancer, while a further 25 contained endocrine disruptors, which can interfere with hormone systems, linked to an array of health problems including birth defects and developmental disorders.

Traces of more than 130 different pesticides were recorded in 2022 across all produce, including 45 with links to cancer . Activists warned that Brits had been left with 'no idea' of the long term health impact of pesticide exposure

Another 14 were shown to include 'developmental or reproductive toxins'. 

Ten others were cholinesterase inhibitors, which can impair the respiratory system and cause confusion, headaches and weakness. 

Many products tested were imported. For example, Grape samples examined were from thirteen different countries, such as South Africa, Brazil and Spain.

They are sold across major UK supermarkets, as well as smaller shops. 

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 1,000 different pesticides are used globally. 

They are used in agriculture to control weeds, insect infestation and disease carriers like mosquitoes, ticks, rats and mice. They also enable farmers to protect crop quantity and quality.

Pesticide consumption has grown almost 60 per cent since 1990 reaching 2.66bn kg (5.86bn lbs) by 2020.

But the elderly, children and unborn babies are especially susceptible to the adverse effects of pesticides. 

A spokesperson for the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs told MailOnline: 'In Great Britain we set strict limits on the pesticides residue levels that are allowed to remain in both food for consumers and feed for animals. 

'These limits are set to protect public health, and are set below, and usually well below, the level considered to be safe for people to eat. The limits apply to both food produced in the UK and that imported from other countries.'

Germany is considering whether to follow Spain's suit and bring in siestas to deal with a searing heatwave that is sending temperatures soaring across Europe.

A public health group recommended Germans adopt Spain's traditional afternoon nap during excessively high temperatures so that workers can be more 'efficient' - and to reduce any health risks. 

German health minister Karl Lauterbach said a siesta was 'certainly no bad proposal', while the BDA employers association said it was open to the idea to deal with Europe's scorching temperatures.

It comes as hospitals across Italy are struggling to cope with an influx of patients seeking emergency care for heat-related illnesses as the unrelenting heatwave continues to bake the Mediterranean. 

Tourists have collapsed and fainted on a daily basis over the past few days across the Mediterranean including Italy and Greece as temperatures soared past 42C yesterday.

Italian medics were seen treating holidaymakers, including children, who had collapsed from heatstroke while visiting the Colosseum in Rome, Italy, where temperatures hit a record 41.8C.

As a result, some Italian hospitals have reported a 25 per cent increase in the number of people arriving at emergency units suffering from dehydration or heatstroke, reports Repubblica. 

It comes as the sweltering heat across southern Europe is set to soar even higher in the coming days, with another heatwave set to strike Greece tomorrow.

Meteorologists are now warning that the worst is still to come for tourists and locals across Greece, where firefighters have been battling wildfires that have been ripping through holiday homes close to the capital Athens.

Temperatures are set to exceed 43C in Greece on Sunday, raising the risk of more wildfires across the country, forecasters said. 

'Although the winds will recede from Thursday, this doesn't mean that the dangers of fires will lessen,' Greek meteorologist Theodoros Yiannaros told broadcaster ERT. 'There will be a drop in danger perhaps tomorrow but during the weekend, the risk will be very high. Difficult times are ahead of us.'

Temperatures have also been unforgiving in Spain, where officials have put three regions under hot weather red alerts. Temperatures are expected to soar to 41C in Malaga today - slightly cooler than 44C recorded in Zaragoza, southern Spain, yesterday.

And coastal waters around Spain have hit a record high for the first time this year at an average of 24.6C in July - 2.2C higher than the average for the season, accordng to the national weather office AEMET. 

The figure 'far exceeds' the previous records of 24 degrees Celsius hit in 2015 and 23.7 degrees Celsius in 2022, and it is 'unprecedented' for mid-July since current records began in 1940, it added.

This situation is even more worrying since the summer is far from over, said Aemet spokesman Ruben del Campo.

'There is still room for the sea to warm even more,' he added, referring to both Spain's southern Mediterranean and northern Atlantic waters. Temperatures in some spots of Spain's Mediterranean southeastern waters have already hit 28C

Meanwhile, the UN weather agency warned temperatures in southern Europe could even break the 48.8C record set in Sicily in 2021 as it told tourists across the Mediterranean to stay indoors and avoid the beach due to the life-threatening dangers of the blazing sun. 

In Italy, hospitals are now under pressure as the heatwave has seen 25 per cent more holidaymakers being pushed through their emergency room doors with heat-related illnesses. The relentless nature of the heatwave, which has lasted for weeks, has made the situation worse, medics say. 

Doctor Giulio Ricciuto told Repubblica today: 'Until tomorrow we expect the worst, given that there will be three consecutive days of heat. Already today we see a clear increases in accesses due to the heat.' 

Ricciuto pointed to how dozens of tourists in Rome are risking heatstroke by travelling to the Colosseum. Indeed, yesterday, medics were seen treating holidaymakers inside ambulances that were parked in front of the historic landmark.

As a sweltering heatwave sweeps across Europe threatening to break the record books for Europe's 'hottest ever week' - it appears these Benidorm Brits are having the time of their lives! 

'Those who have problems directly or indirectly related to high temperatures are a quarter of patients in the emergency room,' he said. 

Concerns are growing that the heat, which has already claimed lives in Italy, will cause a spike in deaths. 

'Heatwaves are really an invisible killer,' Panu Saaristo, emergency health unit team leader for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said yesterday. 'We are experiencing hotter and hotter temperatures for longer stretches of time every single summer here in Europe.'

In response to the heatwave, the German BVOeGD public health officers association has recommended the introduction of siestas in Germany. 

While Germany has escaped the kind of temperatures that hit southern Europe this week, it has sweltered in the mid-30s Celsius, with Bavaria seeing the country's record high so far at 38.8 degrees Celsius.

Niessen, the head of the BVOeGD, said Germans should follow the habits of people in the hotter climes of southern Europe.

'Get up early, work productively in the morning, and take a siesta at midday,' he said in an interview published by the RND media network on Tuesday. 

 'People are not as efficient in strong heat as they are otherwise,' Niessen said. 'Moreover bad sleep in the absence of cooling in the night leads to concentration problems.'

German health minister Karl Lauterbach said a siesta was 'certainly no bad proposal' but employers and workers should negotiate this together.

On holiday in Italy, Lauterbach tweeted that high temperatures had stopped him going on a day trip to Rome.

'My daughter would rather stay in the pool while I will read. Next try tomorrow.'

The BDA employers association was open to the siesta proposal, saying that more flexible working hours could enable employees to take longer midday breaks if it suited both parties.

Niessen also called for 'sufficient fans and lighter clothing, even if the attire rules for an office don't allow it.'

'A cold footbath under the desk would be another option to stay cool while working from home,' he said.

Meanwhile, the Italian islands of Sardinia and Sicily have been forecast to possibly surpass a continent-wide record of 48.8C recorded in Sicily in August 2021.

At Lanusei, near Sardinia's eastern coast, a children's summer camp was restricting beach visits to the early morning and forbidding sports, teacher Morgana Cucca said.

In the Sardinian capital of Cagliari, pharmacist Teresa Angioni said patients were complaining of heat-related symptoms.

'They mainly buy magnesium and potassium supplements and ask us to measure their blood pressure, which is often low,' Angioni said.

Health officials have issued red weather alert warnings for 23 out of 27 cities across Italy, including Rome and Florence. A red alert warning means that the heat is so intense that it poses a health risk to the whole population - not just vulnerable groups like the elderly and very young children.

Britons who have travelled to the Mediterranean have told how the heat is so intense that they have suffered sunstroke and been forced to stay indoors during the hottest hours of the day.

A NASA scientist yesterday warned that this 'will be the coolest summer for the rest of people's lives' due to climate change amid fears that temperatures could break the 48.8C record. 

NASA climate scientist Peter Kalmus warned: 'Most people still don't know what peril they are in. This will be the coolest summer for the rest of your life, and that shouldn't be just a meme - it should be actually terrifying. The only path out of this heat nightmare is to end fossil fuels as soon as possible'.

The UN weather agency said overnight minimum temperatures are expected to reach new highs, creating the increased risk of heart attacks and deaths. 

'Whilst most of the attention focuses on daytime maximum temperatures, it is the overnight temperatures which have the biggest health risks, especially for vulnerable populations,' it said.

In response to the potentially record-breaking heat, Red Cross teams in Italy are checking on the elderly by phone while in Italy they took to social media to tell people not to leave pets or children in parked cars.

In Greece, volunteers handed out drinking water, while in Spain they reminded people to reminded people to protect themselves from breathing in smoke from wildfires that are ripping through the country.

Wildfires are still burning near Athens for a third day in a row today, as authorities braced for a new heatwave stoking tinderbox conditions across the country. 

At first light, air water bombers resumed operations over the towns of Mandra, west of Athens, and Loutraki, close to the Corinth canal which separates mainland Greece from the Peloponnese. Firefighters worked throughout the night to keep flames at bay and away from a complex of coastal refineries.

The fire brigade reported that a third fire had broken out on the island of Rhodes.

Hundreds of British tourists and locals have been forced to flee their holiday homes as the wildfires ripped through tourist hotspots - and there is no end in sight to the dangerous blazes.

Officials said the fire risk hazard will remain high throughout the country in the coming days as a second heatwave is set to strike tomorrow. 'We remain on a level of high alert,' said fire brigade spokesman Vassilis Varthakogiannis.

'Conditions are extreme, and are likely to be so for another week,' Kostas Tsigas, head of the fire brigade officers association, told Greece's SKAI TV. 

The blaze, which broke out on Monday in the region of Dervenochoria, about 30 km north of Athens, spread fast as it was fanned by erratic winds and reached Mandra on Tuesday, burning houses and forcing people to flee.

Not everyone went willingly. Footage released by Greek police showed officers imploring a reluctant group of nuns chanting hymns to evacuate a convent, and another of police screaming 'lets go' as towering flames closed in at a timber yard.

'We put all our effort into making this, we built this, and now it's all gone,' said Andreas Theodosiadis, a resident of Mandra, standing near debris and cars hollowed out by fire.

In the Canary Islands, some 400 firefighters battled a blaze that has ravaged 3,500 hectares of forest and forced 4,000 residents to evacuate, with authorities warning residents to wear face masks outside due to poor air quality. 

Scientists have relentlessly warned of the damaging effects of climate change. As well as withering crops, melting glaciers and raising the risk of wildfires, higher-than-normal temperatures also cause health problems ranging from heatstroke and dehydration to cardiovascular stress.

Heat records are being shattered all over the world and scientists say there is a good chance that 2023 will go down as the hottest year on record, with measurements going back to the middle of the 19th century.

June saw the warmest global average temperature, according to Europe's Copernicus Climate Change Service, and the UN's World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) predicted that a number of heat records are set to fall this summer.

The WMO said unprecedented sea surface temperatures and low Arctic sea-ice levels are largely to blame.

Human-caused climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is making the world hotter and is being amplified by the naturally occurring El Nino weather phenomenon, which warms the surface waters in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean.

El Nino events, which occur every two to seven years, are marked by warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern Pacific near the Equator, and last about nine to 12 months. 

But the current El Nino only started a few months ago, is still weak to moderate and is not expected to peak until winter.

Research published on Monday found that more than 61,000 people died due to the heat during Europe's record-breaking summer last year.

The majority of deaths were in people over the age of 80 and about 63 percent of those who died due to the heat were women, according to the research published in the journal Nature Medicine.

The world has warmed an average of nearly 1.2C since the mid-1800s, unleashing extreme weather including more intense heatwaves, more severe droughts and storms made fiercer by rising seas.

Oceans absorb most of the heat generated by planet-warming gases, causing heatwaves that harm aquatic life, altering weather patterns and disrupting crucial planet-regulating systems.

In June, global sea surface temperatures hit unprecedented levels. Antarctic sea ice reached its lowest extent for the month since satellite observations began, at 17 per cent below average, breaking the previous June record by a substantial margin.

While sea surface temperatures normally recede relatively quickly from annual peaks, this year they stayed high, with scientists warning that this underscores an underappreciated but grave impact of climate change.

'If the oceans are warming considerably, that has a knock-on effect on the atmosphere, on sea and ice worldwide,' said Michael Sparrow, chief of World Climate Research Programme at the WMO.

'There's a lot of concerns from the scientific community and a lot of catch-up from the scientific community trying to understand the incredible changes that we're seeing at the moment.'

My London life was so stressful I wasn't ovulating - but now I'm a mother-of-two after moving to Tuscany to renovate an 800-year-old farmhouse

A mother-of-two living a self-sufficient life with her partner and their two children in Tuscany revealed how she struggled with depression for years in the UK. 

Sophie, 29, and George, 35, welcomed Ben Fogle to the 800-year-old farmhouse they are busy refurbishing in a remote part of Italy for this week's episode of New Lives in the Wild. 

Speaking on the Channel 5 show airing at 9pm tonight, Sophie, originally from Somerset, revealed she began to suffer with depressive episodes in her teenage years, and was left unable to ovulate due to stress after making an 'escape' to London. 

She moved to Italy in her early 20s, where she met George, who was looking to renovate the farmhouse he had inherited from his father, and they are parents to Kayo, five, and India, three. 

Sophie, 29, and George, 35, welcomed Ben Fogle to the 800-year-old farmhouse they are busy refurbishing in a remote part of Italy for this week's episode of New Lives in the Wild, airing tonight at 9pm on Channel 5. They have two children, Kayo, five, and India, three 

The family are self-sufficient, but aware that a long road full of hard work is ahead of them if they want to renovate the whole property. 

Sophie, who grew up in the West Country, admitted to Ben that she began to struggle with depression from a young age. 

'When I was a teenager or even earlier, I don't know what the catalyst was, but I closed down a little bit, and I really struggled with depression and that feeling of belonging,' she explained. 

'I didn't have my place, I guess I didn't feel like I really fitted in anywhere. 

'I didn't really properly address it until I was 17, 18. Which is when I was really unhappy, and I really needed a change.' 

Ben landed the couple a hand during his stay, including feeding their mischievous cow Moona, pictured 

George relied on the help of a local man named Franco to harvest the farmhouse's 15 beehives for their honey 

Sophie believed that moving to London would make her happy and provide her with an escape. 

But she found it hard to keep up with the fast-paced city life.  

'Maybe I didn't realise how much stress it was putting on my body as well. When I was at university, I pretty much didn't menstruate, like at all,' she told Ben. 

'The doctor basically said, ""I can't see anything wrong with you, maybe you just don't ovulate, If you want to have a baby, just come back when you're ready and I'll give you some drugs."" Which was really, really gutting, and I felt very let down and disappointed,' she added. 

Referencing her children, she joked to Ben that it looks she is is now 'apparently very fertile.' 

The father-of-two treated Ben to homemade pizza made with ingredients the family have grown in their own garden 

Ben noted that the couple had found contentment and happiness on the farm, instead of being faced with non-stop work 

George said he had always been attracted to the the self-sufficient lifestyle, and moved to the farm aged 18 

She also revealed how she felt like she had found where she belonged when she arrived at the farm. 

She told Ben she fell in love with the place before she fell in love with George.  

'When I came here, it was like, ""Okay, this is it. This is what I always wanted to do, but didn't know existed. It's given me my sense of belonging,' she said. 

Ben reflected on Sophie's confessions later in the episode, saying: 'She was looking for a place where she could be free and by doing so, she was able to open her heart, and lo and behold, there's George.

'She has finally found happiness and contentment here.' 

The couple are working to renovate the farmhouse, where they hold camping events to make money 

George, who grew up in Norwich, admitted he didn't find what he was learning in school relatable, and dropped out after his GCSEs. 

'I was unsatisfied, I'm not an academic person, really. I found it very frustrating,' he said. 

He had developed a strong interest in self-sufficiency after reading about it in a book, and was aching to try it for himself. 

The father-of-two inherited the farmhouse from his own father, and moved there when he was 18.

'I consciously made the decision to come here with an aim, with a goal, with a purpose,' he told Ben. 

'I remember wanting to sit in a dark house with no electricity and feel the house and feel the loneliness. I wanted to push my comfort zone away.' 

The farm dates back to 800 years ago, and George inherited it from his father, moving there from the UK aged 18 

The father-of-two said he would be fine in his children decide to move to a city and become lawyers 

In order to make money, George began to organise camping events around the farmhouse, but soon realised he needed money, and started to take it volunteers to help renovate his dwellings. 

That how he met Sophie, who had left the UK to travel the world in order to find a place where she belonged. 

Since meeting and becoming parents, the couple have been renovating the farmhouse's main building, where their two children sleep in the master bedroom, and they bunk down in the hallway. 

Sophie and George revealed the place looked like a squat when they started living there. 

They told the presenter how they furnished their house with a lot of recycled items, and furniture they found 'at the side of the road,' with Sophie noting practicality came first and aesthetics came second.  

Sophie said she struggled with depression in the UK and that her body was impacted by the stress of her London life 

The couple have a cow, Moona, whose manure they use as compost to expand their kitchen garden 

'We lived here for years without any lights,' she told Ben, revealing how the couple would use camping lights hooked to the walls to navigate the house.

The family rely on a wood burner for heat and hot water, and get energy from solar panels, thanks to the sunny weather.  

They revealed their kitchen garden also allows them to reduce expenses, meaning they roughly spend 500 euros (£440) on necessities such as gas for cooking and food for their animals, including their cow, Moona. 

The couple and their two children welcomed Ben into their lives for the show, revealing the challenge they face every day 

While she is passionate about her and George's lifestyle, Sophie admitted to Ben she doesn't believe it's possible to be 100 per cent self-sufficient, because you have to rely on other people for things such as gas, however, she said the couple tried to be as self-sufficient as they possibly could using their own space. 

That was in spite of setbacks, including their cow Moona breaking into their garden during filming and helping herself to several crops the family was hoping to feed themselves on.  

The foundations of the farmhouse date back to 800 years ago, and the couple are keen to maintain and renovate all the farmhouse's neighbouring buildings. 

The couple are perfectly content with their life on the farm, and rely on the help of a local named Franco, who lives an hour away, to keep beehives and sell their honey to make extra cash. 

Franco, who visited the farm while Ben was there, shared his thoughts on the couple with New Lives in the Wild, saying: 'When I first saw him, George was a beautiful person, reflective. It's not easy, the call of the city with all the comforts, and services can be tempting, but he decided to live a different adventure.

'Sophie is a very beautiful person, inside and out. I've always thought that, for a woman, having children in this place is really courageous. In my experience, spending time up here is extremely formative, for the children. Also you learn to have a balance,' he told Ben. 

'I think that this land found the right people. They took this house when it was falling apart and they managed to maintain it which allowed them to live, it's a success,' he added. 

Ben was impressed by the young couple's determination, though it left him wondering how they could juggle their young family with this monumental work. 

George and Sophie make sure to include their two children under six in all the activities they undertake around the house, from fixing the roof to minding the garden. 

At the time of the visit, George was also working on fixing up a track leading to a neighbouring road so that it would be easier for the couple to access civilisation, especially for taking their children to school. 

George and Sophie are aware that Kayo and India will have to get to know the outside world in order to adapt. 

'We're not anti-society, if we're to home school and that in however many years, the kids are released into the world, they need to know how to deal with that,' Sophie said. 

'If they decide to leave and go to Milan and be a lawyer, that's their choice, of course,' George added.  

'We are at the beginning of our journey, there is so much that we don't know and that we can learn and it would be amazing to go deeper into that and learn our skills and do that with other people and the children of course,' Sophie told Ben. 

The mother-of-two added that she believed it's not by chance that she and George met. 

'It's not chance, what we're doing right now feels like we could do this forever,' she told Ben, while George added the couple felt 'privileged and grateful' to be able to live their life in this way.

Could rewilding animals turn Britain into a modern day JURASSIC PARK? How beavers, bison and wild boar could wreak havoc if they break free - and could even become DEADLY

Love it or hate it, rewilding is coming to the countryside near you.

Beavers have been reintroduced to the UK since 2008 in a bid to restore natural environments, with the latest colony due to be set up in the London Borough of Ealing.

Likewise, wild boar are already loose in the Forest of Dean, and four wild bison were released near Canterbury in Kent last year as part of a £1.1 million rewilding project.

Some hope that the creatures will help restore biodiversity and control invasive plant life in these areas.

But not everyone is thrilled about their new neighbours and, here, MailOnline takes a look at why some see the reintroduction of these creatures as 'dangerous'.

Four wild bison were released near Caterbury last year. Pictured: Rangers open a gate to allow one of the bison to walk into its new enclosure as part of a £1.1m project

Beavers have been reintroduced to the UK since 2008 in a bid to restore natural environments, with the latest colony due to be set up in the London Borough of Ealing 

The environment forum chair of the National Farmers' Union (NFU), Richard Bramley told MailOnline: 'Both [wild boar and bison] are classed as dangerous wild animals and there's a reason for that - because they are dangerous.

'There are escapee wild boar in parts of south England and the Forest of Dean, they have been known to cause road accidents and they are known to be aggressive if cornered.

'There's an enclosure of bison down in Kent, and I'm told they are even more dangerous animals, so really the thought of these roaming wild across the plains of wherever just doesn't seem feasible. 

'There's often a focus on these large iconic species, which end up absorbing a lot of bandwidth.

'It sounds like a good idea but, when you really think about it, it's not a good idea. You're absorbing time and effort from good ideas.

'There are other species we can reintroduce with success that can be celebrated and have low impact, like the large blue butterfly.'

Wild boar are not naturally aggressive, but have been known to become territorial and confrontational if people, or dogs, get too close

WHAT IS REWILDING?

Rewilding aims to return land to a more natural state - by allowing nature to take its course.

Activists and plans call for rewilding to be encouraged in order to save essential areas and species.  

One site, called Rewilding Europe, calls it giving nature a 'helping hand'. 

Their site reads: 'We can give it a helping hand by creating the right conditions - by removing dykes and dams to free up rivers, by stopping active management of wildlife populations, by allowing natural forest regeneration, and by reintroducing species that have disappeared as a result of man's actions.

'Then we should step back and let nature manage itself.'

Plans include introducing long-gone or valuable keystone species to a region and preserving natural order. 

Why are they being rewilded? 

Bison are currently considered a dangerous animal under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976, and a license is required to keep them.

They grow to about 6 feet tall and can weigh up to 2,200 lbs (1,000 kg).

They are known as 'eco-system engineers', creating muddy ponds, pushing down trees and disturbing the soil to help plants and other animals thrive.

Their natural behaviour - grazing, felling trees, eating bark and taking dust baths - creates new spaces for other wildlife.

This is why three of them have been reintroduced, currently inside an enclosure in West Blean and Thornden Woods, and have since produced a calf.

It is hoped that they will help restore complex habitats be more able to cope with climate change, and store more carbon in woodland to reduce the emissions driving up temperatures.

Why could they be dangerous?

In guidance provided by the Scottish government for keeping bison as livestock, it says that they can 'move more quickly than most horses' and break fences.

It is also recommended that keepers do not enter their bison enclosure, but 'slow movement' is required if they must, to prevent a stampede. 

Equally, a 2018 study found that the animals only manifest aggression in response to prolonged disturbance at close range.

While being described as peaceful, bison rangers at Blean Woods have warned of the care they must take to stay safe doing their job.

'Sometimes they'll bob their head up and down when you get too close. We know to just sort of back off,' ranger Tom Gibbs told Wired.

While bison became extinct in Britain at the end of the last Ice Age 10,000 years ago, approximately 30,000 live freely in national parks and wildlife refuges in the US.

Accidents do happen, and last year a British gap year student was paralysed after she was gored and tossed 15 feet in the air in South Dakota.

In Yellowstone National Park, where there are about 5,900 bison, there are warning signs instructing visitors to stay at least 25-yards away to prevent incidents like this.

A 2019 study found that approximately eight people die from a bison attack every year in the US, and tens of thousands more are injured.

But do they really pose a threat? 

Paul Whitfield, director of the Wildwood Trust which is leading the Kent rewilding project, maintains that the bison present no danger, providing the public act sensibly.

'It's exactly the same as taking your dog for a walk across a farm,' he told The Spectator.

'If you've got a field full of bullocks and you take a dog off the lead, you're an idiot. About four or five people are killed by cattle each year in Britain. 

'Dog walkers are able to stroll through bison sanctuaries in the Netherlands and so far there haven't been any deaths.'

Indeed, in 2007, a bison rewilding project was initiated in the Kraansvlak nature reserve in the Netherlands, and there are now approximately 40 of them.

So far there have been no incidents, despite the public being able to stroll through unaccompanied.

Wild boar

Why are they being rewilded? 

There are also concerns about the comeback of wild boar in the UK, a species that was hunted to extinction more than 300 years ago.

A population reappeared in the woodlands near Ross-on-Wye in the 1990s after they escaped from a farm.

They eventually merged with another group of boar that had being illegally released in 2004, and established themselves in the Forest of Dean.

The forest is now the largest breeding ground in the country, though groups of wild boar are springing up across Britain including in Kent, Devon and Dorset.

Wild boar are large animals that can weigh up to 220 lbs - heavier than the average man - and stand around 2.6 feet tall at the shoulder, the same height as a Great Dane.

They can also run up to 30mph and and jump 6 feet into the air. 

Many see their reintroducton as a positive, as they can help to restore natural ecosystems and promote biodiversity.

Their rooting and foraging behaviour can create areas of disturbed soil that can be colonised by certain plants and provide habitat for insects and small mammals.

There are also concerns about the comeback of wild boar in the UK (pictured), a species that was hunted to extinction more than 300 years ago

Why could they be dangerous?

In 2018, one man had his finger bitten off by a wild boar, and three years prior a driver died after crashing into one on the motorway.

But incidents like this are more frequent elsewhere in Europe, where boar are in the millions rather than thousands.

The feral hogs don't discriminate either, with pop star Shakira falling victim to an attack by two of them in Barcelona, Spain in 2021. 

Last year, several districts in Rome, Italy enforced an 8.30pm curfew for residents, such was the severity of their danger at night.

But do they really pose a threat? 

Wild boar are not naturally aggressive, but have been known to become territorial and confrontational if people, or dogs, get too close.

Spaniel breeder Pepi Barrington, who lives near Lydney estate in the Forest of Dean, had two of her dogs attacked by a lone male boar in 2010.

She told The Guardian in 2012: 'I'd just gone over a stile and all of a sudden this boar appeared from nowhere and shot past me. 

'That's all I saw - this huge thing hurtling past with tusks. He went after two of the dogs - one of the Irish water spaniel bitches and the labrador. 

'The spaniel turned round to look at me and the boar took a huge chunk out of her rear end. It got the labrador as well.'

She now puts bells on her dogs' collars while she walks them, adding that some of the community who use the forest find the boar 'quite dangerous'.

Most complaints regarding the boar relate to the damage they do to crops, gardens and meadows, rather than any physical threat.

The Forest of Dean boar have been spotted wandering into nearby towns and villages on refuse collection days to scavenge for food scraps, and have dug up graveyards and playing fields.

Forestry England has been culling the animals since 2008 to help manage the population by stepping 'into the absent role of the natural predator'.

This is one of the reasons why activists are against reintroducing species in the UK.

Beavers DO reduce flooding and boost wildlife, say scientists - READ MORE HERE 

Beavers living wild on an English river have successfully reduced the risk of flooding and boosted wildlife, a five-year trial has found

Beavers

Why are they being rewilded? 

Beavers were once widespread, but were hunted to extinction in Britain in the 16th century for their fur, glands and meat.

They are now found living in the wild on a number of rivers in Scotland and England through official trials and illegal releases or escapes, and have also been introduced into enclosures in a number of English counties.

Last year, the Environment Department (Defra) followed the Scottish Government's lead and gave beavers legal protection as a native species in England, although conservationists are still waiting on a strategy for supporting their return to the country.

There is a growing body of evidence from reintroduction sites that beaver dams slow the passage of water through landscapes, cutting flood risk downstream and also conserving water in times of drought.

The new wetlands they create can become havens for other wildlife, including dozens of bird and insect species.

Why could they be dangerous? 

Beavers are about the same size as a medium dog, so do not pose much of a threat towards humans, although their bite can do some serious damage.

Mr Bramley told MailOnline: 'In particular places, beavers are known to be able to do an awful lot of good, but the issue with beavers, a bit like any animal, is, if successful, they will breed.

'Breeding animals will start to spread and will end up in areas where there is very likely to be conflict.

'Quite often with something like a beaver, there's a lot of enthusiasm for them from those who are not impacted by them.

'But if you're on the wrong end of one and you're on your own, you're not going to find them endearing at all. It could be a very stressful experience.'

Beavers have reappeared in Britain due to illegal releases and official reintroduction in enclosures, and up to 800 are now thought to be living wild on our rivers

Most concerns around their rewilding relate to flood and tree damage, thanks to their dams and aforementioned sharp teeth.

Mr Bramley told MailOnline: 'Their role in life is to slow water down, and we have a lot of areas where we need water to move, some of that can be habitats.

'Damming can cause flooding, and they burrow as well, quite far underground, which can cause issues for embankments and reservoirs.

'Killing trees and eating trees, if they happen to be near a footpath or road, they can be another danger.'

Farmer John Lewis-Stempel wrote for Unherd: 'When a dam built by humans floods a village, we protest. 

'But when a beavers' dam causes flooding, we call it a biodiverse wetland paradise. 

'Yet it is no less destructive, of both infrastructure and agricultural land.'

In 2021, Martin Kennedy, the president of the National Farmers Union, Scotland, told the New York Times that flooding caused by beaver dams destroyed about £25,000 worth of vegetables.  

But do they really pose a threat? 

Any danger that could be brought on by beavers is unlikely to impact humans, but potentially other flora and fauna.

Mr Lewis-Stempel claims that the rodents could damage trees and disrupt river ecosystems by creating areas of stagnant water.

He said: 'Conservationists concerned about our dwindling, fragile numbers of wild trout and salmon - now at their lowest levels since records began and 'reaching crisis point' - have gnawing fears about beaver dams, which are barriers to piscatorial migration.'

The Directors of the Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics, Professor Andrew Linzey and Dr Clair Linzey, also warn that the reintroduction of species will breed out of control and end having to be shot or snared.

They argue in the Journal of Animal Ethics: 'It is ethically questionable to reintroduce species unless humans are now prepared to tolerate them.

'The question has to be asked: what good does it do to the released animals if one is only setting up new conflicts between the animals and humans whereby the animals will always be the losers?'

Commenting on the reintroduction of beavers into Scotland since 2009, they say: 'The beaver population has steadily increased, such that now NatureScot, the Scottish Government's nature agency, says the beavers are causing ""problems"" and ""pose a risk of serious damage to farmland.""

'Thus, despite beavers becoming a European Protected Species in 2019, by summer 2021 NatureScot issued licenses to kill beavers, and over 200 have reportedly been killed. 

'This is but one example of what we forecast would happen, namely, the snaring, shooting, or poisoning of reintroduced species.'

Farmer John Lewis-Stempel claims that the beavers could damage trees. Pictured: Tree damage in a garden in Pembrokeshire, Wales as a result of beavers chewing the trunks

Despite the concerns, the rewilding of these creatures has brought many benefits. Beavers helped to fight the drought in the UK last summer by building dams that maintain wetland areas. Pictured: An area of wetland in East Devon is green and hydrated thanks to dams built by beavers. This is compared to the dried up fields immediately surrounding it

Beavers and their dam networks do come with some drawbacks, as some areas are completely submerged in water. This means that farmers may be unable to use some of their land for livestock grazing

What are the benefits of rewilding? 

Despite the concerns, the rewilding of these creatures has brought many benefits.

Beavers helped to fight the drought in the UK last summer by building dams that maintain wetland areas.

They enjoy deeper water, so when they notice their habitat is getting too dry they get to work damming, creating ponds and excavating waterways.

This helps areas become more resilient to climate change by cooling the surrounding lands and air, as well as through flood prevention.

A recent study also found that restoring biodiversity in urban areas could boost wildlife and buffer city dwellers from the impacts of climate change, like heatwaves, forest fires and flooding.

'Giving nature freer rein across our cities could not only help to buffer them against extreme climatic events such as storms, floods and heat waves, by helping to cool them down and create natural flood defences, but also help boost urban wildlife via habitat creation,' said Dr Nathalie Pettorelli, climate and biodiversity expert with the Zoological Society of London.

HOW DO BEAVERS MAKE LANDSCAPES MORE RESILIENT TO CLIMATE CHANGE? 

Beavers build dams that create series of ponds connected by waterways.

The resulting wetlands help strengthen environments against climate change in a number of ways;

Vegetarian alternatives could replace a third of the meat we eat by 2040 - preventing 300 million animals from being raised on factory farms and slaughtered, study finds

Alternative protein foods could replace up to a third of the meat we eat by 2040, according to a new study.

A switch from meat to other protein-rich products could prevent more than 300 million animals being raised in factory farms and slaughtered annually.

But the growth of 'alternative proteins' - which include plant-based, lab-grown and fermented ingredients such as Quorn - is hugely uncertain and unpredictable, with estimates of its future market share ranging from 3 per cent to 70 per cent.

The research on the alternative meat takeover has been carried out by the Social Market Foundation think tank and funded by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA).

It was based on interviews with 10 experts within the food sector.

Alternative protein foods, including lab-grown, plant-based, and fermented ingredients, could replace up to a third of the meat we eat by 2040

The future market share of alternative proteins, which includes popular brands such as Quorn, is unpredictable, with estimates of its future market share ranging from 3 per cent to 70 per cent

Britain has the second-highest sales and third-highest per person spending on alternative proteins in Europe.

But the industry's expansion depends on producers refining their products and making them cheaper, the study concludes.

Government policy to streamline regulation, making it quicker and easier to put new products on the shelves, would make a 'very significant difference', experts concluded.

The Good Food Institute estimates that it will cost £78million a year in investment for the UK to compete with countries like Denmark, the Netherlands and Canada, which are seeking to become 'alternative protein superpowers'.

Previous SMF research found that 58 per cent of people have taken steps to eliminate or reduce their own meat consumption.

Meanwhile, a significant portion of people were dissatisfied with the current meat alternatives on offer.

Aveek Bhattacharya, SMF Interim Director, said: 'The potential benefits of alternative proteins are enormous - producing tasty, nutritious and cheap food, without the horrendous costs to animal welfare and to the planet that factory farming currently involves. Whether it can fully deliver on that promise remains uncertain, but that is almost always the case with exciting new technologies.

'Plant-based alternatives have already gained a good foothold in many people's diets, but they need refinement and improvement if they are to fundamentally disrupt the meat industry.'

He added: 'The Government should ensure regulation does not smother the industry, and can support it with judicious investment. If successful, hundreds of millions of animal lives can be saved, and we will be that much closer to meeting our environmental obligations.'

Gemma Hope, Assistant Director of Policy, Advocacy and Evidence at RSPCA, said: 'We ultimately want to see an end to intensive farming and alternative proteins offer huge opportunities to move towards this and change the lives of animals. We know that alternative proteins are better for the planet, can be better for our health and they are better for animals but we need government and industry to have the will to invest and support development of this market to make these changes a reality.'

Last year a Food Standards Agency report said the UK was seeing a growth in alternative protein products to replace beef, lamb, pork, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy.

The products come in four main categories:

But the report said there were issues with health benefits, consumer popularity, scaling up production and viability.

Samantha Armytage has already revealed the new season of Farmer Wants A Wife is the most successful to date, with all five farmers finding love.

But the bubbly host has now dropped an even bigger secret: one love-struck farmer is so smitten with his chosen woman that he leaves the show early to be with her.

'This season, for the first time ever, all our farmers find love, and the surprises keep coming,' Sam, 46, told 7Life.

'One of our farmers falls in love before the show even finishes. It's a huge week of Farmer coming up.'

The farmer in question, whose identity has not been revealed, will send his other ladies home before the finale because he is certain he has found Mrs Right.

A source told Woman's Day: 'He feels like he has really found the one. There's no point wasting the others' time by stringing them along.

'The farmer feels bad about letting the other women down, but his heart is already made up.' 

While viewers will find out who the farmer is this week, it's already clear Brenton, 26, has a particularly strong connection with Sophie, 25. 

The bubbly host has now dropped an even bigger secret: one love-struck farmer is so smitten with his chosen woman that he leaves the show early to be with her

Brenton picked Sophie for his 24-hour date at the start of the season, and admitted he knew he was going to pick her before they had even met after her application piqued his interest. 

While he later went on a romantic date with Rachel, 22, and even kissed her, Brenton told Sophie she was the one he was falling in love with. 

However, the farmer also formed a connection with a new contestant, Jemma, whom he brought back to the farm after Sunday's episode. 

That episode saw the country boys thrown in a spin as ten new women were introduced into the mix.

The boys were tasked with taking two ladies each on a speed date to decide whom they connected with, before bringing them back to their farm. 

Andrew picked 37-year-old interior design director Sarah, while Brad bonded with Shelby and Brenton had a spark with Jemma.

David made a connection with 32-year-old disability support worker Alyssa while Matt picked Madelon.

Brad and Shelby's romantic boat ride ended with a kiss. 

'There is a spark there that could potentially grow into something. It's put my mind into bloody overdrive,' Brad said.

'Definitely attracted to Jemma. And she's obviously really good-looking and so genuine and just so humble,' Brenton said after braving a game of truth or dare with the 21-year-old radiology assistant.

Matt kept an open mind during his date with 22-year-old dressage rider Madelon.

'I definitely think I am surrendering to this opport2unity that Nat [Gruzlewski] has provided us,' he said.

'I think love does take a bit of time and you don't want to put any walls up and not be open to the perfect person that could be.' 

Co-host Natalie Gruzlewski (pictured) announced, 'I've done a little bit of research, and I have hand-picked ladies that I would love you to meet'

When the existing contestants saw their farmers arrive hand-in-hand with the new ladies at the country fair, jealousy flared.

While Claire was confident about her connection with Andrew, the same could not be said about some of the ladies on other farms.

Morgan described Shelby as a 'smokin' blonde bombshell' and was worried how she would compete with her.

Frankie, who hadn't yet had a date with Brenton, reached breaking point.

'Brenton is obviously really connected with Jemma on their date. To me, that says enough,' she said.

Smoke and mirrors: How world leaders from Vladimir Putin, Joseph Stalin and Saddam Hussein 'had body doubles' in bid to avoid danger, confuse the enemy and portray an image of good health

Since Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine and as rumours circulate about his declining health, the body double theories continue to stack up. 

The head of Ukrainian military intelligence, Lieutenant General Kyrylo Budanov, whose wife was poisoned in November according to Ukrainian intelligence officials, has put forward theories that the Russian president is using body doubles, alleging that the 'real' Putin has not been seen since June last year.

In August 2022, Budanov appeared on TV to claim to viewers that Putin's height and ears have changed in recent appearances.

In March, Putin was mocked by Ukraine for allegedly sending a lookalike to war-ravaged Mariupol in a high security visit. Kyiv official Anton Gerashchenko posted three images of Putin's chin and questioned whether they belonged to the same man.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov in April admitted that reports were rife about Putin's doppelgÃ¤ngers but claimed the warmonger was still 'mega-active'.

But the concept of world leaders using doubles is not a new one.

Joseph Stalin. Felix Dadaev in 2008, with the apparent approval of the Putin regime, finally came forward to tell a quite remarkable story of standing in for Stalin

For figures in power and the intelligence officials surrounding them, doubles and decoys can serve as a useful method of avoiding assassination or throwing the enemy off course. 

Putin is not even the first Russian leader reported to have used a body double. In 2008, with the apparent approval of the Putin regime, Felix Dadaev finally came forward to tell a quite remarkable story of his time standing in for Joseph Stalin.

READ MORE: Is Putin actually using a body double to avoid assassins""¦and Covid? As latest appearance sparks more claims of a doppelganger, we look at the evidence 

For a quarter of a century, Stalin dictatorially ruled the Soviet Union and transformed it into a major world power.

The Soviet dictator probably exercised more political power than any other figure in history.

He industrialised the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, forcibly collectivised its agriculture, reinforced his position by intensive police terror, helped to defeat Germany in 1941 to 45, and extended Soviet control to include a number of eastern European states.

Chief architect of Soviet totalitarianism and a skilled but incredibly ruthless organiser, he destroyed the remnants of individual freedom and failed to promote individual prosperity, yet he created an impressive military-industrial complex and led the Soviet Union into the nuclear age.

The narrow, baggy eyes and droopy moustache were unmistakable - features that terrified half the world, condemned millions to a cruel death and which even today are an instant symbol of monstrous despotism.

But despite the careful curve of the brows and the immaculate hair, pictures emerged of a lookalike who had never been the supreme leader of the Soviet Republic.

This, as the Russian public learned, was Dadaev, a dancer and juggler who, amid the desperate defence against Hitler's invading armies, was ordered to the Kremlin to work as Stalin's body double.

For more than half a century, Dadaev remained silent, fearing a death sentence should he dare to open his mouth.

But at the age of 88, he finally came forward to tell a quite remarkable story.

READ MORE: Stunned Putin double-takes as he is confronted with AI deepfake of himself that asks if he uses doppelgangers... then tells it: 'You might resemble me and speak with my voice - but there's only one me'

It takes him from the ruined streets of Grozny all the way to Yalta on the Black Sea coast for the historic three-powers showdown, where Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt fought to determine the shape of post-war Europe.

Dadaev's autobiography explains that he was one of four men employed to impersonate the supreme leader, taking his place in motorcades, at rallies, on newsreel footage and wherever - as at Yalta - Stalin feared he was in particular danger.

The Russian media was enthralled. For years, speculation about Stalin's body doubles remained just that, with the truth locked away in the KGB archives and protected by the culture of paranoia.

It is unlikely that his book, Variety Land, released in 2008, would have been published without official approval.

Brief statements from the KGB archives, the state film industry Mosfilm, and the state-run Academy of Security, Defence, Law and Order supported Dadaev's version of events.

'Even when I was young, my friends joked that I looked like Stalin,' he recalled.

'By the time my make-up and training were complete, I was like him in every way, except perhaps my ears. They were too small.'

Soviet Russian revolutionary politician and leader ruler Joseph Stalin (1879-1953) was born near Tiflis (now Tblisi) in Georgia

Trained at the personal request of Stalin, Dadaev attended rallies and meetings across Russia wearing the leader's trademark Red Army cap and heavy overcoat encrusted with medals.

He rarely had a speaking part but, in an age before television, his carefully copied appearance and mannerisms went down well.

It helped that he had trained as both an actor and illusionist.

Dadaev was born in the highlands of Dagestan and, when his family moved to Grozny, in Chechnya, he began taking ballet lessons - quite normal for a Russian boy in Soviet times.

At the age of 16, he had been offered a place in the State Singing and Dance Band of Ukraine.

But war broke out and, instead of joining a tour of Britain with the band, Dadaev was posted to a concert brigade, where he performed as a dancer, juggler and illusionist.

He was required to fight, too, and was so badly injured during the Russian liberation of Grozny in 1942 that his family was told he had been killed.

'I was one of seven ""corpses"" delivered to a hospital, but another guy and I were still alive,' he said.

That 'death' was the start of a strange double life. One evening in 1943, he was flown to a cottage near Moscow where officers from the NKVD (predecessor of the KGB) demanded that he forge a new and distinctive identity.

'I was flattered, of course - proud to look like the leader, proud to think what my friends who teased me about looking like him when I was young would say now,' he said.

Just into his 20s, Dadaev was a great deal younger than Stalin, but make-up and the strain of war meant that he could pass as a 60-year-old.

'We had all experienced so much suffering that I looked much older than I was,' he said.

He spent months in training, some of it under the eagle eye of Lavrenty Beria, Stalin's feared chief of secret police.

He watched movies of Stalin to perfect the mimicry of his movement and intonation.

Dadaev's book recalls his first terrifying attempt to play Stalin in front of the leader's comrades at the Kremlin.

'Remember, this plan was devised by the chiefs of all those frightful committees,' he said.

'There was much riding on the plan. Perhaps I did not fully understand all the responsibility.

'Everybody shivered. Even among those men at the highest level, everyone was scared. The main thing, they said, was to keep silent at the first meeting if Stalin was not in the mood for conversation.

'But if he was, to be laconic and say something to him in his own voice.

'After a sleepless night, at 9am they brought me to the Kremlin. First General Vlasik, head of Stalin's personal security, came by.

'He was stunned, then, after a pause, nodded his head approvingly. Then he studied my jacket and gown, paid attention to my slightly bent left arm and glanced at my boots.

'I was waiting with fear in case he noticed my fake grey temples.

'I had a make-up artist but he couldn't be with me all the time. So I learned to do it myself.

'But my ability to copy Stalin's manners, voice and walk was far more important.'

In 2008, General Vlasik's daughter Nadezhda Nikolayevna confirmed Dadaev's role.

'Yes, they used doubles,' she said.

'All the tricks to distract attention from the leader were invented by my father.

'He was so involved in the work, and loved Stalin so much, that he suggested fantastic ideas.'

Dadaev was talented - and lucky. Had he failed to convince Vlasik or Beria, he would almost certainly have been shot to protect the secret plan.

As it was, he was banned from seeing his relatives and bound by a non-disclosure agreement that remained in force long after Stalin died.

Dadaev met his doppelgÃ¤nger on only one occasion, in the Fifties, and even then the encounter was brief.

'He smiled and gave me an approving nod and that was it,' he recalled.

'Stalin had four doubles in all. He was very afraid of attempts on his life.

'Spies surrounded him and every trip was thoroughly planned. For example, doubles were often substituted for him on the way to the airport.

'Several cars were used to distract anyone watching. I often took those trips.'

Initially, Dadaev's meetings were limited to leaving the Kremlin and driving off in Stalin's car.

He progressed to meeting party officials, and once, Dadaev stood on the mausoleum in Red Square instead of Stalin.

'It was a sportsmen's parade,' he said.

'Everyone was sure it was Stalin himself. I walked to the mausoleum with members of the government, then stood on the central dais, smiling and greeting the passing columns.

'The key thing was to get the step right. When Stalin was among his entourage, his walk was prompt and firm.

'But at receptions or meetings, he walked slowly and pensively.

'My confidence was bolstered as soon as I came out and was greeted by government members saluting me.

'We went directly to the mausoleum. I could see there were no suspicions. Yet again the KGB had pulled it off.'

Dadaev's biggest mission came as Stalin flew to Yalta for the famous conference in February 1945.

Stalin's flight was kept top secret, while a later one with Dadaev on board was publicised.

'Two flights were arranged, with one of them aimed to distract everyone's attention,' he said.

'Nobody ever wrote about it, no one knows about it. I was a decoy to draw the attention of foreign intelligence. Stalin was already in Yalta.

'But it didn't work. Two attempts were made in Yalta to kill the real Stalin. Our intelligence failed. I was back in Moscow by then.

'Seven high-ranking intelligence officers lost their posts. They were lucky to lose just that.'

Another ruthless dictator said to have made use of body doubles is former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein.

There was a point where everyone seemed to be an expert on Hussein body doubles, having read past reports that he had up to 10 at his disposal.

There were questions over whether one of them had appeared on Iraqi television, proving that the leader had survived a missile attack.

In some instances, recalling reports circulating about Putin since the start of the invasion of Ukraine, theories concentrated on his chin, ears and jowels, with members of the public worldwide transfixed by the concept of a Hussein clone.

It played into pop culture's obsession with doubles and decoys. Hussein's reported use of lookalikes often saw him portrayed in a buffoonish manner, with the dictator parodied in the 1993 film Hot Shots! Part Deux and in the wildly popular South Park franchise.

It was widely reported that the Iraqi president had several lookalikes who stood in for him occasionally at public events.

Intelligence officials had long suspected that Hussein made use of body doubles.

In September 2002, pathologist Dr. Dieter Buhmann from Homberg University in Saarland, southwest Germany, determined that there were at least three lookalikes being used in rotation, featuring in public appearances and seen shooting rifles, smoking cigars, waving and strutting.

It was suggested that the doubles rarely spoke because of Hussein's idiosyncratic lisp.

Buhmann had been asked by a German television news program to scour hundreds of archived video stills and photographs of Hussein.

Iraqi dissidents had spoken of Hussein's stand-ins previously, with tales of recruitment schemes and plastic surgery, and of training in movements and mannerisms.

Dr. Buhmann suggested that the face of a reported doppelgÃ¤nger was just a little too wide. For others, the area under the mouth was fractionally too small and low.

Buhmann said that he had made use of new technology to examine some 450 images of people purporting to be Hussein from public appearances and videos and was able to determine 'without a doubt' that he used doubles.

'The anatomical specificity of the faces is different,' Buhmann said. 'One, for example, has a very large middle face. The distance from one ear to the other is very much different to Saddam Hussein. And in another case the region under the mouth is too small and not high enough.'

Circulating Saddam Hussein theories played into pop culture's obsession with doubles and decoys. Hussein's use of lookalikes often portrayed him in a buffoonish manner

Arab press had widely reported the dictator's elaborate security precautions and said that he regularly used doubles and also would never stay in the same building for two nights in a row. Hussein was known to live in constant fear of being assassinated by his own officers.

CIA officials had said that Hussein immediately executed anyone whom he suspected of betraying him, with such measures making it very hard to source reliable intelligence on his location.

One official said: 'We might know that he was in one of several buildings in Baghdad - but then to be certain of killing him, we would have to blow them all up, which would also kill a lot of innocent people. We're reluctant to do that.'

Buhmann said he had presented his facial features comparison technique using overlays at an FBI forum in 2000, but was uncertain if the method had been adapted by US authorities.

Earlier in September of that year, a former mistress of Hussein, Parisoula Lampsos, who claimed she had been romantically involved with him for three decades, said he had a double whose face had been rendered identical through the use of plastic surgery.

She said the dictator joked about UN weapons inspectors, claiming they would never discover anything because he had moved and hidden chemical and other secret weapons prior to their visits.

Hussein denied using body doubles when he was interrogated by FBI special agents who carried out 20 formal interviews and at least five 'casual conversations' with former Iraqi dictator after his capture by US troops in December 2003, according to secret FBI reports released as the result of Freedom of Information Act requests by the National Security Archive and posted in July 2009 on the National Security Archive website.

During the interviews Hussein refuted some examples of what he viewed as myths, including his purported use of body doubles.

Instead he said that to evade his enemies he never used the telephone and travelled constantly from one dwelling to another. He described the farm where he was captured in a 'spider hole' as the same place where he took refuge after a failed 1959 coup attempt.

Hussein was notorious for being a figure who would stop at nothing to consolidate power, but in body double terms a scheme employed by one of his own family members received even more attention.

Latif Yahia was the body double of Saddam Hussein's son Uday for four and a half years in the late '80s and into the '90s, overcoming several assassination attempts before he escaped at the end of the Persian Gulf War.

Yahia, aged 38 at the time and living in Dublin, released a book about his experiences, entitled I Was Saddam's Son.

Yahia and Uday attended secondary school together in Baghdad, where schoolmates often mistakenly thought they were related because of their similar appearance.

Yahia claimed he was jailed and threatened with the rape of his sister before he agreed to take on a role as Uday's double.

He said that in order to carry this out he had to have teeth implants and plastic surgery on his chin.

Yahia said he was forced to watch videotapes of Uday, to study his movements and conversations, and to watch videotapes of rape and torture 'to be strong like Uday, to not care anymore, to be an animal like him'.

He was kitted out with Uday's signature black uniform and used the same barber. His family considered him dead and a funeral was held for him.

In time, this came to be true, in a way. Whereas Yahia said that as a child, 'I was so quiet, I was so soft,' the years as a double made him tough but combustible. He later underwent counselling to overcome the emotional pain resulting from those experiences.

In the 2011 film The Devil's Double, British actor Dominic Cooper played both Yahia and Uday. 

In 1983 Yahia, a lieutenant in the Iraqi army, was forced to become the double of Uday.

Yahia, who eventually managed to flee Iraq aided by the CIA, claims he stood in for Uday when addressing armed forces during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.

'It's a captivating idea,' Cooper said of the film's storyline. 'The thought that a basically good man has to live every day with someone so hideous, and that he has no choice in the matter.'

Much of The Devil's Double is based on Yahia's autobiography, which gained little attention prior to the invasion of Iraq in 2003, but has since sold more than 6.7 million worldwide.

Twenty years after he escaped Iraq, Yahia said he was still affected by his experiences.

'I still have nightmares, still find it hard to get to sleep until the early hours of the morning,' Yahia said.

'Every time I go into the shower, I see the physical scars on my body and think: ""Why did this happen to me?'''

Uday Hussein was seen as an international playboy, but he was also infamous for his abduction, rape and murdering of young women, and for his torturing and killing of opponents.

He even had a falling out with Saddam Hussein after he killed the Iraqi leader's personal valet at a party, as depicted in The Devil's Double. But several of the real-life events detailed in the book were left out of the film.

Yahia said that had they been included, 'it would be a horror movie'.

'If we put in all the details, I don't think anyone would watch it,' he added.

'There are some extraordinary scenes of violence which actually took place and some of them are harrowing,' Cooper said.

Yet the Mamma Mia! star insisted they are justified in the context of the film's 'glimpse of a gangster regime'.

In 1992 Yahia was flown to Vienna after he was taken out of Iraq. He survived four assassination attempts connected to his book and moved to Ireland in 1997.

Yahia eventually chose to settle in Daingean, County Offaly, where he married an Irish woman. 

Still visibly carrying the physical scars of his ordeal that ended in 1991, he told Reuters in 2011 that he had lost his identity completely, even to the point that a death certificate was issued in his birth name.

It had taken a long time for him to get some form of that identity back.

'It take five years between psychology doctors and counselling, and yeah, the scar, you carry it with you your whole life. It's not something to forget it overnight,' said Yahia.

It was a challenge to hold onto a slither of his original identity during his time as Uday's fiday, an experience that was a terrifying one.

Yahia also had a chilling message for the Hussein family's late son.

He said: 'Just the worst thing happened to me when I get to Kuwait and I have the assassination attempt, and nearly, this is, I lost my life. I've been injured in my arm, my chest, my head - I nearly [was] killed there. But Uday, this guy I say, and I say it before again; if I see him in Hell, I'll kill him again. I can forgive anyone, except this guy.'

Cuban Revolutionary Fidel Castro was also said to have used a body double.

Lieutenant Colonel Juan Reinaldo Sanchez wrote an explosive, revelatory account of state secrets and what he personally witnessed in The Double Life of Fidel Castro, My 17 Years As Personal Bodyguard to El Lider Maximo, published in 2015.

Castro always travelled with fourteen guards spread over four vehicles and multiple weapons distributed in different cars, Sanchez said.

A doctor, a photographer and his double, Silvino Alvarez, who sat at the back of a car wearing a false beard, were in the entourage, he said.

Alvarez was used when Castro fell ill in 1983 and 1992. He was driven around Havana to lead the people to believe their leader was well.

Castro himself always had a 7.62mm Soviet Kalashnikov assault rifle, along with five clips loaded with thirty bullets each, between his feet.

Behind him, level with his right shoulder, was a 9mm Browning pistol - and more weaponry was kept with the escort and the guards, as well as in the trunk.

The author and one-time personal bodyguard had to write down details of Castro's day in notebooks, including the most trivial details, such as the vintage of the wine when a bottle was uncorked. It was an hour-by-hour detailed account of Castro's life.

When the pages were filled, the little book was tied with string, sealed with wax and sent to the presidential palace and stored for posterity.

And there, along with the notebooks, are recordings of all his important conversations. He secretly recorded everything - including bugging the rooms of foreign diplomats who visited and stayed in Havana hotels. He recorded them on video and bugged the telephone.

Sanchez was one of Castro's security guards from 1977 to 1994, accompanying him on overseas trips to meet everybody from popes to US presidents, and witnessing first hand his boss's ability to exploit Cuba as a personal fiefdom.

Recalling a typical day spent spear fishing off Cayo Piedra, he said: 'I can't describe it any other way than comparing it with the royal hunts of Louis XV in the forests around Versailles.'

Lt. Col Juan Reinaldo Sanchez, who was a personal bodyguard of Cuban leader Fidel Castro

When, in 2005 and 2006, Forbes named Castro as one of the world's richest heads of state - on a par with the Queen of England and Prince Albert of Monaco - he accused the magazine of 'infamy' in a public tirade that raged against the alleged greed of countries such as Britain and the US.

As Cuba's Chief of State, Head of Government, Prime Minister, First Secretary of the Cuban Communist Party and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, he wanted to be known as the 'Maximum Leader', not a lazy, avaricious despot.

Sanchez spent 17 years working for Castro before getting bored with the job and asking to be allowed to resign.

Castro responded by accusing him of disloyalty and jailing him for two years between 1994 and 1996.

Sanchez recalled in 2014 how he once viewed the indisputably charismatic Castro as 'a god', admitting: 'I would have died for him.'

But he later said the man he'd been brought up to admire became Cuba's 'master in the manner of a 19th-century landowner'.

'For him, wealth was above all an instrument of power, of political survival, of personal protection,' he said.

'Fidel Castro also let it be known that the revolution gave him no rest, no time for pleasure and that he ignored, indeed despised, the bourgeois concept of holidays. He lies.'

Following a decade of keeping his head down, Sanchez fled to the US as an exile in 2008.

Castro, meanwhile, handed over power to his brother, Raul, the same year, guaranteeing that in the absence of any legal opposition party in Cuba, the Castro dynasty will continue to flourish.

Sanchez portrays a man obsessed with power and money, who styled himself as a hero of the working classes while living the opulent existence of a medieval potentate.

Unlike a gilded royal, however, the Cuban leader managed to keep his life of luxury a closely guarded secret.

For that, like any good dictator, he can thank the agents of a security state every bit as oppressive as that forged by dictatorial chums in Zimbabwe, China and the old Soviet Union.

Castro indulged in a double life of grandeur while portraying himself as a humble revolutionary and vocalising his despise for the bourgeois concept of life and vacation.

He had numerous affairs and kept his mistresses a secret, along with his lavish lifestyle.

His many luxurious homes, his offices, the ghost town where guerrillas were trained, everything was a secret including all the money he siphoned from the national economy.

Castro amassed an immense personal fortune that enabled him to live like a prince, nightly drinking his whisky on the rocks or scotch over ice while being waited on.

He lived like a prince but his language was littered with profanities.

Caya Piedra, an island of unparalleled beauty in the Caribbean Sea off the southern coast of Cuba, was the secret getaway destination of Castro travelling in the only luxury yacht in the republic of Cuba.

Cuban president Fidel Castro speaks to reporters after attending the UN General Assembly meeting on September 26, 1960

Ten members of his elite personal corps escorted their leader in 55-foot-long speedboats 'all equipped with heavy machine guns and stocks of grenades, Kalashnikov AK-47 rifles, and ammunition to prepare us for any eventuality', wrote the author.

Castro travelled in his private, elegant boat, Aquarama II, entirely 'decorated in exotic wood imported from Angola,' a replica of a vessel confiscated when he overthrew Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1959.

Few Cubans knew about the yacht, or the private creek where it was moored ninety miles southeast of Havana.

Ironically he discovered the island following the failed Bay of Pigs Landing in April 1961 mounted by President Kennedy.

A landing stage was built for Castro's three vessels and a helicopter, a floating pontoon was annexed to the jetty, and a straw hut with a bar and barbeque grill was constructed to prepare all the freshly caught meals.

Most Cubans believed Castro only owned 'a modest fisherman's hut somewhere on the coast' rather than this luxury vacation home he visited every weekend when it wasn't raining.

Several Cuban ministers have stepped onshore, claims the author, along with CNN founder Ted Turner, Barbara Walters, French businessman Gerard Bourgoin the Chicken King, and Erich Honecker, one time leader of the communist German Democratic Republic, but few others.

The author swam at his side or above him carrying a pneumatic rifle that shot round-tipped arrows to warn off approaching sharks or barracudas. 

Castro owned a block of houses to guarantee the security of a building called Once in that block. The building contained a fitness room, a private basketball court (he never lost a game), a bowling alley, and an apartment that housed his mistress Celia Sanchez, who had been at the heart of the Cuban Revolution with Castro and served as his confidante and indispensable aid after meeting him in 1957.

He visited her daily until her death in 1980 and did not marry Dalia until Celia had passed.

Hidden behind high walls on a different site of five acres was Unit 160, the logistical headquarters that housed everything from fuel, telecommunications, food supplies, and car mechanics. 

There were laying hens and a flock of geese, several bulls and Holstein cows that were the subjects of Castro's genetic experiments to improve milk yields and farming.

Behind 160 was a detached house, the House of Carbonell, where Castro had many secret affairs - including with Juana Vera, aka Juanita, his English-speaking interpreter, Gladys, a Cuban airline flight attendant, and Pilar, a French-speaking interpreter - among many others.

'Thinness, much more than blondeness, was an essential criterion in Fidel's romantic choices,' Sanchez said. 

He was more interested in his mistresses than his siblings and his numerous offspring - numbering no less than nine.

In Punto Cero, Dalia was boss over the meals, the domestic schedule and the relationship Castro had with her five children.

If one of their five offspring wanted to speak with Castro, they had to go through Dalia.

But perhaps the most important example of the use of a decoy among historical figures comes from Britain's very own Bernard Montgomery.

On May 25, 1944, Field Marshal Montgomery was in the south of England planning to invade German-occupied northern France with a 1.3 million-strong army.

On the same day, the Montgomery decoy made an appearance in the British colony of Gibraltar, leading Nazi spies to inform Berlin that the invasion would take place in the south of France.

The outlandish scheme saw two Bernard Montgomerys living separate lives over the course of few weeks.

One was Britain's most celebrated soldier, a constant threat to the German army Italy and North Africa.

The other was a nine-fingered actor from Perth, who looked the spitting image of the national hero.

As the Germans frantically attempted to work out where the Allied forces invasion would strike, a doppelgÃ¤nger named M.E. Clifton James was doing his utmost to confuse them.

By the summer of 1944, the German military was thin on the ground due to a brutal war against the pressing Russians in Eastern Europe.

They were aware that a combined British and US force was preparing to establish a 'Western Front', but they did not know the location.

The Allies assessed that their daring planned invasion of Normandy in the north of France had the highest probability of being successful if the Germans had allocated their defences elsewhere.

Making use of double-agents, the Allies had tricked the Germans into believing that Norway, the south of France, the Balkans and Romania were under threat of imminent invasion.

Their fictional army in the south of England included inflatable tanks to dupe German planes.

But Montgomery's decoy proved to be their most rewarding trick.

M.E. Clifton James had been a working actor for 25 years.

James, who had grown up in Western Australia before moving to London, had joined the British Army with the aim of becoming an entertainer, but was instead drafted to the Pay Corps.

His uncanny resemblance to Field Marshal Montgomery became known through word of mouth, leading to an invitation from the film unit.

James was trained to impersonate Montgomery after being auditioned by successful Hollywood actor Lieutenant Colonel David Niven.

The crash course included mimicking Montgomery's speech patterns and his quick and unpredictable mannerisms.

James used a prosthetic finger after losing his during the First World War so that it would not give him away.

Some of the pair's lifestyle choices were also worlds apart.

Montgomery famously shunned alcohol and cigarettes, while James was known to enjoy both.

Two weeks before D-Day, James was flown on Winston Churchill's plane to Gibraltar in southern Spain.

There were no German spies active in Britain at the time, but Gibraltar was known to harbour several German agents.

It would serve as an ideal location for the decoy Montgomery and Operation Copperhead.

There he opened up at a reception at the governor-general's home for 'Plan 303', an invasion of southern France, across the country from the real landing site.

Berlin found out and the German commanders were left confused.

James then travelled to Algiers in Algeria, making several public appearances with the Allied commander in the Mediterranean.

The Germans could not understand why Britain's best general was in Africa at the perfect time for a European invasion. The foundations were now truly cemented.

The trick operation had a bigger impact than the Allies had anticipated.

Adolf Hitler fully believed that a series of diversionary attacks were set to take place across Europe.

Hitler told the Japanese ambassador Hiroshi Oshima on June 1: 'I think that diversionary actions will take place in a number of places - against Norway, Denmark, the southern part of western France, and the French Mediterranean coast.'

M.E. Clifton James dressed as British soldier Field Marshal Montgomery

When units from Great Britain, US, Canada and Free France landed in Normandy on June 6, the Nazi leader was convinced that it formed part of the bluff.

He refused to move German troops out of the Pas-de-Calais region for seven weeks, as he believed that the Normandy invasion was just a diversionary attack.

By the time he changed his mind, the Allies had made a significant advance and the Germans would be forced out of the French capital a month later. 

James found himself without work at the end of the Second World War and started to take unemployment benefits.

But he achieved fame through his 1954 memoir I Was Monty's Double, in which he detailed his role in Operation Copperhead.

Four years later, James played both himself and Montgomery in the film version, which altered aspects of the story.

Towards the end of the film, German commandos arrive by submarine to kidnap the phoney Montgomery, with a lively fight scene breaking out. The real-life version was not so dramatic.

Fury over plans to turn Welsh beauty spot into one of UK's biggest solar farms covering 334 acres - despite fears it will 'kill the ecosystem with no tangible benefit for anyone living there'

Villagers have hit out at plans to surround one of Wales' most renowned beauty spots with thousands of solar panels. 

People living in the quaint village of Bishton, east of Newport and on the boundary of the Gwent Levels beauty spot have criticised a renewable energy developer's proposals to cover at least 334 acres of land with solar panels.

UK-based JBM Solar, owned by German energy company RWE, is behind the Craig Y Perthi solar farm project, which will occupy 590 acres of land in total, with solar panels positioned to the east and west of the village.

Some residents claim they have been told they could live around 15 metres from where the panels will begin, which JBM denies, and claim they will receive 'no tangible benefit' in return. 

They have accused JBM of 'greenwashing', saying while they understand the need for renewable energy they can't stand by and watch their village transformed into a 'sea of grey panels' at the expense of the beloved beauty spot.

Resident David Fulker said: 'We are not nimbies. This isn't about our own backyard. It's about a whole area of fertile and rich land which is home to many species that is under serious threat because of our proximity to the grid hook-up, which is what all of this boils down to. This is low-hanging fruit for developers.

'Undoubtedly there will be an awful lot of landowners making an awful lot of money on the levels from this who don't really mind what happens to the land, the wildlife, or Bishton because if it all gets a little too hot they can go elsewhere.'

JBM says the power station would be able to save more than 3,180,000 tonnes of CO2 - the equivalent of planting 52 million trees. It hopes to get the solar farm past the Welsh Government's planning officials by the end of the year. 

The developer has pointed out that Bishton is just outside the boundary of the Gwent Levels area, although the village is within the area identified by the Living Levels Partnership for the Gwent Living Levels Project. 

It also said that it has been communicated throughout the consultation that there is a minimum 75m buffer from properties, and at no point have residents been told there will be a 15m buffer. 

The plans are happening against a backdrop of similar developments proposed on the levels at Magor Marsh, Redwick, and Wentlooge. 

Some of the proposed sites are located within the Llandenny and Redwick Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), including 20% of the area proposed for the Bishton power station. 

Villager Dawn Hooper added: 'While this story is about Bishton this is much bigger than us. Everyone in Bishton is interested in renewable energy and we support all of that but this is a ridiculous scale in the wrong location. You can't tackle climate change by dumping solar panels here.

'Nearby we've had a huge development in Llanwern with few solar panels. Why weren't solar panels installed on every roof there? Why haven't nearby brownfield sites, such as at Llanwern, been used for solar energy?

'Once this land is gone we can't get it back. If we don't put a stop to this the levels will end up covered and it could set a precedent for the rest of Wales. 

'I consider the levels to be the Amazon of Wales. If it's happening here I believe it could happen anywhere. By all means let's have solar power but let's do it right. If we don't get it right then the implications are huge.'

In response to Ms Hooper's claim that it will not be possible to return the land to its original state, JBM said: 'Solar farms have minimal impact on the land and sites can be completely returned to their original use at the end of the life of the project (40 years). 

'The posts that panels are mounted on impact less than 1% of the surface area of the site. We also only hold a temporary lease on the land, we do not take ownership of it, so the site will be returned back to the landowners after the 40 year period.'

Planning documents for the solar farm show the areas of the development that will be covered in solar panels in grey, surrounding the village of Bishton

Villagers say they've been told of 'mitigation' by JBM such as the planting of 89 acres of wildflower meadows and 30 acres of 'enhanced' bird habitat. 

Following a public consultation this summer JBM has increased the proposed housing buffer to 75m and upped its tree and hedgerow-planting promise from 2km to 11.3km while the company predicts the land will be able to be returned to its former state after 40 years.

The developer also says more than 95% of the land will remain usable for sheep or chicken grazing with space in between and beneath the panels. 

John Cocklin, who has lived in the village for more than 20 years, said: 'Companies promise these mitigation angles but they never seem to appear. 

'JBM has promised these meadows with picnic tables. Who would want to sit and have a picnic in the middle of a power station?'

Retired business owner Geoff Devlin said: 'There will be half a million poles in the ground and they say they'll return it as it was after 40 years, which I don't believe.

'Everyone will have their own opinion on it but to me that land won't be able to recover. The truth is that solar power stations have not been around for long enough for us to truly know whether the land can be restored but I don't have much hope.'

JBM highlighted that there are many solar farms around the world that been in operation for decades and they have been shown to improve the land across many metrics over their lifetimes. 

A report from the UK solar trade association published earlier this year shows that there were significant increases in protected species populations within solar farms compared to surrounding areas.

John Griffiths, MS for Newport East, called for a stop for 'developments in and around the levels which conflict' with work to 'better protect and enhance the levels'.

'We need a lot more renewable energy to meet the challenges of climate change, energy security, and affordability,' he added. 

'But developments have to be in the right place and properly respect environmental protections. The Gwent Levels are a tremendous asset for our local area and Wales as a whole. They are unique in their importance for nature, historic and cultural significance.

'As chair of a Welsh Government working group I and others are working to better protect and enhance the levels. 

'It is good to work with the local community, environmental groups, and local authorities to find effective ways forward including stronger safeguards in the planning system. 

'In the meantime we have to ensure there is no further development in and around the levels which conflict with this work.'

Residents have put up banners in the village in protest against the plans 

A spokeswoman for both RWE and JBM said: 'Since 2022 we have engaged in an extensive, meaningful consultation process with the local community to better understand and address the potential concerns raised. 

'Solar farms are vital to ensuring Wales meets its ambitious but crucial net zero aims, helping tackle climate change and cut energy costs for consumers.

'Biodiversity and wildlife enhancement is at the very heart of the proposals, which include more than 129 acres of new, accessible wildflower meadows, creating a vast, preserved habitat for local wildlife. 

'These new meadows, alongside an outdoor classroom and community orchard, are to be located around the village of Bishton, opening up vast green spaces that would otherwise be on private and inaccessible land.

'Recent studies have found that solar farms can greatly benefit local wildlife. 

'A recent long-term monitoring study found that green, amber, and red list bird species were all more active within solar farms when compared to a neighbouring arable farm. 

'This is likely due to the increased foraging potential of the site which unlike a monocultural arable farm would be subject to ongoing pesticide and fertiliser use.

'The creation of this high-quality grassland and wildflower meadow across the site can also improve the quality of the strata of the soil, retaining vital nutrients and minerals that would otherwise have been extracted through farming and potentially left exposed to topsoil erosion. 

'As a result of the 11.3km hedge and tree planting planned as part of this development key views of the development would be screened and likewise the water attenuation potential of the site would increase, reducing flood risk. 

'The scheme has been developed closely in conjunction with the existing multigenerational farms, using no good-quality farmland in the process, and ensuring they have a secure income to enable them to keep farming the land pastorally for years to come.'

Full scale war! Scottish locals battle plans to transform picturesque Loch Linnhe into vast salmon mega-farm

Millions of fish could be introduced into a picturesque Scottish loch to transform it into an industrial salmon farm - sparking fears it will kill wildlife and pollute the water.

The scheme to create Scotland's first semi-closed salmon farm at Loch Linnhe, near Fort William in the west of Scotland, are being slammed by locals as 'ludicrous'.

Fish farming company Loch Long Salmon is making its second attempt at an experimental fish farm after its first application was rejected at Loch Long in Argyll.

After the planning authority refused the plans for the farm - which is currently under appeal - the company is now trying to put it just three hours up the coast at Loch Linnhe instead - a beautiful stretch of water near Ben Nevis.

But the locals say it will cause 'irreversible damage' to the natural beauty of the area as the farm will require an industrial site set up on the shoreline, with an office, silos, car park and a mortality handling station.

Calling the farm an 'act of vandalism', nature-lovers are also concerned that urine from the 8,000 tonnes of fish - the equivalent weight of 11,000 live cows - will lead to the marine life dying, with one saying 'all this life will die - they don't stand a chance'.

Loch Long Salmon is proposing eight 'semi-closed' 50-metre fish pens, which would each hold thousands of fish and would need a large shoreside installation running 24 hours a day.

The new farms differ from the standard open-net farms in that a bag separates the salmon from the sea. Water is pumped in from below the pen, and solid waste, which gathers at its base, is collected, brought ashore and treated.

It says this method of farming excludes sea-lice, catches organic waste and improves the 'health and welfare of the farmed stock'.

Scottish salmon farming is suffering massive mortalities - with 17 million last year - and some hope this new method is the solution. 

In 2021, the company applied for permission for the farm to be at Loch Long, near Beinn Reithe. 

The Scottish Environmental Protection Agency granted them a permit for the farm, but the Board of Loch Lomond & The Trossachs National Park refused planning permission - stating that Loch Long Salmon 'fails to recognise the value of this nationally important landscape'.

Now the company is applying for permission to put the farm a three-hour drive away at a different loch, enraging a new band of locals, fearful their own beauty spot will become a 'test bed'.

It has run five community consultations regarding the proposal to submit a planning application for the salmon farm, but locals have banded together and say they are going to launch a petition with the Scottish Parliament to oppose it.

According to plans submitted for a scoping request into the project, the site on the shore of Loch Linnhe would include:

The initial plans say the construction phase would take place over 18 months. 

The scoping application also says the farm has the 'potential to lead to disturbance, displacement, injury or mortality of otter' and disturbance of protected mammal species.

Jane Hartnell-Beavis, a who is part of a community group opposing the farm, said the farm will damage the marine life and be 'incredibly visually intrusive'.

She told MailOnline: 'The state of fish farming all over the world is terrible and it's wrecking the environment and damaging the wild population of fish. But it's important for the economy.

'The Scottish government are trying to decide whether this technology is the solution to the problem.

'But the farm proposed for Loch Long was half the size of the one they want to put at Loch Linnhe. 

'Our loch is full of the most wonderful marine life, it's full of otters and dolphins and other wildlife. It's incredible.

'But all the crustaceans will suffer from all the pollution from the farm. Even if it collects the solid waste from the fish, all the urine will go into the water.

'Loch Linnhe is enjoyed by everyone who lives here. People go kayaking, canoeing, swimming, sailing, snorkelling... 

'You can imagine that all underneath these cages, all this life, will die. They don't stand a chance.

'These farms are incredibly visually intrusive. In order for them to function they require containers of oxygen, waste extraction, transportation...huge lorries coming through the area.

'It would have 24/7 lighting, 24/7 security. Concrete would be poured next to the shore. The normal fish farms just have a little hut but this is different.

'It's money. It's all about money and the fish but it's being done under greenwashing. 

'It's not sustainable - that's nonsense. They also say the semi-open pens will eliminate sea lice. That's not true - it alleviates it.

'These pens will have super density - they'll be packed with fish. So if a disease gets in, it'll be like covid for the fish. You've got a problem.'

Sea lice are flesh-eating lice which eat salmon alive. It's an agonising experience for the fish whose heads and bodies are covered with pain receptors. 

James Standley, a retired professional diver with 25 years of experience, lives on the boundary of the proposed site, and has raised concerns about the project's impact on the loch's wildlife and surrounding community.

He said: 'The damage this fish farm would have on the area would be irreversible.

'We've only got one shot at protecting Scotland's natural beauty, so to pave over it would be an act of vandalism.

'Coming from a background of diving, it's really worrying to think of the impact this could have on our wildlife. I've seen basking sharks in the loch - yet I could soon be swimming next to 50 metre fish pens. 

'I've watched the volume of marine life diminish over the years and projects like this play a massive part in that.

'My neighbours and I bought our homes to be close to the outdoors, so we could nip down to the loch for a dip and enjoy the view with our morning coffee. Just like that, we could lose all of it.'

Local angler David Gunn, has fished the waters for 61 years. He fears a fish farm could kill off the area's wild Atlantic Salmon population

He said: 'Without a doubt, fish farms have had a huge impact on the declining numbers of wild salmon in our waters, and it is a problem that has been exacerbated on the west coast of Scotland.

'This has always been a good area for wild salmon, and there was even a surplus in Loch Linnhe - but since the advent of salmon farms, the wild salmon population has declined by 95 per cent and so many salmon in Loch Linnhe's rivers are now extinct.

'The level of excrement that will be dumped in the loch is frightening. 

'Loch Long Salmon is effectively proposing eight massive fish farms - and while they say they can capture some of this waste - the majority of it will settle on the loch bed and will filter on the shellfish and make its way into the food chain, restaurants aren't going to want to put that on their menus.

'Everywhere this new technology has been tested so far has been at a much smaller scale and it hasn't worked effectively.

'To go straight into something at such a huge scale is an enormous gamble in an area of outstanding natural beauty - we don't want to be used as a test bed.'

The loch is popular with wild swimmers. Charlotte Parkin has been swimming there for five years and feels a new mega farm would ruin the area's natural beauty.

She said: 'It is incredibly peaceful and you get a real sense of euphoria while swimming in the loch. 

'There is a huge number of people that use the loch and it is not uncommon to have 30 people by the beach on a summer's night enjoying the water - it's incredibly valuable to the community.

READ MORE - Flesh-eating SEA LICE are biting people in Britain's seafront lakes as swimmers are warned to stay away 

 

'Fish farms have a major impact on the tranquillity of the loch, I have swum close to nearby fish farms and it completely spoils the serene experience. 

'Sometimes we've seen scum on the loch surface near these farms and it is enough to put anyone off swimming.'

Stocks of wild Atlantic salmon, a fish abundant within British rivers a generation ago, are in a state of collapse. Some now believe the entire future of the species is threatened.

Overall numbers are down by 70 per cent since the turn of the century, falling from around ten million to between two and three million.

In 2018, the last year for which records are available, 37,196 salmon were caught by Scotland's anglers. That has fallen from over 100,000 a decade ago, and is the lowest number since records began in the 1950s.

CEO of Long Loch Salmon, Stewart Hawthorn, said: 'I have been working in fish farming for over 35 years. Salmon is not only good for our health but it's also one of the most low-carbon proteins you can get.

'Some of the claims being made are inaccurate and wrong. There has been an eight year research project in Norway - so to say it is untested technology isn't true.

'It worked for the welfare, the health and performance of the farm. 

'The sea lice might get in but they won't reproduce because of how the farm is.

'I take comfort from the eight year research project, from visiting these systems, speaking to the people behind them and seeing them with my own eyes.

'That is why I think it is important to bring this technology to Scotland.

'The claims over an industrial site are a gross exaggeration. It is a small patch of land. 

'It's inaccurate to say it will be a huge blight - it won't be visible from the land.

'It is important to the economy in Scotland. It's not just about the tourist economy, but a mixture. This will be a good thing for Scotland.

'I'm frustrated. This is an opportunity for Scotland to bring in something used in Canada, in Norway.

'We have a climate crisis going on. And we are a small company looking to bring in in innovative technology to help.'

Racine, Wisconsin is best known for factories, farming, and an extravagant televised prom celebration.

But in 2018, Racine's suburban sprawl on the edge of Lake Michigan became a source of high caliber weapons for one of Mexico's top fentanyl trafficking gangs, the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion (CJNG).

The cartel exploited permissive federal and state-level gun control rules to buy some of the most powerful weapons available to American civilians, according to two former agents with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and two other sources, all with knowledge of the investigation.

Members of a local family, working with a cousin in Mexico, enlisted friends and relatives who bought guns on their behalf in Racine and transported them to California and south across the border, according to an indictment from Wisconsin's Eastern District Court unsealed in February.

Their clients included a hit squad reporting to CJNG leader Nemesio Oseguera, better known as 'El Mencho,' according to Chris Demlein, one of the former ATF agents.

The Racine case unlocked 'the most prolific CJNG firearms trafficking network ever discovered,' said Demlein, who until 2021 served as a senior special agent with ATF and oversaw a multi-agency arms trafficking project that coordinated dozens of investigations.

One of the men bears the insignia of the Delta hit squad that reports directly to cartel leader Nemesio Oseguera and that U.S. federal investigators say received a gun that came from the Racine gun store.

From North Carolina to Oregon, the CJNG network has reached deep into the United States to find and buy heavier, rarer firearms, Sloan and Demlein said. Far from the border cities that are the usual sources of weapons for Mexico's criminal groups, relaxed surveillance can make such weapons easier to buy in quantity, they said

The Shooters' Sports Center in Caledonia, Racine County, Wisconsin, where members of the Cobian family legally purchased .50 caliber Barrett semi-automatic rifles which were allegedly then smuggled to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) in Mexico. The gun store says it does not condone the illegal movement of firearms.

The traffickers in Racine and connected cells in two other locations bought more than $600,000 of high-end military-style firearms in under a year, internal ATF documents allege. It seemed like an unprecedented shopping spree, said Tim Sloan, the other former ATF investigator. Sloan was the first to trace a CJNG gun to Racine.

Racine was just the tip of the iceberg. The city was a key part of a CJNG firearms network that bought hundreds of guns from more than a dozen U.S. states, specializing in semi-automatic .50 caliber rifles and FN SCAR assault rifles designed for U.S. special forces, internal ATF reports obtained by Reuters allege.

ATF dubbed the Wisconsin case 'Grin and Barrett,' after Barrett, a Tennessee-based weapons maker whose powerful .50 caliber firearms were among those trafficked by the network. Now a unit of Australia's NIOA Group, Barrett did not respond to detailed requests for comment for this report.

ATF spokesperson Kristina Mastropasqua declined to comment on what she described as an open case. Mastropasqua said preventing cross-border firearms trafficking was an ATF priority and new powers had led to 250 people being charged since last year.

Commenting on this story's findings, Alejandro Celorio, legal advisor to Mexico´s foreign ministry, said those involved in the U.S. firearms business should be more careful to 'prevent their products from falling into the wrong hands.'

The Racine Mayor's Office did not respond to a request for comment.

From North Carolina to Oregon, the CJNG network reached deep into the United States to find and buy heavier, rarer firearms, Sloan and Demlein said. Far from the border cities that are the usual sources of weapons for Mexico's criminal groups, relaxed surveillance can make such weapons easier to buy in quantity, they said.

Overseeing much of the network was Mexican citizen Jesus Cisneros, according to ATF internal presentations that cited his intercepted communications with other suspects about moving .50 calibers and other firearms to Mexico. The Wisconsin indictment charged Cisneros and a local accomplice named Victor Cobian on multiple counts related to gun trafficking.

One internal ATF presentation cited more than 28 pending indictments related to the wider network. 

A spokesperson for the Eastern District of Wisconsin Attorney's Office said they could only comment on public court records, adding those records suggested Cisneros was 'the lead player' in the Wisconsin conspiracy.

Cisneros is believed to reside in Mexico, one of the sources with knowledge of the investigation said. The source requested anonymity to speak freely.

Cobian told Reuters in an interview that Cisneros was his cousin and lived in Jalisco. Cobian, who pleaded not guilty to gun-trafficking charges, denied involvement in or knowledge of the alleged trafficking scheme.

Members of the Cobian family, including Oswaldo and Elias, are accused in a federal indictment of purchasing .50 Caliber Barrett rifles that were then smuggled to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) in Mexico

Mexican law enforcement agencies did not respond to inquiries about Cisneros but did acknowledge that Mexican authorities automatically freeze the accounts of individuals sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury. Cisneros was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in February.

The indictment charged Cisneros, Cobian and six other accomplices with felonies ranging from false statements to unlicensed gun dealing and smuggling. The alleged accomplices included Cobian's sister and her fiance, who also entered not guilty pleas. A jury trial was set for May 6, 2024, court filings show.

GUN THIRTY ONE

The existence of the wider Cisneros network and Wisconsin's role in it may never have come to light had it not been for a single Barrett .50 caliber rifle picked up by police in a 2018 raid in Mexico's second-largest city, Guadalajara, the state capital of Jalisco.

Sloan, ATF's attache at the U.S. embassy in Mexico City at the time, called the weapon 'the key' to the CJNG gun pipeline.

Weighing 30 pounds, Barrett .50 calibers are used by militaries around the world for their ability to rip through armored vehicles from over a mile away. They are among the most powerful weapons civilians can buy in the United States through licensed dealers and sell for around $9,000.

In Mexico, they are popular with organized criminal groups. CJNG uses .50 calibers to defend routes through which the U.S. Justice Department says thousands of tons of fentanyl and methamphetamine are shipped to U.S. consumers.

The cartel´s highly-trained, uniformed squadrons have used the guns to down a police helicopter, to kill 13 policemen in an ambush, and in a failed hit on Mexico City´s top cop, Mexican and U.S. authorities say.

On May 21, 2018, gunmen from a CJNG hit squad known as Delta tried to kill a Jalisco government minister - who previously served as the state´s attorney general - in a brazen afternoon attack outside a Japanese restaurant near the city center.

A few weeks later, on June 9, a team of Mexican Federal Police investigating the attack gathered before dawn outside a Guadalajara cemetery, across from a two-story building used by Delta, detailed handwritten Federal Police records show.

Delta reports directly to CJNG head Oseguera, according to a cartel organization chart from Mexico´s National Guard. In 2021, a Mexican court convicted Delta gunmen for the Guadalajara attack.

Agents crept into the bright orange house through the garage. Moving upstairs, they found 36 weapons, including grenade launchers and nearly 8,000 rounds of ammunition, the police records said.

A Jalisco ballistics lab report showed 27 of the firearms were traced to the United States. It did not establish if the weapons were used in the attack.

But one of them, a Barrett .50 caliber registered as Gun #31 in the report, led investigators to Wisconsin.

SHOOTERS' SPORTS CENTER

Sloan traced the weapon to Shooters' Sports Center, a Racine gun shop, where a man called Elias Cobian picked it up on April 9, two months before the Guadalajara raid, according to ATF trace data and purchase records shown by store employees.

Two days after Elias picked up the gun, on April 11, his brother Oswaldo Cobian picked up another .50 caliber, the records show. Oswaldo picked up another one a couple of months earlier. Shooters' Sports Center declined to say how much the weapons had sold for.

The Cobian brothers are cousins of Victor Cobian. ATF investigation documents allege the cousins worked together closely to traffic weapons.

Victor's older brother, Marco Cobian, said he was surprised when he heard early in 2018 that an associate of Elias and Oswaldo was going around asking people to buy guns. Later, when Elias and Oswaldo got in trouble, it 'all made sense,' said Marco, who lives in the Racine area and works construction.

One successful recruit was Elias and Oswaldo's friend and coworker at an energy infrastructure company, a local man called Patrick Finnell.

On July 10, Finnell walked out of Shooters' Sports Center with another Barrett .50 caliber. In an interview, Finnell confirmed buying the weapon. The rifles bought by Finnell and the Cobian brothers were identified in the indictment as being picked up at the store to be trafficked into the arsenal of CJNG.

Finnell said in the interview he bought the weapon on behalf of the brothers, who he said told him the gun was going to Mexico, adding he thought 'they were full of shit.' Finnell didn't respond to follow-up interview requests.

The brothers and Finnell are not charged or named in the Wisconsin indictment, which connects the guns they picked up at Shooters' Sports Center to three unidentified co-conspirators. The brothers could not be contacted for comment. The Wisconsin Eastern District Attorney said it could not comment on individuals not named in the indictment.

Shooters' Sports Center was lucky to sell one Barrett .50 caliber in a normal year, employees said. In just six months in 2018, the crew had picked up four from the store.

In Wisconsin, licensed dealers can legally sell multiple high-caliber semi-automatic rifles to adults. 'We do not condone the illegal movement of firearms,' store owner Bernie Kupper said in an email. He said it was not unusual for people to refer friends and family to the store.

Finnell himself bought three more .50 calibers in the Racine area, the first source close to the investigation said. Finnell declined to either confirm or deny whether he bought more for the brothers, saying he would 'rather leave that to the side.'

The rash of sales of .50 calibers caught the eye of Wisconsin agents from ATF's field offices in Milwaukee, according to the first source, who requested anonymity to speak freely.

Over the next few months, the agents dug further.

QUARTER OF A MILLION GUNS

In the past three years alone, Mexican authorities have seized 300 .50 calibers, a record, according to previously unpublished data collated by the Mexican attorney general's office.

Once in Mexico, the gun's black market value increases to between $30,000 and $50,000, according to Demlein and Sloan.

The great majority of illegal guns in Mexico come from the United States, Mexican and U.S. authorities say. A 2013 University of San Diego study estimated a quarter of a million guns illegally cross the border each year.

Mexico, a country of 127 million people, has tight gun laws - and just a single gun store, located on a military base. By contrast, the United States has nearly 78,000 gun dealers - more than the combined number of McDonald's, Burger King, Subway and Wendy's franchises, according to gun-control advocates Everytown for Gun Safety.

After Mexico launched its drug war in 2006, homicides tripled. Nearly 400,000 Mexicans have been killed, increasingly with firearms. According to Mexico City's Ibero University, guns were responsible for nearly three quarters of murders last year.

Powerful weapons poured over the border after a U.S. ban on assault rifles expired in 2004, fueling an arms race between criminal groups and Mexican security forces, said Romain Le Cour, a violence researcher in Mexico.

'Cartels have become more militarized. Their firepower has shot up,' Le Cour said.

As well as tighter U.S. gun laws, Mexico needed to improve its own border security and intelligence on gun trafficking, he said. 'They need a disarmament campaign and they need to target the black market.' 

In the United States, complex gun trafficking investigations that link together cases across multiple states are relatively rare. Compared to efforts to stop drugs moving north, until recently few laws or resources were dedicated to preventing guns moving into Mexico.

Mexican officials are vocal about this disparity at a time when some Republican Party politicians are calling for the U.S. government to send troops into Mexico or drop bombs on cartels as a plank for the 2024 election campaign. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have died from opioid overdoses in recent years.

'The financial, economic and military power of the Mexican cartels comes from the United States,' said Alfredo Femat, head of the Mexican lower house of Congress foreign relations committee. U.S. guns give drug cartels the 'capacity to wage war' and Mexico pays a heavy human price, he added. Mexico expected the United States to do more to stem the flow of weapons, he said, while acknowledging Mexico should intensify its own efforts.

Mexico is suing nine major gun companies, including Barrett, for $10 billion in damages, arguing the availability of their weapons exacerbates the drug war's carnage.

The companies argued in court that Mexico failed 'to control cartel violence within its own borders.' A Boston court dismissed the case, saying federal law 'unequivocally' bars lawsuits seeking to hold gun manufacturers responsible when people use guns for their intended purpose. Mexico has appealed. Barrett did not respond to questions about the case.

The Biden administration introduced tougher sentencing for arms trafficking last year. The bill passed with the help of 14 Republican members, while 193 Republican members voted against it, in line with the party's opposition to restrictions on gun rights.

In four U.S. states along the Mexico border, federal rules adopted a decade ago to combat rampant trafficking mean gun dealers must report multiple purchases of certain high caliber rifles. In Wisconsin and many other states, there are no such requirements.

The indictment says the network also bought FN SCAR assault rifles for CJNG. Belgium's FN Herstal, which makes the gun, said it commends U.S. law enforcement for investigating illegal networks, saying its US-made firearms are only intended for the Defense Department, law enforcement 'and the most reputable authorized dealers.' FN Herstal is not mentioned in the Mexican lawsuit.

JALISCO HOMETOWN

In 1976, Victor Cobian's father, Victoriano Cobian, asked his girlfriend Maria to marry him and move to Racine from Tonaya, a small agave farming town in Jalisco, Maria said in an interview. It was already common for people from Jalisco to migrate to and from Wisconsin, first for farm work, then for better paying factory jobs.

Victor's cousins Elias and Oswaldo Cobian followed north several decades later. By then, CJNG frequently battled security forces in the area around Tonaya. The town is often described in Mexican media as a hideout for CJNG leader Oseguera.

Victoriano and Maria Cobian kept close ties to Tonaya, visiting at least once a year, often with the kids, their oldest son Marco said in an interview. Marco and Maria denied any knowledge about the alleged gun trafficking. Victoriano passed away in 2013. 

Victor Cobian, speaking on his driveway in Racine, said he was unjustly associated with alleged gun-running honcho Cisneros because of their family ties. He said he only knew Cisneros in passing, on the street during family visits to Tonaya.

VICTOR'S AGAIN

In October 2018, agents investigating the Cobian cousins got a break. Local police in Oak Creek, a city neighboring Racine, found multiple storage cases for high caliber firearms in a red dumpster at a construction site, according to the indictment and the two sources close to the investigation. The sources said they suspected the discarded cases were a sign weapons were being trafficked. Oak Creek police declined to comment.

The dumpster was near Victor's Again, a bar that Victor Cobian's parents opened in 1991 and named after him.

After the find, agents set up a pole camera facing Oswaldo Cobian's house, one of the sources close to the investigation said. Agents staked out Victor Cobian's home. They gathered bank and phone records and set up surveillance on the bar and other Cobian family member homes, the source said.

On February 28, 2019, after gathering intelligence for four months, agents saw the brothers carrying two FN SCAR assault rifles into Oswaldo's garage, both sources said.

One of the sources said agents were worried the guns would be moved to the border. They secured a search warrant in less than 24 hours, according to an internal ATF presentation.

In the parking lot of an abandoned KMart the next afternoon, around 75 agents from ATF, local police, FBI, and Homeland Security Investigations gathered. Backed by BearCat SWAT vehicles, they raided the homes of Patrick Finnell and Victor, Oswaldo and Elias Cobian, among others.

Agents recovered 52 firearms, including the two FN SCARs, one of the sources said.

No .50 caliber Barrett rifles were found. But Victor Cobian was arrested at his house with three empty Barrett cases and a conversion kit to turn weapons into fully automatic machine guns, according to the source.

Also found were two Colt 1911 pistols sporting gold-plated grips and ornately decorated with cartel insignia, the presentation showed.

Victor said the conversion kit wasn't his. He said he embellished the pistols in homage to his home state of Jalisco and his love of gangster TV shows.

One of the pistols, the presentation showed, was engraved with San Judas Tadeo, a saint popular with Mexican narcotraffickers. The other was inlaid with a gold 50-peso coin, similar to coins stolen during a heist of Mexico's Central bank in 2019. Carved below the coin were the letters 'CJNG.'

JANA HOCKING: I've learnt the 'gross' secret to sniffing out a sexy single man - and it explains why I keep falling for tradies, farmers and gym junkies

I have a confession""¦ I kinda get turned on by a bloke's BO. 

I know it sounds gross, but once upon a time I dated a tradie and I couldn't get enough of his 'fresh from a day's work' scent. 

If I had to describe his aroma, I would say it was one part sweat, one part engine oil, and just a hint of Lynx deodorant. I think I subconsciously found it very alpha-like. Here was a man who had been using his body to physically earn an income, and all I wanted to do was rip his clothes off.

I felt a very similar attraction to a farmer I dated a few years ago. Sure he looked cute after a shower, but give me the bloke who had just walked in the door after moving 200 sheep to another paddock and fixed a couple of fences over the other version any day. 

So am I weird? Turns out I'm definitely not.  

Jana Hocking (above) admits that she gets turned on by a bloke's BO - and she's not the only one 

In my never-ending quest to try and figure out men and there funny ways, I've managed to stumble across a new study that reveals a lot about these strange and mysterious creatures - and my attraction to BO.  

An online scientific journal called Frontiers in Psychology has discovered that single men give off a different - and more powerful - scent to males in relationships. Yep, and it turns out we women can sniff them out.

'How?' I hear you shout. Well, it's actually pretty darn simple, you look for the one with the stinkiest BO.  

According to science, men who are single have more testosterone because they are in competition for a partner. Therefore, single men have more body odour. Whereas the coupled-up lads tend to have lower testosterone which allows them to maintain a bond with their beloved. So, to put it simply, they're not so stinky. Huh!

This also explains why I feel quite randy at the gym. Turns out there's testosterone flying all over the place. No wonder people choose to spend so much time there. If only that testosterone scent could be sniffed through the vast amount of gym selfies blokes put on their dating profiles. Rather then us women swiping left out of pure cringe, we might actually give them a go.

Turns out it's all about the scent, says Jana

And thankfully, I'm not the only one who thinks like this. In fact, it's very common amongst women. Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley said females who sniffed a chemical found in male sweat experienced elevated levels of an important hormone, along with higher sexual arousal, faster heart rate and other effects.

Now don't lie ladies, there's nothing hotter then snuggling up to a bloke after a romp and taking in a whiff of their body sweat. Gives me tingles just thinking about it""¦

Now on the flip side of that, men can apparently smell when women are horny. According to research from the University of Kent men can actually distinguish between the scent of a woman who is turned on and one who is 'not in the mood'. As an added bonus, the findings suggest that men are more attracted to women who smell horny. Seriously, when the guys took a sniff of the samples of horny women's sweat it literally made them aroused.

If only that testosterone scent could be sniffed through the vast amount of gym selfies blokes put on their dating profiles, says Jana 

Umm""¦ should I start bottling up my sweat when I'm horny and start using it as perfume? I could be on to a million-dollar idea here.

Now while this is all very exciting, and has got us all signing up for triathlons, let's face the facts. There are some serious deal breakers that can make that scent irrelevant.

For me, they include bad breath (seriously blokes why do you avoid the dentist?), bad manners, a dislike of dogs, and the use of baby voices (especially in the bedroom eww!). You could be the smelliest, muskiest man in the room, but hit me with a bad case of halitosis and I am out of there.

The celebrity 'class tourists'! FEMAIL reveals the VERY posh actors who portrayed characters from much less privileged backgrounds - after Emma Corrin said she wanted a 'gritty' role

The conversation around casting decisions in Hollywood has reached fever pitch in recent years, with questions over whether actors of different genders and sexualities should be permitted to portray certain characters.

And now there are also discussions over whether stars who come from the upper classes should be able to play characters from a less privileged background.

It comes as actress Jessica Barden said stars like Emma Corrin should not play characters from less privileged backgrounds than themselves, labelling it 'working class tourism.'

Jessica said she takes exception to stars like Emma, who recently said they wanted to star in a 'gritty' independent film after playing Diana in the Crown and have an 'outrageous accent' and red hair.

While Jessica was born into a working class family in Northallerton, Emma was privately educated at Woldingham School, went to Cambridge and had a father who was a businessman and a speech therapist mother.

However Emma is far from the first star to have expressed an interest in playing a role of a person in a different class. 

Here FEMAIL reveals the very posh actors who have tried their hand at portraying a person of a different social class. 

CARA DELEVINGNE 

As actress Jessica Barden criticises Emma Corrin for partaking in 'working class tourism', FEMAIL reveals the very posh actors who have taken on roles from a different class (pictured Cara Delevingne is one of the best known multi-hyphenates in Hollywood, with a successful career in modelling and acting to her name)

The 27-year-old has played a number of characters in the working class, most recently appearing in Tell It Like A Woman where she played a homeless person  

Cara Delevingne is one of the best known multi-hyphenates in Hollywood, with a successful career in modelling and acting to her name. 

In 2017, she appeared in Life In A Year as a dying woman who grew up on the wrong side of the tracks. 

The movie, penned by Jeffrey Addiss and Will Matthews, follows 17-year-old Daryn who learns his girlfriend (Delevigne) is dying and sets out to give her their entire life together, in the year she has left.

She comes from a troubled background - she was raised from the age of six by the babysitter after her drug-addict mother walked out.

And this year, she is set to take on the role of schizophrenic homeless woman in Tell It Like a Woman. 

However her background couldn't be further from the grittier roles - and her family are actually extremely well connected. 

Cara's grandmother Angela was born in 1912 in South Kensington, she was the daughter of Canadian-born British lawyer and politician Sir Hamar Greenwood and his wife, Margery Spencer.

Lord Greenwood's sister was married to Leo Amery, the politician, and Angela's maternal aunt was the stepmother of Lord Mountbatten's wife Edwina. Angela's sister married the son of the celebrated artist Philip de LÃ¡szlÃ³. 

Angela married Edward Dudley Delevingne in 1937, and the pair were together for 37 years until his death in 1974. 

Angela's son Charles was a former debs' delight. He is handsome, perma-tanned and often described as a man-about-town. 

Charles made his money in property, much of it in partnership with the late Irish charmer Ned Ryan, a barrow boy who became Princess Margaret's ""˜walker' and confidant.

He sold the family's Grade II-listed house in Belgravia for £10.5 million ""” a price unmatched by any of his neighbours.

Meanwhile Cara's mother, Pandora, is one of the Duchess of York's best buddies and her grandmother was a lady-in-waiting for Princess Margaret. 

Even though she doesn't need the money, Pandora has worked as a VIP stylist at Selfridges ""” where her value lies in her ex-directory address book. The store relies on her to bring in rich customers with good taste (many her friends) to be dressed in luxury brands.

Her list of contacts is stellar and there is talk that she helps the Duchess of Cambridge, among others, to pick clothes. Pandora is posh in her own right. She is the daughter of Sir Jocelyn Stevens, best known for his time as chairman of English Heritage.

Her mother is Stevens's first wife, Janie Sheffield, who was Princess Margaret's lady-in-waiting. She and Sir Jocelyn were a key part of Margaret's Mustique set. After the marriage ended in 1979, Sir Jocelyn Stevens embarked on a long romance with philanthropist Dame Vivien Duffield, whose father left her a £45 million fortune.

In 2005 they split, and Sir Jocelyn ""” nicknamed ""˜the Piranha' for his ferocious temper ""” went on to marry society beauty Emma Cheape, then 54 and 22 years his junior.

In 2012, Peter York, the author and social commentator, said of the Delevingne sisters: ""˜There are always girls who are slender, blonde and posh and fall into modelling, such as Jodie Kidd or Jacquetta Wheeler. 

'But in the case of the Delevingnes, there are three of them, which is all the more attention-catching.' 

The sisters were expensively schooled. First at Frances Holland School for Girls near Sloane Square, where they stood out for being particularly skinny, leggy and gorgeous even in a school full of skinny, leggy and gorgeous girls. 

Cara went to the progressive boarding school Bedales.  



HELENA BONHAM CARTER

Helena Bonham Carter, who is from a wealthy background, is known for her diverse film roles, including The Wings Of The Dove, Hamlet, Alice In Wonderland and the Harry Potter films

Most recently, she starred in the ITVX drama Nolly where she plays the late Crossroads star, Noele Gordon, a working-class girl from Essex who rose to fame in the downmarket soap opera

Helena Bonham Carter is known for her diverse film roles, including The Wings Of The Dove, Hamlet, Alice In Wonderland and the Harry Potter films.

She famously portrayed Princess Margaret in The Crown, as well as playing Queen Elizabeth in The King's Speech.

Most recently, she starred in the ITVX drama Nolly where she plays the late star, Noele Gordon.

She was a working-class girl from Essex who rose to fame in the downmarket soap opera Crossroads.

However Helena, the youngest of three children, was born into great privilege. Her father, the Honourable Raymond Bonham Carter, was a merchant banker who represented the Bank of England on the International Monetary Fund.

Helena's great-grandfather was the Liberal Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, and her grandmother, the politician and orator Lady Violet Bonham Carter, was a close confidante of Winston Churchill. Meanwhile, Helena's mother, the French-Spanish Elena Propper de Callejon, is from a long line of European noblemen. Helena was sent to the prestigious Westminster School in London, where she was close friends with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.

Last year, she was among the stars who were named by author Lipika Pelham as she said today's younger generation of A-listers is ""˜typically represented' by ""˜Eddie Redmayne, who was at Eton with Prince William', and ""˜Benedict Cumberbatch, a distant cousin of Richard III'. 

""˜In the 21st century, acting opportunities appear to have been hijacked by actors from exceptionally privileged backgrounds,' she writes in her book Passing: An Alternative History Of Identity.

There are still exceptions, but the trend is remarkable and remarked upon by those ever-rarer exceptions,' she adds. ""˜One of the few professions that has always, for centuries, been open to people from disadvantaged backgrounds is today becoming less and less diverse.'

She says actors from previous generations such as Anthony Hopkins and Julie Walters ""˜had distinctly working-class upbringings', and those ""˜from slightly better-off families' like Judi Dench and Ian McKellen ""˜were still from modest, truly middle-class origins'.

""˜While queer and non-white representation is now, very slowly, getting better, the trend seems to be the reverse when it comes to socio-economic representation,' she says, adding: ""˜Now there is no longer any social stigma attached to the acting profession, the upper-classes have sought and managed to reclaim the industry from the underprivileged.'

At a talk about her book at the Chalke Valley History Festival, sponsored by the Daily Mail, Miss Pelham highlighted Helena Bonham Carter as a further example.

She pointed to how the actress ""˜appears as whatever character she wants to appear as', including as ""˜cockney-accented barber's wife' Mrs Lovett in the film Sweeney Todd ""˜even though she comes from an upper-class background', and as upper-class in The King's Speech, in which she played Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother.

Miss Pelham, who is also a filmmaker, said Miss Bonham Carter's acting in Sweeney Todd was ""˜brilliant', but she questioned why Sir Michael Caine, who comes from a working-class background, ""˜didn't get to act upper-class roles very often'.

JAMES NORTON  

James Norton, 37, who was born in London to teacher parents, grew up in North Yorkshire. His childhood is a far cry of that from his Happy Valley character, Tommy Lee Royce 

Tommy Lee Royce is a serial rapist, drug offender and murderer who is often on the run from police, and spent time in jail during the programme

James Norton, 37, who was born in London to teacher parents, grew up in North Yorkshire.

He previously revealed he was so badly bullied at school that he's having therapy 20 years later.

The actor admitted 'it's only now' that he's 'recognising the effect' of his troubled past and 'what it's done to him'.

'I had quite a grim time,' he told the Daily Mail's Eden Confidential. 'It's only now, in my later life as an adult, that I'm recognising that effect and what it has done to me.'

After leaving school, he began  studying theology at University of Cambridge.

It was there he began starring in theatre productions, landing his first film role opposite Carey Mulligan in 2009 in An Education.

From there, he appeared in a number of small film and TV roles, including Doctor Who, before landing his break-out part in Happy Valley.

However the role couldn't have been further from his own childhood. 

Norton was acclaimed for his role as Tommy Lee Royce, the villain of the hit crime drama, which was quickly renewed for a second season.

The character is a serial rapist, drug offender and murderer who is often on the run from police, and spent time in jail during the programme.

He previously told The Journal: 'I will be forever grateful for that role. To be given the opportunity to prove myself like that was just great.

'Not just from an academic point of view, but in an emotional, embodied way. The word we always use is empathy. There's nothing more powerful than that. I'd never managed to empathise with a serial killer from any article about them, but when you're actually inhabiting them, you have to learn to love them, however abhorrent they are.'

He later appeared as Prince Andrei Bolkonsky in the BBC miniseries of Andrew Davies' production of War & Peace.

In 2019, Norton portrayed John Brooke in Greta Gerwig's film adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's novel Little Women.   

The War & Peace star has been long reported to be Daniel's successor following his outing as the spy in No Time To Die, with bookmaker Ladbrokes even temporarily suspending betting on the character. 

FLORENCE PUGH 

Florence Pugh is widely regarded as one of Britain's brightest stars in Hollywood, with a string of successful movies under her belt

However one of her early roles was in the 2016 film Fighting with My Family, where she played working class girl Saraya as she pursued her dream of becoming a wrestler 

Florence Pugh is widely regarded as one of Britain's brightest stars in Hollywood, with a string of successful movies under her belt.

And she won praise when she played the part of Saraya in the 2016 Fighting With My Family.

The character, who rocked a goth look with plenty of East Anglian attitude, was an amateur wrestler who fought under the name of ""˜Paige'.

However Saraya's own life in Norwich was a far cry from Florence's own privileged background.

Florence was plucked as a sixth-former from £30,000-a-year St Edward's school in Oxford to play pregnant schoolgirl Abbie in Carol Morley's thriller The Falling.

She went on to appear as sexually obsessed Katherine in the 2016 film Lady Macbeth, and starred alongside Anthony Hopkins in a stage adaptation of King Lear.

She took the lead role of Charlie in BBC thriller The Little Drummer Girl before starring in the horror film, Midsommar.

Her father restaurateur Clinton Pugh has previously insisted that while Florence may have grown up in a £1.2 million home, her ancestors were distinctly working-class.

Her maternal grandfather, George, worked at Grimsby docks and her maternal grandmother, Pat, was an office clerk. Clinton's mother, meanwhile, was raised in London's East End.

Clinton said he has applied solid working-class principles to creating his own very close family.

PHOEBE DYNEVOR 

Phoebe Dynevor, who shot to fame in Bridgerton, transformed into iconic ceramicist Clarice Cliff for The Colour Room

In real life, Cliff broke the glass ceiling to revolutionise the workplace during the 20th Century, and the film will see her take 'more and more dangerous risks' to bring her creations to life

Phoebe Dynevor, who shot to fame in Bridgerton, transformed into iconic ceramicist Clarice Cliff for The Colour Room.

The star played Clarice, who was a pioneering ceramic artist who became a rising star in the pottery industry in Stoke-On-Trent in the 1920s.

In real life, Cliff broke the glass ceiling to revolutionise the workplace during the 20th Century, and the film will see her take 'more and more dangerous risks' to bring her creations to life.

The artist went on to create the Art Deco 'Bizarre' range while apprenticing for renowned Art Designer Fred Ridgeway, played by David Morrissey.

Gushing about the production earlier this month, Phoebe said: 'I am so excited to be joining the cast of The Colour Room, especially in the role as one of the nation's most celebrated artists, Clarice Cliff. It's truly such an honour to take on such a remarkable character.

'The script is a beautifully written contemporary take on the 20th century, and I feel proud to be working with such a strong female team, both in front and behind the camera.'

However, Clarice's background as a working-class potter couldn't be further from Phoebe's glitzy childhood. 

She was born to Emmerdale screenwriter Tim Dynevor and actress Sally Dynevor, who is one of the nation's best known soap stars for her long-running role as Sally Webster on Coronation Street.

Phoebe grew up in Manchester, and attended the private school Cheadle Hulme School.

Despite that, Phoebe has previously said she wanted to represent the 'Northern working-class background'. 

She explained: 'My mum grew up in Oldham and was going to work at a cigarette factory till she decided to go to drama school, so there's part of me that wants to represent the Northern working-class background.'

CAREY MULLIGAN 

Carey Mulligan was born in Westminster, Central London, to Stephen, a hotel manager from Liverpool, and Nano, a college lecturer from Wales - and attended a leading Catholic school

However despite Carey's middle class background, she has played a number of roles of a decidely different class. Among them was her portrayal of Maud Watts in the 2014 film Suffragette

Carey Mulligan was born in Westminster, Central London, to Stephen, a hotel manager from Liverpool, and Nano, a college lecturer from Wales. 

Between the ages of three and eight she lived in a succession of hotels, first in Mayfair then in Germany, after her father became manager of the European arm of InterContinental Hotels.

Mulligan's parents had traditional British middle-class aspirations. When Carey was older, they sent her to Woldingham in Surrey, a leading Catholic independent school for girls. And she was expected to go to university.

However despite Carey's middle class background, she has played a number of roles of a decidely different class.

Among them was her portrayal of Maud Watts in the 2014 film Suffragette. The focus of Suffragette is on Maud (Carey Mulligan), an East End laundry worker whom writer Abi Morgan very openly admits she's made up.

Maud is an amalgam, a composite, a fiction - with a strikingly cor-blimey cockney accent. 

Sexually abused in her youth, she was a devoted but horribly overworked mother married to an initially kindly-seeming man (Ben Whishaw) who retreats into full male chauvinism at the first sign in his wife of independent female thought.

KATE BECKINSALE 

Kate Beckinsale is the stunning English actress who was born in Chiswick to parents in showbusiness, before attending the independent girls school Godolphin and Latymer School in London

in 2017, Kate took on the role of a stern, working class woman in the movie Farming (pictured) 

She is the stunning English actress who was born in Chiswick to parents in showbusiness, before attending the independent girls school Godolphin and Latymer School in London. 

But in 2017, Kate Beckinsale took on the role of a stern, working class woman in the movie Farming.

In the film, she played Ingrid, a hard-loving woman who takes huge pride in her foster children while unable to provide them with the emotional support they crave.

The film is a coming of age story about a young Nigerian boy (Damson Idris) who is sent to live with a white British family in the hope of a better future.

nstead, he becomes embroiled in gang politics and rises to become the feared leader of a white skinhead gang.

When all seems lost and he spirals into self-destruction, a kind teacher (played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw) offers him one last chance at redemption.

EMILIA CLARKE

Actress Emilia Clarke rose to fame when she starred in the hit show Game of Thrones as Daenerys Targaryen. 

However she would go on to play a number of grittier roles, including the role of drug-addict Susan Smith in the 2019 film Above Suspicion.

The character, addicted to coke, trying to escape an abusive ex and stuck in her own trailer park nightmare, is a far cry from Emilia's own upbringing in the home counties. 

She attended a number of independent schools, including Rye St Antony School in Headington and St Edward's School, Oxford, which she left in 2005.

She told Time Out: 'I went to posh boarding schools, but I wasn't the posh girl at the posh boarding schools. I was the one going: ""Wow, you guys are awesome! I really want to be you!"" and, ""Mum, can I have a Polo Ralph Lauren shirt, please?""'

Ralph Fiennes, whose full name is Ralph Nathaniel Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes, is the grandson of industrialist Sir Maurice Fiennes and cousin of Sir Ranulph Fiennes.

While is mother was a painter and novelist, his father was a farmer- turned-photographer-turned-gardener and house renovator.

He trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, which has fees up to £4,000, between 1983 and 1985. 

He has since played a host of different roles, including the part of gangster criminal Harry in In Bruges.  

He has been fiercely critical of discussions about class, and shut down conversations about the system when it is raised in interviews.

While speaking to The Telegraph in 2014, he said: 'This is so b*********. and all it is, is f""”""” England's obsession with class, and it's so depressing. And it's a media construct to run stupid articles about class this, posh actors that. 

'It's so retarded to me, the discussion. It's not true. There are parts for everyone. 

'It happens to be a couple of actors who are hitting the limelight at the moment who happen to have public school educations.

'It's depressing, it's this country's f""”""” ghastly Achilles' heel, its obsession with class.

'Good actors get work. Doesn't matter what their background. It's even a question I'm reluctant to go there on.' 

Earlier this week, Jessica shared that she feels that if she gets a script for a 'gritty' show or film, it means she is playing something being abused. 

Jessica does not think posh actors and actresses should venture into the realms of playing working class characters in shows and films.

Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture magazine, she said: 'I hate words like gritty or feisty. 

'Gritty means working class and feisty means you have an opinion. I die inside when I read them.

'I was, like, why are you allowed to talk like this? How is working class tourism still OK for posh actors?'

Jessica, who now lives in Los Angeles with husband Max Winkler, also revealed that in the acting industry, she is one of very few working class stars.

During her career, she has played roles including Pea Gibbons in Jerusalem by Jez Butterworth at London's Royal Court Theatre.

In her role, she was a drunk teen who came out from underneath a caravan worse for wear during the show. 

Her Yorkshire background is in stark contrast to Emma, who was born in Royal Tunbridge Wells.

The star was privately educated at Woldingham School, went to Cambridge and had a father who was a businessman and a speech therapist mother.

It is just 50 years since I graduated from what was then the shiny new University of York. I and a few hundred others had spent three years on a wooded campus entirely divorced from normal life. 

We had full grants and our fees were paid. I had no debts. And it was the modern world, before it existed. We did more or less exactly what we wanted, and did not do what we did not wish to.

For several reasons I did not enter fully into the spirit of things. People used to say that I and Harriet Harman were the only two York students in that era who did not smoke marijuana, but I cannot vouch for this. There may have been one or two others.

The novelist Linda Grant, who was there around the same time, described the experience of her generation leaving York as like a lorryload of baby koalas being tipped out on to an ice-floe in the Arctic and left to fend for themselves.

As somebody once said, the main purpose of a university education is to teach a man to disagree with his father, and our universities have certainly achieved that successfully

People used to say that I and Harriet Harman were the only two University of York (pictured) students in that era who did not smoke marijuana, but I cannot vouch for this. There may have been one or two others

I fended. I had been brought up (literally) in hard schools. But I am not so sure about the others. Imagine. We had to re-enter a world where laws were still more or less enforced, where people believed in respectability of many kinds, where food and rent were not subsidised and where employers expected us to turn up on time and not leave till the job was done.

More than that, they had never heard of the ""˜inclusive' opinions we had on everything, which in those days were not called that.

Banks, for instance, were highly conservative institutions and, while they hoped that we would one day bring them fat accounts, they were stand-offish about our lifestyles. No wonder so many of us devoted ourselves to turning the world upside down, so that we could go back to being free.

It was people like me who infiltrated the banks, not to mention the schools, the BBC, the law and the police and turned them into what they are today. For, as somebody once said, the main purpose of a university education is to teach a man to disagree with his father, and our universities have certainly achieved that successfully. 

I have often wondered since whether the three years I spent in that dream world might have been better spent at work, or perhaps before the mast in a sailing ship, or learning the military arts of which I now know nothing. 

I reckon I was about ready to be a university student when I turned 45, by which time it was not an option. Even at almost 19, my age on entry, I was far too young to benefit properly.

And as my older brother got to college before I did, I have never been able to make the Neil Kinnock boast that I am ""˜the first from my family to go to university'. 

Not that it is much of a claim. 

Good secondary schools, good technical and vocational colleges, good polytechnics are what this country really needs and has not got

The novelist Linda Grant, who was there around the same time, described the experience of her generation leaving York as like a lorryload of baby koalas being tipped out on to an ice-floe in the Arctic and left to fend for themselves

Mr Kinnock and my brother and I went to university in those years because a wealthy country made it easy for us to do so. It is not much more of a claim than saying you were the first in your family to wear polyester, or eat fast food.

I am not quite sure how I ended up assuming (as I must have done from around the age of 14) that I would automatically go to university. The word glittered in my mind, conjuring up a picture of stars shining in the night sky, which I still haven't quite shaken off.

The Monday morning reality in my first week was very different. In retrospect, I am grateful to them for being tactful enough to award me a degree at the end, though, typically of my generation, I never turned up to collect it, or scrambled into a mortarboard and gown, as people do nowadays.

It is not just a matter of ""˜Mickey Mouse degrees'. The whole idea of mass university education is wrong, especially now that it lures the young into debt. Universities, by definition, are for the few, who can get the most out of them - and that means a tough, highly selective education system based on merit - which we destroyed in 1965.

Good secondary schools, good technical and vocational colleges, good polytechnics are what this country really needs and has not got. 

While I think (and know from the experience of others) that the Open University is a wonderful thing, and favour all kinds of heavily subsidised access for those who later in life feel inspired to study, I think the great expansion that began in the 1960s has been a mistake. I was lucky with it. Others are not.

""˜Gollum' Tony is no moderate

Last week the Blair creature emerged from wherever he dwells to sit alongside another leathery old Marxoid, the current Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. 

Amazingly, people still think of Blair, who has done so much to ruin a prosperous and happy country, as a ""˜moderate'.

They make the same mistake about Sir Keir, a veteran ultra-radical. The resulting interaction was about as much fun as gallstones or reflux. 

WITHERED: Tony Blair speaking at the Future for Britain conference last week. Right: Gollum in Lord Of The Rings

But what struck me was how Blair is starting to look like Gollum in The Lord Of The Rings, consumed and withered by his embrace of war in Iraq, and the great tidal wave of evil released by it. 

By the way, his invasion of Iraq genuinely was unprovoked, which Russia's invasion of Ukraine was not. Why is it never referred to as such?

What is it about the BBC? Why can it not leave any good thing alone?

What is it about the BBC? Why can it not leave any good thing alone? The radio show I'm Sorry, I Haven't A Clue is famous for its wit - often subtly rude, not prudish but not lumpishly coarse either.

Under its original host Humphrey Lyttelton it was a joy. 

Last week, it broadcast an entire segment of sub-schoolboy jokes about condoms. 

A friend wrote to the BBC: ""˜I tuned into I'm Sorry, I Haven't A Clue on Monday evening while having dinner with my teenage boys - it's the end of a long term and I thought a bit of humour would jolly us along. However, I was mortified by the condom item, which went on and on and on, one explicit or coarse contribution after another.

""˜My sons were as embarrassed as I was. What's more, it wasn't particularly witty or clever, just crude. The best of I'm Sorry, I Haven't A Clue doesn't rely on a cheap and quick laugh, but on clever pun and improvisation - please don't reduce it to the former.'

I agree with her. I wonder what the chances are of her getting a thoughtful or helpful response?

At last, a grown-up verdict on inflation

Hurrah for former Bank of England chief Mervyn King, who has condemned the ""˜Left-wing' policy on inflation of his successors.

The collapse in the value of money is quite obviously the result of the mad spending of mountains of non-existent cash during the Covid Panic.

Once this had happened, our wages and savings were simply bound to shrivel. That is why I warned against it at the time, for all the good that did. Inflation is described as prices going up, but it is not. It is money shrinking. It has happened.

Hurrah for former Bank of England chief Mervyn King (pictured at Wimbledon), who has condemned the ""˜Left-wing' policy on inflation of his successors

Like a flood rolling down the Mississippi river, the resulting fall in our standard of living must be endured and cannot be stopped - though it would be wise if nobody repeated the mistake. But the idea that putting up interest rates will help is quite daft.

This policy will only make things worse, by destroying business and raising the already mad cost of housing. I am troubled by the idea that this country is, for the most part, run by teenagers.

All in all for Senegal: Self-confessed package-holiday snob Marianne Jones never dreamed of taking an all-inclusive holiday - until she tried a resort in West Africa

Self-confessed package-holiday snob Marianne Jones never dreamed of taking an all-inclusive holiday - until she tried a resort in West Africa

As I amble past one of our hotel's four swimming pools, balancing soft drinks in plastic cups, my view is interesting.

In front of me, 30 or so elderly holidaymakers are energetically attempting to keep up with a water Zumba class. The music is pounding, the bar next door is throbbing, pale skin is sizzling beneath the African sun. And it's only 10am.

At the age of 57, I've finally broken one of my holiday rules, which is right up there with never going on a cruise. I've surrendered to an all-inclusive, complete with red laminated wristband that allows me unlimited buffet food and cocktails among strangers in bikinis.

My journey to a five-star Senegalese beach resort began at the end of last year, when my husband and I became empty-nesters, our two sons having left home within a month of each other. It dawned on us that the elusive term-time winter-sun break we'd often talked about was finally doable.

We were looking for something more adventurous than Tenerife, so when I read a newspaper article naming Senegal as the new holiday hotspot, my interest was piqued. The more I researched the West African country, the more boxes it ticked. A five-and-a-half hour flight from the UK, no time difference and an average winter temperature of 25 degrees, for starters. The country is safe and has seven Unesco World Heritage sites.

The only drawback for me was the ""˜all-inclusive' bit. But with travel operator Tui recently offering its first direct flight to Senegal's capital Dakar from London Gatwick, and the opening of its competitively priced five-star Hotel Riu Baobab beach resort, I was prepared to park the holiday snobbery for a week.

Package holidays have never appealed. Most of my life I've held down busy, deadline-driven jobs so my ideal break was a remote villa where I could switch off, recharge and read a stack of books. Two words guaranteed to bring me out in hives are ""˜organised fun' - and all-inclusive holidays conjured up visions of Benny Hill crossed with It's a Knockout.

My ""˜naff' preconceptions were swiftly turned on their head. The professional meet-and-greet with drinks in the lobby was bordering on The White Lotus chic. Our third-floor room was not the no-frills cupboard I was expecting but large, spotless and tastefully decorated with wicker and wooden furnishings, king-size bed, sofa and generous balcony.

I admit to having some misgivings that first night. I felt like Bambi in a herd of experienced old hands. It seemed every occupant of the hotel's 524 rooms knew what they were doing apart from us. They could operate the interactive screens in the lobby, advertising nights with singers called Bony Bless and Jacky Groove. They had booked the popular Chinese restaurant well in advance. And they knew which way to queue for the extraordinary buffet that groaned with Senegalese stews, giant prawns, meat simply labelled ""˜pig' or ""˜cow', every salad known to man and the best coconut ice cream I've ever tasted.

After a jaw-clenching first night listening to hit songs being murdered in a karaoke session on the stage below our room we decided we could either sulk or join in. We joined in.

A welcome briefing by our holiday rep, a chirpy chappy called Chris, proved useful and we decided to intersperse our beach time with a couple of trips out. There is a wealth of experiences - from an overnight glamp in the desert to a day by Lake Retba (a vivid pink salt lake), with national parks and wetlands in between. We opted for a safari where we saw rhinos, giraffes and monkeys and learned the story of the national tree, the baobab, before our vehicle was chased by an ostrich. (""˜He likes blondes', the guide quipped.)

We were then driven in a caged jeep through a pride of lions, several of whom jumped on to the roof to eat raw meat thrown by the driver. Being inches from the amber eyes of a lioness as she leisurely crunched the bones of her lunch is as close as you'll ever want to get to these magnificent beasts.

You shouldn't go to Senegal without a trip to the Unesco World Heritage site of GorÃ©e Island, a 20-minute ferry ride from Dakar. The pretty colonial architecture of this tiny, car-free island masks its grim history as the largest slave-trading centre on the African coast. The House of Slaves, with its symbolic Door of No Return, was a horrific ""˜holding pen' for millions of African men, women and children before they were forcibly transported across the Atlantic. It is now a museum and memorial to those who suffered, with notable visitors including Nelson Mandela, Barack Obama and Pope John Paul II.

On the outskirts of Dakar we visited the 164ft-high African Renaissance Monument, a bronze landmark taller than the Statue of Liberty that cost $27 million - a controversial attraction in a country where almost half the population lives below the poverty line. The sheer height of it is staggering - next to it I look like a dot in my holiday snaps.

My journey to a five-star Senegalese beach resort began at the end of last year, when my husband and I became empty-nesters, our two sons having left home within a month of each other

During these trips we got to know some of our fellow all-inclusives, and over the days we regularly bumped into them and shared a drink. There were mates Mal and Dave, the Welsh lads, as we called them. There was Hayley and her colleague Liz, who were flight attendants and served us a coffee on our flight back. There was a lovely couple in their 50s who had gone to school together and met again years after losing their partners. And there was a charming elderly widower who had travelled the world with his wife and was now venturing out on his own. It was like inhabiting Gogglebox - everyone was from different backgrounds, with their own story, enjoying their time in the sun. None of them were first-timers, and when one couple told us that they wouldn't holiday any other way - and this year's two-week stay cost £1,100 each - we could see why the low cost, high quality and sheer ease of it could become addictive.

By the end of the week I'd embraced some of the entertainment and listened to superb drummers, bagged a regular sunbed on the beach (away from the Zumba music), watched men trot past with their horses and carts, admired the local women in their stunning print dresses and driven past a full-on goat market.

I'd also put on a few pounds from the buffet, needed a Prosecco detox and arranged to visit the elderly widower who we discovered lives nearby on the coast. As I snipped off the red bracelet, I knew there would probably be a new one on my wrist same time next year.

Sunrise host David Koch unleashes with a brutal message that every baby boomer needs to hear and busts a common housing myth

Sunrise host David Koch has explained why younger Australians have it tougher than older generations when it comes to buying a home.

The breakfast TV host analysed the financial burdens weighing on those trying to buy a home in the late 1980s against those entering the property market now.

The home loan rate in 1989 to 1990 was at 17 per cent, compared to today's six per cent variable rates.

However, Koch said Australians were much worse off in 2023 because median house prices during the pandemic boom had surged at levels well beyond wages growth.

'Back in the 80s, the average cost of an Aussie house was $70,000, now it's $700,000 - ten times more expensive,' he said.

David Koch (right) has explained why younger Australians have it tougher than older generations when it comes to buying a home 

'A 20 per cent deposit has gone from $14,000 to $140,000 but wages have not kept pace.'

Then and now: interest rates and house affordability 



1989: Interest rates hit 18.2 per cent.

Sydney's median house price was $170,850 back when $26,874 was Australia's average, full-time salary.

The 20 per cent deposit of $34,170 was barely more than a year's wage and someone paying off a $136,680 mortgage had a manageable debt-to-income ratio of 5.1.

2023: Interest rates hit 3.6 per cent.

Sydney's median house price of is $1,217,308 and a borrower needs a 20 per cent deposit of $243,461.

Someone on an average, full-time salary of $94,000 paying off a $973,846 loan would now have a very dangerous debt-to-income ratio of 10.4.

The Sunrise host and financial guru explained how in the 1980s the average salary was $19,000, compared with $94,000 in 2023.

'So in the 80s, the price of a house was four times the average person's income,' he said.

'In 2023, it's eight times the average Aussie salary.'

Australia's median house price of $753,670, based on CoreLogic data, is eight times an average, full-time salary of $94,000.

But with a 20 per cent mortgage deposit of $150,734, that debt-to-income ratio is 6.4.

This is above the banking regulator's mortgage stress threshold of 'six', proving the scourge of unaffordable housing extends well beyond Sydney and Melbourne. 

Koch said existing home loan rates were causing 'the same pain' as those trying to buy a home in the late 1980s, when baby boomers were their thirties and forties. 

'And with rates set to go higher, it has never been tougher to meet a mortgage,' he said.

'So hopefully that puts that myth aside.' 

It comes after a survey found that one in three young Australians are missing their mortgage repayments.

The Reserve Bank of Australia's 10 consecutive interest rate rises since May are biting with Finder's monthly Cost of Living report showing 31 per cent of Generation Z borrowers, born from 1995 onwards, missing a mortgage repayment during the past six months.

In 2023, Sydney's median house price of is $1,217,308 and a borrower needs a 20 per cent deposit of $243,461. Someone on an average, full-time salary of $94,000 paying off a $973,846 loan would now have a very dangerous debt-to-income ratio of 10.4 (pictured are houses at Oran Park)

By comparison, 11 per cent of Generation Y - aka Millennials - had missed a repayment, while 8 per cent of Generation X borrower were in that position.

BRISBANE: $767,781

HOBART: $699,659

CANBERRA: $946,022

'Increases in housing costs are having a higher impact on Australian households than any other metric,' the Finder report said.

'Younger generations were far more likely to report financial difficulty in managing their mortgage repayment.'

The Reserve Bank's 3.6 per cent cash rate is significantly less than the 17.5 per cent level of January 1990 when a target cash rate was introduced.

But house prices are significantly more expensive compared with incomes.

In November 1989, when interbank interest rates hit 18.2 per cent, Sydney's median house price was $170,850 back when $26,874 was Australia's average, full-time salary.

The 20 per cent deposit of $34,170 was barely more than a year's wage and someone paying off a $136,680 mortgage had a manageable debt-to-income ratio of 5.1.

In 2023, Sydney's median house price of is $1,217,308 and a borrower needs a 20 per cent deposit of $243,461.

Someone on an average, full-time salary of $94,000 paying off a $973,846 loan would now have a very dangerous debt-to-income ratio of 10.4.

The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the banking regulator, is concerned when an individual or a couple owes the bank more than six times their salary. 

Sydney house prices have plunged by 14.7 per cent during the past year but they had surged by 27.7 per cent during the pandemic, a level well beyond the 3.3 per cent annual increase in wages when Reserve Bank interest rates were at a record-low of 0.1 per cent.

Australian household debt levels make up 188 per cent of income, compared with 68 per cent during the late 1980s. 

The American Demographia think tank regards Sydney as the world's second most unaffordable city, when house prices were compared with incomes, after Hong Kong.

Melbourne was the ninth least affordable market in the world, having a median house price of $897,222, based on CoreLogic data for February 2023.

Adelaide was 14th, having a median house price of $694,653, while Brisbane was 15th, with a mid-point house price of $767,781.

Sydney was more unaffordable than Vancouver, Honolulu, San Jose, Los Angeles, Auckland and San Francisco.

Young Australians open up on their struggles to buy a home 



Mira Almasri, a 35-year-old single mother, is renting a one-bedroom apartment with her two children aged nine and 14 in Mosman on Sydney's well-heeled north shore for $600 a week.

'In Sydney everything is expensive. Even to breathe is expensive,' she said.

Ms Almasri, who works in a bridal shop in central Sydney, said she had given up all hope of owning a Sydney home.

'It's impossible to buy in Sydney,' she said.

Stephanie Zizer, 35, first got on the property ladder four years ago

'Even if you earn loads of money it's still hard. All my friends who have bought houses in the last two years say they are not happy at all because they are paying high interest rates.'

'I get around $1,000 a week after tax and I'm paying $600 for a one-bedroom apartment. Add on food, petrol, electricity - it's too much.'



Ms Almasri, who is originally from Lebanon, has not been able to return home or travel anywhere overseas for five years now.

'I can't put any money on the side,' she said.

Ms Almasri, who has been in Australia for 14 years, is looking for a three-bedroom house for herself and her two kids.

In her current unit, she sleeps on a sofa bed in the living room while her children share the sole bedroom containing two single beds.



Santos Tiwari, 35, is an entrepreneur who runs several coffee stands across Sydney and has just opened a dumpling bar in a laneway off George Street in the CBD.

Santos Tiwari (pictured) has just opened the Dumpling & Momo bar in central Sydney 

He bought a five-bedroom house in Adelaide in 2015 which he rents out for $550 dollars a week.

But he says property in his home city is absurdly priced.

'It would be nice to buy one in Sydney but not the amount you have to pay now - it's just ridiculous,' he said.

'I'd probably buy somewhere else in Australia rather than in Sydney.'

Mr Tiwari lives in a two-bedroom house with a harbour view in Gladesville, in Sydney's lower north shore, which costs $700 a week.



Jacob Burrows, 22, an electrician from Perth, Western Australia, hopes to buy a property within the next 12 months despite interest rates being at their highest since 2012.

He has done a lot of research, including reading a book about a man who owned 30 properties by the age of 30.

'It's fairly hard at the moment because everything is so expensive,' he said.

'A couple of years ago I wanted to try and understand the market to appreciate what's involved in buying a house. I spent a year or so learning the housing market and now I'm going to try to look for cheaper houses instead of buying one big one so that I can have a smaller deposit.'

Mr Burrows, who is visiting his girlfriend in Sydney, said buying property in the NSW capital was out of the question.

'It's ridiculous,' he said. 'Buying one small place here would probably get you two houses in Perth.'



Mr Burrows, who now earns $100,000 a year, went into his trade as soon as he left school at the age of 17 and is looking at places he could renovate himself.

'You don't want to over compromise,' he said. 'I took a step back and weighed up the quality of my life and I realised if I rented a smaller house I could have a better style of living, I could travel more etc.'

He hopes to enter the property market without help from his parents.

'I'd rather do it myself than having to worry about mum and dad,' he said.

Stephanie Zizer, 35, has lived in Sydney her whole life.

Mrs Zizer, who is a full-time mum to her two children, first got on the property ladder four years ago.

She and her husband, who runs a waste and recycling business, are paying off a four-bedroom house in pricey Vaucluse.

But the recent interest hikes have impacted them.

'Massively,' she said. 'There's obviously been quite a few increases and it's affecting everyone at the minute.''

Before she bought with her husband, Mrs Zizer rented in the eastern suburbs.

'It's always been expensive to live in the east but it was manageable then,' she said.



Garth Johnstone, 25, moved to Sydney from the outskirts of London three-and-a-half years ago.

Mr Johnstone works as a roofer and shares a place in Darlinghurst in the city's inner east.

'My rent is $450 a week right now but might be going up soon with all the price increases,' he said.

'Some of my mates' have already gone up to $500 a week and I've heard of some hostels where you pay $450 for a bed in an eight-man dorm.'

'It's a crazy price, especially for travellers trying to set up a life over here.'

Mr Garth, who is is training for his roof plumbing licence, is working towards permanent residency and plans to settle down in Australia.

He is saving towards buying a place within the next five years.

'The market has skyrocketed recently,' he said.

'It's pretty dreadful to live here but I don't really see myself moving to far out west but obviously there's a lot cheaper rent and more jobs as well so it might have to be done.'

Zoe Janssen, 21, is working as a paralegal in central Sydney while she completes her law degree and lives with her parents in Roseville on the north shore .

'I've got no immediate plans start renting because everything is paid for at home and I'm saving money,' she said.

When she is ready to buy, her dream location would be somewhere near the beach in Sydney.

'Really anywhere you can get at this point,' she said.

 Successful baby boomers - including Aussie Home Loans founder and top ANZ economist - admit they had easier than millennials and Gen Z ... as the young 'give up' on buying a house

Prominent baby boomers who had huge success in business have admitted they had it a lot easier than the younger generation when it comes to buying a house.

The Reserve Bank hiked interest rates for the 10th month in a row last week, prompting many older Australians to recall their own struggles, when rates hit 18 per cent in 1989.

In recent interviews with Daily Mail Australia, both Aussie Home Loans founder John Symond and AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver agreed that it was 'easier' to purchase when they were younger.

They are backed up by the data, which shows that house pries in comparison to incomes were significantly cheaper 34 years ago than in 2023 - even though the current 11-year high cash rate of 3.6 per cent is low by historical standards.

A median-priced Sydney house currently selling for $1,217,308 costs 10.4 times an average, full-time salary of $94,000, for a buyer with a 20 per cent deposit.

But in 1989, the equivalent home in Australia's most expensive capital city was priced at $170,850 - just five times the average $26,874 salary after the mortgage deposit.

John Symond, now a multimillionaire who lives in Sydney's eastern suburbs, said that while the share market flatlined after the 1987 stock market crash, real estate remained affordable in the late 1980s for the average earner.

'The '87 stock market crash caused a lot of pain for five or six years but take that away, baby boomers had it pretty good,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'Housing was more affordable, baby boomers didn't have to go to war - there was some conscription but the percentage of baby boomers who went to Vietnam is very tiny and I think the baby boomers' era was a golden era.'

Sydney's median house price in 1979 was $50,700, Macquarie University data showed. But just seven years earlier, in 1972, they were less than half that at $23,700.

Mr Symond said that despite the price surges of the 1970s, a young man of his generation could easily buy a house during an era when mortgage lending was a lot more regulated.

'I remember when I was a young articled clerk in law, the average price of a house in the 70s was around 50 grand - when I say it was easier, less people got home loans then because money wasn't a commodity like it is today where banks are borrowing offshore against their balance sheets,' he said.

Professor Allan Fels, a former head of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission who has a PhD in Economics, is slightly older than the baby boomers, being born during the war in 1942.

But the University of Melbourne professorial fellow is particularly concerned about falling home ownership rates on young people as a former chair of the National Mental Health Commission.

'We baby boomers have had it a lot easier than the new generation of young people,' he told Daily Mail Australia last year.

'They face a future of much less home ownership and associated mental health stability. The mere fact they are missing out is a cause of stress.

'The trend of rising prices adds to the stress because many used to think that they could buy their own house but they keep missing out because prices are continually rising just beyond their grasp.' 

AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver, a baby boomer, pointed out that interest rates in 2023 didn't need to rise to the very high levels of the late 1980s because houses compared with incomes are now so much higher.

'So rates shouldn't have to go up anywhere near as much as they did in the 1980s to slow spending and hence inflation,' he said.

He noted that Australia's household debt as a share of income stood at 68 per cent in the late 1980s, compared with 188 per cent now - a level that's among the world's highest.

The Reserve Bank on Tuesday raised the cash rate for a 10th straight month to an 11-year high of 3.6 per cent. The 32-year high inflation rate of 7.8 per cent is well above the central bank's 2 to 3 per cent target.

The 3.5 percentage points worth of rate hikes since May 2022 are the most severe in a short time since the RBA first published a target cash rate in January 1990.

Borrowing costs haven't risen at such a steep pace since January 1988 to November 1989.

That's when the overnight cash rate, or the rate that banks lend to each other, surged from 10.6 per cent to 18.2 per cent, during the era before the Reserve Bank made monthly announcements and set an interbank lending rate target.

Home ownership rates among the young have plunged in more recent decades as property value increases vastly outpace wages growth.

In 1981, 61.1 per cent of Australians aged 25 to 34 owned their own home with a mortgage, Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed.

But four decades later, in 2021, the rate of home ownership for those aged 25 to 39 had plunged to 43.1 per cent, even allowing for those in their late thirties.

Mira Almasri, a 35-year-old single mother, is renting a one-bedroom apartment with her two children aged nine and 14 in Mosman on Sydney's well-heeled north shore for $600 a week.

'In Sydney everything is expensive. Even to breathe is expensive,' she said.

Ms Almasri, who works in a bridal shop in central Sydney, said she had given up all hope of owning a Sydney home.

'It's impossible to buy in Sydney,' she said.

'Even if you earn loads of money it's still hard. All my friends who have bought houses in the last two years say they are not happy at all because they are paying high interest rates.'

Zoe Janssen, 21, a paralegal living with her parents at Roseville on Sydney's lower north shore, dreams of one day buying a house near the beach but is realistic about her chances.

'Really anywhere you can get at this point,' she said.

Even median Australia's home price of $702,136 is beyond the reach of an average income earner buying on their own, despite CoreLogic data showing a record 7.9 per cent fall in the year to February.

Someone earning $94,000 can only borrow $436,000 which means a $545,000 home with a mortgage deposit, Canstar calculated before the latest rate rise.

That means Sydney is out of reach, despite the median price plunging by 14.7 per cent annually.

So is Melbourne, despite an 11.2 per cent decline to $897,222 and Brisbane where prices have dropped 8.6 per cent to $767,781.
