Climate change will prompt expansion of farming in northern wilderness

As the world warms, vast areas of wilderness in Russia, Canada and Alaska will become more suitable for farming, threatening the local wildlife

Climate change is expanding the amount of land suitable for farming in colder regions. While farming such areas could offset declines in crop yields elsewhere, it would also pose a threat to wild places once protected from cultivation by the cold.

As the planet warms, researchers expect farmers will have to adapt to achieve crop yields sufficient to feed a growing global population. ""I would say that's inevitable,"" says Alexandra Gardner at the University of Exeter in the UK.

That could mean farming different crops, planting at different times, using more irrigation and fertiliser or growing in different places. One study found that with very high fossil fuel emissions, the world's bread baskets - regions responsible for producing a large proportion of our food – would need to shift toward the poles by around 600 kilometres before the end of the century to maintain current yields.

While that shift could help offset climate-related declines in yields nearer to the equator, it could also pose a threat to vast wilderness areas and the intact ecosystems they host.

Gardner and her colleagues modelled how climate change under different emissions scenarios would alter the areas appropriate for growing more than 1700 varieties of major crops, including potatoes, wheat and cotton. They then looked at where the newly suitable agricultural regions overlapped with ""wilderness"", defined as large spaces free from human pressures.

They found that under a moderate emissions scenario, 1.85 million square kilometres of wilderness became newly-suited for at least one crop by mid-century. Under a very high emissions scenario, 2.75 million square kilometres of wilderness became farmable, amounting to 7 per cent of all the wilderness outside Antarctica.

This overlap disproportionately occurred in the northern hemisphere, both because of the large amount of wilderness remaining there as well as the more rapid warming in higher latitudes. Some of the largest overlaps occurred in Russia, Canada and Alaska.

Gardner says the models don't account for numerous other factors that would affect whether crops could actually be grown in these areas, such as soil quality or proximity to transportation networks. Uncertainties involved in modelling both future climate change and how particular crops will respond means the projections should be seen as a ""first pass"", she says.

But researchers say the pattern of overlap suggests a clear problem. “This is a real threat that vast areas in northern latitudes - very important for biodiversity, carbon balance, hydrological cycle, etc - will be under pressure for food production,"" says Matti Kummu at Aalto University in Finland, who wasn't involved with the research.

Climate-related declines in areas currently used for farming nearer the equator could exacerbate this pressure. Under both emission scenarios, the researchers found around 6 per cent of the land currently suitable for farming will become unsuitable for any crop by the middle of the century, and half of all land will see declines in the diversity of edible plants that would be able to grow there.

More efficient use of current agricultural land - for instance, by using less of it to raise livestock and encouraging consumers to shift towards a more plant-based diet - could help avoid this pressure. So would reducing emissions to mitigate climate change. But Elisabeth Moyer at the University of Chicago says adaptations on existing farmland probably won’t be enough to meet demand for food on their own. ""In the real world, unless the seed breeders save us, we’re going to have to let things move around.""

Farming destroyed UK rivers to meet food demand - here's how we fix it

Rivers are awash with manure, fertiliser and pesticides from farming. This is more polluting even than sewage, so what can be done?

THE rolling English farmland of Dorset, Somerset and Devon might look like a bucolic idyll, but looks can be deceptive. These three counties in the country’s south-west are home to hundreds of intensive dairy farms, producing almost a quarter of the UK’s milk. Thousands of cows create a smelly problem for farmers: what to do with all the dung? As I drive along the winding country lanes, the stench drifting off nearby fields offers a clue.

My nostrils aside, it is local rivers that bear the brunt. In wet weather, slurry (manure plus water) overflows from silos where it is stored and runs off land into waterways, wreaking havoc on their ecology. The situation is particularly bad in the south-west, but this is a nationwide problem - and it isn’t the only damage that agriculture does to rivers. Over recent decades, pressure from supermarkets to provide plentiful food at low prices has pushed farmers to boost livestock numbers, use more fertilisers and pesticides to increase crop yields and remove hedgerows to make larger, more efficient fields. All these actions have knock-on effects, polluting watercourses with soil sludge, toxic chemicals and excess nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus.

As in other countries, the UK has legislation to reduce the ecological damage caused by farming. But enforcing these rules isn’t always easy, even when environment agencies make them a priority. No wonder the UK’s rivers are in such a bad state. It sounds like the perfect storm, but, in my…

We already have ethical options for replacing industrial farming

The industrialised food system harms the environment and animal welfare, but new ways of farming are now addressing these issues and further change is coming



31 May 2023

THE industrialised food system is approaching a crossroads. Though it undoubtedly produces more than enough food, it is butting up against ethical and environmental limits. The system, especially factory farming, is doing great damage to the environment, biodiversity, water resources and animal welfare. It is also ultimately self-defeating as soils can’t sustain it for much longer - by some estimates we have just 60 harvests left.

But environmental and ethical concerns sometimes come into conflict. As the influential philosopher Peter Singer points out in our feature “Peter Singer on animal rights, octopus farms and why AI is speciesist”,…

Why you should never ever mention rewilding to a Welsh hill farmer

In the push to give nature and the climate a chance to thrive amid growing agricultural pressures, words like rewilding have become de rigueur among researchers. Just don't tell the farmers, says Graham Lawton

MY LATE uncle was a sheep farmer in north Wales and I have happy memories of visiting his farm in Snowdonia as a child. I wasn’t much interested in farming back then, but these days I find it fascinating. Producing enough food to feed a growing global population is one of the most destructive activities we impose on the natural world, a massive driver of climate change and a major threat to biodiversity.

“Biodiversity is, on average, faring very badly indeed,” says Andrew Bamford at the University of Cambridge. “And while other drivers of biodiversity’s decline often attract more attention, the greatest source of threat to…

Pesticides in soya farming may be behind leukaemia deaths in Brazil

The replacement of cow pastures with soya plantations in parts of Brazil has corresponded with an increase in leukaemia deaths among children, possibly due to pesticide exposure

­­More children have died of leukaemia since large soya plantations have gradually replaced cattle farms in parts of Brazil, suggesting that pesticide exposure could be involved. However, the number of deaths is low and the exact cause hasn’t been determined.

Over the past two decades, parts of the Amazon have experienced a 20-fold expansion of soya farming, with previously cleared cow pastures converted into croplands. In the Cerrado, a vast savannah region which neighbours the Amazon, such farming has tripled.

Southern Brazil has a long-standing soya farming industry, with a transition in land use taking place more recently in the north and centre of the country. Brazil overall uses more pesticides than anywhere else.

While carrying out agricultural research in the Amazon, Marin Skidmore at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign heard local people talking about a recent rise in childhood cancers, with previous research linking pesticide exposure to childhood leukaemia. ""I wanted to see whether this phenomenon that I was hearing about on the ground would really bear out in the data,"" she says.

Skidmore and her colleagues collected information about deaths due to lymphoid leukaemia in children under 10 years old - who usually develop a form of the condition called acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) - between 2004 and 2019 in rural areas of the Cerrado and Amazon, covering about 1.75 million square kilometres.

Healthcare workers in these places don’t necessarily report all lymphoid leukaemia diagnoses to government databases, says Skidmore. The researchers therefore focused on deaths, which were well documented, she says.

They compared that information with data about land use and the location of people's homes relative to water sources and paediatric oncology centres.

The team found that for every 10 per cent increase in land used for soya farming, there were an additional 0.4 lymphoid leukaemia-related deaths of children under 5 years old per 10,000 people and an additional 0.21 such deaths for children under 10 per 10,000 people. A statistical analysis indicates this wasn’t a chance finding.

Death rates were higher in areas more than 100 kilometres away from a paediatric oncology centre. This makes sense, since ALL in particular is ""a highly treatable cancer"", says Skidmore.

Looking specifically at children who were born after the soya farming surge began in 2004, approximately half of the 226 deaths due to lymphoid leukaemia may not have occurred without the growth of that industry, she says.

Critically, the team found that lymphoid leukaemia-related death rates were especially associated with living downstream from a soya farm, which suggests the children, or their mothers during pregnancy, may have been consuming pesticide-laced water. Previous research has linked pesticide exposure during pregnancy to cancer in infants.

The results don’t prove that pesticides from soya farming caused the deaths, but “I buy it”, says Pablo MenÃ©ndez at the Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain. Nevertheless, the number of lymphoid leukaemia-related deaths is very low overall, he says.

Experimental CRISPR technique has promise against aggressive leukaemia

Chensheng (Alex) Lu at Southwest University in Chongqing, China, says that while the correlation between the deaths and the soya farming expansion seems clear, the cause isn’t definite.

If the results are confirmed in further research, this will underline the importance of government-regulated pesticide policies, says Skidmore. These could include training protocols for anyone applying pesticides and access to competent healthcare to ensure early diagnoses and accessible treatment, especially for rural populations, she says.

Agricultural intensification, via widespread pesticide use, is probably going to be part of global food security strategies, says Skidmore, who is ""not advocating for a wholesale stop to these inputs"". ""I think, safety first - making sure public health is taken care of as we see potentially more intensification happening in regions that are potentially under-resourced or haven't seen these types of chemicals in the past,” she says.

Robots could make farms more biodiverse with precision crop planting

Autonomous farm machinery may enable farmers to scale up the benefits of plant interactions, according to research presented at New Scientist Live

By Matthew Sparkes

Autonomous farm robots guided by GPS can plant and harvest multiple crops in close proximity, enabling beneficial interactions between different plants and potentially boosting biodiversity.

Strip cropping, which involves partitioning fields into narrow bands containing different plants, is a common farming practice. Now, robotic technology is making it possible to space crops closer together than ever before.

Kit Franklin at Harper Adams University, UK, who is working on trials of this method, says one can think of it as taking the diverse planting approach that an allotment gardener might and scaling it up massively with autonomous machinery. This could enable commercial farms to stop planting vast, non-biodiverse fields and reap the benefits of mingling plants with different needs and mutually beneficial habits, he says.

At New Scientist Live in London on 8 October, Franklin presented preliminary results from the latest experiments conducted on the Hands Free Farm at the Harper Adams University campus in Shropshire.

The robots are equipped with a seed drill that deposits crops in 2-metre-wide rows and a combine harvester that collects the plants once they reach maturity. This year, the university ran a trial with half a hectare of repeating rows of wheat, barley and beans.

“We’ve been able to plant those crops as separate strips and then tend them as separate crops, and then come back and harvest them as separate crops,” says Franklin. “With conventional farm machinery and conventional operational practices it’s very hard to do that. But with these small, very precise, autonomous machines… we can now actually maybe divide our fields up differently and start farming in a different geometry, which might be beneficial for crop growth, and also wider biodiversity and carbon capture and all those sorts of things.”

Franklin says the crops have a beneficial impact on each other, with beans drawing nitrogen, which wheat and barley require to grow, down into the soil and storing it. “The one is potentially feeding the other,” he says.

Feeding the plants in this natural way reduces the need to spray artificial fertilisers, potentially reducing the carbon footprint and complexity of farming. Planting crops of varying heights, which are harvested at different times of year, can also increase the amount of sunlight each row receives, boosting growth, says Franklin.

Weeds were a problem in the trial crop because of a summer with variable weather, but the technology still proved successful. In the coming year, Franklin and his colleagues plan to plant winter crops, as well as the spring crops of beans, wheat and barley they tried this year. They aim to get an even wider range of plants from the same field and maximise the area’s the diversity and efficiency.

Robot gardener grows plants as well as humans do but uses less water

Felicity Crotty at the Royal Agricultural University in the UK, who is not involved in the project, says the approach could be beneficial for farmers and the environment. “You’re actually increasing your biodiversity on the farm, and also that potentially reduces pest pressure, because pests usually detect crops by certain smells or volatiles. So when they’re looking for something to eat they might miss it, because it will be hidden amongst the other crops,” she says.

But relatively small-scale experiments may not translate into industrial farming, says Crotty. “Whether it would be scalable across a 10-hectare field or a 100-hectare farm, I’m not totally convinced,” she says.

Was the shift to farming really the worst mistake in human history?

The notion that our ancestors' shift from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to farming was disastrous for our health is well established, but a new study should prompt a rethink, says Michael Marshall

STOP me if you have heard this one before: the transition to farming was a cataclysmic turn for the worse. Beginning around 12,000 years ago, some of our ancestors started cultivating crops, abandoning the egalitarian and sustainable hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had worked for hundreds of thousands of years. The result was poor health, limited diets, new diseases and unsustainable practices that have culminated with climate change and a sixth mass extinction.

Almost 20 billion people could be fed on the world's current agricultural land, according to new research, but doing so would push the planet’s ""feeding capacity"" to its limit and create huge biodiversity and climate change risks.

The global population hit 8 billion in 2022 and is predicted to reach 11 billion by the end of the century, according to the United Nations, meaning the question of how many people Earth could possibly feed will be crucial in the coming decades.

Walking into the newest greenhouse run by vertical farming company Eden Green on the outskirts of Dallas, Texas, I am greeted by floor-to-ceiling walls of lettuce. The greenhouse is warm, bright with sunlight and busy with workers tending to the more than 300,000 heads of romaine, butterhead and red oak growing in hydroponic pots.

""It never stops growing,"" says Jake Portillo, the company's head grower, as he shows off the stringy taproots of a romaine almost…

Curiously cool summers in US Midwest linked to crop irrigation

For 75 years, the US Midwest has experienced unexpectedly cool summer temperatures - the ""warming hole"" could be due in part to intensive agriculture

Large parts of the US Midwest have seen average temperatures cool slightly since the 1950s, due in part to farmers growing more crops and pumping more water for irrigation. But climate change may eventually overwhelm this ""warming hole"", with implications for crop yields in one of the world's major breadbaskets.

For decades, climate researchers have puzzled over anomalously cool temperatures seen in the US Midwest and Southeast since the late 1950s. Average temperatures in the region saw a small decline, even as global…

Breeding corn to boost yields has made it more vulnerable to heat

As temperatures rise due to climate change, the huge amounts of corn grown in the US Midwest could be under threat, and it seems breeding for high-yielding varieties has made the crop genetically more vulnerable

Corn could be vulnerable to climate change

DAVID PAPAZIAN PHOTOGRAPHY/Getty Images

A century of breeding corn to boost yields in the US Midwest may have also made the crop more vulnerable to the hotter temperatures expected with climate change.

The amount of corn grown in the US more than quintupled during the 20th century due to a combination of breeding, agricultural intensification and favorable temperatures. But hotter and drier weather projected to arrive due to climate change threatens to slow or even reverse those gains.

""It's fairly severe,"" says Patrick Schnable at Iowa State University. ""If you look at middle-of-the-road projections, corn yield goes down."" The worst scenarios project as much as a 50 per cent decrease in yield by 2100.

To investigate whether corn breeders can develop more hardy variants, Schnable and his colleagues looked at data from corn-growing trials in four Midwestern states conducted between 1934 and 2014, along with temperature data from the same years. The trials involved nearly 5000 different varieties, enabling the researchers to track the influence of both climate and breeding on yield.

They found that after decades of breeding, corn varieties became more tolerant of moderately hot temperatures between 32ËšC and 34ËšC (89.6ËšF and 93.2ËšF). However, many varieties became less tolerant of severe heat above 38ËšC (100.4ËšF), suggesting a genetic trade-off between breeding for a 20th-century climate and a 21st-century one.

""The trade-off in there is bad news if you're in a high heat area,"" says team member Aaron Kusmec at Iowa State University, though exactly why it occurs is unclear, he says.

Such severe heat is rare in the Corn Belt, but could become more frequent with climate change, says Ethan Butler at the University of Minnesota. The fact that corn adapts differently to moderate and severe heat shows that ""the exact magnitude of warming is going to make a really big difference"", he says.

While the trade-off suggests breeding varieties that can tolerate both moderate and severe heat will be more challenging, the amount of genetic variation in response to temperature means careful breeding or genetic engineering could address this vulnerability. ""Maize is so adaptable,"" says Schnable. ""It's pretty extraordinary.""

It can be stunning to take a step back sometimes and realise that we are living in the future. Technologies that seemed fantastical in movies last century are fast becoming part of our regular lives. The food tech sector is no exception, with start-ups making cell-cultivated meat - real meat grown from animal cells rather than slaughtered…

Microplastics found in the soil on farms used to grow crops

Plastic is commonly used on farms in irrigation pipes or sheets to cover crops, but can reduce soil quality

Microplastics are found in the soil of farms used to grow crops, reducing its quality, according to an analysis of six strawberry farms in California.

Plastics are used regularly in industrial agriculture, such as in irrigation pipes or the sheets that cover crops. Many studies have shown that small fragments of plastic, known as microplastics, are widespread in the environment, including on farms, but the effect this might have on soil isn't well understood.

""Microplastics might impair the soil's properties, they might disintegrate and further leach into the groundwater system, and they can also interact with other existing co-contaminants in the environment, but we really don’t have much data about these things yet,"" Ekta Tiwari at the California Polytechnic State University told the Goldschmidt geochemistry conference in Lyon, France, on 10 July.

To learn more, Tiwari and her colleagues took soil samples from 20 strawberry fields across six Californian farms and examined each for microplastics, which measure between 1 and 5 millimetres across. They then compared this to health indicators for the soil, such as its moisture content, its level of nutrients like nitrogen and its respiration rate, a measure of how much carbon dioxide microbes give off as they turn oxygen into energy, a proxy for soil microbial activity.

The team found that higher microplastic levels are closely linked with lower levels of soil moisture, nutrients and respiration. Each of these could lead to a reduced growth rate for plants and smaller fruit when they come to be harvested.

In another part of the experiment, the researchers looked for larger pieces of plastic debris - macroplastics, measuring more than 5 millimetres across – across the fields, which they analysed to determine where the microplastics were coming from. The macroplastics that are most commonly used in farming – polyethylene, polypropylene and PVC – were also the main microplastics. ""We found a huge number of plastic particles, which exceeded more than 200,000 macroplastic particles per hectare,"" said Tiwari.

While previous studies have looked at microplastics in soil, the scale of this work was much larger, says Kip Solomon at the University of Utah. ""It's something we've been wondering about for quite some time.""

How counting the true cost of cheap food could make a better world

What we pay for food and other goods doesn't reflect the environmental and social damage they cause. But a radical new approach to economics could change that

By Graham Lawton

28 November 2023

Martin O'Neill

IN THESE difficult times, it seems utterly bananas to say that food is underpriced. In the UK, average grocery bills have risen by more than 12 per cent in the past year. But it is. The price tags on food are way lower - by about two-thirds - than what they would be if we were paying the full cost. Don’t worry, though, there are plans to sort this out.

Could a diet save the planet? Only if we pay the real cost of food

That might sound unpalatable: who wants their grocery bill to rise even more? Yet in reality, we already pay the true price, it is just that most of it is stealthily hidden from us. “We pay overall four times for our food,” says Alexander MÃ¼ller at the sustainability think tank TMG in Berlin. First, we pay at the checkout. Then we pay for the health, environmental and social costs of producing that food, mostly though taxes.

Green accounting

These costs are “externalities” - things that are treated as free even though they aren’t, such as the environmental damage caused by farming or the health costs of obesity. Right now, producers ignore them and let the rest of us pick up the bill. Maybe not for much longer. Economists and accountants - don’t yawn at the back! - have been working on a system called true cost accounting (TCA), which aims to internalise these externalities and upend decades of economic orthodoxy. Play our cards right, and it won’t result in all of us spilling more cash at the tills, but rather in a wholesale recalibration of global supply…

Extreme rainfall could lead to 'big disaster' for rice yield in China

Heavy rain triggered by climate change is forecast to reduce rice production in China by 8 per cent by the end of the century

Imaginechina Limited/Alamy

Extreme rainfall made more intense and more frequent by climate change poses a major risk to China's food security, according to a new study which forecasts an 8 per cent fall in rice yields by the end of the century.

China is the world's largest rice grower, producing around 214 million tonnes a year. It is a staple foodstuff for the majority of the country's 1.4 billion people.

Studies have warned that increasingly severe droughts - driven by climate change - will cause a decline in yields over the coming decades, but little research has been done on the potential impact of extreme rainfall on the crop.

Jin Fu at Peking University, China, and her colleagues used data from nationwide observations and field experiments to model the impact of extreme rainfall on current and future rice yields across the country.

They found that extreme rainfall has already reduced rice yields by 8 per cent compared with a world without human-made warming, a reduction comparable in magnitude to the impact of extreme heat.

In the coming decades, yields are expected to fall a further 8 per cent under climate scenarios in which average temperatures rise by 2 to 3°C by the end of the century.

""Extreme rainfall is normally an overlooked disaster for food security,"" says Fu. But she says it ""could really cause a big disaster"" for food production in China and beyond.

Heavy rain affects rice crops in two main ways. Firstly, excess water in paddy fields dilutes nitrogen levels in soils, leading to slower growth and lower yields. Meanwhile, torrential rain can damage the delicate flowers, disrupting the plant's grain production.

Fu says the study's findings are conservative assessments because the modelling didn't account for the additional impacts on yields of stronger winds, lower levels of sunshine and colder temperatures that can accompany rainy weather.

China can make staple crops carbon-negative by adding biochar to soil

The findings suggest other countries in South-East Asia that also grow a lot of rice could see even larger declines in yield, because climate models suggest they will suffer even more intense rainfall than China.

Fu says research is now needed to establish whether farmers can mitigate some of the negative impacts of extreme rainfall, by shifting the location of paddy fields to part of China less likely to be affected, co-planting rice with upland crops that could do well when rice fails, such as maize, or applying more nitrogen fertiliser to fields to compensate for the additional rainfall.

Allison Thomson at the Foundation for Food & Agriculture Research, a non-profit organisation based in the US, says: “I think this type of research is important not just to quantify the impact on food security, but also to help us better understand what adaptations are needed - so knowing what the impacts might be, how can farmers better prepare to minimise the impact of these extreme rainfall events in the future?”

China's production of staple food crops such as wheat and corn could become a net carbon sink if farmers start widely applying biochar to soil.

Instead of returning raw biomass, like straw, to the soil at the end of the growing season, farmers could take it to pyrolysis plants, where the material is heated at a very high temperature in an oxygen-free chamber to create biochar, a charcoal-like solid rich in carbon.

Studies have shown that applying it to soils not only…

Are crops more nutritious when grown outside in direct sunlight?

Are fruits and vegetables grown under glass, plastic or artificial light as nutritious as ones grown outside in direct sunlight?

Tony Woodward Portland, Oregon, US

Fruits and vegetables grown in greenhouses can be as nutritious as those grown in fields under natural light. Indeed, under ideal conditions they are more nutritious and healthier.

Greenhouses provide a constant environment without the hazards of bad weather; insufficient sunlight can be corrected by electric light. Properly maintained greenhouses don’t have the pests that can attack plants in the field and therefore don’t need the toxic pesticides commonly sprayed over fields. Moreover, in a…

Nitrogen-producing bacteria slash fertiliser use on farms

Microbes that produce nitrogen have made a big difference for reducing fertiliser-related emissions and pollution across millions of acres of farmland in the US. The microbes can be applied directly to the soil or as a coating on seeds

Nitrogen-fixing microbes can dramatically reduce the fertiliser-related emissions and pollution from farms.

Nitrogen fertiliser plays an essential role in industrial agriculture, but it comes at a steep environmental cost. The production and use of synthetic nitrogen is responsible for around 5 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Excess fertiliser also adds to air pollution and can contaminate water.

In addition to finding greener ways to produce nitrogen fertiliser, researchers and farmers are looking for ways to use fertiliser more efficiently, without sacrificing crop yields. One approach taken by US-based company Pivot Bio is to add bacteria to crops that take nitrogen from the air and fix it in soil as nitrates plants can use.

""Microbes are freeloading couch potatoes when nitrogen is around,"" says Karsten Temme, the company's CEO. If the soil has synthetic fertiliser, bacteria will use that rather than pull nitrogen from the air.

That requires farmers to use more fertiliser to have the same effect on crop yields. It also adds to nitrous oxide emissions from soil as microbes convert excess nutrients from the fertiliser. Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas and emissions from soil are responsible for the majority of fertiliser-related emissions of the gas.

Using genetic engineering, Pivot Bio developed two bacteria-based treatments that continue to produce nitrogen even when high levels of nitrogen are already present in the soil. Temme says the treatments, which can be applied as a liquid directly to the soil or as a powder to coat seeds, can replace about a quarter of the synthetic nitrogen used without affecting crop yield.

Pivot Bio says its products are now being used on more than 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) of farmland in the US, mostly on corn crops, but also on wheat, sorghum, barley, millet, oats and sunflower crops.

According to initial estimates, the treatment helped avoid 32,000 tonnes of synthetic fertiliser on farms in 2022. The firm estimates that resulted in a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 220,000 tonnes of CO2, about the same as burning 1200 rail cars full of coal. About a third of those avoided emissions came from not producing the synthetic fertiliser. The other two-thirds come from the avoided nitrous oxide emissions from soil.

Those estimates are based partly on self-reported fertiliser use from farmers and partly on changes in use verified by a third party, and there are large uncertainties associated with linking fertiliser use and emissions, says Jane Franch at Pivot Bio.

A number of other companies have developed similar microbial treatments for plants. Agritech giant Bayer, for instance, has a partnership with synthetic biology company Ginkgo Bioworks to develop more efficient nitrogen-fixing strains of bacteria.

Another is Massachusetts-based Kula Bio, which feeds naturally occurring microbes with a carbon energy source so they live for longer in soil. Bill Brady, the company's CEO, says the treatment, which is in development, will be able to work on any crop and also reduce nitrogen use by around a quarter.

Human waste could help tackle a global shortage of fertiliser

Tests on cabbage plants suggest fertilisers derived from human urine and faeces are safe and could help bring down food prices

By Brian Owens

19 January 2023

Researchers test two kinds of fertiliser on cabbage plants at the Leibniz Institute of Vegetable and Ornamental Crops in Germany

Fertilisers derived from recycled human urine and faeces are just as safe and effective as conventional ones, according to tests on cabbage plants. Using human waste in this way could help alleviate the fertiliser shortage that is contributing to rising food prices - if people can be convinced to use them.

Nitrogen-based fertilisers are manufactured in an energy-intensive process using natural gas as a raw material. Human waste can be a good source of plant nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus, but can also carry disease-causing pathogens and parasites, so needs to be carefully treated to make it safe. It is still used - sometimes untreated - as a fertiliser in some low-income countries, but has been largely abandoned in high-income nations.

Franziska HÃ¤fner at Agroscope in Zurich, Switzerland, and her colleagues compared cabbages grown using organic fertiliser derived from vinasse, a by-product of ethanol production, with fertilisers made from treated human urine and faeces.

The yield for cabbages grown with nitrified urine fertilisers (NUFs) was comparable to those grown with vinasse. Cabbages grown with faecal compost, or compost and NUFs together, had lower yields, but this fertiliser may increase soil carbon content in the long term, the study found.

The researchers also tested for more than 300 chemicals in the faecal compost, including pharmaceuticals, flame retardants and insect repellents. Just 6.5 per cent of these were detected, all at very low concentrations. Of the 11 pharmaceuticals detected in the compost, just two were found in the edible parts of the cabbage: the painkiller ibuprofen and the anticonvulsant and mood-stabilising drug carbamazepine. But the concentration of the latter was so low you would need to eat half a million cabbages to get a single dose.

""The products derived from recycling human urine and feces are viable and safe nitrogen fertilizers for cabbage cultivation,"" HÃ¤fner said in a statement. ""They gave similar yields as a conventional fertilizer product, and did not show any risk regarding transmission of pathogens or pharmaceuticals.""

The researchers estimate that, if correctly prepared and quality controlled, up to 25 per cent of conventional synthetic mineral fertilisers in Germany could be replaced by ones recycled from human urine and faeces. In some places, that trend is already under way. One of the NUFs they tested, called Aurin, has already been approved for agricultural use in Austria, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.

Benjamin Wilde at ETH Zurich obtained similar results in yield and safety when he tested NUFs in field trials in South Africa. But getting people to use them can take some convincing. The Zulu farmers he worked with, like those from many cultures, have strong social taboos around human waste. However, long discussions about the process of making such fertiliser and a field trip to where this happens helped them overcome those. ""Farmers are very practical people once they see that something works,"" he says, although the farmers pointed out they might have a harder time convincing their customers.

If people can be convinced to overcome their squeamishness, fertilisers from recycled human excreta might make a serious dent in the fertiliser shortage. There are billions of people in the world and that is a lot of available nitrogen, says Wilde.

Jaguars have been trained to dislike the taste of cattle, sheep and dogs by feeding them tainted meat, suggesting a way to spare the lives of both domestic animals and the predators that prey on them.

An endangered species, jaguars roam freely under wildlife protection laws in Mexico and parts of Central and South America. But their attacks on livestock and pets have led to illegal shootings by angry owners.

Endangered vultures saved from deadly poisoning and electrocution

A decade-long conservation effort spanning 14 countries has halted the decline of a key population of Egyptian vultures by preventing poisoning and insulating electrical infrastructure

A huge international effort has succeeded in protecting endangered vultures by tackling threats to the birds along their migration route between Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus) can be shot, poisoned by livestock farmers or electrocuted as they migrate across 14 countries each year.

A combination of these threats has caused their population in Eastern Europe to drop from 600 breeding pairs in the 1980s to just 50 today.

Conservationists have been chipping away at dangers to the birds, and a project launched in 2017 aimed to protect them over their entire migration route. In the Balkans, the number of poisoning incidents was cut in half between 2018 and 2022 by conservationists working with farmers to reduce the use of poisoned bait for livestock predators, which is then consumed by vultures.

In addition, 30 captive-bred vultures were released in Bulgaria, a key breeding site, between 2016 and 2022.

The European-Union-funded project also insulated live components on more than 10,000 electricity poles near perching sites in countries from Bulgaria to Ethiopia, and promoted the use of substitutes for vulture body parts in traditional medicine in Niger and Nigeria.

This ambitious conservation effort has led to a decrease in mortality of 2 per cent for adults and 9 per cent for juveniles, and a population growth of 0.5 per cent per year, according to Steffen Oppel at the Swiss Ornithological Institute and his colleagues.

""The population currently is stable with that very tiny increase,"" says Oppel.

The work has benefited other migratory birds that use the same route as the vultures, including buzzards, eagles and storks.

Oppel and his colleagues witnessed thousands of white storks (Ciconia ciconia) arriving in southern Turkey, a number of which were electrocuted by touching live cables with their wings as they landed on electricity poles. To avoid this, plastic or rubber covers were used to insulate power cables wherever conservation teams detected lots of dead birds.

People have benefited too, he says. ""We've had some great success with companies, for example in Bulgaria and now in Turkey, recognising that it is in their own interest that if they insulate the power lines, they have far fewer service disruptions.""

Any intervention to save vultures is important, and the Balkans project has a good chance of success, says Kerri Wolter at VulPro, a conservation group in South Africa. ""It’s kind of all hands on deck, and all conservation interventions and strategies are important in order to do everything within our means [to save the species],"" she says.

Southern Africa once had its own breeding population of Egyptian vultures that is now extinct.

EU funding to protect the Egyptian vultures' flyway ended at the end of 2022, but Oppel says the work must continue to ensure mortality rates don't increase again.

""On the one hand, you want to say, ""˜Yes, we've achieved something fantastic because we have managed to swing around the population trend of a declining migrant,' but on the other hand, you need to ensure that politicians realise this isn't fixed forever,"" he says.

Earliest signs of horse riding found in 5000-year-old human remains

The bones of nine men from graves in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania show hallmarks of horse riding in the patterns of wear on their spines, legs and pelvises

The earliest evidence of horse riding has been found in 5000-year-old human skeletons from south-east Europe.

The bones of nine men from graves in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania show hallmarks of horse riding in the patterns of wear on their spines, legs and pelvises.

The adoption of horse riding is seen as one of the key developments of history, as it helped people to herd livestock, promoted trade and migration, and eventually transformed warfare.

""Suddenly, people had the possibility to move five times as fast and carry 10 times more than they were able to transport before – that’s revolutionary,"" says Martin Trautmann at the University of Helsinki in Finland.

It has long been suspected that the first people to domesticate horses were the Yamnaya, livestock herders originating in the Eurasian steppe north of the Black Sea and Caucasus mountains. They went on to colonise most of Europe in what some archaeologists see as a murderous rampage.

Traces of horse milk have been found in shards of their pots. Although this shows that people kept horses, they may have done so first for their milk and meat, so it is unclear when they might have begun riding the animals.

Trautmann's team analyzed the remains of 217 human skeletons that had previously been found in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Serbia for signs of wear on their bones that could indicate horse riding. They dated from between 3000 and 7000 years ago. ""Bones are living tissue and if you are doing certain activities throughout your life, the attached muscles and ligaments exert pressure on the bones,"" says team member Volker Heyd, also at the University of Helsinki.

Several features have previously been proposed as hallmarks of horse riding, as they are sometimes present in modern people who spend a lot of time on horseback. They include wear of the top and bottom surfaces of the spinal vertebrae, caused by the up-and-down motion experienced on a horse.

Another potential sign is a thicker and rougher area where thigh muscles join to thigh bones, showing heavy use of the thighs, which could be from needing to grip the horse with the legs. ""There's additional bone growth to make the area where ligament meets bone bigger, so it disperses the force better,"" says Trautmann.

The team assessed all the skeletons for six such hallmarks. Five individuals showed the strongest evidence for horse riding, having five or more of the signs. Another four skeletons showed four of the signs. All nine were male, dating from 4500 to 5000 years ago.

But William Taylor at the University of Colorado Boulder says other kinds of evidence of riding, such as remains of bridles, don't show up in the archaeological record from this region until about 1000 years later. ""It does zoom in on this region of the steppes as a homeland, but we are off by almost a millennium.”

The patterns of wear on the bones aren’t conclusive proof of horse riding, as they could have been caused by other activities, such as riding in a cart pulled by cattle, he says. ""We don't have the kind of data I would like to see to let human skeletons track horse riding versus other activities.""

How big a problem are methane and other non-CO2 greenhouse gases?

Carbon dioxide is the dominant driver of climate change, but countries convening at COP28 are expected to make agreements to reduce methane and other often overlooked greenhouse gases

Carbon dioxide is not the only greenhouse gas under fire at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. On 2 December, the UAE, the US and China are convening other countries for a meeting focused on methane and other ""non-CO2"" greenhouse gases, with announcements expected from the fossil fuel industry on cutting these emissions.

In terms of contribution to climate change, methane is the most significant of these. But other gases, such as nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases made for refrigeration, are also of concern.

How much of a problem are non-CO2 greenhouse gases?

Together, they are responsible for around a third of human-caused warming so far, and the Paris agreement climate targets won't be reached without slashing these emissions along with CO2, says Mathijs Harmsen at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. ""It doesn't get the attention in line with the climatic impact it has.""

But there is renewed focus at COP28. ""We see COP28 as a turning point"" for limiting the emissions of these short-lived non-CO2 greenhouse gases, says Martina Otto, who heads the Climate and Clean Air Coalition at the UN.

What are the main non-CO2 greenhouse gases?

Methane is the non-CO2 greenhouse gas that has had the greatest effect on climate change. It is followed by nitrous oxide and manufactured fluorinated gases, or ""F-gases"", which are emitted in relatively small amounts but are far more potent than CO2. Sulphur hexafluoride, for instance, which is used as an electrical insulator, has a warming effect more than 23,000 times that of CO2, gram for gram.

Methane has both natural and human-caused sources - the majority of the latter come from fossil fuel production, due to leaks from wells, coal mines, pipelines and ships. Burping cows and other livestock make up the second largest share, followed by landfills, which release methane as food and other organic matter decomposes. Warming temperatures also increase methane emissions from natural sources like wetlands and thawing permafrost. These many sources have made it challenging for researchers to zero in on exactly what has been driving a steady rise in emissions since 2007.

COP28: How this year shattered nearly every modern climate record

Nitrous oxide also has natural sources, such as wetlands. But human-caused emissions of the gas have risen since the industrial revolution, mainly due to the increasing use of nitrogen fertilisers and livestock manure.

F-gases have been manufactured for refrigeration and other applications since the early 20th century. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were widely used as a refrigerant until countries agreed in the 1987 Montreal Protocol to phase out their use due to their degrading effect on the ozone. This phase-out is expected to avoid as much as 0.5°C of warming this century, although CFCs are still illegally being produced in some countries. The most common replacement for CFCs, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), do not degrade the ozone, but have a warming effect that is hundreds or thousands of times more potent than CO2. In 2016, countries agreed to amend the Montreal Protocol to begin phasing out HFC's as well.

Which of these non-CO2 gases is the biggest concern?

Methane is responsible for nearly all of the warming caused by non-CO2 gases so far, or about a quarter of overall warming. ""It's really a methane story,"" says Harmsen.

Methane sticks around in the atmosphere for only around 12 years, while CO2 can remain for millennia, but the gas is around 30 times more potent than CO2. While long-lasting CO2 emissions increasingly dominate over time, dealing with methane and other non-CO2 gases has a significant near-term effect. Harmsen and his colleagues recently found that keeping global warming within Paris agreement limits would be impossible without steep reductions in these non-CO2 gases.

""You will need to go quite deep with cutting non-CO2 to think about reaching the Paris agreement targets,"" says Harmsen.

What are countries doing to reduce non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions?

At the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in 2021, the US and the European Union launched the Global Methane Pledge, where countries promised to cut the world's methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030. Since then, more than 150 countries have joined the pledge. Approaches to stemming the tide include plugging leaks or stopping releases from fossil fuel production and capturing emissions from landfills, among many others.

Nitrous oxide emissions could be reduced by using fertiliser more efficiently and by adopting more sustainable modes of agriculture, for instance. And thanks to the Montreal Protocol, the F-gases are already being replaced with less harmful alternatives.

COP28: These are the key clean energy targets the world must agree on

What is happening at COP28 now around non-CO2 gases?

Methane is a major focus at COP28 in Dubai. ""What we see here is an evolution and sharpening of what started in Glasgow,"" says Matt Watson at the Environmental Defense Fund, an environmental advocacy organisation in the US. ""The companies generating emissions are being asked to step to the line and make company-specific, meaningful targets.""

A joint statement by the US and China ahead of the meeting committing to include specific targets on methane and other non-CO2 greenhouse gases has also raised hopes for a strong outcome at COP28.

In his opening address to the summit, COP president Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber called on countries to adopt net-zero methane targets. He also hinted at pledges on reducing methane from oil and gas companies expected at the summit. Though he did not name specific firms, he says these will include pledges from the nationally owned oil and gas companies responsible for the majority of emissions. ""Zeroing out methane emissions would make a huge impact in the shortest time frame,"" he said.

Putting solar panels in grazing fields is good for sheep

Sheep living in pasture with solar panels benefit from shade in hot weather and more nutritious grass - and they stop weeds from growing on the panels

Sheep living among rows of solar panels spend more time grazing, benefit from more nutritious food, rest more and appear to experience less heat stress, compared with nearby sheep in empty fields.

Earlier research suggested that agrivoltaic farms - which combine grazing animals with solar panels - offer more efficient renewable energy at lower overhead costs, as well as reducing wildfire risks. The latest findings show that the practice is also good for animal welfare, providing further evidence…

Mine waste and rivers: The legacy toxins re-entering our waterways



By David Stock

At the peak of its activities in the 18th century, Cwmystwyth Mine in Ceredigion, Wales, was one of the largest silver, lead and zinc mines in the country. It has been closed for decades, but its polluting legacy is far from over.

New Scientist environment reporter Madeleine Cuff visited the Welsh mine with Mark Macklin and Chris Thomas, both at the University of Lincoln, UK, who are studying how this mine – and others like it around the world - are contributing to river pollution in the modern day.

Macklin is exploring how wilder, wetter weather caused by climate change is dredging toxins like lead and mercury discharged by the mine back to the surface. Often, it’s not the mine sites themselves that are the problem. Over hundreds of years, waste material has been washed downstream and accumulated in riverbanks and floodplains, where humans and livestock now live. Remobilising this material can leave grazing livestock vulnerable to contamination, he says. Meanwhile, Thomas fears the residual metal pollution from the mine could be accelerating the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

The UK alone is home to thousands of abandoned mines scattered across the country. These ruined outposts may look like they belong in the history books. Yet as this short film uncovers, they are at the heart of a modern pollution problem that could threaten our rivers, our livestock and even human health.

Lab-grown meat could be 25 times worse for the climate than beef

Analysis finds the carbon footprint of cultivated meat is likely to be higher than beef if current production methods are scaled up because they are still highly energy-intensive

Meat produced from cultured cells could be 25 times worse for the climate than regular beef unless scientists find ways to overhaul energy-intensive steps in its production.

Lab-grown or ""cultivated"" meat is made by growing animal stem cells around a scaffold in a nutrient-rich broth. It has been proposed as a kinder and greener alternative to traditional meat because it uses less land, feed, water and antibiotics than animal farming and removes the need to farm and slaughter livestock,…

We are trapped in a junk food cycle that is making us sick

Poor diet is the biggest cause of avoidable illness and premature death in high-income countries. Our food system is broken, say Henry Dimbleby and Jemima Lewis

By Henry Dimbleby and Jemima Lewis

Michelle D'urbano

IN 1950, less than 1 per cent of the UK population was clinically obese. Today, that figure stands at 28 per cent. How did this happen? Did the British public suffer a massive collapse of willpower? Of course not. Humans haven’t changed. The food system has.

Many people find it hard to imagine that a food “system” really exists, let alone that it could be shaping their own dietary habits. This is because we live deep in this vast, complex machinery of supply and demand, and struggle to see it as a whole. Our new book, Ravenous, aims…

Your ultimate guide to ultra-processed food - how bad is it really?

Highly processed foods, from pizza to bread, are said to be seriously bad for your health. Here is a digestible guide to what the evidence says, to help you make sense of the conflicting claims

By Graham Lawton

23 October 2023

Nele Rojek

I RECENTLY scoured my kitchen looking for trouble, and I found plenty. There was a packet of instant noodles in a cupboard. Tins of baked beans and a box of muesli. In the fridge, a Jamaican patty, ketchup, hummus and probiotic yoghurts. Over in the bread bin, a loaf. I didn’t dare peek in the freezer.

These foods are part of my normal diet, which I don’t think is especially unhealthy. But by eating them, I may be opening myself up to obesity, heart disease, a fatty liver, cancer and more. That’s if you believe the increasing worries over ultra-processed foods (UPFs) and how bad they supposedly are for our health.

But amid the warnings, there are still many open questions. Are UPFs really bad for you? If so, why? In fact, what exactly are ultra-processed foods anyway? Sprinkle in the myriad social and economic issues intimately associated with the purchase of said foods (see “Ultra-processed do’s and don’t’s”, below), and it is no wonder everyone is so confused.

In an attempt to get some clarity on the matter, I have spoken to researchers at the forefront of the debate. And while there are no clear answers on UPFs, it is possible to navigate this nutritional quagmire.

Humans have been processing food for millennia to make it tastier, more digestible, more resistant to decay and more convenient. Salting, drying, fermenting, pickling and smoking were invented to preserve foods; milling produced flour to bake bread. Cooking turned unpromising or toxic raw ingredients into tasty, safe and nutritious meals.

During the industrial revolution, however, mechanisation entered the food system. In 1802,…

How ultra-processed food harms your health and how to fix the problem

Ultra-processed foods contain artificial ingredients that impact our health in ways that we are only just beginning to understand, says Chris van Tulleken

By Clare Wilson

26 April 2023

Nabil NEZZAR

FROM cocktail sausages to ready meals, ultra-processed food has long been suspected of being nutritionally inferior. Most dietary guidelines say this is because it tends to be high in fat, sugar and salt. But that is missing something vital, says doctor, academic and TV presenter Chris van Tulleken in his new book, Ultra-Processed People: Why do we all eat stuff that isn’t food… and why can’t we stop?

What really determines a meal’s nutritional value, says van Tulleken, is how it is made: in the home or a factory. This idea puts a spotlight not on individual ingredients, but on how the way they have been processed, reformulated and cooked affects our health. The industrial techniques used to make many modern foods not only add unhealthy ingredients, but also change the way the foods themselves interact with our body, says van Tulleken - and with ultra-processed food now making up more than half of all food eaten in many Western countries, the consequences for much of the world’s health are catastrophic. He tells New Scientist what we can do to turn this trend around.

Clare Wilson: Why is ultra-processed food worse than the food we cook from scratch at home?

Chris van Tulleken: The industrial processes involved in food manufacturing change its chemical and physical structure. They reduce food crops to their core constituents, such as high fructose corn syrup made from corn starch or hydrolysed vegetable protein from soya beans, which are then reformulated into substances that are highly palatable and calorific. These processes strip out fibre and micronutrients. Then ingredients are added that our bodies haven’t evolved to cope…

Tackling ultra-processed food must focus on evidence and avoid stigma

Highly processed food is an integral part of many food systems. Changing our relationship with it will take time and evidence, and must not point the finger at consumers



26 April 2023

Tim Gainey/Alamy

THINK of unhealthy foods and you might picture takeaways, fried foods or sweets - products high in fat or sugar. But a new idea says we should shift our focus away from a food’s nutrient content to how and where it is made.

Anything cooked from scratch in your own home is allowed, while food made in a factory, which is now classed as “ultra-processed” thanks to artificial ingredients like additives or high-fructose corn syrup, is frowned upon.

Consider a pre-packaged loaf of brown bread. Usually seen as wholesome fare, its additives put it in the ultra-processed camp. Most breakfast cereals…

Serve vegan burgers in schools to trigger shift from meat, says report

Researchers urge governments to use public procurement of plant-based proteins to bring about cascading changes that help tackle climate change

Governments should force prisons, schools, hospitals and other state-run institutions to serve more vegan burgers, sausages and fillets in order to trigger a dramatic shift in global agriculture, a team of researchers has proposed.

They identified public procurement of plant-based protein as a ""super leverage point"" that would spark cascading changes throughout the global food system.

Serving more plant-based foods in public institutions would help the alternative protein sector to scale up and bring down its costs, while also boosting the popularity of these products with the public, according to a report from sustainability consultancy Systemiq in partnership with the University of Exeter, UK.

Should vegan alternatives displace 20 per cent of meat sold globally, up to 8 million square kilometres of land used for livestock farming could be redeployed for climate-positive schemes, says Tim Lenton at the University of Exeter, who contributed to the report.

""You really get a disproportionate reduction in land use demand, which is obviously a big source of emissions,"" he says. ""Then you're liberating land on which you could do reforestation, afforestation, rewilding.""

Public procurement of plant-based proteins is one of three ""super leverage points"" identified in the report as small interventions that can cause a cascade of decarbonisation.

Introducing a mandate for at least 25 per cent of ammonia fertiliser to be made using green hydrogen would be another, the report said, by increasing the deployment of electrolysers to bring the price of green hydrogen to as low as $1.50 per kilogram. This could in turn make green hydrogen a viable fuel for ships and, eventually, steel production.

Meanwhile, requiring car manufacturers to produce a certain volume of electric vehicles each year would help to push zero-emission driving into mass adoption. This could in turn significantly reduce the cost of electricity from renewables and related storage solutions, by accelerating lithium-ion battery development.

The idea was to design interventions that trigger positive tipping points, where a shift to a greener society becomes unstoppable, says Lenton. These would act as a counterpoint to climate tipping points - such as the thawing of permafrost - that researchers warn would be irreversible and could speed up climate change.

""It was always apparent to me that sometimes in human social systems you get abrupt, self-propelling and often irreversible changes,"" says Lenton. ""We need to find and trigger positive tipping points to avoid those bad climate tipping points.""

The report, which will be presented today at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, is backed by the Bezos Earth Fund, a philanthropic venture from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

The interventions, designed for governments around the world, will inspire positive change rather than ban polluting activities, says Mark Meldrum at Systemiq, an author of the report.

""None of these are about banning the old,"" he says. ""They are about supporting and lifting the new, to help them be as competitive and attractive as possible. So we get to a place where we don't need a ban, because everyone wants the new thing anyway.""

'Dark earth' made by Amazon farmers stores carbon for centuries

Nutrient-rich soil known as ""dark earth"" has been cultivated by Indigenous farmers in the Amazon for centuries, leaving behind a large and still uncounted store of carbon

Indigenous farmers in the Amazon cultivate nutrient-rich, carbon-storing soil to grow crops - and archaeological evidence of this “dark earth” suggests they have been doing so for centuries. Studying the technique could help with wider efforts to store carbon in soil in an attempt to slow climate change.

Despite the Amazon’s verdant reputation, soil in the hot, wet region isn’t very fertile. How large settlements of people were able to grow sufficient food in such soil has long perplexed researchers. ""Where were they getting their food?"" says Samuel Goldberg at the University of Miami. ""That's where dark earth comes in.""

Dark earth is soil packed with organic material found near or around human settlements, particularly in piles of waste. Artefacts such as broken ceramics are often found in the soil, along with a high concentration of nutrients that turn the earth darker than surrounding natural soils.

Such soil has been found at many archaeological sites in the Amazon and seems to have been used for farming, but it wasn't clear whether dark earth was actively cultivated or merely a byproduct of human activity.

To investigate, Goldberg and his colleagues compared soil from a modern village with that from several historical and ancient settlements in the Xingu river basin in the south-western Amazon. They also studied how Indigenous farmers use the soil today at a village in the Kuikuro Indigenous Territory, where cultural continuity with ancient societies in the region has been established by the archaeological record.

In the modern Kuikuro village, they found that farmers actively spread charcoal, ash and organic waste such as fish and scraps of manioc, also called cassava or yuca, to make dark earth, known there as ""eegepe"". The chemical composition and spatial patterns of dark earth deposits were also similar in both modern and ancient settlements, supporting the idea that past societies actively made the soil.

""The chemistry is like fertile soil for plants, just exaggerated,"" says Morgan Schmidt at the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Brazil.

The enriched soils also contained substantially more carbon than typical soils in the Amazon, comparable to the amount of carbon stored in the rainforest growing above the soil. This suggests that dark earth in the Amazon may amount to a large and as yet uncounted store of carbon.

Though stored for centuries, the soil carbon could be released due to warming temperatures or unsustainable agriculture, says Goldberg. He says the centuries of soil management also suggest the importance of efforts to store more carbon in soil today. ""We can see that it works,"" he says.

Hunter-gatherer genes gave European farmers an immunity boost

An analysis of ancient genomes has revealed that the descendants of Stone Age farmers in Europe and hunter-gatherers gained more genes from the latter group than expected

The offspring of Stone Age farmers that settled in Europe inherited an unusually high share of immunity genes from local hunter-gatherers, suggesting that the development of farming wasn't the sole reason early humans became more resistant to pathogens.

It has long been thought that ancient farmers would have had improved immune systems over hunter-gatherers, due to living in more densely populated conditions and having closer contact with animals, increasing exposure to pathogens. As these farming populations expanded, their immunity genes would be best adapted and passed to their offspring.

But the story is more complex than that. ""These early farming groups came into Europe, bringing their lifestyle and technology, but there [were] also hunter-gatherers in Europe,"" says Pontus Skoglund at the Francis Crick Institute in London, and the two populations mixed.

To learn more, Skoglund and his colleagues analysed the genomes of 677 ancient individuals from across western Eurasia, spanning from approximately 12,000 to 5000 years ago.

The team divided the genomes into three groups: early farmers who had moved west from the region now occupied by Turkey and the Balkans, European hunter-gatherers and later individuals with mixed inheritance. ""Fast forward a few millennia, and the remaining farming groups now have about 20 per cent of their ancestry that can be traced back to hunter-gatherers,"" says Skoglund.

But in a specific genome region, called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), this split was closer to 50:50, suggesting that hunter-gatherer genes here were more favoured by selection processes. The MHC contains many genes for adaptive immunity, which is how the body targets specific pathogens, but exactly why the hunter-gatherer genes were selected for is unclear, says Skoglund.

The simplest explanation is that hunter-gatherers may have been better adapted to pathogens in western Europe, so their genes provided an advantage once the farmers had settled there.

But there is an alternative, thanks to a quirk of evolution that means groups that generally pass on a minority of their genes, like the hunter-gatherers, can provide more genes for functions where diversity is important, such as immunity - where the most successful offspring will be those that can survive a range of diseases.

The MHC plays a large role in determining whether we can survive a particular infection, says Mark Thomas at University College London, who wasn’t involved in the work. ""So, from an evolutionary point of view, it makes sense that we're very diverse for MHC. It means we can fight off more pathogens,"" he says.

Alan Hopps/Moment RF/Getty Images

An overhead scanning system combined with artificial intelligence is automatically assessing cows' health status twice a day on dozens of ""smart"" dairy farms across the UK.

3D cameras film the animals' backs as they leave the milking barn, while sensors read their individual identity tags. The associated computers then use machine learning to process the data, providing critical daily information about each cow's weight, body condition and mobility, says Wenhao Zhang at the University of the West of England (UWE) in Bristol, UK.…

Why I can once again eat cheese with a clear conscience

I thought there was no way around cheese being an environmental and ethical disaster, but a new approach to dairy farming has proved me wrong, says Graham Lawton

By Graham Lawton

31 May 2023

Ian Findlay

A FEW years ago, I wrote a feature story that has become, at least in New Scientist circles, the quintessential example of my role as the harbinger of doom. It was about the shocking environmental impact of cheese, especially its colossal methane and carbon hoofprint. The reactions from my colleagues were variations on “I don’t want to know”.

I am now ready to become a harbinger of good news. Earlier this month, I went to a conference organised by Compassion in World Farming, and others, where I met a farmer called David Finlay. He runs a creamery in Galloway,…

The river Teifi: How agricultural waste is destroying this Welsh river



By David Stock

The river Teifi is one of the longest rivers in Wales and one of its most beautiful. Yet despite the picturesque setting, this river and many others like it across the UK are facing a barrage of problems that are choking their health, everything from sewage pollution to microplastics and slurry from farming. In this film, environment reporter Madeleine Cuff travels the length of the river Teifi to find out some of the issues that waterways like this one are facing and what we can do to protect them.

How to force your rhubarb for an earlier, sweeter crop

Depriving rhubarb plants of light for several weeks forces them to grow fast and gives an earlier harvest, says Clare Wilson

By Clare Wilson

11 January 2023

I HAVE just finished one of the few winter jobs at my allotment: preparing my rhubarb patch, including setting up one of the plants to be forced. This means covering it with a large container to make the stalks grow more quickly in search of light.

If you have the space, I highly recommend getting a few rhubarb plants as they are so easy to grow. I give mine little attention, but each spring they produce a huge crop when there isn’t much home-grown produce around. Technically, rhubarb stems are a vegetable as they are the plant’s leaf stalks, but…

How to grow asparagus - and why it takes so long

Planting asparagus is a long-term investment in good eating, but your patience will eventually be rewarded with a crop that is tastier than anything available in shops, says Clare Wilson

By Clare Wilson

5 April 2023

Pixel-shot/Alamy

THERE is much debate about the merits of eating fruit and vegetables that are available seasonally and grown locally, to reduce your carbon footprint. From a taste point of view, I would argue that there are at least two crops where locally grown produce has a real edge. These are strawberries, which have better taste and texture if you can get them fresh, and asparagus - in my humble opinion, the king of vegetables, but also known among growers as the most quickly perishable after harvesting.

For these reasons, it is well worth buying asparagus only during the brief period…

Microgreens: The surprising truth about this trendy new ""˜superfood'

Microgreens are an increasingly popular hobby, and have gained a reputation as the superheroes of the nutrition world - are they actually good for you?

Microgreens are easy to grow indoors on a windowsill

Marina Bogachyova/Alamy

FOR several years, I have had a collection of greenery growing on my windowsill, a bunch of tiny leaves that provide me with freshly cut salad and a sprinkling of garnish on my meals.

These miniature versions of traditional herbs, vegetables, grains and grasses are known as microgreens. They are easy to grow - you plant them much like outdoor produce, but cultivate them indoors and harvest them after the first set of true leaves shows. There is a lot of variety, from cauliflower to kohlrabi, and they taste great too.

I am not alone in embracing the microgreen lifestyle. Worldwide, interest in these tiny plants has grown rapidly over the past 10 years. But they aren’t just for hobbyists: at least 16 per cent of indoor farming in the US is now devoted to microgreen production.

The reason? Microgreens have grown a reputation for being the superheroes of the nutrition world. Tens of thousands of articles have been published about their potential as “functional foods” that offer health benefits over and above that of mature vegetables. “If microgreens are included in our meals, it enriches our [health] because of the diversity of species used and the amount of nutrients they contain,” says Francesco Di Gioia, assistant professor of vegetable crop science at Pennsylvania State University. But, until recently, research into these plants has been sparse. So before investing further energy and money into developing my crop, I wondered: are they really doing anything for my health, or are they…

Refusing to accept GM food is safe is like climate change denial

Tom Pilston/The Times

Pro-science types, when they lambast those who campaign against genetically modified crops, often point out that no one has ever been harmed by the food produced from them. After 3 trillion meals, they insist, nobody has credibly reported even so much as a headache.

August bodies - from the US National Academy of Sciences to the UK’s Royal Society - all agree that food from genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is as safe as any other.

Perhaps I am the first person, therefore, harmed by dealings with a GMO. During an hour spent recently examining the performance of genetically engineered maize in a…

Gene-edited wheat reduces levels of cancer risk chemical when cooked

Field trials show that a form of wheat developed using CRIPSR gene editing produces lower levels of the potentially carcinogenic compound acrylamide when cooked at high temperatures

The first field trials of a gene-edited form of wheat show it produces less of a potentially cancerous compound called acrylamide when baked.

While acrylamide in food isn’t a large concern for most people, many countries have set limits on how much is allowed to be present in processed foods, so some manufacturers are interested in lowering levels of it in products such as bread, biscuits and pastries.

Acrylamide is formed by a chemical process known the Maillard reaction when the amino acid asparagine - found particularly in starchy foods - is cooked at high temperatures.

Studies in rodents have found that acrylamide causes cancer, although it is unclear what levels would be dangerous in people. Foods with higher levels of acrylamide tend to be darker brown, so common health advice is to avoid darker toast or French fries, for instance.

The amount of asparagine in starchy crops such as wheat and potatoes can vary depending on their growing conditions. Many food products already breach acrylamide guidelines, but food agencies are likely to get stricter about this in future, says Nigel Halford at Rothamsted Research in Harpenden, UK, who has been developing the gene-edited wheat.

In 2021, Halford's team used CRISPR gene editing to remove one of two genes necessary for making asparagine from common wheat plants (Triticum aestivum). When grown in the lab, this wheat produces flour with about half the level of asparagine.

Now, the group has reported similar results when the wheat was grown in outdoor fields. As expected, when the flour was heated to cooking temperature, its acrylamide content was about 45 per cent lower.

Tomato is first CRISPR-edited food to go on sale in the world

Genetically altered foods are widely consumed in the US, Australia and many other countries. But in the European Union, some people's fears that they are somehow harmful have held more sway over policy, even though most scientists say they are safe. If genetically altered foods are sold there, they must be labelled as such.

But in the UK, where some EU laws are being phased out after Brexit, new legislation currently going through parliament would allow the wheat to be sold without requiring the food containing it to be labelled as gene edited.

""We have got support from a number of plant breeders, but they are nervous about the thought of using gene editing,"" says Halford.

Simon Griffiths at the John Innes Centre in Norwich, UK, says public consultations suggest most people see plants that are genetically edited in this way - with a single gene removed - as less risky than the first generation of genetically modified foods, which sometimes retained new genetic material. ""It makes them feel better about it,"" he says.

In the US, potatoes with lower asparagine are already available. They are also less prone to bruising.

Robot gardener grows plants as well as humans do but uses less water

A vegetable-growing trial has pitted expert human gardeners against an AI-powered robot - both produced comparable crops, but the robot used about 40 per cent less water

By Alex Wilkins

11 June 2023



An automated robot gardener has shown its nurturing side by matching humans in trials of growing vegetables - and it did it with more efficient use of water.

Simeon Adebola at the University of California, Berkeley, and his colleagues have developed an automated plot, called AlphaGarden, that contains a mix of plant types and tested whether it can perform as well as a team of six expert human horticulturalists, each with 10 years of gardening experience, on average.

The robot and human-run plots both contained pairs of eight different common edible vegetables, such as kale, chard and radicchio. Where the humans…

It’s the kind of question that might be raised in a smoky room, as the asker flicks back the wheel on a lighter, about to hold the flame to a joint: Where did weed even come from? Not the marijuana dispensary down the street or that guy your cousin goes to - but long, long before that?

Science and technology's newest words and what they tell us about 2023

From ageotypes to marsification and noctalgia, here are nine words that entered our vocabulary this year, expressing fresh concepts, emerging trends and hard-to-articulate emotions

By Liz Else

12 December 2023

Andy Martin

Ageotype

In 2020, Michael Snyder, a geneticist at Stanford University in California, discovered that we tend to age along four different pathways. He found that the biological signatures associated with ageing are mostly found in four parts of your body - your kidneys, liver, immune system and general metabolism - with one or two of these systems ageing faster than the rest.

Snyder reckons figuring out your “ageotype” can lead you towards the best strategy to target your predominant ageing pathway, meaning you live healthier for longer. Liver agers, say, might consider laying off the booze. Metabolic agers, meanwhile, should focus on exercise.



How working out your ageotype could help you live healthier for longer

Your body is ageing down one of four - or more - possible pathways. Figuring out your ""ageotype"" could help you zero in on the things you can do to stay healthier for longer

In any case, we might expect the term to rise to prominence, at least within the circles that obsess about this stuff, on the basis that it is at the vanguard of efforts to personalise anti-ageing interventions.

Agrivoltaics

The next time you find yourself walking in the countryside, you may spot some rather odd-looking fields. Some will have crops co-existing with great swathes of solar panels, while others will be full of livestock sheltering or grazing under a photovoltaic canopy. What you would be looking at are “agrivoltaics”, a term that describes solar energy installations designed to work alongside crops or livestock.

Inevitably, some people argue that solar farms blight the landscape and change the nature of rural communities. But in North America, proponents of agrivoltaics are working to convince them that solar farms can help to restore disappearing prairies. In any case, the term will surely stick around because it captures a new…

To confront the climate crisis, we also need a wave of innovation

Cutting emissions remains undeniably important in a warming world, but the role of invention to help avert disaster is also worthy of attention



4 January 2023

Andriy Onufriyenko/Getty Images

HOW to stop our planet overheating is, of course, the key question of our time. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a UN agency known for its sobriety and caution, has, for some time, noted that halting the current warming trajectory “requires rapid and far-reaching changes” in all aspects of society.

Some interpret that as meaning the end of capitalism. Others prefer that we innovate our way out of the problem. Certainly, we must cut our consumption of planetary resources, especially in high-income countries, and this is something that the Czech-Canadian scientist and author Vaclav Smil has argued for at…

When did animals like foxes first start living alongside people?

We used to think ""synanthropic"" animals like raccoons, foxes and ravens started living alongside people around the time of the agricultural revolution, about 10,000 years ago. But it could have been much earlier, says Michael Marshall

STATISTICALLY, you probably live in a city. Around 55 per cent of humans do, and in high-income countries where New Scientist has most of its audience, the figures are even higher.

This means you also live alongside urban animals. In the UK, where I live, the most conspicuous ones are pigeons, foxes and gulls. These species have adapted to life alongside us, often by eating the food we throw away.

Does what goes down a cat always come back up?

Feedback digs deep into a new piece of research on the ""recovery of gastric foreign objects in cats"" and looks into the potential yumminess of spray-dried animal plasma

By Marc Abrahams

28 June 2023

Josie Ford

A sick experiment

The phrase “what goes up must come down” isn’t obviously relevant to the insides of a cat.

The countervailing “what goes down must come up” is, when that cat has swallowed something of dubious nutritional worth.

Christiana Fischer, Nolan Chalifoux and Erica Reineke have quantified the “must” aspect of it, as they explain to anyone with the stomach to read their report “Emesis induction is successful for recovery of gastric foreign objects in cats“, published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.

Advertisement

In their documented experience, objects that have been ingested by cats can be encouraged back up the oesophagus in half of all cases.

The trio of veterinarians, all of whom are based at the University of Pennsylvania, say: “Of the 22 cats that had emesis attempted, 11 (50%) vomited some or all of the foreign object. The time from ingestion to presentation, time from the last meal, presence of food in the vomitus, type of the object, and length, width, and surface area of the object did not influence the likelihood of successful recovery with emesis induction.”

The most common objects the cats ingested, they report, were rubber bands.

Food stuff

Spray-dried animal plasma has yet to hit it big in the food and fine dining industries.

Spray-dried animal plasma is pretty much what it says on the tin. Almost no one yet loudly mentions it as a foodstuff (or partial foodstuff) for humans. Livestock industries have been more welcoming, using spray-dried animal plasma as a food additive for piglets, calves and young chickens.

The substance, sometimes also made from pigs, cows and poultry, is attractive for more than just its possible yumminess. There is cost, in this age of rising food prices. There is efficiency, in the drive to minimise food waste by maximising recycling. And there is, maybe, good health for the elderly. A new study suggests that “Dietary supplementation with spray-dried animal plasma improves vaccine protection in aged mice“.

The pet food industry has taken spray-dried animal plasma to its bosom. Reports indirectly show how the little-bits-of-everything substance could become tempting for chefs and food vendors.

In Spain, Javier Polo and Carmen RodrÃ­guez have written a series of studies about not only its “functional properties”, but also some of the simple pleasures that spray-dried animal plasma can bring to a meal. Yumminess rises high in their paper called “Improving the juiciness of pet food chunks and pouches with plasma“.

Spray-dried animal plasma - “SDP” to those in the know - potentially offers much to many, even to the littlest among us. A 2021 study says that, while “The effects of SDP on shrimp health is not well understood”, “it could potentially be applied in shrimp farming as an alternative to antibiotics”.

Just like us

Inspired by the old saying that “people are the strangest animals”, Feedback wants to compile a sturdy list of animal behaviour metaphors that also tellingly describe some of our fellow humans.

This could be an enlightening project. The colourful strangenesses characteristic of certain people strongly resemble the colourful strangenesses characteristic of certain species of other, non-human animals, after all.

Such a list might also be useful to professionals. People can be frustrating for psychologists and psychiatrists, who struggle to find simple, clear phrases that capture the essence of each person’s mÃ©lange of characteristic behaviours.

Eventually, when equipped with a catalogue of apposite metaphors, psychologists and psychiatrists would be able to calculate the percentages of the world’s human population who are metaphorically cat, dog, fox, sparrow, cockroach, earthworm, snake, shark, ear mite or whatever.

Here is an example, in the form of an 18-word description of aardvark behaviour, which was published in the Encyclopedia of Animal Cognition and Behavior: “Aardvarks capture their prey using a combination of their long prehensile tongue, their adhesive saliva, and large claws.” Many of us have a human friend or colleague who behaves almost exactly this way.

You can help us gather a simple but broad-ranging catalogue of these metaphors, which we shall call Human Animal Behavioural Intrinsic Traits (HABITs). Send your entries to feedback@newscientist.com, and please remember to provide your sources.

Snot a superpower

Patrick Laughlin contributes to another of Feedback’s catalogue projects. Laughlin boasts a trivial superpower that can be cultivated and that can extend the joys of childhood into later life.

He says: “In primary school, my best friend and I invented the ‘wahmie’. You occlude one nostril with a fingertip, and blast out snot from the other, directing it to either side. One can become quite accurate with practice. I still use the wahmie when walking in the woods to avoid having to carry tissue, especially in allergy season.”

Ohio train derailment: What we know about the toxic chemical spill

A train derailed and caught fire in eastern Ohio, releasing hazardous chemicals into the air, soil and water - and raising concerns about health effects for residents

By Corryn Wetzel and James Dinneen

14 February 2023



Just before 9pm on 3 February, a train carrying hazardous chemicals partially derailed and caught fire in eastern Ohio, sending thick black smoke into the air. More than 1000 people in the town of East Palestine and surrounding areas were evacuated under orders from the state governor.

On 8 February, state and local officials announced that air quality monitoring had not detected contaminants of concern above levels considered safe for humans, and it was safe for people to return home. ""The Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) is assuring Ohioans its food supply is safe and the risk to livestock remains low following the East Palestine train derailment,” the agency said in a statement to WKBN news.

However, some residents remain concerned about exposure to contaminants following reports of fish and chickens dying in the area. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources said the spill had killed thousands of fish following the crash, but the chicken incident has not officially been linked to the spill.



What chemicals were on the train?

According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), around 50 of the train's 150 cars were affected by the derailment. Approximately 20 cars were listed as containing hazardous materials, including vinyl chloride, a carcinogen, according to a letter sent to Norfolk Southern Railway, the company that operated the train.

The EPA set up air-quality monitoring instruments around the burning train, and took soil and water samples from surrounding streams.

The agency found that hazardous chemicals from the train - including vinyl chloride, butyl acrylate and ethylhexyl acrylate - were released into the air, soil and water following the derailment, according to the letter.

The most dangerous of these is vinyl chloride, chronic exposure to which can cause liver damage. At high concentrations, it can cause dizziness, drowsiness and headaches. According to the EPA website, these chemicals may produce an odour at concentrations below safe levels.

Unidentified objects: What's behind the rise in aerial shootdowns?



What actions have been taken to contain the chemicals?

Norfolk Southern contractors built a dam to contain contaminated water at the site. They also used a vacuum truck and absorbent pads to recover spilled chemicals.

On 6 February, due to concerns about a large explosion, an EPA team conducted what officials called a controlled burn of vinyl chloride from five cars, diverting the chemical into a trench and burning it off. When burned, vinyl chloride creates phosgene and hydrogen chloride, which are toxic to people at high concentrations.

The burn generated a massive fireball and column of black smoke above the site, images of which spawned the hashtag #OhioChernobyl on social media.

Is the air safe to breathe?

Air quality monitoring around East Palestine did not detect contaminants of concern in the days after the crash or following the controlled burn, according to the EPA.

Detected levels of volatile organic compounds, including vinyl chloride and butyl acrylate, have remained below levels the EPA considers dangerous to human health, though particulate matter was detected above safe levels after the derailment and following the controlled burn.

The EPA is continuing to monitor air quality around East Palestine, and is testing individual homes near the derailment as part of a ""re-entry"" screening process. As of 13 February, schools, the town's library and 291 homes had been screened, with no detections of vinyl chloride or hydrogen chloride. One hundred eighty-one homes had not yet been screened.



Is the region’s drinking water contaminated?

The day after the derailment, the East Palestine Water Treatment Plant had not been affected, according to the EPA website. Water treatment operators downstream on the Ohio river also said they had detected no changes in the river at their intake, but were taking precautionary steps, such as installing another intake on a different river.

The Ohio state environmental agency and a contractor hired by the railroad company have also sampled soil at the derailment site and water in surrounding streams. Until laboratory results return from those samples, however, state officials have advised residents with private wells to drink bottled water.

On 10 February, Norfolk Southern released a plan to clean up the site, including digging wells to test and monitor groundwater.

How prepared is the world for a pandemic of bird flu in people?



How does the EPA determine safe levels of hazardous chemicals?

Based on general screening levels set by health agencies such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the EPA sets a minimum risk level for different chemicals in air, water and soil. Exposure to chemicals above that screening level has potential to harm human health, though the damage depends on different factors, such as the length of the exposure and the age or health of the person affected.

FORTY per cent of the world’s cashmere is sourced from the windswept plateau of Mongolia.

The fabric is made from the undercoats of the local goats, which develop a particularly tight fur to survive the harsh winters, where temperatures can drop as low as -40°C. In past decades, cashmere has made a fortune for local herders, becoming the main source of income for a third of the Mongolian population.

But lately climate change and overproduction have threatened the cashmere supply, and a unique way of life with it. In Mongolia, temperatures have warmed by more than 2°C in the past 80 years, above the world average, and could rise by up to 5°C by the end of the century. Milder winters - which can negatively affect the quality of cashmere - are now followed by long, dry springs and short summers, when not enough rain falls to sustain the pastures.

The global cashmere boom saw the number of goats skyrocket from 10.2 million to 26.5 million, causing overgrazing and desertification. Seventy per cent of Mongolia’s pastures are already considered degraded.

To address the problem, local herders are reviving traditional pastureland management practices. Cooperatives have also been set up to coordinate grazing and rotation between pastures, to give nature the chance to replenish itself, and the national government has imposed a tax on livestock to curb numbers.

But so far, no alternative source of income seems a ready substitute to a fabric that has provided an economic lifeline for a nomadic way of life that would otherwise have been lost.

Food waste in US landfills produces emissions equal to 12 million cars

More than a third of food produced in the US goes to waste. Most of it ends up in landfills where it becomes a major source of planet-warming methane as it decays

Wasted food rotting in landfills is a large and growing source of planet-warming methane emissions in the US, according to a report that quantifies these emissions for the first time. Cutting food waste is the best way to reduce these emissions.

Landfills make up about 15 per cent of US methane emissions, the third largest source after fossil fuel production and livestock burps. This landfill methane is produced by decaying organic matter, such as paper and food. More than one-third of all…

Horn of Africa drought is set to become the region's worst on record

A sixth failed rainy season would deepen the long-term drought in parts of Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia that has contributed to a devastating food crisis

The Horn of Africa may soon see its worst drought on record, as forecasts predict dry weather during this year's March-to-May rainy season. This would be the sixth consecutive failed rainy season in parts of Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia since the end of 2020. The severe drought, along with conflict and ongoing economic pressures, has displaced more than a million people, and led to a hunger crisis for more than 20 million others.

If rainfall is below average over the next three months, this will be the worst drought in the region in at least 70 years, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

The drought has brought the region to the brink of famine, killing crops and millions of livestock animals. The WMO forecast notes that if temperatures remain above average in May, crops will wither and more vegetation will die, reducing feed for livestock.

""The sequential nature of the droughts is really, really devastating to livelihoods,"" says James Verdin at the United States Agency for International Development.

A statement from the Famine Early Warning Systems Network on the situation in Somalia says humanitarian aid has so far averted famine for millions of people, but that the crisis is not over, with millions more still urgently in need of food assistance.

The drought has been driven by three years of below-average temperatures in the Indian Ocean as well as a rare triple La NiÃ±a in the tropical Pacific. Climate change has also contributed to hotter temperatures and a longer-term drying trend in the region, says William Roberts at Northumbria University in the UK.

Some preliminary models show the opposite El NiÃ±o pattern developing in the Pacific Ocean by the end of 2023, which could bring wetter weather to the region. ""Traditionally, when there is an El NiÃ±o, we do see above-average rainfall in East Africa,"" says Robert Stefanski at the WMO. However, heavy rain could bring its own problems, such as flooding and disease.

Invasive species are now a major threat to wildlife, farms and people

The proliferation of alien species costs the global economy more than $420 billion a year, and the problem is only growing

By Michael Le Page

Human activities have resulted in the introduction of 37,000 alien species around the world, with 3500 of those species responsible for serious harm to wildlife, food production and human health. The global economic cost of these invaders is now more than $420 billion a year, according to the first major global report on invasive species, by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).

“This is a huge, huge problem, and it is a growing problem,” says Helen Roy at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, one of 90 researchers who helped put the report together.

However, the report also says that much can be done to tackle the issue and prevent further introductions. Individuals can help as well as governments, says Roy. “People all around the world can make a difference.”

People can take steps to ensure they don’t help invasive species to spread and can also report the presence of invasive species to help eliminate them or prevent them from becoming established in the first place. For instance, she says, reports by members of the public in the UK are helping to ensure that any nests of Asian hornets are promptly destroyed, which has so far prevented the species from becoming established in the country.

However, globally not enough is being done. Only 17 per cent of countries have national laws or regulations on alien species, the report says, and nearly half don’t spend any money on tackling biological invasions.

“What’s really crucial is the need to develop policies that cut across different sectors,” says Anne Larigauderie at IPBES. These sectors include tourism, farming, aquaculture, the pet trade and gardening, she says.

Invasive species are one of the main drivers of extinctions worldwide. They have been a major factor in 60 per cent of all recent extinctions, the report says.

“If things remain unchanged, by 2050, the total number of alien species globally is expected to be about one-third higher than in 2005,” says Roy. “However, we know that things are not remaining unchanged.”

Does squishing invasive lanternflies really help stop their spread?

Around the world, land is still being cleared for farms and cities, and the planet is rapidly warming as a result of carbon emissions. “The interactions among these causes of biodiversity loss will result in a much worse picture than we are presenting here,” she says.

In addition to biodiversity loss, invasive species are harming food production. For instance, in Lake Victoria in East Africa, the spread of the water hyacinth (Pontederia crassipes) has reduced fish catches.

A large number of invasive species are a threat to human health. Giant hogweed can cause serious blistering if people’s skin touches the plant, while the recent wildfires that killed around 115 people in Hawaii were fuelled by invasive grasses, says Roy.

Many of the 37,000 alien species that aren’t problematic at the moment could become a problem in the future, says Roy. Alien species can be present for decades or more before something triggers a population explosion, such as climate change or the introduction of another invasive species, she says.

Cutting pesticide use on farms doubles abundance of wild pollinators

In a three-year study on US farms, the numbers of wild pollinators and commercial bees were much higher in fields where pesticides were applied only when needed

Both commercial bees and wild pollinators do much better on farms that use synthetic pesticides sparingly, according to a three-year study on US farmland.

Jacob Pecenka at Purdue University, Indiana, and his colleagues placed colonies of commercial honey bees (Apis mellifera) and bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) in fields of watermelon surrounded by corn, and collected pollinators visiting watermelon flowers.

At each site, they compared two fields with different pest management regimes.…

Can massive solar power expansion regenerate the US's iconic prairies?

Renewable energy development is transforming the US countryside. It could be a chance to restore the iconic prairies if rural opposition can be overcome

By James Dinneen

12 September 2023

Tony Bynum

A THIRD of North America was once an ocean of grass stretching from what is now central Canada to Mexico. Today, almost all of that original habitat, called prairie, is gone, ploughed for agriculture, paved over for cities and roads, or taken over by encroaching trees and shrubs. Most native prairie remnants are unmarked and hidden to the untrained eye - at least until the spring bloom reveals what grows there.

So, it was a surprise for Danish energy company Ã˜rsted to learn that the field in which it planned to build a giant solar facility was among the largest areas of intact prairie left in Texas. It was also a “wake-up call” for conservationists, says Kirsti Harms at the Native Prairies Association of Texas. “Suddenly there are thousands of acres going into these solar projects.” Unlikely as it seems, this could be good for both clean energy and biodiversity.

Rapid development of renewable energy facilities, such as solar farms and wind turbines, is necessary to cut greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change. But the industry’s demand for rural land - what Shannon Eddy, director of the Large-scale Solar Association, calls “the biggest shift in land-use patterns in modern history” - has generated intense opposition among local communities across the US. Amid this, researchers and some developers, including Ã˜rsted, are looking for ways to make facilities that bring benefits not only to rural populations but landscapes too.

The one that has perhaps gained most traction is the idea that solar development can restore lost habitat if native flora is planted beneath panels, supporting birds and insects and improving the…

This is why we must be wary of geoengineering

Published 27 December 2023

From Arthur Dahl, Geneva, Switzerland

The study that found there is a weekend boost to plant productivity in Europe because of reduced air pollution by aerosols, which block sunlight, should be a warning to those who seek to address global heating by injecting aerosols into the atmosphere (25 November, p 11).

This research shows how sensitive plants are to any drop in sunlight. Addressing climate change through atmospheric geoengineering will reduce plant photosynthesis on land and at sea globally, with probably catastrophic impacts on nature and agriculture.

What does a Plant Health and Seeds Inspector do?



Plant Health & Seeds Inspector, Beth Anderson, Animal & Plant Health Agency

I'm responsible for...

Protecting plant health across the country- this includes across trade, agriculture and the environment. I look for plant pests and diseases that are non-native and prevent them harming the UK's ecosystems.

My typical day...

There's no such thing as a typical day in my role! I could be looking at plants in an airport, taking soil samples in a field, inspecting machinery that's being exported, or responding to a national outbreak. I also receive calls from concerned members of the public who want to report a suspected non-native pest or disease, an example might be a Colorado beetle that's hitched a ride from abroad in a bag of salad!

The best part of my job...

I'm mainly out-and-about, which is what I love best. This means I could be in a garden centre, field, orchard, moorland or anywhere you might find plants. It also means I meet new people every single day and see their enthusiasm for horticulture and the environment.

The most challenging part of my job...

Things are always changing: one of the many effects of our changing climate is that some exotic pests are more likely to survive and spread, which makes our work more challenging. A big part of the job is legislation, which also changes regularly, so it's important to keep up with it and share changes with clients to help them trade.

I love my job because...

It is exciting, important work that means I'm constantly using my skills and learning new things. I can use my eye for detail to search for small signs that a pest or disease is present, or even find a live pest that I can send to our laboratory scientists for more investigation. It is incredible what you can find when you look at plants closely!

Advice to others.. (What advice would you give to others who want a role like yours?)

There is no ""˜typical' Plant Health & Seeds Inspector: our team is made up of lots of different types of people. I completed an apprenticeship alongside my first 18 months in my role, which not only helped me with skills in inspection but gave me a great understanding of regulations. An eye for detail, experience in horticulture and great plant identification skills are very useful in this job, and you'll be given excellent training.

I want to be remembered for...

Spreading the word about plant health and the importance of biosecurity! As part of my role I speak to schools and colleges about how crucial it is to protect our environment, and how small actions can help us all. Everyone has a part to play in protecting plant health and the biosecurity of our country, it can be as simple as not bringing plants and seeds home from your holidays or reporting an unexpected passenger in that bag of salad!

The civilisation myth: How new discoveries are rewriting human history

In an evolutionary eyeblink, our species has gone from hunting and gathering to living in complex societies. We need to rethink the story of this monumental transition

By Michael Marshall

27 June 2023

Coke Navarro

FOR almost all of human existence, our species has been roaming the planet, living in small groups, hunting and gathering, moving to new areas when the climate was favourable, retreating when it turned nasty. For hundreds of thousands of years, our ancestors used fire to cook and warm themselves. They made tools, shelters, clothing and jewellery - although their possessions were limited to what they could carry. They occasionally came across other hominins, like Neanderthals, and sometimes had sex with them. Across vast swathes of time, history played out, unrecorded.

Then, about 10,000 years ago, everything began to change.

In a few places, people started growing crops. They spent more time in the same spot. They built villages and towns. Various unsung geniuses invented writing, money, the wheel and gunpowder. Within just a few thousand years - the blink of an eye in evolutionary time - cities, empires and factories mushroomed all over the world. Today, Earth is surrounded by orbiting satellites and criss-crossed by internet cables. Nothing else like this has ever happened.

Archaeologists and anthropologists have sought to explain why this rapid and extraordinary transformation occurred. Their most prevalent narrative describes a sort of trap: once people started farming, there was no way back from a cascade of increasing social complexity that led inexorably to hierarchy, inequality and environmental destruction. This bleak view of civilisation’s rise has long held sway. However, the more societies we look at, the more it falls to pieces. Confronted with inconvenient evidence, we are being forced to retell our own origin story. In doing so, we are also rethinking what a society can be.

Warmer and wetter weather has increased the spread of plant viruses in the past few decades, and climate change is expected to result in more outbreaks in the future.

Erin Mordecai at Stanford University in California and her colleagues analysed the spread of viral pathogens in 5380 wild and agricultural plant populations across six continents from 1984 to 2019. They used data from dozens of previous studies that mainly focused on plant populations where some disease is typically present.

Europe's ""˜insect apocalypse' may mostly be driven by changing weather

Researchers have struggled to explain the precipitous decline in central Europe's insect populations since the 1980s, but a new model suggests weather is to blame

Booms and busts among Europe's insect populations are largely determined by the weather, according to a study of insect numbers in Germany. The finding could bring clarity to debates about what has caused the alarming decline of insect populations on the continent, but not all researchers are convinced.

""For now, this result is almost too good to be true,"" says Hans de Kroon at Radboud University in the Netherlands, who wasn’t involved with the new study. ""It's a pretty strong claim.""

Much of the alarm regarding Europe's insects dates to a 2017 study by de Kroon and his colleagues that found a shocking 76 per cent decline in flying insect biomass in protected areas in Germany between 1989 and 2016. That and other findings led to warnings of a global ""insect apocalypse"" and widespread insect extinctions. While those claims may have been overblown, insects are clearly in trouble - one analysis found terrestrial insect biomass in sites around the world has decreased by around 11 per cent each decade since the 1980s.

JÃ¶rg MÃ¼ller at the University of WÃ¼rzburg in Germany says that, like many of his colleagues, he initially thought the decline was down to a loss of insect habitats due to agriculture and urbanisation. But his research found that insect biomass didn’t change much between agricultural and more natural environments. ""The decline was everywhere,"" he says.

That suggested to him that the process was being driven by something that affects landscapes over larger scales, such as the weather. An unexpected rise in insect biomass at some trapping sites since 2016 - as well as a surfeit of butterflies around his house this year - also suggested a more fickle driver than changes in the landscape.

A monthly celebration of the biodiversity of our planet's animals, plants and other organisms.

Using data on insect biomass from the 2017 study as well as from more recent trappings across southern Germany up to 2022, MÃ¼ller and his colleagues tested seven different statistical models linking changes in insect biomass with a different set of variables, from changes in habitat to the weather.

They found the models that took weather into account could explain more of the observed patterns in insect biomass than the models that didn't consider weather. They also found they could predict changes in insect biomass at sites elsewhere in Germany using weather variables alone.

This link with weather suggests a mechanism through which climate change may be affecting insect populations. A warmer, drier winter, for instance, seems to have a negative influence on biomass, while a warmer, wetter spring has a positive influence. Europe has seen both warmer winters and springs with climate change. However, MÃ¼ller says the relationship is too complex to yet say precisely how climate change is playing a role. ""It's definitely risky, and it's getting more risky for insects,"" he says, particularly the rare or threatened ones.

For his part, de Koon says he has yet to ""look under the hood"" of the modelling, but finds it difficult to believe weather can explain the dramatic decline, especially across so many species of insect. ""It's hard to imagine that the group as a whole responds uniformly to those very specific weather anomalies,"" he says.

He is also sceptical of the reported rise in insect biomass since 2016, pointing to recent data that describes continued decline. ""We don't see any accounts for the time being for a recovery in the insect community,"" he says.

Soya beans made more meat-like by adding genes for pig proteins

A company called Moolec has created transgenic soya beans called ""Piggy Sooy"" in which a quarter of the protein is pig protein rather than plant protein

Moolec

Meat substitutes could be about to get a lot more meat-like. A UK-based company called Moolec says it has created genetically modified soya plants that produce beans in which a quarter of the soluble proteins are pig proteins. It has named its plant ""Piggy Sooy"".

Moolec is also creating pea plants that contain beef proteins. It claims its products will be able to provide similar taste, texture and nutritional value as meat, but without the high costs associated with cultured meat.

The company won't yet say which pig genes have been added to soya to produce Piggy Sooy. ""At this point, we can’t disclose that, for intellectual property reasons,"" says Amit Dhingra at Moolec.

However, photos of Moolec’s Piggy Sooy beans show they have a pinky-red tinge inside them (see picture, above). This means it is likely that one of the added genes is for a protein with an iron-containing haem group such as myoglobin. Myoglobin gives red meat its colour and also contributes to its flavour.

Impossible Foods already adds a plant haeme protein called soy leghaemoglobin to its burgers to give them a more meat-like look and taste. Leghaemoglobin is naturally found in the roots of soya plants, but to obtain enough, Impossible Foods manufactures it in genetically modified yeast.

Another company called Motif produces beef myoglobin as an additive called Hemani for meat substitutes. Motif began manufacturing it in modified yeast, but plans to make it in modified maize to scale up production.

Dhingra says the added proteins in Piggy Sooy have been chosen to give the right ""feel in the mouth"" after food is cooked, but wouldn't comment when asked if myoglobin was one of them, nor would he say if anyone has tried tasting Piggy Sooy beans yet.

Products such as Piggy Sooy could help make our food supply more sustainable, says Dhingra.

Environmental writer Mark Lynas thinks similarly. ""It should also be much more environmentally sustainable, and also avoid the unpleasantness of intensive animal farming,"" he says.

Lynas has argued that the ""yuck factor"" associated with transgenic plants - those whose DNA has been modified using genetic material from something else - is what led to the opposition to genetically modified crops. He isn't sure how Piggy Sooy will go down with the public.

""I really have no idea how this will land. It's interesting that they have gone all-out for the ""˜piggy' thing - there is no attempt to sweeten the pill,"" says Lynas. ""Of course, scientifically it's just a protein, and we already engineer lots of plants and microbes to make desirable proteins.""

This production of transgenic proteins in plants and microbes is sometimes called molecular farming. ""While we aren't aware of research specifically looking at molecular farming, there is strong evidence that consumers want - and are actively seeking out - more sustainable alternatives to animal agriculture,"" says Seren Kell at the Good Food Institute Europe. ""Sales of plant-based options have increased by 21 per cent in Europe since 2020.""



Vegan pet food: Can cats and dogs be happy and healthy without meat?

Emerging research suggests vegan pet food may be able to keep dogs and even cats healthy and happy, reducing the massive impact that traditional pet food has on the environment

Moolec points out that 98 per cent of all soya grown in the US is genetically modified, and says the success of Impossible Foods shows that consumers aren't deterred by genetically modified products.

The company is now seeking the approvals necessary to grow and sell Piggy Sooy in the US, says Dhingra. This should be easier to obtain than in Europe because of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rules. ""In the US, food ingredients developed in this manner would be considered under the FDA's voluntary pre-market consultation programme for foods from new plant varieties,"" says Kell.

In Europe and the UK, regulations are stricter and the process of getting approval would take at least 18 months, she says.

Transgenic plants with added genes from other species have been widely grown in many parts of the world, including in Europe, for decades. For instance, so-called Bt crops have an added gene for a bacterial protein that kills insects without harming larger animals.

Locusts produce an odour to try to put other locusts off eating them

The crop-devastating swarms that locusts form are driven in part by the insects' tricks to avoid being cannibalised - they move around and produce a pheromone to deter other locusts from eating them

Locusts are known for their massive swarms, in which they devour crops and can destroy enough food to feed 35,000 people in one day. They are also cannibals, so huge swarms present a danger to the insects themselves - but researchers have found that migratory locusts produce a pheromone that throws their swarm-mates off their scent.

In the animal kingdom, cannibalism is pretty run-of-the-mill. ""Not eating [members of your species] is a human invention,"" says Bill S. Hansson at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Germany. ""It's a loss of energy to not eat whatever is around.""

Recently, scientists determined that cannibalism helps drive locusts' apocalyptic swarms. ""They actually start eating each other from behind,"" says Hansson. ""You have to start moving, otherwise the guys from behind will eat you.""

Cannibalism even drives swarms in flightless juveniles, says Iain Couzin at Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany. ""If swarms take flight they become even harder to control. It's somewhat like a wildfire,"" he says.

Hansson and his colleagues hypothesised that locusts must have evolved countermeasures to deter their neighbour from eating them when they gather in large groups. The researchers began by looking for odour compounds produced exclusively by juvenile locusts (Locusta migratoria) under crowded cage conditions of up to 250 individuals per cage. Using a technique called gas chromatography that separates out the different chemical compounds in a sample, they identified 17 compounds the locusts produced, including phenylacetonitrile (PAN). PAN was already known to deter other species such as birds, because it can be converted into a toxic cyanide compound.

A monthly celebration of the biodiversity of our planet's animals, plants and other organisms.

To test if PAN protects against cannibalism in juvenile locusts, the researchers used CRISPR gene editing to create a line locusts that lacked the gene for PAN. These insects then quickly became the targets of cannibalism. In another line of locusts, the researchers disabled the olfactory receptor that detects PAN. This drove the locusts to begin eating any neighbour, even those producing the deterrent odour.

The findings could one day be used to help manage locust swarms, decreasing their numbers without need for current approaches like pesticides. Gregory Sword at Texas A&M University says that in principle, blocking the locusts' ability ""to either produce or detect the pheromone has the potential to cause the locust populations to self-regulate by eating themselves"". It could also make locusts more vulnerable to other predators.

Humans use a quarter of all the biomass created by plants on land

To stay within safe planetary boundaries, humans should only use around 10 per cent of the biomass produced each year by plants on land, but we are currently way above that level

By Michael Le Page

We are using more than our fair share

We are using more than our fair share

Charlie Rogers/Getty Images

Humans are now consuming over a quarter of the biomass produced each year by plants on land, leaving too little for wildlife and putting at risk the biosphere on which all life on Earth depends. To keep the planet in a suitable state for civilisation, we should be using no more than a tenth of plant biomass for our food and fuel, researchers say.

This means that plans to tackle climate change by using even more biomass, for instance to turn into fuel for aeroplanes, will seriously damage the planet in other ways, says Katherine Richardson at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, such as by causing more deforestation and species loss.

“That we’re already using too much biomass, of course, is a blow to those who want to use biomass for energy and for capturing CO2,” she says. “You’re just not going to solve the climate problem if you don’t also respect the deforestation problem we have.”

Richardson is part of a team that has been exploring what we need to do to keep Earth in a state similar to that during the 10,000 years leading up to the industrial revolution, to ensure that people can thrive. In 2009, the team proposed that there are nine main limits, or planetary boundaries, that shouldn’t be breached if we want to prevent drastic changes that endanger us as well as nature.

“We’re not only affecting the climate, we’re also affecting the water, the biodiversity, ocean acidification, the ozone layer and so on,” says Richardson. “How far is it safe to go? You need some kind of guardrails.”

Get a dose of climate optimism delivered straight to your inbox every month.

The team has been improving and updating this work since 2009. For instance, it was previously unable to establish the safe limit for some of the planetary boundaries, so has been working on calculating these.

Besides the climate, maintaining the biosphere – the planet’s life-support system – is the most important of these boundaries, says Richardson. Back in 2009, it was clear that the loss of genetic diversity due to our actions had already reached dangerous levels, but the team was unable to find a good measure of how the functioning of the biosphere has been affected.

The researchers have now decided to measure it in terms of how much of the biomass produced by photosynthesis is being appropriated by humans, or is no longer happening, relative to pre-industrial levels. Plant biomass is the basis of food chains, so if we take it, the life that depended on it dies out.

The study estimates that plants on land produced 56 gigatonnes of biomass a year, as measured by its carbon content, in pre-industrial times, and that through farming, logging, the grazing of domestic animals and so on, people now take 17 gigatonnes per year, or around 30 per cent of pre-industrial levels. Today, plants produce an estimated 66 gigatonnes of biomass a year due to higher carbon dioxide levels, and would produce even more if not for land degradation, meaning that our current consumption sits at around 26 per cent.

The 12 innovations we need to save humanity and the planet

Richardson and her colleagues propose that a safe limit for this exploitation would be 10 per cent of pre-industrial plant biomass, and that anything over 20 per cent is high risk. For biomass produced by plants in the oceans, further study is still necessary, they say.

“I think it is a good, first-order metric,” says Timothy Searchinger at Princeton University. “Anyone claiming we really can acceptably use more of the world's plant production to meet additional demands created by policy should have the strong burden of proof about how and why that's OK.”

Growing demand for food and wood alone means the proportion of biomass we appropriate is likely to increase in the coming decades, says Searchinger. And some proposals for growing crops for energy and capturing the carbon would double our use, he says.

Overall, Richardson and her colleagues conclude that we are transgressing six of the nine planetary boundaries. Besides changing the climate too fast and harming the biosphere, we are also altering the land too much, damaging freshwater systems, releasing too much nitrogen and phosphorus, and releasing too many artificial substances, such as pesticides and plastics.

So far, however, ocean acidification remains within safe limits, as do the levels of aerosols released into the atmosphere. And while we were once destroying the ozone layer to a dangerous extent, we are now back in the safe operating zone.

There are interactions between all these nine aspects of the planetary system that we need to take into account to ensure efforts to solve one problem don’t make another worse, says Richardson. “Unfortunately, our legal and political system hasn’t gotten there yet.”

Alcoholic fruit may help plants recruit mammals to spread their seeds

Measurements of alcohol levels in fruits collected in a Costa Rican forest reveal that those eaten by mammals contain higher levels of alcohol

Many fruits eaten by mammals in a tropical forest contain alcohol and this may be one way that plants entice animals to disperse their seeds.

Ethanol occurs naturally in fruits as a product of fermentation by wild yeasts. Until now, there have been few large-scale studies looking at what role alcohol plays in the interactions between plants and animals, says Julia Casorso at the University of Calgary in Canada.

Casorso and her colleagues collected fruits at different stages of ripeness from more than 70 plant species in a Costa Rican tropical dry forest, both directly from trees and from the ground. To measure the alcohol concentration of the fruits, they placed them in plastic bags for an hour and then sampled the air inside the bag with a breathalyser.

Based on existing knowledge of the kinds of fruits that animals eat, they classified smaller, brightly coloured fruits as bird-dispersed and heavier, duller fruits as mammal-dispersed. Soft, succulent fruits were considered mixed-dispersal. After excluding fruits for which the sample size was too small, 37 species were included in the final analysis.

The researchers found detectable levels of alcohol in 78 per cent of the fruit species, and those likely to be dispersed by mammals had higher levels of alcohol. The highest concentration of alcohol, detected in a hog plum (Spondias mombin), was more than 1.5 per cent.

Mammals might find alcohol attractive because it indicates a ripe, sugary fruit that provides more nutrition, the researchers say. Previous studies have found that animals such as lemurs and monkeys have a preference for fruit with a higher alcohol content.

""Mammals in particular use their sense of smell to find food,"" says Casorso. ""Ethanol is one odour amongst the many aromas that fruits produce and the fruits might be using alcohol to attract dispersers.""

Although plants don't produce alcohol themselves, they evolved to grow large, fleshy fruits with fermentable sugars in the early Cretaceous Period. Around the same time, yeasts evolved to ferment sugars and produce ethanol. Yeasts also benefit from the interaction with mammals, because the animals help to disperse their spores.

While the alcohol level in individual fruits is quite low, Casorso says that small-bodied mammals may accumulate quite a significant amount of blood alcohol by consuming large amounts of fruit. As a result, many mammals have evolved enzymes that process alcohol and the intoxicating chemicals it is converted into.

Sowing grasses and wildflowers among solar panels can bring big increases in bees and aid crop pollination in nearby fields, a four-year study in the US suggests.

The expansion of solar energy is sometimes seen as a threat to the environment because of the large amounts of land required, but solar developments can be designed to restore habitat and bring biodiversity gains.

How was rhubarb found to be edible when it isn't palatable raw?



29 March 2023

How was rhubarb found to be edible? It certainly isn’t palatable raw.

Chris Robinson London, UK

As a child in the north of England, I was often kept quiet with a stick of rhubarb and a saucer of sugar: dip and bite. I imagine that the many periods of starvation in human history expanded the boundary of what is considered edible.

Young squash bugs eat adults' poo to stock up on healthy bacteria

Squash bugs need certain kinds of gut bacteria to survive, but young nymphs don't get any from their parents - so they have to acquire them by eating other adults' faeces

Shortly after hatching, young squash bugs go on a mission to find and eat adults' faeces so they can acquire bacteria they need to survive. They are forced into this unusual behaviour because they don't inherit the vital bacteria from their parents.

Squash bugs (Anasa tristis) are agricultural pests that commonly attack courgette, also known as zucchini, and pumpkin crops in North and Central America.

The bugs have a symbiotic relationship with Caballeronia bacteria, which live in their guts and are crucial for their growth, development and survival.

Other species that require symbiotic bacteria, like stink bugs, get immediate access at birth because their mothers leave bacteria-rich faeces on top of their eggs.

However, squash bugs aren’t left the same inheritance, says Scott Villa at Davidson College in North Carolina. “Squash bugs need [these bacteria] to live, yet, for such an important piece of their lives, parents do not simply give it to their offspring,” he says. “Instead, they basically leave it up to each generation to find it on their own in the environment.”

Villa and his colleagues discovered that newborn squash bugs – called nymphs – do this by seeking out and feeding on the faeces of adult squash bugs, which are packed with Caballeronia bacteria.

A monthly celebration of the biodiversity of our planet's animals, plants and other organisms.

The team placed nymphs in an arena in which they could choose to move towards saline solution or adult faeces. In 99 per cent of trials, the nymphs headed to the faeces, which they liquefied with their saliva and slurped into their mouths.

Separate experiments found that the nymphs could still locate adult faeces in the dark and from long distances away.

The nymphs had been provided with ample summer squash to munch on, so they didn't appear to be eating the faeces out of hunger. Plus, once they had acquired Caballeronia bacteria, they didn't seek out any more faeces and concentrated on eating the summer squash.

Interestingly, the nymphs mostly avoided the faecal matter of a related species called Anasa andresii, even though it also contained Caballeronia bacteria, suggesting that the nymphs are precisely attuned to the faeces of their own species.

Villa believes that squash bug parents don’t need to directly pass their bacteria to their offspring because adults and nymphs live in close-knit communities, meaning there are ample adult faeces lying around for nymphs to feed on and acquire the bacteria themselves.

The researchers hope their findings will lead to new strategies for eliminating the pests from crops.

“Squash bugs can be a devastating pest, and we now know a key vulnerability in their life cycle,” says Villa. “If we can somehow break their ability to find their [bacteria] or remove their [bacteria] from the environment, we can halt population growth.”

Neolithic complex dubbed ""˜Stonehenge of the North' opens to UK public

Two sections of the Thornborough Henges near Ripon, UK, have been donated to the public body Historic England in an effort to preserve the millennia-old monuments

Thornborough Henges, a Neolithic complex near Ripon in North Yorkshire, UK, known as the ""Stonehenge of the North"", has been donated to public ownership and is now open to visitors.  

The site dates from 3500 to 2500 BC and features three earth circles, each 4 metres high and 200 metres across. The earthworks were probably used as ceremonial gathering places and trading centres by early Britons, archaeologists believe. 

Two of the three henges have been donated to the public body Historic England by building firm Tarmac. They are now under the care of the charity English Heritage and are free for the public to visit. Lightwater Holdings, a local company, has also donated parts of the wider monument.

The henges are ""a link to our ancient ancestors, through thousands of years, inspiring a sense of wonder and mystery"", Duncan Wilson at Historic England said in a statement.

""We are thrilled to have acquired this highly significant site for the nation, ensuring that these magnificent monuments are safe and will be preserved for generations to come.""

The transfer of ownership means the two earthworks will be removed from Historic England's risk register. They have been on the register since 2009, over concerns the sites were being eroded by livestock and rabbits.  

Today, all three henges are visible as large, circular banks, but thousands of years ago, they would have stood above wetlands. They may have been covered in a sulphate mineral known as gypsum, creating white landmarks visible for miles.  

The site's opening to the public will bring its story to new audiences, according to Kate Mavor at English Heritage. ""Thornborough Henges is one of the most important ancient sites in Britain and yet almost completely unknown. We are looking forward to sharing its significance, its stories and its secrets with the public,"" she said in a statement.

The ancient process of fermentation could help to produce plant-based cheese that more closely resembles the texture and flavour of traditional cheese.

Plant-based alternatives to animal-derived food are becoming increasingly popular, in part because of the environmental impact of livestock farming, but vegan cheeses have so far struggled to gain popularity with consumers.

Plant proteins behave differently from animal proteins, making it difficult to replicate the texture and flavour of dairy cheese. Most vegan cheeses are derived from starch and…

For much of the 20th century, boom and bust cycles of desert grasses in the US Southwest were linked to long-term cycles of temperature in the Pacific Ocean. That link now appears to have been broken, possibly due to climate change. This could complicate efforts to restore grasslands that support biodiversity and grazing livestock.

The Chihuahuan desert extends from the US Southwest into Mexico over more than 500,000 square kilometres. It contains some of the most biodiverse grasslands on…

Male chicks are more sociable if they were grown in warmer eggs

Increasing the temperature of egg incubators by 1°C or 2°C has shown promise to help chickens cope with rising global temperatures. Now, research suggests it also makes male chicks more sociable and potentially less aggressive as adults

Rising global temperatures mean that many researchers are looking for ways to stop farmed chickens from overheating. This could involve exposing eggs to slightly higher temperatures during incubation, with previous research suggesting promising outcomes.

However, the behavioural consequences in adult chickens of this approach are less clear, particularly in terms of how it could affect the sociability and aggressiveness of males, which influences flock well-being.

A non-standard approach to celebrating World Standards Day

Feedback ponders the logic behind the choice to mark World Standards Day on different occasions, depending on where you live, as well as looking into sheep counting, and the workings of the middle ear muscle

By Marc Abrahams

Double standards

World Standards Day 2023 will arrive soon, two days after it arrives. As Feedback noted last year (17 September 2022), having double Standards Days is standard behaviour.

This year, most of the world will officially celebrate World Standards Day on 14 October. The date is specified by a consortium of three organisations: the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).

The United States of America (which these days are less united than they used to be - except in celebrating World Standards Day) officially celebrates World Standards Day on 12 October. That date is specified by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), an organisation long dogged by standards confusion. Two decades ago, Occupational Hazards magazine published this comment: “One area of confusion for safety professionals, design engineers, machine builders and users… revolves around the enforceability of [ANSI’s] consensus standards.”

The 2023 world celebration has an official slogan (“SHARED VISION FOR A BETTER WORLD”), an official poster, an official web banner, an official email signature, an official Zoom background and ever so much more. Lengthiest of all, there is a downloadable 20-page Visual Identity Guide, which specifies that logos for the special day “shall not be used in any way that could disparage the IEC, ISO and ITU brands, mislead users, create false impressions, or cause confusion”.

Not a job for AI

Anna Butcher - whose name looks like, but may not be, an example of nominative determinism - tells Feedback that attempts to use artificial intelligence to count sheep (Feedback, 29 July) are based on ignorance. Anna explains:

“We farmers can only shake our heads at what is to us a ludicrous idea of counting sheep with AI. Counting sheep accurately is quite a skill, a skill that many Australian livestock producers and stock agents have. Sheep aren’t counted individually, but in twos or fives. It is usually done in the yards, not in the paddocks (fields), and is very well done - usually to the exact number even if the mob is in the hundreds! It takes a matter of minutes and I can assure you it is neither onerous or sleep inducing.

To count the hundreds, you put some small rocks in your pocket and transfer them to your hand. Counting of sheep in the field is far too onerous and inaccurate; the sheep may be resting under vegetation or hidden in a far corner of a paddock; if disturbed they don’t stand still and may remain unaccounted for.”

Anna sent the photo you see to the left, of a countable number of Dorper ewes and lambs.

Laws of all kinds

For anyone who likes laws - laws of any and all kinds - the place to be in 2023 was the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina in Halle. On 28 and 29 September, people assembled there for an event called “Law(s): Rules of reality - rules for reality“.

The “broad spectrum of laws of God and nature, rules and regularities is at the heart of this year’s Annual Assembly of the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina”, explains a press release. Among the touted topics: “rules and regularities in the natural, human and social sciences”, “the concept of ‘right’ and “wrong’ in mathematics”, “the legalities of musical freedom” and “various religious laws”.

Feedback savours one particular difference between scientific laws and judicial laws: what happens when a law gets broken.

When a behaviour - any behaviour at all - undeniably conflicts with a scientific law, scientists conclude that that law is wrong and needs correction. But when a behaviour undeniably conflicts with a judicial law, the judicial system concludes that that behaviour was wrong and needs correction. Public discussions, especially in courtrooms and political arenas, don’t always make that distinction.

Inner (ear) harmony

Simon Leach explains how he uses a trivial superpower - of a kind recently added to Feedback’s catalogue of trivial superpowers - to explore the arts. He says:

“After reading about Rob Holmes’ trivial superpower of flexing his middle ear muscle (stapedius, the smallest muscle in the human body) [Feedback, 15 July], I realised that I have the same superpower. Further, by voluntary contractions, I can play a bass line in a tune. Only for my own consumption of course. I am currently playing the theme tune of Thunderbirds. I can also voluntarily open my Eustachian tubes, a boon when flying. I attribute my superpower to repeated episodes of otitis media when young.”

Honeybees benefit from strips of native plants embedded in farmland

Prairie strips, areas of wild vegetation within intensive farms, are associated with bee colonies collecting more pollen, growing larger and having better winter survival rates

Small areas of native plants strategically placed in and around fields of soya and corn (maize) seem to improve honeybee colony health and performance in areas of intensive farming.

So-called prairie strips are being introduced in the US Midwest as part of a US Conservation Reserve Program policy aiming to improve water quality and biodiversity and reduce soil erosion.

Ants independently evolved to farm fungus at least twice

Fungus farming by ants has evolved independently in populations separated by the Atlantic Ocean - the latest example was observed in cocktail ants in Cameroon, which cultivate fungus to build their nests

In warm regions of the Americas, leafcutter ants farm the fungus that they eat, gathering bits of greenery to feed it. An entire ocean away, one species of ant in Africa uses a very similar fungus cultivation technique. The findings suggest that this complex ant-fungus relationship has evolved independently at least twice.

The nearly 50 species of leafcutter ant tirelessly carve and shuttle pieces of leaves back to their expansive subterranean nests, where they feed the bounty to a fungal culture…

Algae-farming fish help coral reefs bounce back from bleaching events

The presence of territorial farmerfish that look after algae gardens seems to help branching corals recover after heat stress has bleached them, but we aren't sure why

Farmerfish are territorial and protect their algae gardens

ArteSub/Alamy

Fish that tend patches of stringy algae seem to shield branching corals from the worst effects of marine heat waves and help them recover after bleaching.

In 2019, the reefs near the French Polynesian island of Moorea in the South Pacific Ocean endured their worst heat stress event in 14 years. Because of some six weeks of unusually warm waters, branching corals there bleached en masse, in which they lose the symbiotic algae living in them that supply most of their food.

Peter Singer on animal rights, octopus farms and why AI is speciesist

Controversial author Peter Singer, who inspired the animal rights movement, explains why killing humanely reared animals may be a defensible ethical position and why he has rewritten Animal Liberation for the 21st century

By Madeleine Cuff

31 May 2023

NABIL NeZZAR

PETER SINGER’s book Animal Liberation was a “philosophical bombshell” when it came out in 1975, according to activist Ingrid Newkirk, who says it “made people - myself included - change what we ate, what we wore and how we perceived animals”.

Singer, now a professor of bioethics at Princeton University, provided a philosophical argument for overhauling humanity’s treatment of animals, condemning practices such as animal testing and meat eating on the grounds that animals had as much right to live free from pain and suffering as humans.

Although it helped inspire the modern animal-rights movement, Singer’s views on animal ethics were, for a long time, far from mainstream. For decades, vegetarians and vegans were treated by many other people with equal parts bemusement and exasperation. Factory farms flourished.

Now, we have a deeper understanding of the intelligence of many animals, from pigs to octopuses, as well as evidence to show that veganism - which is more popular than ever - is good for our health and the environment. And yet global meat and fish consumption is still rising, plans are afoot for the world’s first octopus farm and escalating climate change is driving many animals to extinction. Against this backdrop, Singer has revised Animal Liberation for a 21st-century audience.

He tells New Scientist how his thinking on animal rights has changed, why beef should be taxed to help the people affected by climate change and what an ethical life looks like now.

Madeleine Cuff: For those who aren’t familiar with your arguments, where do you stand on humanity’s treatment of animals?

Peter Singer: I think the core arguments I made in 1975 have…

Thousands of animal and plant species in decline across the UK

Conservation organisations call for expansion of nature-friendly farming to stem the ongoing loss of the UK's wildlife

One-sixth of species assessed in a comprehensive study on the state of UK nature is at risk of disappearing from England, Scotland and Wales. The conservation organisations behind the report are calling for an urgent expansion of nature-friendly farming schemes to halt the ongoing loss of UK wildlife.

""We’ve never had a better understanding of the state of nature in the UK and what is needed to fix it,"" says Richard Gregory at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. The RSPB is a member of the State of Nature partnership that delivered the landmark report along with over 60 organisations, including The Wildlife Trusts and governmental bodies such as Natural England.

Out of more than 10,000 animal, plant and fungus species assessed for their extinction risk in Britain, the report reveals that 151 are extinct and almost 1500 are threatened with extinction. Assessments of 2508 species found in Northern Ireland found that 281 are threatened with extinction from the island of Ireland.

The abundance of more than 700 land and freshwater species in the UK has declined by 19 per cent, on average, since 1970, the study found. This average figure includes a decline in 38 per cent of land and freshwater species and an increase in the abundance of 27 per cent of these species. Among seabirds, the abundance of 13 species has fallen by 24 per cent, on average, since 1986.

According to the report, the area occupied by more than 4900 invertebrates, such as bees, ladybirds and dragonflies, dropped by 13 per cent, on average, between 1970 and 2020. For small mammals such as mice, voles and shrews, the area they inhabited shrank by 29 per cent, on average, between 1970 and 2016. The distribution of 54 per cent of flowering plants, such as heather, has also declined.

Key drivers of biodiversity loss in the UK, which is ""one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world"", include intensive farming, climate change and unsustainable fishing and forestry, says Gregory.

On a positive note, localised efforts to restore nature have led to the recovery of species such as the Duke of Burgundy butterfly (Hamearis lucina) and natterjack toads (Epidalea calamita), he says. ""We just need to do it on a larger scale.""

In line with international biodiversity targets agreed in Montreal, Canada, last year, known as the Global Biodiversity Framework, the UK has agreed to restore 30 per cent of land and sea by 2030. ""Taking action will be good for people's well-being, mental health, and support healthy food, fibre and clean air,"" says Gregory.

The latest report is an update on the last assessment in 2019, which found similar results, although they aren't directly comparable, says Gregory. ""The basket of nature we're measuring now is slightly different from 2019, and the methods we're applying now are more sophisticated as well.""

UK will 'pause' publication of data showing biodiversity in decline

Although the latest ""catalogue of catastrophe"" is necessary and important, previous reports have shown much the same thing, says broadcaster Chris Packham.

""If, in four years' time, I'm reading another one of these reports and it's another catalogue of decline and decay, and nothing has happened, then, frankly, I and my generation of conservationists are simply not worth their salt,"" he says.

On 28 September, Packham will join dozens of organisations in protests calling for stronger policies to support nature-friendly farming, fishing and forestry in the UK. ""My view is that agricultural schemes that support biodiversity need to be mandatory, need massive public investment and they need to be decentralised so farmers are empowered to adapt them to their farms.""

Around 2 billion people don't have access to clean drinking water

An international pledge to ensure that all the world's population has access to safe drinking water by 2030 is woefully off track, according to a major UN report

Around 2 billion people don’t have access to safe drinking water, a major United Nations report has found.

Several factors are to blame, says Richard Connor at the UN, the report's lead author. Rising urban populations, expanding agriculture, a lack of waste water-treatment infrastructure and climate change all play a role, he says.

The UN World Water Development Report is being published as the UN's first major conference on water since 1977 gets under way in New York.

It is intended as an update on progress towards ensuring that everyone in the world has access to safe drinking water by 2030 - one of the UN’s sustainable development goals adopted in 2015.

This goal is severely off track, says Connor. ""Achieving universal coverage by 2030 will require a quadrupling of the current rates of progress in the provision of water and supply services.""

The report has found that the global demand for water has risen by 1 per cent each year for the past 40 years and will continue to rise at a similar rate for the next 30 years. ""This growth in demand is concentrated in emerging economies and lower-income countries,"" says Connor. In particular, urban water demand is projected to increase by 80 per cent by 2050.

The provision of adequate waste water-treatment infrastructure isn’t keeping up with this increase in demand, the report found. It says 80 per cent of the world's waste water flows back into the environment without being treated or reused. Consequently, at least 2 billion people use a source of drinking water that is contaminated with faeces, which puts them at risk of contracting various diseases, such as cholera.

Climate change is likely to make it even harder to access clean water around the world, says Connor. Seasonal water scarcity will become more common in parts of the world that don’t currently experience such issues and more acute in regions where it is already a major problem, he says.

The global urban population facing water shortages is projected to increase from 933 million people in 2016 to 2.4 billion people in 2050, with India projected to be the most affected country.

The report also found that 46 per cent of the world's population, making up 3.6 billion people, lack access to a toilet or latrine that disposes of human waste safely. Connor says the lack of access to water and sanitation around the world comes down to insufficient political will and priority-setting.

""Water tends to be seen more as a social or environmental issue and so doesn't receive the same political attention because it's not seen as a driver of the economy,"" he says.

We can't engineer our way out of the water crisis in the Southwest US

Connor says he hopes this year's UN water conference will lead to the development of more realistic goals surrounding water. ""Instead of going for the moon and saying that every single person on Earth should have access to all of these services, I would like to see something more realistic and make it a binding agreement that states are responsible to meet.""

""We are clearly not on track,"" says Claire Seaward at WaterAid. ""What is clear is that a monumental shift in ambition and approach is needed.”

""There is no magic bullet to this. What it really requires is that we all come together to strengthen the whole of the water and sanitation system,"" she says.

It is unlikely that we will achieve clean water for all, even by 2050, says Greg Pierce at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""Although it is already a focus, doubling down on institutional and governance reforms may yield more substantial progress than we have seen to date.”

Cannabis has a shocking environmental cost - here's how to fix it

Cannabis farms can compete with communities for water

When California legalised the recreational use of cannabis in 2016, Houston Wilson saw an opportunity to study the plant's environmental impact. To say his research has been challenging would be an understatement. He was refused official permission to visit farms in 2018 because some of his funding comes from US federal sources - and cannabis is still illegal at the federal level. Even meeting marijuana growers in neutral venues proved difficult, because some farmers were still unwilling to talk after operating outside…

Scaring up scary ways to scare birds

Feedback looks at a variety-show approach to let crops grow in noisy, blinding peace

By Marc Abrahams

26 July 2023

Multi-scare the birds

What does it take to scoot birds away from a field? More, maybe, than you might imagine.

Augustina Pruteanu and colleagues at the National Institute of Research-Development for Machines and Installations Designed for Agriculture and Food Industry in Romania recently gave their take at a conference in Jelgava, Latvia.

Their report, “Review of effectiveness of visual and auditory bird scaring techniques in agriculture“, advises that: “At present, there is no bird control technique that provides maximum protection for crops, so it is recommended to use a combination of scaring methods at the same time, namely: acoustics (propane cannons, pyrotechnic cartridges, speakers, etc.), visually (balloons, mirrors, reflective tapes, kites, lasers, drones, etc.) and physical (nets).”

The report doesn’t discuss what else (bees? mice? worms? farmhands?) might be scared away by that same vast array of sights, sounds and objects.

On some farms, simplicity, if done trickily, might be enough. In 2019, Zihao Wang at the University of Sydney, Australia, and his colleagues advised reducing the “What does it take?” problem to a mind game.

In a report called “Psychological warfare in vineyard: Using drones and bird psychology to control bird damage to wine grapes“, published in the journal Crop Protection, they contend that cunning and a single drone are sufficient to protect a small vineyard.

Disturbingly winning

Hazel Russman humbly lays claim to a trivial superpower of staggering worth. This is a potentially controversial addition to Feedback’s expanding catalogue of trivial superpowers.

Russman writes: “When I was a small child, I used to guess the winners of horse races for my father… Unfortunately he never took my tips seriously or he might have made some money from them.

“One year I managed to give him the spring double: Early Mist for the Grand National and Sailing Light for the Lincolnshire. Another year it was Never Say Die to win the Derby.

“Some years ago, I mentioned to a work colleague that I could do this as a child but had no idea how. He was greatly amused and handed me a newspaper with the day’s racing in view. He pointed to one race and said, ‘Who’s going to win this one then?’ I skimmed through the names of the runners and one immediately jumped out at me. ‘Quest For Fame’ I said. The next day he gave me a very queer look and asked, ‘How do you do it?'”

Russman says she is well aware of certain uncertainties: “I have never tried to do anything like this since. When I was a child, it was fun, but now it seems distinctly creepy.

“And of course there are numerous fictional accounts of people who come to grief from trying to use such gifts for profit.”

Androids dreaming

Counting imaginary sheep while lying abed helps dozy people bring on sleep, some of them like to say. Counting real sheep in a field or a barn helps wakeful farmers keep track of potential milk and mutton and wool.

The problem is how to count those real sheep accurately and efficiently. This being the 2020s, artificial intelligence (broad and vague though the phrase is) comes to the rescue!

China is home to much of the new, artificially cogitational sheep-counting research. Jianming Xu and his colleagues at Shaoyang University write in the journal IEEE Access about their “Sheep counting method based on multiscale module deep neural network“.

They explain the problem: “it is very challenging to accurately count sheep in the sheep farm due to the mutual occlusion between sheep and the change of illumination”. The traditional humans-looking-at-sheep method, they remind us, “is very time-consuming, labor-consuming and error prone”. And though they don’t say it, maybe sleep-inducing.

Xuefeng Deng at Shanxi Agricultural University and colleagues developed an alternative method, “A real-time sheep counting detection system based on machine learning“.

Yuanyang Cao and colleagues at China Agricultural University are among the many researchers jazzing up new sheep-tallying algorithms - mathematical tools that can shear some inefficiency off the computation.

The science isn’t just about sheep. Yu Zhang and colleagues at Sichuan Agricultural University worked on “An integrated goat head detection and automatic counting method based on deep learning“.

Others are labouring to better count cow heads. Livestock per-capita computation may be entering a golden age, presaged kinda sorta by the title of Philip K. Dick’s 1968 book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?

Lying and lying

Andy Maloney gives lie, in two senses, to Feedback’s list of trivial superpowers.

He says: “Reading in your column about trivial superpowers, I thought I should tell you about my own. I can always tell if someone is lying just by looking at them… I can also tell, just by looking at them, if they are standing up.”

Milk may have fuelled a growth spurt in ancient Europeans

An analysis of ancient human skeletons finds that an increase in size and weight in some regions coincided with the rise of lactose tolerance

People in northern and central Europe increased in size between 7000 and 4000 years ago, while people elsewhere stayed the same height or got smaller, a study has found.

The growth of some Europeans was probably caused by them evolving lactose tolerance earlier, the researchers say.

The ability to produce the enzyme lactase into adulthood and digest milk is believed to have played a significant role in the health and evolution of ancient humans.

Studies have suggested that those who were able to consume milk without health complications were able to overcome acute famine, making lactase persistence spread through natural selection.

To measure the impact of lactose tolerance on the size of humans, Jay Stock at Western University in Ontario, Canada, and his colleagues collated data on 3507 skeletons from 366 archaeological sites in seven regions – the Levant, southern, central, and northern Europe, the Nile Valley, South Asia and China – going back to 30,000 years ago.

The researchers used skeletal measurements to estimate the specimens' heights and the size of weight-bearing joints to estimate their weights.

They found that the global mean height for men and women declined from 30,000 years ago onwards, reaching its minimum between 8000 and 6000 years ago. But in central Europe, stature increased between 7000 and 4000 years ago, while in northern Europe it increased between 8000 and 2000 years ago. Similar trends were seen for body mass.

The earliest evidence of dairy production is from around 9000 years ago in western Asia, from where it spread around the world, reaching central Europe at least 7400 years ago.

The authors theorise that the exceptional growth resulted from those European peoples becoming lactose tolerant, which allowed them to gain more nutrition from milk. In other parts of the world at this time, people only consumed fermented dairy goods, such as yogurt and cheese, which contain less lactose.

Although the data can’t prove that lactase persistence was the cause, the researchers argue that it is a compelling explanation. ""We’re showing that the timing and the geography of body size increase corresponds with what we see in lactase persistence, and lactose is such an important component of diet as it provides very, very energy-rich, nutrient-rich sources of food,"" says Stock.

However, the study found that people in Britain actually got smaller in the same period, despite being early milk drinkers.

""The authors have done some pretty fantastic stuff on stature, estimating body mass and how they changed through time. But I see no systematic, numerical analysis to suggest it is much more than a guess that selection was stronger on lactase at this time when we see increases in body mass,"" says Mark Thomas at University College London.

Previous research has suggested that humans became smaller when they abandoned a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to cultivate crops, as relying on a single crop would have been less nutritious.

But the new study found strong evidence that people were getting smaller before they shifted to agriculture, hinting that there was another cause for their declining stature, says Thomas.

These 6 tipping points could be catastrophic for humanity, says the UN

Systems that humans depend on could collapse if we don't take action to address groundwater depletion, melting glaciers and space debris, according to a UN report

By Chen Ly

The world is in danger of hitting six interconnected ""tipping points"" that could have catastrophic impacts on both people and the planet, according to a report by a United Nations think tank. They include mounting space debris, depleting groundwater and the melting of mountain glaciers.

Tipping points are critical thresholds in natural and societal systems that are reached when the system can no longer provide its expected function. Caitlyn Eberle at the United Nations University (UNU) in Germany and her colleagues have identified the key tipping points that connect the physical climate system to society. ""We wanted to look at what point all these physical changes will lead to people experiencing this risky future,"" says Eberle.

The first is species extinctions, which are being accelerated by human activities and now occur at more than 10 times the natural rate. If too many species are wiped out in quick succession, it could trigger even more extinctions and lead to ecosystem collapses.

Many people rely on underground water reservoirs for drinking and agriculture. If this groundwater is depleted quicker than it is naturally replenished, then food production could be seriously hindered.

The meltwater from mountain glaciers is another vital source of water. Once glaciers reach what is known as ""peak water"", which is when they provide the maximum amount of water run-off, then the supply will slowly decline. In many glaciers around the world, including ones in Europe and South America, this threshold has already been passed.

Around 75 per cent of all the monitored objects in Earth's orbit are junk. If the planet's orbit gets too crowded with this space debris, that will lead to collisions that could destroy satellites.

""If we lose these eyes in the sky, we lose that ability to better monitor things like biodiversity or weather,"" says team member Jack O'Connor at the UNU.

Temperature records have been smashed across the planet in recent years, with heatwaves becoming increasingly commonplace. With further warming, we are likely to see heatwaves so intense that even healthy young people could die.

The last tipping point is when it gets too costly for most people to insure their property against extreme weather events or natural disasters. By 2030, it is predicted that over 500,000 homes in Australia will be too expensive to insure due to flooding risks.

Do back-to-back disasters show first climate tipping point is upon us?

Some of these tipping points have already been crossed, says Eberle: groundwater has been depleted in parts of Saudi Arabia and extreme temperatures near the limits of human survivability have been observed in Asia.

""To avoid these tipping points, we need to move towards what we call transformation and really change the system,"" says O'Connor. For instance, “we need to start considering the risk of rising heat in how we build our cities"".

""All of these things are caused by those human behaviours and acts and values,"" says Eberle. ""We have the power to sort of shift our mindsets. This transformation needs to be on an individual level right the way up to governments.""

""Considering how shocks can originate and spread through socio-ecological networks is an important and under-researched field, to which this report is a welcome contribution,"" says David Armstrong McKay at the University of Exeter, UK. ""While the issues highlighted by this report are important, not all of them feature this critical self-sustaining tipping dynamic and framing all of them as ""˜risk tipping points' risks further confusion on what we mean by tipping points.""

A flowering shrub in California's Death Valley is one of the most heat-tolerant plants known to science and could hold clues for engineering crops that can cope with rising temperatures.

Most agricultural crops are unable to withstand temperatures above 35°C (95°F), meaning our food sources could be affected as climate change worsens.

What we can do to let the UK's tamed rivers flow wild and free again

In the UK, 97 per cent of rivers have been modified, blocked and otherwise corralled to suit our needs - with enormous damage to wildlife. Here's how we can reverse the damage we've done

By Graham Lawton

Abbey weir on the UK's river Avon is a barrier to fish

Abbey weir on the UK's river Avon is a barrier to fish

Margaret Clavell/Alamy

WHEN I visited the river Derwent in Yorkshire in March, the landscape wasn’t as I remembered it from my youth. Normally, the floodplains would be inundated with water and the whole river system feel like a miniature recreation of the vast glacial lake that covered this part of northern England after the ice sheets last retreated. But an unusually dry February meant that floodwater was lacking. On the upside, it allowed me to approach the river across an area of grassland called Wheldrake Ings, which is a haven for rare plants.

The word “ings” derives from the Old Norse word for a water meadow. This was once Danelaw, an area administered by Vikings from Jorvik (now York), and their language is still etched on the landscape. In fact, this stretch of the Derwent looks much as it would have when Danish berserkers invaded in the late 9th century. That is a far cry from most UK rivers. Many have been heavily modified to suit our needs: blocked by dams and other barriers, corralled, straightened, widened or narrowed, disconnected from floodplains, sucked dry for drinking water and encroached on by housing estates and business premises. A river with no such obstructions or canalisation is called “free flowing”. Just 3 per cent of rivers in the UK fit that description.

This is an environmental disaster. Free-flowing rivers are a valuable part of healthy landscapes and ecosystems. They provide various ecological benefits, from carrying sediment and purifying water to allowing fish to migrate. How can we reverse the damage we have done and help our rivers run free again?

Humanity has been trying to tame rivers for millennia and, today, the results are clear to see. In 2019, when a team at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and their colleagues produced the first global map of free-flowing rivers, they found that only about a quarter of very long rivers - those in excess of 1000 kilometres - are unobstructed along their entire length. These are almost all in remote regions of the Arctic and the Amazon and Congo basins. More encouragingly, 80 per cent of medium rivers (between 100 and 500 kilometres) and 97 per cent of short rivers (between 10 and 100 kilometres) were classified as free flowing. However, the researchers warned that those numbers are probably vastly inflated because their analysis excluded small barriers. This is especially true of highly developed regions in Europe and North America; the overwhelming majority of truly free-flowing rivers are in remote areas.

Shipping channels

More recently, a European Union project called Amber (Adaptive Management of Barriers in European Rivers) concluded that 3 per cent of UK rivers flow unobstructed. That is very low by global standards, but perhaps not surprising given the long history of river modification in this small, crowded country. One of the earliest approaches was what is now called channelisation, which entails raising riverbanks, deepening the channel, consolidating separate streams known as braids and sometimes straightening out meanders. Historically, this had two main purposes, according to Susanne Muhar at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna, Austria. The first, and foremost, was to improve navigability for shipping, which is why it is also called canalisation. The second was to control flooding by segregating a river from its floodplains, with the knock-on benefit of draining floodplains, which could then be used for agriculture and settlement.

Until the industrial revolution, channelisation in the UK was quite benign, but the advent of steam power upped the ante considerably, says Muhar. River navigation came under intense competition from the railways and responded by fighting fire with fire: steam-powered watercraft became larger and there were extensive “improvements” to rivers. This process continued throughout the 20th century, compounded by the fact that channelisation was also employed to speed up river flow to help flush away industrial effluents.

Similar pressures were changing the course of rivers in other industrialising countries. Much of the early research on the detrimental ecological effects of channelisation was done in the US. It wasn’t until 1983 that geographers made the first such survey of rivers in England and Wales. They found that, in the previous half century, 8500 of around 35,000 kilometres of the main rivers had been subjected to major channelisation. (This was a much higher proportion than in the US, which had a “channelisation density” of 0.003 kilometres per square kilometre, compared with 0.06 in England and Wales.) Most of the rest was managed to some extent, including vegetation cutting and the removal of submerged ridges and banks to smooth out the flow.

Soon after, the Royal Geographical Society in London published a series of articles on problems associated with river channelisation. It concluded that the main impacts are twofold: on the river system itself and on the wildlife around it.

Unsurprisingly, the physical characteristics of a channelised river change dramatically; that is the whole point. The increased flow rate can cause a river to gouge ever deeper, further estranging it from its floodplains. This has knock-on effects downstream. If and when the river re-enters a non-channelised section, the flow rate decreases and masses of sediment are deposited, often requiring the next section to be channelised in a domino effect. This is what happened to the Danube in Austria, which is now completely channelised, according to Muhar. If a river has been channelised to reduce flooding, this often merely displaces the problem downstream, again inviting further channelisation. Then there is “retrograde erosion”, where the pull of the channelised section increases flow rates upstream, altering the course and depth of a river’s upper reaches and gouging out yet more sediment.

The negative effects on biodiversity result principally from homogenisation of the riverine habitat. Flow rates become more uniform, depriving aquatic species of their preferred water velocity. “You change the habitat structure,” says Ulrika Ã…berg at the International Union for Conservation of Nature in Gland, Switzerland. “You often get a very monotonous system that doesn’t have a large variety of riffles [shallow, turbulent zones] and pools and other morphological features that are important for the ecosystem.” Meanwhile, the removal of bankside vegetation can alter the water temperature and reduce the amount of nutrients falling in.

The value of a non-channelised river can be seen with the Derwent. The river itself supports many rare ecosystems and species, such as river lampreys and mats of vegetation that provide food and shelter for fish. And the floodplains are so important ecologically that much of Wheldrake Ings is a national nature reserve. Annual floods deposit masses of nutrient-rich sediment onto the ings, maintaining a rare, protected habitat called MG4 grassland. When I was there, it looked like an unremarkable field of turf. But this becomes a riotous flower meadow and, in late summer, will be a valuable hay crop, prized by specialist livestock farmers. “It’s a certain mix of plants and grasses,” says Craig Ralston at Natural England, which manages the reserve. “This area contains a significant proportion of [MG4 grassland], probably a third of the global resource, because it is globally confined to England and Wales.” The flooded ings also support an internationally significant influx of migrating waterfowl, with around 40,000 overwintering shovelers, teals, wigeons, Bewick’s swans, ruffs and golden plovers.

Nevertheless, not all is free flowing on the Derwent. Although largely unchannelised, except in its lowest reaches, it does have barriers that alter its flow and prevent the natural movement of sediment and animals. There are four old weirs upstream of Wheldrake, and downstream there is a large, modern lock-and-sluice system used to control water levels to enable the extraction of drinking water. There is also a tidal barrier at the river’s confluence with the Ouse at Barmby on the Marsh, which prevents brackish water entering and tainting the drinking water. “Human-induced changes in hydraulic conditions” is one of the major threats to the Derwent, according to the EU’s Natura 2000 programme, which has designated part of it a special protection area.

Obstacle course

Again though, the Derwent has far fewer barriers than many other UK rivers. In 2020, a team led by Carlos Garcia de Leaniz at Swansea University in the UK published an inventory of these obstacles across Europe: dams, weirs, sluices, culverts, fords, ramps and others, including small ones that had previously been overlooked. In the UK, they recorded 23,719 barriers on more than 68,000 kilometres of river. That suggests the UK has nearly 50,000 barriers in total, or about 0.7 per kilometre of river. The average for western Europe is 2.7, but that is heavily skewed by the Netherlands, which has 19.4 per kilometre.

One major problem with barriers is that they impede fish, especially migratory ones such as eels and lampreys, which swim far up and down rivers to complete their life cycles. On the Derwent, river lampreys are only found downstream of the lock, suggesting they can’t get through it. There are fish passes but they are “probably not very successful”, says Ralston. Critically endangered European eels also get stuck behind or in front of barriers. They migrate from the Sargasso Sea in the Atlantic deep up rivers across Europe and North Africa to mature, then return to the sea to breed many years later. River barriers are one factor in their precipitous 90 per cent decline since the 1980s, says eel expert Jack Wootton at the University of Hull, UK.

Barriers stop the natural movement of sediments too. “They get trapped, which means that the river downstream gets starved of sediment,” says Ã…berg, “When the river doesn’t get replenished by new sediment, the force of the water starts digging down into the bottom, so you can get a very strong incision.”

The obvious solution is to remove barriers where possible. “Often no one really knows what a weir was for,” says Wootton. “That isn’t the case for all weirs, dams and sluice gates, but for a significant amount of them, nobody has any want or need any more.” A key obstacle to getting rid of them is economic. “Money is an issue. You’re talking about hundreds of thousands of pounds, potentially, [for a stretch of river],” he says. Another issue is that removing seemingly redundant structures may have unintended consequences. Take the Derwent again. In the 1950s, engineers built up some of the riverbanks around Wheldrake to reduce the frequency of flooding. It would seem logical to raze them now, says Ralston. But climate change means that more water flows into the Derwent than before, so their removal might threaten the ings with excessive flooding. “That’s a really difficult one to solve,” he says.

Immovable barriers

Other barriers simply can’t be removed. These include hydropower dams and constructions designated as industrial heritage. Even where historic barriers aren’t protected, it may be impossible to get rid of them because of their settings. For example, says Ralston, a few years ago, Natural England was involved in a project to see whether it was feasible to remove a weir built in the 1800s on the Derwent at Howsham to serve a now-demolished watermill. As a trial, the water level of the millpond was lowered. This caused the water table to drop, leading to subsidence damage to the nearby ruins of Kirkham Priory, a grade I-listed medieval building, and the plan had to be shelved.

Where barriers can’t be removed, fish passes may at least help rescue biodiversity. They have been installed at dams for more than a century and are usually one of three types: a slippery slope, a ladder or an elevator. Slopes are water slides for fish; ladders are a series of small pools of increasing elevation to enable fish to jump a barrier in bite-sized chunks; elevators are holding tanks that accumulate fish and periodically hoist them over. “How successful they are is open to debate,” says Ralston. One problem is that they can be quite selective in the species they help. “A lot of them are very specific, usually focused on salmonids,” says Wootton.

Fish-pass technology is quite rudimentary and has barely advanced in a century, but now things are improving. A Seattle company called Whooshh Innovations is designing high-tech fish passages such as the Lampway, a water-filled Archimedes screw that transports lampreys over otherwise-insurmountable barriers. Some of these systems automatically record how many fish pass through so biologists can monitor populations. Other innovative solutions aren’t so high-tech. The Lough Neagh Fisherman’s Co-operative Society in Northern Ireland has perfected a pass called an eel rope. “It’s essentially a long, sausage-shaped bundle of straw that you drape over the top of a river barrier and it creates a climbing structure that eels can work their way up and over,” says Wootton. Each sausage costs peanuts. “I truly believe in 10 years, we will be looking at very, very different fish passes,” he says.

This is all well and good, but Ralston points out that fish passes don’t address the wider issue of water quality due to sedimentation around barriers. Only removing the obstacles will do that. Even then, remediation isn’t always possible. “If a dam is very large and has been in place for a very long time, it creates irreversible impacts,” says Ã…berg. Reversing the worst effects of channelisation may also be impossible. In many cases, the river has gouged a bed several metres lower than where it started, making it hard to reconnect to its floodplain. Besides, those floodplains are now often covered in houses and businesses that need flood protection.

One key lesson from all this is to value our remaining free-flowing rivers, because undoing the damage isn’t going to be cheap or easy. But the good news is that, if we embrace the challenge, we will have a surprising ally. What has been done can sometimes be undone simply by letting nature take its course, says Ã…berg. “Rivers can restore themselves if we just remove embankments and barriers and everything that constrains them.”

Human voices are scarier than a lion's growl for savannah animals

Animals at watering holes in South Africa were twice as likely to flee in response to recordings of humans talking compared with sounds of lions

Many animals in the savannah react most fearfully to human voices

People's voices frighten wildlife in the savannah even more than the growls and snarls of lions, suggesting that we are the scarier predator.

Giraffes, elephants, impalas, rhinoceroses, leopards and more than a dozen other species of mammals in a South African wildlife reserve ran away from loudspeakers twice as often when they heard the sounds of humans compared with those of lions, found a study led by Michael Clinchy at the University of Western Ontario in Canada.

""Theoretically, this is a protected area, so these animals should not be fearful of us,"" he says. ""But [our study implies that] if you're a wildlife tourist, or a poacher, or whatever, you're all going to be perceived as the same thing. The presence of the human is equally malignant, regardless of what type of human you are.""

Clinchy and his colleagues had already discovered that the fear of predators can cause species to decline in number. Wanting to find out which was the most feared, the team decided to test humans against lions ""” often perceived as the world's most fearsome predator on land, says Clinchy.



They set up loudspeakers and cameras on trees 10 metres away from animal paths near 21 waterholes in Greater Kruger National Park, South Africa, which hosts one of the largest remaining lion populations in the world.

A monthly celebration of the biodiversity of our planet's animals, plants and other organisms.

When animals approached the waterholes, the speakers automatically played back one of four kinds of audio recordings, all at the same volume. These included men and women speaking calmly in local languages and dialects, lions snarling and growling, gun shots with or without barking dogs and the calls of regional birds like hoopoes and wood owls.

Although the animals live inside a sanctuary, they can regularly hear visiting tourists speaking to each other, as well as guns and dogs during rare organised hunting events or illegal poaching.

The researchers captured 15,000 videos of 19 species of carnivores and herbivores reacting to their recordings. They found that wildlife ran around in response to human voices more than to any other sounds, and were also 40 per cent quicker to flee - abandoning the water hole even during the dry season - when hearing humans compared with lion or hunting sounds. The animals were unlikely to have learned these fear reactions through their limited exposure to humans, says Clinchy. ""It does seem to be ingrained.""

The only species that didn’t flee people's voices were the lions themselves. ""The lions didn't run from anything,"" he says.

The findings build on previous studies of animals' strongly fearful reactions to humans in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia, highlighting the damaging impact that our presence can have throughout wildlife habitats. ""Just the fear of us could potentially be having significant ecological consequences,"" says Clinchy.

Even so, the findings could lead to positive outcomes as well, he adds. Human vocal recordings might deter wildlife from entering crop fields or livestock farms, or even protect rhinoceroses from roaming in zones where horn poaching is more likely to occur.

Plants are spreading up mountains faster than thought in North America

From Mexico to Canada, mountain plants are moving upslope to cooler elevations. In some mountain ranges, the upward climb is as fast as 112 metres per decade

In the face of climate change, mountain plants in western North America are expanding into higher, cooler elevations faster than previously thought. But in some regions, the climbing isn't keeping up with rising temperatures.

As climate change ratchets up global temperature, plants and animals that have evolved to live within a specific set of environmental conditions are forced to quickly adjust to the new normal. One way for species to beat the heat is to move higher in elevation, where cooler conditions persist in the thinner atmosphere. Ecologists already knew that species respond to changes in their environment, says James Kellner at Brown University in Rhode Island. ""The question is, to what degree? And are they able to keep up?""

To learn more about the rate of vegetation shift, Kellner and his colleagues compared NASA Landsat satellite images of nine mountain ranges in western North America between 1984 and 2011.

""We’re talking about an absolutely enormous region of the world here, all the way from southern Mexico to the Canadian Rockies,"" says Kellner.

When the researchers looked at the mountain slopes' peak ""greenness"" - a measure of vegetation cover during the height of the growing season - they found a rapid shift: plants were moving an average of 67 metres higher per decade - more than four times faster than previously reported. In New Mexico, where vegetation was moving fastest, plants climbed over 112 metres per decade.

Warming isn't the only reason vegetation might move upslope. Changes in precipitation patterns, or ecological disturbances like farming, grazing livestock and fire could also be responsible for the skyward shift. But Kellner says finding this pattern across different mountain ranges suggests one common factor: rising temperatures.

""It’s pretty hard to think about any explanation for this [pattern] other than something that is operating consistently across nine mountain ranges between Mexico and Canada,"" says Kellner. Climate change has also impacted the amount and timing of precipitation in some ranges, but the pattern hasn't been steady across all regions.

Some plants' rapid climbing may still not be fast enough. When the team compared the measured speed of the upslope shift across five mountain ranges in the US with what would be predicted by recent warming, only plants in two ranges - in New Mexico and the Sierra Nevada - kept pace with climate change.

""If species are being pushed outside of the range in which they can have a viable, sustainable population,"" says Kellner, ""then we could be in a situation where we’re going to lose them.""

The nearly three-decade time span and geographic range analysed are major strengths of the study, says Sabine Rumpf at the University of Basel in Switzerland. But because the study looks at vegetation cover overall, Basel says the findings can't tell us what is happening with individual plant species.

""The problem is species shift so differently [from one another] - there is huge variation."" She says the findings are a ""wake-up call that species are already on the move"".

What does a Government Scientific Officer do?



Chris Downham, Government Scientific Officer - Bacteriology, SLSD - Animal & Plant Health Agency

What is the SLSD?...

I work for the Surveillance and Laboratory Services Department (SLSD), where we perform an array of diagnostic testing for disease in livestock and wildlife. I form part of the Bacteriology team where we culture & identify various pathogens, mainly bacteria but also some fungi. We often perform some basic diagnostics on suspect parasite cases looking specifically for Cryptosporidium on faecal smears using a staining process or general worm egg counts using a flotation method. We also perform further antimicrobial resistance (AMR) testing on certain bacteria such as Escherichia Coli, Salmonella & Staphylococci.

Other departments in our lab include the Category 3 Laboratory where they handle higher risk pathogens such as Tuberculosis, and the Molecular department which perform molecular diagnostic tests, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. I'm also part of the team responsible for conducting Contagious Equine Metritis (CEM) testing, which is a statutory screening test for the export & import of horses in many countries around the world such as the USA, the EU & Australia. CEM is an exotic notifiable disease in the UK and other countries. The samples we receive for CEM testing are from private clinics & export companies and are very time sensitive due to testing requirements.

My typical day and responsibilities...

A typical day in the lab includes a wide array of tasks, depending on the current season, certain disciplines may be busier than usual. Right now, we're heading into the busiest period for CEM testing so that will take up a large portion of my day, processing and booking in samples, setting up cultures and the daily checking of the ongoing cultures. CEM testing is a relatively slow process, requiring a daily check of every sample and each sample taking seven days from initial culture to final result.

 I'm also usually responsible for the Salmonella culture bench. This begins with the use of ""Brilliant Green"" agar and an enrichment selenite broth. The most common sample submitted for Salmonella testing is faeces, and as you can imagine these samples are teeming with all kinds of irrelevant bacteria. The selective media we use helps to kill & reduce the presence of any non-relevant bacteria and encourage the growth of Salmonella, making our job of identifying it much easier. The use of biochemical tests can be used to rule out suspicious colonies and serological testing is used to confirm the presence of Salmonella species. We usually have a good idea of a negative or positive result within 24 hours and can generally confirm a final result within 48 hours of the initial culture of each sample.

Some positive results, including Salmonella, E. coli & Staph. species are tested for antimicrobial resistance. This is done using a disk diffusion technique on specialist agar and measuring the zones of resistance against pre-determined parameters. This is done for treatment purposes (identifying a resistance before attempting treatment saves time, money & helps reduce over-use of antibiotics of ineffective antibiotics) and serves as a surveillance tool for wider public health, acting as a first warning bell for potential second and third line antibiotic resistant organisms that could lead to outbreaks with serious consequences for human health.

The remainder of my day is usually spent completing routine maintenance & administrative tasks. We also regularly perform internal quality control and validation checks on everything from simple stains and individual reagents to more complicated assays & Analytical Profile Index (API) kits which usually involves running and logging a series of positive and negative controls. This helps ensure the accuracy and overall quality of our testing and fulfils one of the criteria to maintain our UKAS accreditation to ISO 17025.

The best part of my job...

The best part of my job is dealing with the unique or unusual samples, such as the suspect White Nose Syndrome (WNS) on a bat sample we received a few months ago. The causative organism of WNS, Pseudogymnoascus destructans is a slow growing, psychrophilic fungus that has devastated native bat populations in areas of North America - and so would be of special concern if a positive case was confirmed in this country, but thankfully the result came back negative.

I find cases such as these really grab my attention in the lab and help me learn and develop diagnostic techniques, I had otherwise not had opportunity to. One of my passions is wildlife and its conservation so I really enjoy the opportunity to work on any wildlife cases that come into my department.

The most challenging part of my job...

We're just leaving one of the most challenging seasons we usually see in the lab. At the beginning of spring local farmers begin lambing season and our volume of samples increases substantially. Many common infections such as Salmonella & Campylobacter can result in pregnant ewes losing a lamb, however, so can higher risk category 3 pathogens such as Brucella, Chlamydia & Q-Fever. These must be screened for before we can begin testing for the more common causes at containment level 2 which can create a bit of a juggling act in the lab as we rotate samples through appropriate stages of containment prior to testing. 

As we head into late autumn, we tend to see a massive increase to our sample volume for CEM testing. As these are very time sensitive samples it can be massively challenging to ensure everything is cultured within the right time window and often takes a great deal of team work to manage effectively.

I love my job because...

There is an extraordinary amount of variety in the samples we receive; the techniques we use & results we get. It's a fantastic environment in which you are constantly learning and developing your skills. There is also a great deal of satisfaction in getting a result and knowing you've helped in the process of a vet or farmer treating their animals and improving or saving animal's lives.

Advice to others... (What advice would you give to others who want a role like yours?)

I think laboratory experience is incredibly valuable & provides a fantastic entry point for working in health & disease. It does take a strong stomach most days, we're dealing directly with deceased wildlife and livestock - so it's not for the faint of heart or sensitive of nose. However, it's very rewarding work, full of variety and opportunities to learn and develop. 

Gaining direct work experience is very useful when applying to a role like this one, to both support your future applications and to explore the working environment. I'd strongly encourage anyone considering a career in laboratory focused work, such as diagnostics to consider reaching out to local centres either directly or through an organisation such as the STEM ambassador program to try and arrange a visit where possible.

My Plan B... (If it wasn't this job - what else would I be doing?)

Even before starting my Bachelors in Zoology, I'd always wanted to work in Ecology & Animal conservation to some effect. I'd maybe be somewhere in the field side of the effort, gathering samples or conducting surveys but I'm very glad I made the decision to go into lab diagnostic work and thankful for the opportunities it has provided me to grow as a scientist.

Silkworms genetically engineered to produce pure spider silk

Spider silk has been seen as a greener alternative to artificial fibres like nylon and Kevlar, but spiders are notoriously hard to farm. Now researchers have used CRISPR to genetically engineer silkworms that produce pure spider silk

Spider silk fibres produced by silkworms

Junpeng Mi, Donghua University

Silkworms have been genetically engineered with CRISPR to produce pure spider silk for the first time. The worms could offer a scalable way to create things like surgical thread or bulletproof vests from spider silk, which is prized for its strength, flexibility and lightness.

Spider silk has been eyed as a greener alternative to synthetic fibres, which are derived from fossil fuels and leach harmful microplastics into the environment. Farming silk from spiders themselves is difficult, however, because they tend to eat each other and only produce a small amount of silk fibre to make their webs. A 4-square-metre spider silk shawl that was displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, for example, had to be created from the silk of over 1 million golden orb-weaver spiders.

As a result, several groups have tried to genetically engineer silkworms so that they make spider silk instead of their own silk, since silkworms are easier to farm and spin much larger quantities of fibre. But until now, the silk produced by these modified silkworms has been less than 36 per cent spider silk.

Now, Junpeng Mi at Donghua University in China and his colleagues have used a more advanced genetic engineering technique - CRISPR - to insert the genes responsible for making spider silk proteins into silkworms.

The resulting silkworms produced silk that was 100 per cent spider silk and could withstand a stretching force of 1299 megapascals without breaking, making it 1.3 times stronger than nylon. Its toughness - the energy it could absorb under impact - was 319 megajoules per cubic metre, making it six times tougher than Kevlar.

As a bonus, the silkworms also naturally applied a protective coating to the spider silk, resembling that produced by spiders themselves. This is likely to result in the fibres being more durable than artificially created spider silk, says Mi. “This makes silkworms an all-in-one station for spider silk fibre production,” he says.

The engineered silkworms could enable cheap mass production of spider silk, which may be used as surgical suturing thread or in bulletproof vests, says Mi. The team has already experimented with using the spider silk as a suturing thread for stitching up incisions in rats and found that their wounds healed better than when traditional nylon threads were used, he says.

DNA from the bones and teeth of 1300 people who died up to 37,000 years ago has revealed what infectious diseases some of them had when they died - as well as how the incidence of some of these diseases changed over time. The findings show that animal diseases were much more likely to jump to humans after the advent of farming.

This is the first direct evidence that the domestication of animals led to…

Lab-grown meat can be environmentally sound

Published 24 May 2023

From Liz Specht, The Good Food Institute, Washington DC, US

Scientists developing cultivated meat agree that R&D-scale methods won’t work for large-scale production. The non-peer-reviewed environmental impact study you reported on assumed commercial production of cultivated meat would rely on pharmaceutical-grade media to feed the cells - which food manufacturers won’t need to use (13 May, p 11).

Its findings deviate from other published research and don’t reflect current or anticipated practices. Recent peer-reviewed data demonstrates that food-grade ingredients can support animal cell growth, and producers are actively developing the supply chain for these ingredients.

A peer-reviewed study in The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment, based on input from many cultivated meat companies and media suppliers, showed that producing cultivated meat at scale using renewable energy could lower climate emissions by 92 per cent and use 90 per cent less land than conventional beef.

Just as we wouldn’t assess the environmental impact of solar panels based on 1980s prototype production methods, we shouldn’t assess cultivated meat’s potential impact using R&D-scale processes. To deliver on cultivated meat’s potential to help satisfy growing demand for meat, reduce climate impacts and create space for more sustainable farming, governments must develop sustainable, large-scale production.

Kangaroo faeces may be able to help reduce the amount of methane produced by cows - a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions from farming.

Methane has a warming effect in the atmosphere that is almost 30 times more potent than that of carbon dioxide. Around half of global methane emissions come from ruminants like cattle and goats, which harbour a group of bacteria called methanogens in their stomachs. Methanogens scavenge and consume hydrogen gas - produced during the digestion of sugars -…

Photos of solar sheep and an eco-winery capture Italy's green journey

From sheep grazing in a field of solar panels to natural wine chilling, Islands of Energy by photographer Luigi Avantaggiato captures the greening of Italy at every scale

By Alison Flood

12 April 2023

Luigi Avantaggiato

THESE inquisitive sheep (pictured above) are on their way home after a hard day’s grazing among the 71 hectares of solar panels at a solar farm in Sant’Alberto, Italy, a small area about 14 kilometres north of Ravenna.

The solar farm works in synergy with the Buon Pastore dairy and sheep farm, with the sheep helping to maintain the turf areas. The solar panels are capable of generating a peak of 35 megawatts of electricity.

The project is one of several captured by photographer Luigi Avantaggiato for his new series Islands of Energy, which focuses on examples of Italian sustainability of all sizes. These aren’t big players like British Gas or the Italian energy provider Eni, says Avantaggiato. On the contrary, he says, they are “heroes” - sustainability outsiders whose models of self-production and electricity consumption make a real difference in the energy crisis.

Below the picture of the sheep is a view of the entrance to the cellar of the Salcheto winery in Montepulciano. Vertical gardens and a recovery system for natural ventilation insulate it from the summer heat without resorting to air conditioning. Inside, the cellar (pictured above) is lit naturally using solar collectors and curved mirrors to channel sunlight into its various levels. It is “very charming”, says Avantaggiato.

Launching a huge dust cloud from the moon could ease global warming

Launching a million tonnes of moon dust around Earth could dim sunlight across our planet by 1.8 per cent. This would reduce the global temperature, but whether it would be worth the resources, and the risks involved in such a strategy, are unclear

Continuously launching a stream of dust from Earth's moon could help to combat climate change

Launching a dust cloud from the moon to block sunlight reaching Earth could reduce global warming, but such a strategy may require more than a decade's worth of research before it can be implemented. The risks involved with such an approach in terms of how it could affect agriculture, ecosystems and water quality in different parts of the world are also unclear.

Placing more than 100 million tonnes of dust between Earth and the sun to partially block light from reaching our planet has previously been explored as a way to combat climate change. Such dust particles would shade Earth by absorbing light energy or scattering light particles, known as photons, away from Earth.

To achieve this, the dust would need to be placed 1.5 million kilometres from Earth, where the gravitational pull of the sun and our planet cancel out. Here, objects stay at a fixed position known as the first Lagrange point, or L1.

Different research groups have explored placing dust at L1, but energy from photons and charged particles ejected from the sun, known as the solar wind, can gradually nudge dust further away from its desired position, which would need correcting.

Now, after running thousands of computer simulations, Benjamin Bromley at the University of Utah and his colleagues have found that continuously launching a stream of lunar dust directly from the moon's north pole towards L1 at a speed of 2.8 kilometres per second may be a better approach.

In this scenario, the simulations suggest that each propelled dust particle spends about five days blocking Earth-bound sunlight, before dispersing throughout the solar system.

Considering the gravitational pull of the sun, Earth and other planets, as well as non-gravitational forces such as the solar wind, the simulations found that maintaining a dust shield with a mass of 1 million tonnes near L1 for a year could dim sunlight across Earth by 1.8 per cent, equivalent to completely blocking six days of sunlight.

If the approach were sustained indefinitely, or until other measures were introduced to remove carbon dioxide from Earth’s atmosphere, this could offset the rise in carbon dioxide levels that has occurred since the industrial revolution, says Ben Kravitz at Indiana University, Bloomington.

""If this method works, it would certainly be effective at reducing global temperature, but it’s hard to say whether it would be worth it relative to the effort and resources used,” he says.

While the simulations didn’t model the use of any machinery to launch the lunar dust towards L1, you could use a railgun, which propels things via electromagnetic energy, says Bromley. ""This would be perfect because it could be fueled by a few square kilometres of solar panels placed near the launch site,” he says.

However, shading the entire Earth will have unequal effects in different regions, says Kravitz. ""Temperature, precipitation, winds and many other things will change [as a result of this strategy], and they will change differently in different places,"" he says. ""Those changes will, of course, translate into effects on agriculture, ecosystems and water quality.""

Before a strategy like this can be implemented, large-scale engineering studies need to be carried out by multiple agencies in different countries and with consideration by the United Nations, says Curtis Struck at Iowa State University.

Another issue is that there would probably be inaccuracies in the launch and scattering of the dust, which would have unknown effects. ""Would there be enhanced micrometeorite falls to Earth and damage to Earth-orbiting satellites?” says Struck. “This and many other questions have not been studied in the necessary detail.”

Furthermore, considering an approach like this shouldn’t replace our efforts to decrease carbon emissions on Earth. “We have to keep reducing the greenhouse gases within our own atmosphere, no matter what,” says Bromley. “Our dust shield solution would simply buy us more time.”

Striking photo of lone tree is stark warning about Bolivia's future

Bolivia's deforestation crisis is underlined in this set of images from Terraforming, a project by photographer MatjaÅ¾ Krivic and journalist Maja Prijatelj VidemÅ¡ek

A TREE stands alone on land now ready for planting soya seeds, near Santa Cruz, Bolivia (pictured above). It is a symbol of the country’s growing deforestation crisis.

These are among the striking images by photographer MatjaÅ¾ Krivic, working with Maja Prijatelj VidemÅ¡ek, a journalist for the Slovenian newspaper Delo. The pair’s Terraforming project shows how Bolivia’s tropical forests are being destroyed at a rate surpassed only by Brazil and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. From 1976 to 2021, Bolivia lost 14 per cent of its forests.

MatjaÅ¾ Krivic

The driving force behind this deforestation is the cultivation of soya and expansion of cattle ranching. The latter is shown in three of the small images of ranchers and cattle at different ranches in eastern Bolivia.



MatjaÅ¾ Krivic

Some 80 per cent of cattle are for domestic consumption; the rest are exported. By 2025, the state plans to double herds to 22 million animals and to triple cultivated land to 13 million hectares.

MatjaÅ¾ Krivic

This is fuelled by domestic and foreign companies, settlers from the mountainous regions, and the Mennonites - ultra-conservative Christians who arrived in the 1950s. The tractor driver (pictured above) is a Mennonite minister at Santa Anita colony, eastern Bolivia.



MatjaÅ¾ Krivic

Laws are fostering the expansion by offering cheap land and heavily subsidised fuel, which encourage small developments (such as the grain silos, pictured above).



MatjaÅ¾ Krivic

Brazil has destroyed over 18 per cent of its rainforests. Unless Bolivia pulls back from pushing cheap land for agriculture, it will follow suit - and there will be more tragic trees to photograph.

Shown above are the smoking lines of burnt trees in San Rafael.

How we broke the water cycle and can no longer rely on rain to fall

We thought Earth's water cycle was resilient to human meddling, but new analysis shows our supplies of water in plants and soil that are critical to generating rainfall are dangerously low. Here is what we must do to repair the damage

By Graham Lawton

21 August 2023

Goldfinch4ever/iStock /Westmac

I TRAVEL a lot for work, and everywhere I go people talk about rain. I was in Uganda last November and heard grumbles that the rainy season had failed to arrive. In Albania in March, I read about plans to export water to drought-stricken Italy. I visited Saudi Arabia in June and was told about an unexpected torrential downpour in the desert.

It is easy to shrug at all this. After all, we already know climate change is disrupting the weather. And the rain will fall eventually because water is infinitely renewable. It falls from the sky as rain, variably but reliably. Doesn’t it?

The answer, increasingly, is no. “We’ve allowed ourselves to think that water is simply something that comes back every year and there’s a stable water cycle and we can trust it,” says Johan RockstrÃ¶m at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. But that is changing as a result of human activity. “We must recognise that - oh my God - we’re actually not able to trust the source any more.”

This isn’t vague scaremongering. RockstrÃ¶m has just carried out a serious analysis of our water systems and concluded that they are broken. So how bad is the damage? And is there anything we can do as individuals or as a society? Broadly, the answers are that the damage runs deep, but it is still fixable - just.

The hydrological cycle is a complex, interconnected system that circulates freshwater between rivers, lakes, wetlands, groundwater, ice, water vapour in the atmosphere, clouds and precipitation. It has been extremely stable during the Holocene, or the past…

Wood transistor could let us embed electronics in trees

An electrochemical transistor made from balsa wood opens up the possibility of embedding sensors and other electronic devices in plants, which could help in agriculture and forest management

By Jeremy Hsu

An electrical switch made from conductive wood could become a building block for future electronic devices embedded within living trees and other plants.

""There is an emerging research field called electronic plants, where scientists look at different ways to send signals inside plants or to incorporate functionality such as sensors in plants, even in living plants,"" says Isak Engquist at LinkÃ¶ping University in Sweden.

Engquist and his colleagues developed the wood equivalent of a transistor - an electronic component that can boost electric currents or act as a switch for electric signals. A single computer chip the size of a fingernail contains billions of tiny transistors made from semiconductor materials such as silicon. Each semiconductor transistor can switch on and off billions of times per second. Compared with silicon transistors, the wood transistors are significantly larger, each 3 centimetres long. They also have much slower switching speeds that only allow them to switch off in about 1 second, and to switch on in about 5 seconds.

But the wood transistors could prove more sustainable and biocompatible for certain electronic applications in agriculture or forestry, such as monitoring plants' resistance to environmental stress and climate change.

To create the wood transistor, Engquist and his colleagues used a heating and chemical process to remove lignin - an organic binding substance within wood and plants - from pieces of balsa wood. That process freed up space within and between the natural network of tubes, called lumina, that transport water within wood.

They then immersed the wood within a liquid solution containing a conductive polymer, allowing the polymer to soak into the wood and coat the lumina. That created conductive wood capable of interacting with electrolytes - chemicals that conduct electricity when dissolved in water - as the foundation for constructing a wood transistor.

The researchers demonstrated and measured the wood transistor’s operations during multiple switching test runs. This represents an “exciting engineering possibility for utilising wood” as a scaffold “that can incorporate electrical materials into devices”, says Tian Li at Purdue University in Indiana, who wasn’t involved in the study.

The team initially tried several types of wood, including birch and ash. But balsa turned out to have the ideal characteristics for this approach, including retaining its structural integrity after the removal of the lignin, absorbing the conductive polymer without problems and having no significant seasonal difference between summer and winter wood.

Researchers may eventually grow conductive wood with the polymer already inside, says Engquist. That could involve using different conductive polymers to penetrate the wood without having to first remove the lignin.

""It seems most probable that each piece of wood, or each plant, would incorporate only a few wood electrochemical transistors, and that these would be on the millimetre-size scale,"" says Engquist.

Edible and delicious Chinese mitten crabs are invading the UK

Numbers of invasive Chinese mitten crabs are believed to be growing in the UK, causing damage to river beds and competing with native wildlife

By Chen Ly

18 October 2023

Chinese mitten crabs are edible, and in China they are a celebrated seasonal delicacy in the autumn.

Chinese mitten crabs are edible, and in China they are a celebrated seasonal delicacy in the autumn.

People in the UK have been asked to report sightings of Chinese mitten crabs, an invasive species of concern whose population is thought to be growing.

Chinese mitten crabs (Eriocheir sinensis) are crustaceans native to East Asia named for their furry, brown, mitten-like claws. Their bodies can be a greenish grey to dark brown colour, usually growing to about 8 centimetres, with their legs extending to twice that length.

Over the past century, the crabs have spread around the world, including Europe and North America, where they are deemed an invasive species. They are typically found in freshwater habitats, such as rivers, canals and estuaries.

Chinese mitten crabs can wreak havoc on the environment by burrowing into river beds, blocking waterways and damaging fishing gear with their sharp claws. There are also concerns that they could eat fish eggs and outcompete native species for resources.

The species was first spotted in the UK in 1935 in the river Thames and has since become established in waters around the country. More recently, there has been a flurry of crabs seen scurrying around waterways in Cambridgeshire.

The Natural History Museum is running ""Mitten Crab Watch"" - an initiative for members of the public to submit their mitten crab sightings. The UK Department for Food, Agriculture and Rural Affairs is also encouraging people to report sightings, which can help track the crab population and prevent the movement of eggs.

""Numbers are rising because they have a very unusual life history. After the migration downstream, adult females may be able to produce three spawnings of eggs,"" Paul Clark at the Natural History Museum told Mail Online. Each spawning can produce between 500,000 and 1 million eggs, said Clark.

In a bid to tackle the rising population of these crabs in the UK, Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust, Welland and Deepings Internal Drainage Board and the Natural History Museum installed the first permanent Chinese mitten crab trap in Pode Hole, Lincolnshire, in August.

Are Chinese mitten crabs edible?

Chinese mitten crabs are edible, and in China they are a celebrated seasonal delicacy in the autumn, commonly steamed whole and served with vinegar. Prices can reach 2700 yuan (£300) for a box of eight crabs.

According to food writer Fuschia Dunlop, ""the pale, silken flesh of the crab legs is delectable enough, but their shells contain the real treasures: the golden, voluptuous semen of the males and the bright orange roe of the females, sprawled lazily atop a custardy mess of meat.""

A report by Clark and his colleagues in 2008 concluded that the mitten crab population in the Thames ""is large enough to support an artisanal fishing industry"". ""This could reduce mitten crab numbers from the catchment and provide additional financial benefits for local fishermen,"" the report said.

While there have been concerns that the crabs could harbour lung fluke parasites, a 2005 study found that they weren't present in mitten crabs in the Thames estuary. Clark and his team's report did find high levels of Vibrio parahaemolyticus bacteria in Thames crabs and warned that ""consumption of the product particularly raw or lightly cooked may pose a public health risk"".

The crabs can also accumulate pollutants known as dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in their bodies. Clark's report found high levels of these chemicals in crabs from the Thames, but concluded: ""With a caveat over excessive partaking of mitten crab brown meat, particularly in the case of children and women of child-bearing age, it does appear that the harvesting of mitten crabs from the Thames for culinary use need not be discouraged.""

Fascinating photos of fungi show their diversity

Mycologists Danny Newman and Roo Vandegrift spent more than a decade scouting for fungi in the threatened Los Cedros reserve in Ecuador. See some of their finds here

OVER the course of more than a decade, mycologists Danny Newman and Roo Vandegrift went on many expeditions to a virtually unexplored part of Ecuador.

The Los Cedros reserve in the Ecuadorian Andes is a cloud forest, so its main source of precipitation is low-level clouds. Between 2008 and 2019, the pair scouted out as many fungi species as they could in this 52-square-kilometre area. An astonishing 727 were identified. Some of the specimens from Los Cedros are shown here, including one thought to be from the Mycena genus (main image) and a Favolaschia (pictured below), with its distinctive honeycomb-like pores.

“We started studying the fungi there because it’s both incredibly understudied and incredibly threatened,” says Vandegrift, with mining, tree felling for lumber and clearance for agriculture posing the main threats. The expeditions’ findings protected Los Cedros from mining concessions in a landmark ruling in 2021 - opening the eyes of the Ecuadorian court system to the reserve’s importance as a biodiversity reservoir.

It is a lesson that can be applied to so many more of the world’s habitats, says Vandegrift. “Not every forest, protected or not, gets that kind of attention, but if they did, I guarantee you would find incredible life,” he says.

This diversity is highlighted in further specimens Newman collected elsewhere.

The state of Britain's rivers: Slurry, silage and sewage

The majority of the UK's waterways are suffering, even those that look like they are in good health, but some restoration projects have started to tackle the issues, and much more can be done

I AM leaning over a small river in the beautiful village of St Agnes in Cornwall, UK, watching clear water babble through a grate and into a concrete conduit under the road. The grate is there to catch debris that might otherwise clog the waterway and prevent fish from swimming freely, says Josie Purcell at the Westcountry Rivers Trust, an environmental charity. It is clearly doing its job. There are a few sticks, some vegetation - and a crisp packet.

Downstream is the Peterville pumping station. This is supposed to help clean the water before it flows into the magnificent Trevaunance cove, a magnet for beach-goers, swimmers and surfers. The station also deals with sewage from the village. But sometimes it gets overwhelmed by heavy rain and lets untreated water gush onto the beach and into the sea. Last October, activist group Surfers Against Sewage issued a sewage warning for the cove after a section of the sea turned brown. Nonsense, said local water and sewerage company South West Water. It was just mud washed from the fields after heavy rain. Nonetheless, according to official figures, the Peterville station was responsible for 32 overspills of varying volume into the cove in 2021, totalling more than 166 hours.

These problems are a microcosm of those afflicting rivers and streams across the UK: rubbish, pollution, sewage, agricultural runoff, barriers to the movement of fish, other forms of river engineering and an ineffective waste-water system. “There are major problems facing our rivers, and they are extensive,” says Stephen Addy at CREW, Scotland’s Centre of Expertise for Waters at the James Hutton Institute in Aberdeen.

The destruction of the UK’s rivers has a long and undistinguished history. “Human impact on the landscape in the UK is widespread and it goes back thousands of years,” says Addy. But, by some measures, the situation has reached a low-water mark. There is no doubt that the effluent excesses of the recent past have been cleaned up, but the sheer scale and reach of anthropogenic change is unprecedented. In 2016, Addy co-authored a report for the International Union for Conservation of Nature on the state of rivers in the UK and Ireland. It concluded that “truly natural [river] environments that have escaped both direct and indirect human alteration no longer exist”.

The impact of agricultural waste

That stark statement is backed by assessments of the ecological health of the UK’s rivers carried out under the European Union’s Water Framework Directive (WFD). The assessment takes many factors into consideration, including the presence or absence of certain species; levels of pollutants, such as heavy metals, pesticides and nutrients; and the general condition of the habitat, such as water levels and barriers to fish migration. It then ranks rivers on a five-point scale of ecological health: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. If a river fails any one of the tests at any sampling site, the whole river is barred from achieving “good” status. In other words, most of a river can be in good shape, but be let down by one bad stretch.

The latest iteration, in 2021, found that only 2.6 per cent of the UK’s 7481 rivers and canals are in high ecological health, all of them in Scotland. Slightly more - 2.7 per cent - are bad. Just 30 per cent are good. Of the four nations that make up the UK, England’s rivers are in the worst health, with only 16 per cent good and 22 per cent poor or bad. The stream in St Agnes is too small to be included, but almost all the rivers along the north coast of Cornwall aren’t in good health.

The biggest rogue in this gallery of failure is agricultural waste, which runs off fields into streams and rivers. “Agriculture is a big problem. Sixty per cent of the failures to achieve good status are due to agricultural sources,” says Tessa Wardley at the Rivers Trust, a charity based in Callington, Cornwall. Some of this is an unavoidable consequence of farming, but much isn’t. Poorly constructed, badly maintained and under-capacity tanks for slurry (a mixture of manure and water) and silage (a kind of fermented grass used as feed for livestock) are a significant source of what is known as nutrient pollution, according to the Environment Agency (EA), a governmental body responsible for England’s ecological health. This can cause one of the main problems associated with farm runoff - eutrophication. It occurs when the over-enrichment of water with nutrients from fertiliser, slurry and manure leads to excessive growth of algae. These growths block out light for other organisms and produce lots of carbon dioxide, which acidifies the water. When the algae die and decay, oxygen levels plummet, creating dead zones. The blooms sometimes include cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, which are toxic and can poison wildlife and taint drinking water. “They’re dangerous,” says Addy. Runoff can also silt up rivers and destroy fish-spawning areas.

Next on the list of shame is sewage, which afflicts more than half of the rivers that don’t attain good ecological health in the UK. Most of it plops into rivers when storm drains are overwhelmed by heavy rain. Much of the UK has an archaic mixed waste-water system where rainwater, sewage and other waste water - from baths and washing machines, for example - are combined and sent to treatment plants as one big sloppy mess. When it rains a lot, as it tends to in the UK, treatment plants can become overwhelmed, risking backflow of filthy water into homes and businesses. To prevent this from happening, water companies are permitted to release the untreated water straight into rivers. It is supposed to be an emergency measure, but according to the Rivers Trust, EA data shows that it happened more than 400,000 times in 2020 in England alone. EA data also revealed that England’s untreated waste-water pipes were open for a combined total of 2.6 million hours, or almost 300 years, in 2021. And that is just the outlets that are monitored.

Cesspits and septic tanks also contribute to sewage in rivers. Around 1.25 million rural homes in England aren’t connected to sewers and manage their own human waste. Some old cesspits and septic tanks are faulty and leach their content into rivers; a few older ones discharge straight into watercourses, though this has been illegal since 2000. This isn’t a nationally significant source of pollution, says the EA, but is a major contributor to sewage hotspots in some areas.

Pollution from “forever chemicals”

Chemical pollution is yet another major issue. According to data gathered by the EA, not a single one of England’s rivers ranks as high or even good on this score. The vast majority are contaminated with a class of industrial chemicals called uPBTs (ubiquitous, persistent, bioaccumulative, toxic substances). These are legacy industrial chemicals that leach out of landfill.

But there is a flipside to this shocking statistic - if you exclude uPBTs, 93 per cent of England’s rivers are in good chemical health or higher. This way of assessing chemical health is allowed under the WFD so that the malign and persistent presence of uPBTs doesn’t mask progress on other types of pollution.

Nonetheless, chemical pollution remains an issue. The Rivers Trust has been looking at a broader range of chemicals than is assessed under the WFD, says Wardley, and is seeing concerning signs of other organic pollutants not on the list of uPBTs. “That’s a really big worry because they’re very, very persistent,” she says. “The full impact of them is slightly uncertain, but it’s definitely not good.” Microplastics, especially from washing machine water, are another growing concern, she says. So are pharmaceuticals, either flushed straight down the toilet or present in the urine of people who take them. Waste treatment plants sometimes can’t deal with these, so they circle back into drinking water. These are part of what is known as “diffuse sources” of pollution, which include those that leach into rivers due to rainfall or surface runoff. They are much harder to monitor and mitigate than “point sources”, such as factory effluent pipes. Other diffuse sources are microplastics from tyre wear, agricultural chemicals and pollution washing out of the atmosphere. “It’s the diffuse sources of pollution that are really, really hard to identify and control,” says Wardley.

Abandoned metal mines are another major but neglected source of pollution. St Agnes is overlooked by several old tin and copper mines, including the dramatic Wheal Coates clinging to the cliffside. According to the EA, even though they closed decades ago, they still leach metals that harm insects and fish. They are one of the top 10 causes of poor water quality in the UK, despite affecting a small percentage of its rivers, mainly in the north-east of England, Cumbria, Yorkshire and Cornwall.

Yet another major issue is fragmentation by dams, weirs, sluices and other obstacles that hinder sediment transport and stymie the movement of fish and other organisms. “Our use of rivers has nearly always involved fragmenting them,” says Carlos Garcia de Leaniz at Swansea University in Wales. “The defining characteristic of non-ephemeral, natural rivers is that they flow, and the most pervasive sign of human impacts on rivers is the break in connectivity caused by artificial barriers to free flow.” In 2020, he and his colleagues published the first full inventory of Europe’s river obstacles, including small ones that have previously been overlooked. They recorded more than 1.6 million, around twice as many as the old estimate. Sixty-eight per cent were structures less than 2 metres tall. The UK arm of the project sampled 68,719 kilometres of river and found 23,719 dams, weirs, sluices, culverts, fords, ramps and other obstacles. Scaled up to the entire country, this suggests that the UK has nearly 50,000 barriers, 99.6 per cent of which are small. Many of them are obsolete, says Jack Wootton at the University of Hull, UK. According to an EU project called Amber (Adaptive Management of Barriers in European Rivers), only 3 per cent of the UK’s rivers are free-flowing.

The engineering practices of canalisation and channelisation - where a river is corralled between artificial banks and straightened - also affect how natural they are, separating them from their floodplains, preventing them from meandering and making the water deeper than it would be. “Often, you go to a river and it’s been canalised, it’s dead straight and banks are steep so there’s quite a drop into the river,” says Michael Acreman at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology in Wallingford. “It’s probably being excavated out to prevent the flooding of the land alongside the river.” Natural floodplains, meanwhile, are increasingly used for housing and other developments, which prevents them from doing what they are supposed to do: store excess water and return it slowly to a river.

Reasons to be hopeful about rivers

Waterways are also an important repository of what little biodiversity the UK still has. Despite covering just 3 per cent of the land, river environments are home to 10 per cent of the country’s species. Only four of them are globally endangered - European eels, white-clawed crayfish, Spengler’s freshwater mussel and the Derbyshire feather moss - but many more are locally endangered, including water voles, white-tailed eagles, marsh warblers, Bewick’s swans and curlews. Biodiversity has an inherent value and also plays a huge part in people’s enjoyment of rivers and the health benefits that brings, says Jane Hill at the University of York, UK.

Perspective is, of course, required. Despite being in a bad way, some of the UK’s rivers have been worse. “If you look at the historical data, it can look as though our rivers have been improving, and in some cases they have,” says Wardley. “By some measures, they were even more dire than they are now.”

“Back in the 50s, I remember people saying ‘you don’t want to go near the Thames, let alone swim in it’, because it had effluent coming in from factories. But there’s been amazing strides to improve our rivers,” says Acreman. Sadly, progress has stalled. In 2021, James Bevan, chief executive of the EA, told the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee, part of the UK parliament, that water quality was flatlining “because the two main polluters, the water and farming sectors, are not yet, in my opinion, doing enough to protect and enhance the environment”.

There are, however, some reasons for hope. There are more than 3000 completed, ongoing or proposed river restoration projects across the UK and tentative signs that wildlife is bouncing back. A few weeks ago, Purcell tells me, an unusual fish was spotted in the stream in St Agnes. It was a European eel on its way back to the Sargasso Sea, the first one seen there in a long while. Eels are a good indicator of the overall health of waterways and, like the rivers themselves, they aren’t finished yet.

""These form a major component of the British natural environment and are of major significance for wetland biodiversity conservation and for the many ecosystem services they provide to people,"" says Nick Davidson at Charles Sturt University in Albury, Australia.

Sadly, estuaries aren't in good shape. Even though 68 of the UK's have been recognised as internationally important wetland areas, they have long been under pressure from agriculture, ports, industry and urban development. At least 85 per cent of them are affected by humans and more than a quarter of their area has been lost. But the rate of development has slowed and estuaries are now widely recognised as habitats worth preserving, says Davidson.

People in the US passed swine flu to pigs nearly 400 times in 12 years

A particular strain of swine flu was first recorded in people in 2009. Since then, humans have passed the strain to pigs at least 370 times in the US

People have passed swine flu to pigs at least 370 times over 12 years in the US. Better understanding how the virus behind the disease moves between humans and pigs could help to reduce infections and ensure vaccines stay effective.

Swine flu is the common name for a condition that originated in pigs. It is caused by a type of influenza A, known as H1N1, of which a variant called pdm09 led to an outbreak in people in 2009. Since then, the variant has lingered in pigs and infected a small number of people, with some recorded cases of transmission between the two.

Tavis Anderson at the US Department of Agriculture and his colleagues wanted to investigate how pdm09 has spread since 2009. They analysed genetic sequences of all the H1N1 virus samples collected in people and pigs in the US between 2009 and 2021. Of these, 12,823 human and 1112 swine samples were of the pdm09 strain.

Viruses evolve quickly in a host's body and often develop specific traits in different species, says Anderson. To assess which of these samples were a result of transmission between the two species, the researchers looked at how similar the samples were to each other. If one version of the virus in a person looked reasonably different to versions in other people, they assumed it was passed by a pig. Conversely, if a version of the virus in a pig looked different to those in other pigs, they assumed it was passed by a person.

From this, the researchers estimated there were 370 cases of human-to-swine transmission and 17 cases of swine-to-human transmission over the study's 12-year period, with most of these probably occurring due to farming. However, the true number may be higher as not all infections lead to ill health and can therefore go unreported, says Anderson.

The virus also appeared to evolve particularly rapidly in pigs and continued to circulate in these animals. Vaccines against swine flu can become less effective due to these evolutionary changes, says Anderson.

Between 2020 and 2021, during the height of the covid-19 pandemic, cases of pdm09 fell in people but continued to circulate in pigs as a carryover from infections in these animals from previous years. This suggests it is possible to reduce the interspecies transmission of swine flu if proper control measures are taken, says Rebecca Jane Cox Brokstad at the University of Bergen, Norway.

""We have to understand all the components associated with the transmission of the viruses between different hosts,"" says Anderson. ""Hopefully if we do that, we could improve animal health and human health.""

We can't engineer our way out of the water crisis in the Southwest US

Ever since Arizona was first colonised, politicians and entrepeneurs have sold residents the idea that human ingenuity can craft a solution to water shortfalls. It can't, argues Natalie Koch

By Natalie Koch

1 March 2023

Michelle D'urbano

SEVEN states in the Southwest US are legally allowed to take water from the Colorado river: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. But with the once-mighty river now running at historic lows, the states were given a federal deadline to voluntarily agree to dramatic cuts in their use. On 31 January, they missed it. Meanwhile, the low river flow has already slashed the power output of the iconic Hoover dam - once able to produce 2080 megawatts of hydropower, its generation has been cut in half as of June 2022.

Revealing images from the front line of climate change in Bangladesh

People are increasingly grappling with the impacts of a shifting climate in Bangladesh, something that journalist Fabeha Monir has captured in a series of photos

THE summer monsoon in Bangladesh can spell trouble. When its rains are too heavy, major floods can tear through buildings and crops, stranding millions of people and claiming lives. But where rains are too light, drought can strike. Together with rising sea levels and coastal inundation, this leads to water sources becoming saltier, with all these effects heightened by climate change.

These photos by journalist Fabeha Monir illustrate the impact that an increasingly unpredictable climate is having on the people of Bangladesh. “We don’t have to wait decades for a preview of our future transformed by rising seas,” she says. “It’s crucial to show the tangible and intangible loss and damage our peoples are facing.”

The population there has struggled to get support to deal with such issues - but that may be changing. Researchers at the International Institute for Environment and Development and the International Centre for Climate Change and Development have been visiting communities in Bangladesh whose livelihoods have been hit by climate change, in order to better understand how they can be helped.

The spiky shape of sunflower pollen may clear bee guts of parasite

Sunflower pollen's spiky texture dramatically reduces the prevalence of a widespread gut parasite in eastern bumblebees

The spiny texture of sunflower pollen reduces infections of a common gut pathogen in bees by up to 94 per cent.

Wild plants and food crops rely heavily on bees for pollination. The loss of habitat and widespread pesticide use has pushed most bee species into decline and made them more susceptible to infections. But like humans, bees can tailor their diet to boost their gut and immune health.

Earlier studies have established that pollen from certain species of plants - especially…

Apps that identify plants can be as little as 4 per cent accurate

There are many smartphone apps that aim to identify plants from photographs, but tests have found that most are not very accurate

Apps can help identify plants – but only up to a point

Marko Geber/Digital Vision/Getty Images

Smartphone apps that identify plants from photographs can be as little as 4 per cent accurate, which could put people foraging for food at risk and also lead to endangered plants being mislabelled as weeds and eradicated.

Julie Peacock at the University of Leeds, UK, and her colleagues evaluated six of the most popular apps: Google Lens, iNaturalist, Leaf Snap, Pl@ntNet, Plant Snap and Seek. They attempted to identify 38 species of plant in their natural habitat, at four locations in Ireland, with each app. The team found that some apps scored extremely poorly, while even the best fell short of 90 per cent accuracy.

“There are lots of reasons why it’s important that either the apps are accurate, or people are aware that these apps are a guide but definitely not perfect,” says Peacock. For example, people could misidentify important native species as invasive, and remove them from their gardens, or consume potentially dangerous wild plants, thinking they are a harmless variety.

But Peacock doesn’t think people shouldn’t use these apps, as long as they understand the limitations. “They have huge potential for people to start to engage more with plants,” she says.

The apps use artificial intelligence algorithms trained on vast numbers of captioned photographs of plants. During training, the AI is taught to recognise not only the training photos, but also to spot similarities between them and new photographs, which allows them to identify plants.

Generally, the apps were all better at identifying flowers than leaves, which the researchers say is due to their greater variety of shape and colour providing the AI with more clues. But this wasn’t always the case. The iNaturalist app was able to correctly identify just 3.6 per cent of flowers and 6.8 per cent of leaves. Plant Snap identified 35.7 per cent of flowers correctly and 17.1 per cent of leaves. The highest accuracy was achieved by Pl@ntNet at 88.2 per cent.

Alexis Joly at Inria in Montpellier, France, who is one of the researchers behind the non-profit project Pl@ntNet, said that the app’s success was down to its data sets, which are sourced and categorised by botanists, scientists and informed amateurs, along with algorithms that attempt to balance out bias towards common species and instead rank several likely candidates for each search.

“This is sometimes a thankless task because people prefer to see a single result with 100 per cent confidence, even if it’s not the right one, rather than three possible species at 33 per cent each, but which represents the reality with regard to the photo taken,” he says. “But it seems our strategy is paying off.”

Stephen Harris at the University of Oxford says that Peacock’s concerns are valid, and that he has also experienced problems with such apps and relies on a good reference book instead. The problem is relying on images uploaded to the internet that are often incorrectly labelled, he says.

“People tend to take images of similar things. So you will get certain plants that are really obvious and everybody wants to take a picture of, whereas if you get some sort of really interesting plant but it happens to be a scrappy little thing that doesn’t have very attractive flowers or anything, you won’t get very many images of it,” says Harris. “It’s very unlikely that you’re going to have people scrambling around in ponds, hoiking out pond weeds and taking pictures of it.”

Google declined a request for interview, while the other app creators didn’t respond.

Shock collars could keep elephants out of conflict with humans

Elephants fitted with electric shock collars quickly learn to avoid approaching the place where they get shocked, suggesting a way to keep elephants away from crops that may be more humane than alternative approaches

Shock collars could be an effective way to keep elephants from raiding crops in Sri Lanka, and researchers think this approach could be more humane than other strategies for tackling the problem.

Sri Lanka has perhaps the highest density of elephants in the world. Conflict between humans and elephants is a longstanding issue in the country, leading to the deaths of 145 people and 433 elephants in 2022.

To keep the animals away, some farmers use electric fences, but elephants can easily break them by…

Male spider mites rip off females' skin to be first to mate with them

Due to fierce competition for mates, male spider mites guard juvenile females and forcibly remove their skin as they near adulthood so they can secure the first mating

By Alice Klein

Male spider mites closely guard juvenile females and tear off their outer skin as soon as they approach maturity so they can be the first to mate with them.

Two-spotted spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) are a common agricultural pest, feeding on a wide range of crops including beans and tomatoes. The mites shed their outer skin when they transition from juvenile nymphs to adults – a process known as moulting.

Adult females can have multiple sexual partners, but only the sperm of their first partner fertilises their eggs. As a result, there is strong competition between males for females that have just reached maturity.

To try to secure this access, male mites often guard juvenile females until they become fertile adults. This is a risky strategy because it costs energy and prevents the males from foraging for food - and rival males may still steal the females at the last minute.

Peter Schausberger at the University of Vienna in Austria and his colleagues found that male guards try to minimise this risk by pulling off females' outer skin just as they near maturity so they can inseminate them before other males swoop in.

The researchers filmed juvenile female spider mites that were individually reared in cages with or without the presence of a male.

The females that were housed without a male naturally shed their outer skin at a leisurely pace when they reached sexual maturity.

In contrast, females housed with a male had their outer skin forcibly removed. As a female neared maturity, the male began drumming on her skin to encourage it to break open. Then the male used his mouthparts to pull off the female’s skin from behind so he could expose her genitals and immediately inseminate her.

This meant that females with a male emerged from their outer skin 5 minutes earlier on average than those on their own, says Schausberger.

""Five minutes is not long in absolute time, but it is in relative time because these spider mites often live in high-density colonies where other males are close by,"" he says. ""Every second pays when it comes to being first at the emerging female.""

The spider mites are the first species in which this skin-stripping behaviour has been experimentally documented, says Schausberger.

Ohio train derailment killed more than 40,000 aquatic animals

Officials reported that thousands of fish died within days of the chemical spill caused by a derailed train, potentially due to contamination of local waterways

In early February, a train carrying hazardous chemicals partially derailed and caught fire in East Palestine, Ohio. Three days later, on 6 February, officials conducted a controlled burn of vinyl chloride from five cars to prevent a larger explosion. This generated a massive fireball and column of black smoke above the site. In the weeks since, officials have reported thousands of wildlife deaths, and alarmed residents have been sharing social media posts of contaminated waterways and dead animals.

 

How many animals have died?

Officials from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources said on 14 February that they believed chemicals associated with the train derailment killed around 3500 aquatic animals. On 23 February, they provided an updated estimate, stating the wildlife death total has now climbed to 43,700 animals within 8 kilometres of local waterways.

Why are animals getting sick?

The derailment itself, as well as the controlled burn, caused hazardous chemicals from the train to leach into the surrounding air, soil and water. These included butyl acrylate, ethylhexyl acrylate and vinyl chloride - the last of which is the most concerning, as chronic exposure can cause liver damage in people. Short-term exposure to high concentrations can lead to dizziness and headaches in humans, and kidney and liver damage in other animals, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

The EPA has been monitoring water around the derailment site for these chemicals, and says that air quality monitoring has not detected contaminants of concern above levels considered safe for humans. But the threshold at which these chemicals become unsafe for wildlife is less understood.

What kinds of animals are dying?

An assessment by independent environmental consulting group EnviroScience found thousands of dead animals in the four waterways they sampled - Dead Sulphur Run, Leslie Run, Bull Creek and North Fork Little Beaver Creek. Most deceased animals were small minnows, though larger fish, amphibians and crustaceans were among the fatalities.

All of those animals are believed to have died “immediately after the derailment”, said Mary Mertz at the Ohio Department of Natural Resources in an interview with CBS News. The government agency also received reports of three birds and an opossum found dead, which it is currently investigating.

Aquatic animals are especially vulnerable to chemicals in water, as they are continually exposed to contaminants. Officials maintain that wildlife killed in the days following the derailment didn’t include any threatened or endangered species.

 

Are pets or livestock at risk?

There have been anecdotes of farm animals and pets falling ill following the incident, including several woozy foxes, a pet cat with congestive heart failure and a flock of sick chickens kept at a local farm - but these haven’t been officially linked to the hazardous chemicals that leaked from the train. Despite this, Brian Baldridge at the Ohio Department of Agriculture told residents on 14 February that ""there's nothing that we've seen with the livestock that poses any concerns"".

What does a Quantitative Ecologist do?



Quantitative Ecologist - Susie Gold - Animal and Plant Health Agency


I'm responsible for""¦

I work in the National Wildlife Management Centre at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). My role focuses on developing simulation models to improve our understanding of wildlife diseases to help inform government policy. These models pull together our understanding of species ecology and disease processes to try and predict disease spread and test the effectiveness of different management strategies. Since starting this job, I've worked on models for a range of species including foxes, badgers and bats.

My typical day""¦

I split my time between working from home and from our office near York. On days in the office, I'll join team meetings to discuss ideas and progress on different projects. Most days I'll divide my time between working on model code in Python or R, keeping up to date with relevant research, and writing my own papers.

The best part of my job""¦

Is getting to work on wildlife ecology, both at my desk and occasionally out in the field. The department consists of a range of different roles, from field ecologists to statisticians and modellers, so there's always interesting work going on.

The most challenging part of my job""¦

Keeping up to date with current methods in disease modelling, as well as the ecology of different species and diseases, and integrating this into complex models is an interesting but challenging part of the job.

I love my job because""¦

It's really varied and interesting. As we've seen recently with the Avian Influenza situation, wildlife disease is an increasing threat to public health, livestock and conservation so working in this area is really rewarding.

Advice to others""¦ (What advice would you give to others who want a role like yours?)

I started this job after finishing my PhD, which allowed me to develop skills that have been really useful in this role. I'd recommend considering the civil service if you want to work in research with a direct policy-focus.

My Plan B""¦ (If it wasn't this job - what else would I be doing?)

I've always wanted to work with wildlife so if it wasn't this job, I'm sure it would be another job in ecology or conservation.

Iceland volcano: 15km magma tunnel under town threatens to erupt

A 15-kilometre-long mass of lava has formed underneath the Reykjanes peninsula in Iceland and could erupt at any time

By Michael Le Page

Iceland is bracing for a volcanic eruption, as thousands of small earthquakes have shaken the southern part of the Reykjanes peninsula since October. The earthquakes were caused by a huge amount of magma from deep inside Earth moving upwards and forming a 15-kilometre-long crack between 2 and 5 kilometres underground. As of 12:30pm GMT on 15 November, no volcanic eruption had begun.

When will the volcanic eruption occur?

No one knows. It is thought likely that an eruption will occur, but it isn’t certain. The mass of magma could remain where it is and gradually cool rather than erupting.

But I saw videos of an eruption on social media?

These are videos of past volcanic eruptions, such as of the Fagradalsfjall volcano that erupted in 2021, 2022 and July 2023. The Fagradalsfjall volcano is near the new magma intrusion but is separate from it.

Why is the ground cracking?

The magma intrusion has pushed the land on either side outwards and up, causing the ground immediately above the intrusion to sink up to a metre in places. This has resulted in cracks in the ground, causing a lot of damage in the coastal town of GrindavÃ­k, whose north-western edge is directly above the magma tunnel.

What’s at risk in the region?

The magma intrusion runs from just off the coast, passes under GrindavÃ­k and continues inland to within a couple of kilometres of a geothermal power plant called Svartsengi. The hot water from Svartsengi is the source for the Blue Lagoon spa nearby, one of Iceland’s biggest tourist attractions.

What’s happening there now?

The 3000 residents of GrindavÃ­k have been evacuated, but they were allowed back briefly to collect belongings, pets and livestock. The Blue Lagoon is closed.

What would happen if there is an eruption?

No one can be sure. It is likely that a fissure vent could form, with a fountain of lava generating a lava flow. ""It kind of unzips, letting out magma in a long fissure,” says Evgenia Ilyinskaya at the University of Leeds, UK, who is in Iceland monitoring the site. “We don’t see necessarily a large, pyramid-shaped stratovolcano.”

How much destruction this causes depends on where it happens and how much lava comes out. If rising lava meets large amounts of groundwater, or the eruption occurs under the sea, there could be an explosive eruption due to the formation of steam. “If we are lucky, we will get mostly eruptions within uninhabited valleys like we had in 2021 and 2022 and earlier this year,” says Ilyinskaya.



Can anything be done to protect the town?

In the past, Iceland has sometimes built earthen ""dams"" to deflect lava flows and protect key infrastructure, including on the Reykjanes peninsula. However, the magma chamber stretches for 15 kilometres in this case, and it isn’t clear where or if lava will start to flow.

During a 1973 eruption that threatened to block a harbour, seawater was sprayed on a lava flow to slow it down, says Ilyinskaya. “Actually that was really successful.”



Black lava from this bizarre volcano could reveal Earth's deep secrets

Tanzania's Ol Doinyo Lengai is the only volcano known to spew out carbonatite lava, which could offer fresh clues about Earth's mysterious mantle - but getting hold of a sample is no simple matter

Will an eruption disrupt transatlantic flights?

The basalt eruptions that occur on the Reykjanes peninsula seldom produce much ash, so it is unlikely we will see an impact like that of the EyjafjallajÃ¶kull eruption in 2010. ""This could cause some short-lived disruption to local air traffic,” says Ilyinskaya. “But it is pretty certain there’s not going to be a lot of disruption to air traffic across the world like in 2010.”

Why have there been so many eruptions in this area recently?

In this part of Iceland, the volcanoes all seem to erupt around the same time every thousand years or so, in cycles called Reykjanes Fires, says Ilyinskaya. The last time this happened was around 800 years ago. “Now it’s pretty clear we are in this very active cycle again. We could be going into these kind of eruptions for the rest of our lifetimes,” she says. “Luckily, the eruptions that do happen in these [Reykjanes] Fires are all quite small.”

Software update for world's wind farms could power millions more homes

An AI that predicts wind changes could boost wind turbine efficiency by 0.3 per cent, which globally would amount to enough extra electricity to keep a country running

A small efficiency gain for every wind turbine would lead to a big boost globally

Justin Paget/Digital Vision/Getty Images

A simple software upgrade could improve the efficiency of wind turbines by ensuring they face directly into the wind more of the time. If the technique were rolled out worldwide, it could boost electricity production by 5 terawatt-hours a year - about the same amount as is consumed annually by Albania or 1.7 million average UK homes.

Wind turbines work most efficiently when directly facing oncoming wind, but changing wind patterns mean they must regularly…

The cannabis of the future might not come from plants

We can now synthesise THC, CBD and other cannabinoids in bioreactors - these could be used to make new therapeutic compounds with a lower environmental cost

The cannabis of the future might not come from plants

Golden liquid churns in six glass vessels, each hooked up to a computer via a bundle of tubes and wires. Air pumps buzz, and the room smells of bananas and old beer. But this facility - I was allowed to visit on the condition I not use its name or location - is no brewery. Its operators are making cannabis products using microbes instead of plants.

Humans have been cultivating cannabis plants for thousands of years, first for their fibres and later for their cannabinoid molecules, some of which have psychoactive and therapeutic properties. But we can now make those molecules without plants.

For at least five years, synthetic biologists have been producing cannabinoids using bioengineered yeast, more recently including tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the cannabinoid behind cannabis' psychoactive effects.

Moreover, the yeast can make large quantities of cannabinoids that are present in low concentrations in the plant, some of which may have potential medical uses. And they have a smaller environmental footprint than farming. ""I don't see how plants ever compete when we get to scale,"" says Ben Chiarelli at Cellibre in California, one of a number of start-ups aiming to capitalise on microbial cannabinoids.

But for all this ambition, the industry has struggled: several companies recently went bankrupt and others are abandoning their yeast vats for other projects. Challenges in finding funding and worry about protecting proprietary processes have made some in this space wary of attention at the moment too - hence the terms of my recent visit.

Despite this stuttering…

River pollution 'offsets' for homes in England and Wales may not work

Some home builders in England and Wales are allowed to buy nutrient credits to ""offset"" the pollution caused by new houses, but their efficacy is in doubt

New homes can increase pollution in nearby waterways

Paul Smith/Alamy

Plans to allow housing developers in England and Wales to ""offset"" the river pollution caused by building new homes may not actually work, as they are often impractical and lack scientific evidence to support them, experts have warned.



Building new homes increases the amount of pollution that is released into waterways, particularly phosphorus and nitrogen. These nutrients are expensive to process in wastewater treatment works and so a significant amount ends up being released into local rivers, says Peter Cruddas at the University of Portsmouth, UK. This, in turn, leads to the deoxygenation of water bodies, harming both fish and plant life.

Because of this, many local government councils in England only allow new homes to be built if the developers can ensure that the nutrient pollution they produce can be mitigated, a principle called nutrient neutrality. A similar scheme operates in Wales for new homes near certain rivers, while Scotland and Northern Ireland have no such rules.

Nutrient neutrality in England has led to around 140,000 houses not being built, says James Stevens at the Home Builders Federation in the UK, according to a survey of the trade association's members. In a push to allow more development, some councils in England and Wales have introduced nutrient credits, in which developers calculate how much nutrient pollution a new home will produce and then offset it by paying for nutrient pollution reduction schemes elsewhere.

The general idea is similar to carbon offsetting, in which people emitting greenhouse gases can ""offset"" this by paying for projects intended to pull carbon dioxide from the air, such as tree-planting schemes. The public body Natural England has now announced plans to roll out a nutrient credit programme nationally, allowing home builders to progress with developments that would otherwise be blocked.

Despite this, it is unclear that nutrient pollution offsetting actually works. In England, local councils have largely used nutrient credits to pay farmers to stop farming on a particular piece of land, and thus stop using fertilisers, which contain high concentrations of nitrogen.

A farmer who stops using 1 hectare of a poultry farm could produce enough nitrogen nutrient credits to allow for the development of about 30 houses, says Cruddas, although the exact number depends on where in England the farm is located.

UK river pollution monitoring is 50 years out of date, say researchers

But while farming pollution generally diffuses over a large area, the sewage from houses is piped to a treatment plant for processing and then released into rivers via a small number of pipes, creating a high concentration of nutrient pollution in a smaller area, with potentially more environmental damage.

""Generally, when you have more dilute, diffuse sources, the natural environment has a better chance to adapt to it,"" says Cruddas.

Then there is the issue of whether it is possible to generate enough credits for certain nutrients to allow any houses to be built. ""Far more farmland is needed to mitigate phosphorus,"" says Gabriel Connor-Streich at Greenshank Environmental, a consultancy working on nutrient credits. This is because farmers generally use a lot more nitrogen than phosphorus, so the concentration across their land is lower.

It has been difficult to buy phosphorus credits in most areas in England with nutrient neutrality rules, says Connor-Streich, as farmers don't want to give up so much land and are therefore asking for huge prices, but an increasing number of schemes is making this easier, he says. Recent reports suggest the government may look to scrap nutrient neutrality to enable more houses to be built, but Connor-Streich says changing the law to do so may prove politically difficult.

His firm is looking into other ways that farmers could mitigate nutrient pollution. One method is installing riparian buffers which constitute of trees and shrubs planted near rivers to slowdown agricultural runoff into waterbodies. But Michele Burford at Griffith University in Australia says we still don't know how effective these buffers are in a wide range of settings. Natural England are working with Greenshank Environmental, as well as others, to reduce the uncertainties involved in using such methods to mitigate nutrient pollution, says Connor-Streich.

Another problem is that farmers who are being paid for nutrient credits typically sign up to agreements lasting around 100 years, based on how they use nutrients today. ""But we've been reducing the amount of nutrients we put on farmland for a long time,"" says Cruddas. ""In 10 years, we may have become even more efficient and so that same piece of land won't actually be offsetting an equal amount of pollution produced by the new houses built using nutrient credits.""

How a UK river serves as a natural lab for flood defence research

Simon Kennedy at Partnership for South Hampshire, who has led the nutrient credits scheme in Southampton, UK, says he believes the scheme has potential for success in England, but ultimately nutrient credits aren't about improving rivers. ""This scheme does not solve the bigger problem about the decline of these sites,"" he says. ""It's about ensuring they don't get worse.""

""Nutrient mitigation aims to reduce pressure on our rivers while supporting the building of the sustainable homes we need,"" says Mike Burke at Natural England. ""Our advice is based on a robust and rapidly growing evidence base, and the focus is on developing the practical techniques that can be most effective at cleaning up our rivers.""

Cruddas says he fears that the scaling up of the nutrient credit scheme could have inadvertent consequences. ""We need more houses in this country, but my biggest concern is that it's been taken up because it's the easiest on paper to do the numbers,"" he says.

""I'm worried that we'll become over-reliant on it to the point that perhaps the numbers are not going to balance in the right way,"" he says.

Origin of Indo-European languages traced back to 8000 years ago

An analysis of related words in 161 languages suggests their shared roots lie in the Middle East - a conclusion that also fits with DNA evidence

By Jason Arunn Murugesu

The common ancestor of Indo-European languages, which are now spoken by close to half the world's population, was spoken in the eastern Mediterranean around 8000 years ago, according to an analysis of related words.

Indo-European languages, spanning from English to Sanskrit, have long been thought to share a common ancestor. The first linguist to make this link, William Jones, said in a lecture in 1786 that no linguist could examine Greek, Latin and Sanskrit together ""without believing them to have sprung"" from some common ancestor.

But researchers have struggled to agree on the origin story of this so-called proto-Indo-European language, says Paul Heggarty, who is now at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru. There are two main hypotheses, he says.

The first suggests that the language originated in the steppe region, north of the Black Sea, no earlier than 6500 years ago and then spread across Europe and parts of Asia with the domestication of horses.

The second, known as the farming theory, argues that the language was spoken far earlier and originated in the north of the Fertile Crescent, in what is now south-east Turkey and north-west Iran, as early as 9500 years ago and spread to other regions with the rise of farming.

To test these hypotheses, Heggarty and his colleagues created a database consisting of 170 words, such as “night” and “fire”, and their translations in 161 Indo-European languages, including 52 non-modern languages, such as ancient Greek.

By analysing shared patterns between the words, the researchers could estimate how related the languages were to each other and try to piece together when one language split into two new languages. ""Languages don't really have a date of birth, but you can see where there's a split,"" says Heggarty. ""English is related to German, but these lineages separated from each other around 2000 years ago.""

Using this analysis, the team estimates that the root of all Indo-European languages dates back to around 8100 years ago. There is a good chance it originated in the Fertile Crescent as hypothesised by the farming theory, the researchers report. But while the farming theory suggests a close link between Indo-Iranic languages, such as Hindi, and Balto-Slavic languages, such as Latvian, the study found no clear evidence for this.

Instead, the researchers theorise that Indo-European languages spread in multiple directions from the Fertile Crescent. ""One of those directions took it to the steppe, and from there, there was a secondary expansion to Europe,"" says Heggarty.



The hunt for the lost ancestral language of Europe and southern Asia

We've long known there was an ancient language that gave rise to English, Bengali and dozens of other tongues - now we're on the brink of working out where Proto-Indo-European was spoken

They think this European expansion would have happened about 5000 years ago, as proposed by the steppe hypothesis. It is backed up by ancient DNA data that suggests there was a massive migration into Europe from the steppe region around that time. The team suggests that the Indo-Iranic branch of the language broke off earlier, around 7000 years ago.

This new ""hybrid"" idea therefore takes aspects of both the steppe and farming hypotheses. ""This is the best framework to be working with now, as more research is coming in, especially from ancient DNA,"" says Heggarty.

James Clackson at the University of Cambridge says this study is unlikely to be the final word on the origin of the Indo-European language family, but says it is a step in the right direction. ""The creation of the open access database [of word meanings] is particularly welcome and I'm very grateful to the authors,"" he says.

On the starting point for a new geological epoch (1)

Published 20 September 2023

From Jan Zalasiewicz, Martin Head, Simon Turner, Colin Waters and Mark Williams, Anthropocene Working Group

Erle Ellis says formal recognition of an Anthropocene Epoch beginning in 1950 would be damaging in that it denies earlier human impacts. It does no such thing. Such impacts - from hunting, farming and urbanisation - go back through and characterise the 11,700 years of the Holocene (and some into earlier times). But they didn’t disrupt the overall stability of the climate, sea level and biosphere (9 September, p 21).

The Anthropocene as a potential new geological epoch represents something quite different: a marked and rapid change from the relative stability (sustained over millennia) of the Holocene into another planetary state, one of sharply disrupted global chemical cycles, intensifying global warming, a reconfigured biosphere and countless globally dispersed novel materials, including pesticides, plastics and artificial radionuclides.

Driven from the mid-20th century on by industrialisation, technological advance, population growth, fossil fuel burning and globalisation, this change is indelibly imprinted into recent geological deposits. Much is now irreversible: the planet has no way back to a Holocene state.

This Anthropocene concept has a coherence, reality and significance that justifies formalisation, to stabilise its meaning and use in communication. To obfuscate the meaning of this recent planetary change by hiding it within all human impacts through all time, rather, would damage science.

Hurricane damage to forests could release huge amount of stored carbon

A study modelling the impact of a major hurricane in New England suggests carbon-offsetting schemes are greatly underestimating the risks posed by storms

A single hurricane hitting New England could result in the release of more than a tenth of all the carbon stored in the area’s forests, according to a modelling study. The findings show that carbon-offsetting schemes greatly underestimate the risks posed by hurricanes, says Shersingh Joseph Tumber-DÃ¡vila at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.

At Beta Bugs, the team use a selective breeding technique to breed black soldier fly that have desirable characteristics. This includes traits such as protein content, survivability and fast growth. This helps Lindy to choose the flies with the best genetics to be sent to multiplier sites where they will be mass produced. These eggs are then distributed to Beta Bugs customers, including farmers that can use the eggs to feed to their animals. On a day-to-day basis, Lindy looks after the bugs by feeding them and treating them as if they were any other pet. By caring for the Black Soldier Fly, Lindy can ""take a standard fly and make it into a super fly by choosing the best bugs and breeding them together!

The best part of my job...

Meeting new people and building relationships is something that Lindy values as part of her job as a Bug Breeder. ""The main aspect of my job at the moment that I love is building relationships with customers and meeting chicken farmers who have never thought about breeding insects before, but now they do because they can see where the future of farming is going."" She also enjoys knowing that her job creates a positive impact for the planet. ""No matter what we do, if we make an improvement in that day (which we do in some aspect of the company) we are making an actual improvement on the planet. That's really what I think keeps me so happy and excited in this job because no matter how bad of a day you're having, you've made a difference.

I love my job because...

It is exciting, challenging and (extremely) rewarding.

Advice to others""¦ (What advice would you give to others who want a role like yours?)

There are multiple pathways to explore if you would like to become a bug breeder.

Lindy notes that: ""If you have an interest in sustainability, the planet, animals, bugs, or anything (similar), you could volunteer and get some work experience.

Because this is a new industry, no one knows how to mass rear black soldier fly in an industrial setting, so the opportunities are endless.""

University degrees are also a great option. By studying a biological degree, an entomology degree or food science degree, you will gain the skills and knowledge to help you kickstart your career in the industry. Relevant courses are also an option instead of a degree.

ABOUT BETA BUGS

We are an insect genetics company developing and distributing black soldier fly breeds to the insect farming sector.

Black Soldier Fly and its larvae are being farmed worldwide as an alternative protein source that can be used in aquaculture, pork, and poultry feed. Alongside this, they can be reared on various waste streams, including agricultural and food waste. This rapidly developing industry provides a green, circular, and regionally produced alternative to the environmentally damaging production of soy meal and fishmeal, the prime causes of deforestation, biodiversity loss, and overfishing.

However, although it has been farmed commercially for the past decade, Black Soldier Fly have not yet been genetically improved for large-scale production.

We need to go beyond net zero to reverse catastrophic climate damage

Our planet is about to hit a critical 1.5°C of global warming. To rectify things, we must cut emissions, but we also need to harness technology and the natural world to suck carbon dioxide from the air



7 June 2023

WHEN it comes to global warming, every notch on the thermometer is vital. But one temperature rise has been etched into our minds for years: 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Passing this threshold may trigger multiple climate “tipping points” that could change the planet irreversibly. The arrival of an El NiÃ±o weather event and our poor efforts at cutting greenhouse gas emissions mean we could exceed 1.5°C of warming as soon as next year. This is “uncharted territory” for Earth’s climate, warns the World Meteorological Organization.

Uncharted, perhaps, but certainly not unknown. For years, scientists have been studying…

Galapagos giant tortoise argument may threaten conservation efforts

How many distinct species of Galapagos giant tortoises are there? The latest genetic study says at least five, disputing previous work, and the answer could have implications for their conservation

Are these Alcedo volcano giant tortoises a subspecies or a distinct species?

Tui De Roy/Minden/naturepl.com

The number of species of Galapagos giant tortoises that exist is in dispute and the result could influence how we conserve these endangered animals.

Researchers have defined 16 populations of giant tortoises (Chelonoidis spp.) spread across the Galapagos islands based on differences in their shell shape, behaviour and genetics. Three of these are now extinct because of hunting, the loss of their habitat for agriculture and the introduction of invasive species, such as goats, which compete for their food.…

Silent Spring didn't condemn millions to death

The 50-year-old campaign against Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring still distorts environmental debates, says William Souder

By William Souder

6 September 2012



Silent Spring, Rachel Carson’s landmark warning about the indiscriminate use of pesticides, turns 50 this month. By extension, that puts the environmental movement also at the half-century mark - along with the bitter, divisive argument that continues over the book and the movement it spawned.

The terms of that argument, which emerged in the brutal reaction to Silent Spring from those who saw it as a warning rather than a threat, haven’t changed much. And they leave us with a vexing question: Why do we fight? How is it that the environment we all share is the subject of partisan debate? After all, the right and the left inhabit the same planet, even if it doesn’t always seem that way.

Carson’s book was controversial before it even was a book. In June 1962, three long excerpts were published by The New Yorker magazine. They alarmed the public, which deluged the Department of Agriculture and other agencies with demands for action, and outraged the chemical industry and its allies in government.

Advertisement

In late August 1962, after he was asked about pesticides at a press conference, President Kennedy ordered his science adviser to form a commission to investigate the problems, the president said, brought to light by “Miss Carson’s book”.

The fightback

A month later, when Silent Spring was published, the outlines of the fight over pesticides had hardened. Armed with a substantial war chest - Carson’s publisher heard it was $250,000 - pesticide makers launched an attack aimed at discrediting Silent Spring and destroying its author.

The offensive included a widely distributed parody of Carson’s famous opening chapter about a town where no birds sang, and countless fact-sheets extolling the benefits of pesticides to human health and food production. Silent Spring was described as one-sided and unbalanced to any media that would listen. Some did listen: Time magazine called the book “hysterical” and “patently unsound”.

Carson’s critics pushed her to the left of the political spectrum, to a remote corner of the freaky fringe, which at the time included organic farmers, food faddists and anti-fluoridationists.

One pesticide maker, which threatened to sue if Silent Spring was published, was more explicit: Carson, the company claimed, was in league with “sinister parties” whose goal was to undermine American agriculture and free enterprise in order to further the interests of the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites. The word “communist” - in 1962 the most potent of insults - wasn’t used, but it was understood. Silent Spring was un-American, said its more ardent detractors.

And there the two sides sit, 50 years later. On one side of the environmental debate are the perceived soft-hearted scientists and those who would preserve the natural order; on the other are the hard pragmatists of industry and their friends in high places, the massed might of the establishment.

Substitute climate change for pesticides, and the argument plays out the same now as it did a half-century ago. President Kennedy’s scientific commission would ultimately affirm Carson’s claims about pesticides, but then as now, nobody ever really gives an inch.

Rise of malaria

Carson was also accused of having written a book that, though it claimed to be concerned with human health, would instead contribute directly to death and disease on a massive scale by stopping the use of the insecticide DDT in the fight against malaria.

One irate letter to The New Yorker complained that Carson’s “mischief” would make it impossible to raise the funds needed to continue the effort to eradicate malaria, and its author wondered if the magazine’s legendary standards for accuracy and fairness had fallen. Apparently unaware of the distinction between science authors and nudists, the letter writer referred to Carson as a “naturist”.

The claim that Rachel Carson is responsible for the devastations of malaria, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, has gained renewed traction in recent years. The American Enterprise Institute and other free-market conservatives have defended the safety and efficacy of DDT; and the claim of Carson’s “guilt” in the deaths of millions of Africans is routinely parroted by people who are clueless about the content of Silent Spring or the sources of the attacks now made against it.

The Competitive Enterprise Institute, a limited-government, free-enterprise think tank, maintains the website rachelwaswrong.org, which details Carson’s complicity in the continuing plague of malaria.

In 2004, the late writer Michael Crichton offered a bite-sized and easy-to-remember indictment of Carson’s crime: “Banning DDT,” Crichton wrote, “killed more people than Hitler.” This came in the form of dialogue in a novel, but in interviews Crichton made it clear this was what he believed.

Ideologically moderate

Rachel Carson, who stoically weathered misinformation campaigns against her before her death from breast cancer in 1964, would find the current situation all-too predictable. As she said once in a speech after the release of Silent Spring, many people who have not read the book nonetheless “disapprove of it heartily”.

Rachel Carson never called for the banning of pesticides. She made this clear in every public pronouncement, repeated it in an hour-long television documentary about Silent Spring, and even testified to that effect before the US Senate. Carson never denied that there were beneficial uses of pesticides, notably in combating human diseases transmitted by insects, where she said they had not only been proven effective but were morally “necessary”.

“It is not my contention,” Carson wrote in Silent Spring, “that chemical insecticides must never be used. I do contend that we have put poisonous and biologically potent chemicals indiscriminately into the hands of persons largely or wholly ignorant of their potentials for harm. We have subjected enormous numbers of people to contact with these poisons, without their consent and often without their knowledge.”

Many agreed. Editorialising shortly after The New Yorker articles appeared, the New York Times wrote that Carson had struck the right balance: “Miss Carson does not argue that chemical pesticides must never be used,” the Times said, “but she warns of the dangers of misuse and overuse by a public that has become mesmerised by the notion that chemists are the possessors of divine wisdom and that nothing but benefits can emerge from their test tubes.”

Pesticide ban myth

Carson did not seek to end the use of pesticides - only their heedless overuse at a time when it was all but impossible to escape exposure to them. Aerial insecticide spraying campaigns over forests, cities and suburbs; the routine application of insecticides to crops by farmers at concentrations far above what was considered “safe”; and the residential use of insecticides in everything from shelf paper to aerosol “bombs” had contaminated the landscape in exactly the same manner as the then-pervasive testing of nuclear weapons - a connection Carson made explicit in Silent Spring.

“In this now universal contamination of the environment,” Carson wrote, “chemicals are the sinister and little-recognised partners of radiation in changing the very nature of the world - the very nature of its life.”

The Competitive Enterprise Institute - to its credit - acknowledges that Carson did not call for the banning of pesticides in Silent Spring. But it claims that Carson’s caveat about their value in fighting disease was so overwhelmed by her general disapproval of their use that “negative publicity” around Silent Spring halted the use of DDT against malaria, notably in sub-Saharan Africa where some 90 percent of the world’s malaria cases occur.

It’s true that Carson found little good to say about DDT or any of its toxic cousins - the chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon insecticides developed in the years after World War II and after the Swiss chemist Paul Muller had won a Nobel Prize for discovering DDT. But it’s a stretch to see how the mood surrounding Silent Spring was the prime cause of DDT’s exit from the fight against malaria.

And, as the New York Times and other publications proved, it was understood by anyone who took time to read Silent Spring that Carson was not an absolutist seeking to stop all pesticide use.

Waning DDT interest

DDT had been effective against malaria in Europe, in Northern Africa, in parts of India and southern Asia, and even in the southern United States where the disease was already being eradicated by other means. But these were mostly developed areas. Using DDT in places like sub-Saharan Africa, with its remote and hard-to-reach villages, had long been considered problematic. It was an old story and one still repeated: Africa was everybody’s lowest priority.

And in any case, the World Health Organization (WHO) had begun to question its malaria-eradication programme even before Silent Spring was published. One object lesson was that the heavy use of DDT in many parts of the world was producing new strains of mosquitoes resistant to the insecticide. Just as can happen with antibiotics, the use of an environmental poison clears susceptible organisms from the ecosystem and allows organisms with immunity to take over.

The WHO also faced declining interest in the disease among scientists, as well as sharp funding cuts from the international community.

When, in 1972, the recently created US Environmental Protection Agency banned DDT for most domestic uses, this ruling had no force in other parts of the world, so the insecticide remained part of the international anti-malaria arsenal. The US continued to manufacture and export DDT until the mid-1980s, and it has always been available from pesticide makers in other countries.

Still with us

One result is that DDT is still with us, globally adrift in the atmosphere from spraying operations in various parts of the world, and also from its continuing volatilisation from soils in which it has lain dormant for decades.

The threat of DDT to wildlife - as a deadly neurotoxin in many species and a destroyer of reproductive capabilities in others - has never been in doubt. Carson’s claims in Silent Spring about DDT’s connection to human cancer and other disorders have not been completely resolved.

The US National Toxicology Program lists DDT as “reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen”. The same holds for two of its common break-down products, DDD and DDE, which are also suspected of causing developmental problems in humans.

These are cloudy but worrisome presumptions. DDT is stored in fat tissues - including ours - and that storage is amplified with repeated exposures over time and through food chains, with unpredictable consequences. We walk around with our personal body-burden of DDT, a poison we still consume both from decades-old residuals and its ongoing uses. If Rachel Carson hoped to end the use of DDT and our exposure to it, she did a lousy job.

In 2006, the World Health Organization announced a renewed commitment to fighting malaria with DDT, mainly in Africa - where the WHO had never lifted its approval for this purpose. The move was backed by environmental groups, as it surely would have been by Rachel Carson had she been with us still.

COP28 must stick to 1.5°C target to save ice sheets, urge scientists

A report warns that 2°C of global warming would mean losing most of the world's ice sheets and glaciers, leading to catastrophic sea level rise

The world must stick to its target to limit climate warming to 1.5°C to avoid catastrophic melting of ice sheets and glaciers, according to a report.

The International Cryosphere Climate Initiative (ICCI), a group of scientists who study ice-covered parts of the world, warns that a rise of 2°C would liquidate most tropical and mid-latitude glaciers and set off long-term melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, leading to 12 to 20 metres of sea level rise.

In the 2015 Paris Agreement, all countries committed to holding global average temperature to ""well below 2°C"" over pre-industrial levels and ""pursuing efforts"" to limit it to 1.5°C. Our still-rising greenhouse gas emissions have already caused almost 1.2°C of warming and put us on track to exceed 3°C.

More than 350 cryosphere scientists have signed an open letter calling on countries to commit to the 1.5°C limit at the upcoming COP28 climate summit in Dubai.

""From the cryosphere point of view, 1.5°C is not simply preferable to 2°C or higher. It is the only option,"" Iceland's prime minister KatrÃ­n JakobsdÃ³ttir said in a statement.

Earth’s regions of snow and ice are melting faster than we expected and already approaching tipping points, says Jonathan Bamber at the University of Bristol, UK, who reviewed the ICCI report.

""We need to put the brakes on, big time,"" says Bamber. ""Otherwise, we’re going to see irreversible changes in the polar regions that are going to have global consequences.""

In the past two years, Antarctic sea ice has hit back-to-back record lows, Swiss glaciers have lost 10 per cent of their volume and a winter heatwave melted snow up to 3000 metres high in the Andes.

But 2°C of warming would be much worse, the report warns. The Arctic Ocean would be ice-free almost every summer. Annual carbon emissions from thawing permafrost soils would equal those of the European Union today. And absorption of atmospheric CO2 would permanently acidify polar seas and threaten krill, salmon and king crab.

The Himalayas would lose half their ice, disrupting water supplies for agriculture and hydropower and raising the threat of floods caused by glacial meltwater breaking through a barrier of ice or rock. One such flood killed at least 179 people in Sikkim, India, in October. A study this year found that 15 million people are at risk from sudden glacial floods, mostly in India, Pakistan, Peru and China.

""The lakes will start to get larger and larger,"" says Tenzing Chogyal Sherpa at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development in Nepal, whose hometown of Namche Bazaar, Nepal, was damaged by an outburst flood in 1985. ""They'll be more and more hazardous, and once they get to a point, something can just trigger them, like a landslide.""

Keeping to 1.5°C now requires the world to reach net zero emissions by 2034. Some scientists have argued 1.5°C is dead, while others point to the rapid uptake of solar and wind energy as reason for continued hope.

""It could be that [over 1.5°C] is where we end up,"" says Twila Moon at the University of Colorado Boulder, who helped organise the scientists’ letter. ""But I think talking ourselves out of rapid change now is selling ourselves short on what is possible because [of] cultural tipping points, social tipping points.""

And even above 1.5°C, ""every tenth of the degree counts,"" says Bamber.

Emergence of huge cicada generation in 2021 led to a caterpillar boom

The emergence of 'Brood X' periodical cicadas in the US in 2021 gave birds a new food source, leading to knock-on effects throughout forest ecosystems

Martha Weiss/Georgetown University

When big broods of cicadas emerge every 13 or 17 years, birds are treated to a smorgasbord of fresh food - and this sudden glut has cascading effects on other animals and plants in the ecosystem.

John Lill at The George Washington University in Washington DC and his colleagues first noticed the huge ecological impacts of cicadas in 2004. They immediately began planning to study the next of these once-in-a-generation events, when that huge brood, known as Brood X, would emerge again across the eastern US in 2021. ""We had 17 years to think about it,"" says Lill.

The researchers suspected that the sudden appearance of cicadas would cause birds to opportunistically change their diet to focus on the new food source, leaving their usual prey, like caterpillars, temporarily uneaten. They set out dummy caterpillars made of clay and recorded the telltale marks left by the beaks of confused birds as they attempted to eat them.

The team found that, in years with no cicadas, about one quarter of the dummies were attacked each week, but during the short few weeks of cicada season, fewer than 10 per cent showed signs of bird strikes.

Lill and his colleagues also enlisted local birders to observe birds feeding on cicadas, finding that more than 80 different species were taking part in the all-you-can-eat cicada buffet - even ones that don't normally eat insects.

""They saw owls, swans, herons and even small songbirds whose beak we thought would be too small to eat a cicada,"" says Lill. ""Some didn't recognise the cicadas as food at first, but they eventually figured it out.""

That temporary relief from predation had a huge impact on caterpillar populations and the forest at large. The team observed more than twice as many caterpillars during cicada season, and those caterpillars caused twice as much damage to trees and leaves as usual. ""In a normal year, birds regulate insect herbivore damage, but that gets disrupted in cicada years,"" says Lill.

These impacts are short-lived and the trees soon recover, but other studies have reported more enduring effects. The populations of some birds are higher in the year after an emergence and the cicadas can influence the timing of oak tree ""masting"" events, when the trees produce unusually large numbers of acorns.

The research gives a preview of what a world with fewer birds might be like, says Lill, as their populations dwindle due to climate change and other human interference. ""Birds are important for regulating insects in forestry and agriculture,"" he says. ""Without them, there will be more damage to forests and food crops.""

David Beresford at Trent University in Peterborough, Canada, says the study highlights the importance of looking for the unexpected outcomes that can result from changes to species in an ecosystem. ""We're not always going to see the effects where we expect them to show up,"" he says. ""There can be ripple effects across the whole system.""

The myth that men hunt while women stay at home is entirely wrong

An analysis of foraging societies from around the world has found that women hunt in the vast majority of those looked at, confirming that the idea of gender division in providing food is a myth

The idea that men hunt while women stay at home is almost completely wrong, a review of foraging societies around the world has found. In fact, women hunt in 80 per cent of the societies looked at, and in a third of these societies women were found to hunt big game – animals heavier than 30 kilograms – as well as smaller animals.

These findings are likely to be representative of all foraging societies past and present, says Cara Wall-Scheffler at the University of Washington in Seattle. “We have nearly 150 years of ethnographic studies sampled, we have every continent and more than one culture from every continent, and so I feel like we did get a pretty good swathe of what people do around the world,” she says.

There was already growing evidence that women hunted in many cultures in the past. For instance, of 27 individuals found buried with hunting weapons in the Americas, nearly half were women, a 2020 study found. Yet researchers have been reluctant to conclude that these women were hunters.

“There is a paradigm that men are the hunters and women are not the hunters, and that paradigm colours how people interpret data,” says Wall-Scheffler. Her team looked at a database called D-PLACE that has records on more than 1400 human societies worldwide made over the past 150 years. There was data on hunting for 63 of the foraging societies recorded and, of these, 50 described women hunting.

For 41 of these societies, there was information on whether women’s hunting was intentional or opportunistic – that is, whether they were going out to hunt rather than catching animals they stumbled upon while gathering plants, say. In 87 per cent of cases, it was intentional. “That number was higher than I expected,” says Wall-Scheffler.

The team also looked at data on the size of animals hunted by women, which was recorded for 45 societies. In 46 per cent of cases it was small game such as lizards and rodents, 15 per cent medium game and 33 per cent large game. In 4 per cent of the societies women hunted game of all sizes.

The analysis found that women’s hunting strategies were more flexible than men’s. “Women use a wider range of tools when they go hunting, they go out with a wider variety of people,” says Wall-Scheffler.

Hunter-gatherers kept animals for food before they farmed crops

They may hunt alone or with a male partner, other women, children or dogs, for instance, says Wall-Scheffler. While the bow and arrow was commonly used by female hunters around the world, she says, women also used knives, nets, spears, machetes, crossbows and more.

This greater flexibility could be a result of female hunters’ mobility varying when they are pregnant or breast-feeding, she says. In at least some cases women hunted with babies strapped to their backs, for instance.

In some societies there were taboos on women making or using specific tools or weapons, Wall-Scheffler says, forcing them to find alternatives.

“This paper represents a much-needed meta-analysis,” says Randy Haas at Wayne State University in Michigan, whose team carried out the study of burials in the Americas. “The findings, coupled with related archaeological findings, convincingly show that division of subsistence labour is much more variable than previously thought,” he says.

Given that women did and do hunt in so many societies, Wall-Scheffler says she can’t explain why the popular notion is that only men hunt. “I don’t understand it,” she says. “I think it is just as remarkable that women with babies on their back are going out to shoot animals.”

Male flies are better at mating after fighting off a robotic rival

Lab-reared insects sometimes struggle to compete for mates with wild males, but an encounter with a robotic replica seems to improve their performance

Male fruit flies reared in a lab are more successful at mating after an encounter with a robotic dummy designed to look like a rival male. The finding could boost efforts to control populations of the flies, which are a major crop pest.

The Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata) is one of the most destructive fruit pests in the world, found on every continent except Antarctica. There have been various attempts to rein it in by releasing large numbers of…

Endangered insects captured in vivid photographs

Photographer Levon Biss's project Extinct and Endangered: Insects in peril combines thousands of shots of insect specimens to create these startlingly clear images

WE ARE all aware that our influence on Earth has driven widespread biodiversity loss, from the species that have already disappeared to those on the brink. Among these is a group that outnumbers most other animals, but that we tend to overlook: insects. Some of these are captured here in startling clarity by photographer Levon Biss (pictured below), as part of his project Extinct and Endangered: Insects in peril.



Levon Biss

Biss created 40 vivid portraits of endangered and extinct insect species by combining thousands of shots of specimens from the American Museum of Natural History, New York. He used a photo-stacking technique in which the images, captured via microscope objective lenses on a bespoke photo rig (shown above), are brought together to produce final artworks with extreme levels of detail. The images are currently on display at the museum and feature in a book that shares the project’s name.

Levon Biss

The image above shows a nine-spotted ladybird, numbers of which have been mysteriously declining since the 1980s, and a giant Patagonian bumblebee (pictured below).

Levon Biss

The only bumblebee native to southern regions of South America, it has suffered from the introduction of domesticated European bumblebees to pollinate crops.



Levon Biss

The image above shows the now-extinct Rocky Mountain locust, as well as a raspa silk moth (main image) and a lesser wasp moth (pictured below), both of which are threatened.

Levon Biss

Biss says the decline in insect populations is alarming. “Insects provide the foundation of many ecosystems and if critical numbers are lost, then the knock-on effect is immediate and serious.”

Enumerating the trivial superpowers our readers possess

After putting out a call, Feedback reveals the latest crop of trivial superpowers claimed by readers - abilities that seem mundane to those who have them, but extraordinary to those less blessed

Spacey superpowers

Some people have a superior knowledge, and maybe control, of space and direction. That is evident in the harvest from Feedback’s call to identify trivial superpowers - a person’s ability to reliably do some particular task that seems mundane to them, but that most people find impossible to do except once in a while by sheer luck. Also evident, in the views expressed by some harvesters, is that other people have an inferior knowledge.

Yeasts have been used in food production for millennia. The microorganisms direct the fermentation process that is important for winemaking, baking and brewing. Food scientists have isolated strains of yeast that work particularly well for specific applications, but Yong-Su Jin at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign…

Changing stance is heartbreaking to see

Published 21 June 2023

From Karen Dawn, DawnWatch, an animal advocacy charity, Santa Barbara, California, US

Though it is great to see animal issues covered in New Scientist, it is heartbreaking to see Peter Singer, who was once a great voice for animals, even contemplating the idea that their farming and humane slaughter might be considered ethical (3 June, p 43). Can you imagine Gloria Steinem discussing types of sexism that she now thinks might be ethical?

Vikings left Greenland after growing ice sheet caused sea level rise

The increasing mass of the Greenland ice sheet caused local sea level to rise more than 3 metres after Vikings colonised Greenland, flooding many settlements and contributing to their abandonment of the place

By Michael Le Page

17 April 2023

The settlement of Qassiarsuk in Greenland was once probably the site of Brattahlid, the home of Viking Leif Erikson, whose statue watches over the area

Cindy Hopkins/Alamy

The sea level around Greenland rose more than 3.3 metres from AD 1000 to 1450, contributing to the woes of Viking settlers and to their eventual abandonment of the island, researchers have found.

In AD 985, Erik the Red established a colony in Greenland after being exiled from Iceland. At the time, the North Atlantic region was unusually warm - the so-called medieval warm period - but after a massive volcanic eruption in Indonesia in 1257, conditions became much colder for several centuries, a period known as the little ice age.

That led to the expansion of the Greenland ice sheet, say Marisa Borreggine at Harvard University and their colleagues, causing the land adjacent to the ice sheet to subside because of the increased weight. The bigger ice sheet also had a greater mass and so exerted a stronger gravitational pull on the waters around Greenland. These two factors had roughly equal effects on sea level there.

The growth of the Greenland ice sheet reduced global sea level by 7 millimetres during this time as it locked away water, but due to other factors, there was a small overall rise on average across the world. All of this contributed to the 3.3-metre rise around Greenland.

It was already known that the sea rose in Greenland when Vikings lived there, but Borreggine's team is the first to calculate the effect. The findings show that the coast would have retreated hundreds of metres, with the water swamping more than 200 square kilometres of land and impinging on many farms and homes.

That must have had a major impact on the settlers. There is evidence that their diet shifted from land-based to sea-based, says Borreggine.

The settlers - including Erik the Red's son Leif Erikson, who sailed to North America some 500 years before Christopher Columbus - were also grappling with colder weather making farming more difficult, conflict with Inuit peoples and reduced demand for walrus ivory as more elephant ivory reached Europe. By around 1450, all the settlements were abandoned.

""What we found is that sea level rise did indeed play a role in the Viking abandonment,"" says Borreggine. ""But it was not necessarily the number one cause.""

Greenland's ice sheet is now shrinking fast. Local sea level is already falling around Greenland as the gravity effect weakens and the reduced weight of ice allows land to rise. If the entire ice sheet there melts, as may soon become inevitable, local sea level will fall by more than 100 metres over coming centuries- but rise globally by around 6 metres on average.

Why saving Britain's rivers means more than cleaning up sewage

Researchers at the UK's annual River Restoration conference say that policy-makers and the general public are largely unaware that most of the UK's rivers aren't in their natural state, with huge impacts on biodiversity

UK policy-makers must deal with far more than sewage if they want to save the country's rivers, researchers have warned.

Last week, river practitioners and scientists congregated at the UK's annual River Restoration conference in Birmingham. The recurring theme of the two-day gathering was that officials and the general public are too focused on the excessive amounts of sewage discharged by water companies, and not enough on the fact that nearly all of the UK’s rivers are in an unnatural state.

""Even if you solved all the sewage and farming pollution affecting the UK's rivers, you'd only solve half the problem,"" Marc Naura at the River Restoration Centre in Cranfield, UK, and one of the organisers of the event, told New Scientist.

Just 3 per cent of the UK's rivers flow unobstructed, according to a European Union project. ""Through time, rivers have been straightened, widened and often lined with concrete, which provides little variety of habitat for aquatic wildlife,"" says Bella Davies at the South East Rivers Trust, a conservation body.

""Imagine you're a fish in such a straight concrete channel, when it rains and water runs off land and into rivers, you'd be faced with a wall of water which would be hard to swim against with nowhere to hide – you'd get washed downstream and out of the river,” says Davies. ""Over time the fish population disappears as there's nowhere to live, no river gravels and vegetation to lay your eggs, and the river structure doesn't support the diversity of aquatic insects you'd need to eat.""

While it is often cited that just 14 per cent of England's rivers achieve good ecological status, it is less noted that the most common reason that rivers don’t achieve this designation is due to physical modifications – 41 per cent of England's waterways fail on this measure.

Rivers were historically straightened to make way for roads and railways with little consideration for the impact on wildlife, says Chris Spray at the University of Dundee, UK.

""Many freshwater fish species, such as Atlantic salmon and trout, not only require cool, clean water in which to live, but also rely on natural river processes that provide clean gravels and boulders in which to lay their eggs, hide from predators and to find food,"" says Craig MacIntyre at the Esk District Salmon Fishery Board in Brechin, UK.

That is why many people at the conference were discussing solutions for restoring rivers to a more natural state. One is re-meandering, in which artificially straight rivers are bent again, restoring their natural flow. This increases the volume of water carried by rivers, which in turn reduces the risk of flooding and creates multiple types of water flow in the river, leading to a greater diversity in aquatic life, says Spray.



What we can do to let the UK's tamed rivers flow wild and free again

In the UK, 97 per cent of rivers have been modified, blocked and otherwise corralled to suit our needs - with enormous damage to wildlife. Here's how we can reverse the damage we've done

Last year, the UK's Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) launched the Landscape Recovery scheme. This isn’t specific to rivers, but half of the 22 projects funded as part of it involved restoring the natural processes of rivers and streams. These cost around £400,000 each. Defra plans to expand the scheme and pay for 25 more projects in the coming months.

D-J Gent at the UK’s Environment Agency told the conference it hopes to pay for 200 such projects by 2030. These will be funded by fines levied on water companies for various rule infringements, such as the illegal discharge of sewage.

But many people at the conference said such money alone wouldn’t be enough to tackle the artificial state of many of our rivers. David Sear at the University of Southampton, UK, hopes that more funding will come if the public better understands the severity of the issue.

""The general public doesn't even know that most of our rivers are physically modified,"" he says. ""People have grown up with rivers that look artificially straight and have weirs,"" he says. ""And so it doesn't seem abnormal.""

What does a Government Research Scientist do?

 



Government Research Scientist, Dr Lizzie Billington, Animal & Plant Health Agency

I'm responsible for...

Managing research projects that help us understand how the avian influenza (bird flu) virus works. If we can understand the virus better, we can make more informed decisions during outbreaks, to help minimise the impact these have on farming.

At the moment, my work is focusing on how viruses can evolve to become more dangerous to poultry and cause more severe disease in birds. We are also very interested in mammalian adaptation and assessing what drives pathogen evolution. I am also involved in outbreak response and organising multi-team studies.

My typical day...

Varies quite a lot. I might need to spend some time at my desk analysing sequences or writing up data, or I could be in the high containment labs helping with an outbreak or undertaking research.

I also spend a lot of time working on evaluating naturally occurring variants of the viruses that we work with to help answer research questions. Part of my job is also taken up with training other scientists to develop their skills.

The best part of my job...

Is working in the lab. I really enjoy being hands on with the science. The nice thing about being in research is that you get to know things no one else knows, then share that knowledge. Also, at APHA we have the facilities to work safely with these viruses in high containment labs. These facilities are quite rare globally and give me the opportunity to undertake research that can be unique, especially in the assessment of naturally occurring viruses. 

The most challenging part of my job...

Is the level of tracking we have to do during a disease outbreak. The results of our tests can have serious economic impacts, so everything has to be traceable and transparent. While this is important, it can take up quite a bit of time.

I love my job because...

It's dynamic and changes a lot, even within the usual routines and rhythms of reports and bird flu outbreaks. It keeps me on my toes and stops me getting bored.

Advice to others.. (What advice would you give to others who want a role like yours?)

Get in a lab as early as possible. A work experience placement or summer project can really help confirm that this is what you want to do. Also, get comfortable with coding, as that's an increasingly in demand skill to have within sciences.

My Plan B... (If it wasn't this job - what else would I be doing?)

If I wasn't at APHA I would probably be working in a university somewhere on a fixed/short term contract. The big advantage of being civil service for me is that I get to do the research I love with the stability of having a permanent job.

Please let us know anything else you think we should know...

A new genetic analysis has changed our understanding of Ã–tzi, the mummified ""Iceman"" who lived 5300 years ago and was found in a glacier in the Alps.

The findings reveal that almost all of Ã–tzi's DNA was inherited from early farmers, who moved into Europe a few thousand years before he was born.

The genome also indicates that he had darker skin than any people with predominantly European ancestry today, and may well have…

Do artificial sweeteners cause cancer and are there other concerns?

Fresh concerns have been raised over the potential for the sweetener aspartame to cause liver cancer

By Clare Wilson

14 July 2023

Sweeteners such as aspartame are often added to diet sodas

Two reports on the sweetener aspartame came out this week, noting that some research has linked its consumption to liver cancer. This comes after the World Health Organization (WHO) advised most people to avoid most kinds of ""non-sugar sweeteners"", after a 2022 review of the evidence found they don't help with weight control long term and may cause diabetes, heart attacks and death.

Which sweeteners are the concern?

In May, the WHO said most sweeteners are problematic, both artificial ones, such as aspartame and saccharin, as well as ones made from plants, such as stevia. The exception is sweeteners made from sugar alcohols called polyols, which don't fall under the ""non-sugar sweeteners"" umbrella and weren't included in the review.

Does aspartame carry any extra risk?

Two separate international bodies this week issued reports on the long-used sweetener aspartame and they are seemingly somewhat contradictory. The WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified the substance as ""possibly carcinogenic"", which sounds alarming, but actually means there is limited - and not convincing - evidence that it could be a cause of liver cancer.

A separate report, from the WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives concluded that there was no reason to change its existing recommendations on aspartame consumption. This advice says it is safe for people to have up to 40 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of their body weight, which would be up to 14 cans of diet soft drinks a day for someone who weighs 70 kilograms.

""The findings of limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and animals, and of limited mechanistic evidence on how carcinogenicity may occur, underscore the need for more research to refine our understanding on whether consumption of aspartame poses a carcinogenic hazard,"" said Mary Schubauer-Berigan at the IARC Monographs programme in a statement.

Would it be safer to avoid all sweeteners altogether?

The idea is that food and drinks with sweeteners help people reduce their sugar intake, as too much sugar is linked with higher weight, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. The trouble is that the evidence supporting this is mixed. Some short, randomised trials have found that consuming drinks with sweeteners instead of the full-sugar versions can reduce weight gain in children, but others have failed to show a benefit.

Population studies tend to show that sweetener consumption correlates with higher rates of diabetes and heart disease, but this could be because people are more likely to use sweeteners if they are heavier to start with, says Duane Mellor at Aston University in Birmingham, UK. The WHO says: ""The available evidence suggests that use of non-sugar sweeteners does not confer any long-term benefit in reducing body fat.""

What about managing diabetes?

The WHO said its broad recommendations in May don't apply to people who already have diabetes, because making recommendations for this group was outside the scope of the review and studies in people with diabetes weren't included. That said, people with type 2 diabetes, where blood sugar can get too high, generally need to limit the amount of sugar they eat.

Are there any other concerns over sweeteners?

Some research has suggested unexpected harms from specific kinds of sweeteners, generally from small studies in people or those involving animals. For instance, last year, it was found that saccharin and sucralose may raise blood sugar levels. This year, preliminary evidence emerged that a common polyol sweetener called erythritol could promote blood clots, although the polyols weren't included in the WHO's review anyway.

Findings such as these contradict initial assumptions that sweeteners are biologically inert. Nevertheless, current official health advice in most countries says people should choose artificial sweeteners over sugar.

So, do others agree we should ditch sweeteners?

It's complicated. Researchers say sweeteners still have their use, despite the WHO advising against them. ""The recommendation could have been a bit more nuanced in acknowledging the potential utility of non-sugar sweeteners to support short-term weight loss when used judiciously,"" says Allison Sylvetsky at The George Washington University in Washington DC.

You also may find it difficult to avoid sweeteners, as many foods and drinks now contain them without necessarily being marketed as diet products. This is especially true in countries such as the UK, South Africa and Portugal where ""sugar taxes"" have nudged drink manufacturers into using more sweeteners. But that isn't necessarily a bad thing, says Mellor. ""If you're going to consume a soft drink, it's better to switch to one with less sugar and more sweeteners,"" he says. ""But the perfect solution is going for water.""

What happens now?

Countries aren't obliged to follow WHO recommendations, but its reports may carry weight when national policies are being set. Because of the uncertainties in the evidence, the WHO says these recommendations are ""conditional"", meaning that they may need to be implemented differently by different countries. Some nations may just ignore the WHO guidelines, says Thomas Sanders at King's College London. ""It's going to cause some ructions.""

Let's use AI to rethink education, instead of panicking about cheating

If we build and use AI effectively, we can create an education system where students are assessed on the quality and depth of their knowledge, rather than the content of an exam, says Okezue Bell

ON A Monday afternoon in May, a final-year student, fresh off the Texas A&M University-Commerce graduation stage, received a shocking email. “The final grade for the course is due today at 5 p.m.,” it read. “I will be giving everyone in this course an… incomplete.”

According to a report in the Washington Post, agricultural sciences professor Jared Mumm had run his students’ essays through the AI tool ChatGPT, which had detected its own use in the work - an offence that warranted a zero on the assignment. But in reality, it was ChatGPT that was the plagiariser, incorrectly claiming…

Jim Murray: The 'activist angler' collecting data to improve rivers



By David Stock

All rivers in this country are in dire straits, says actor Jim Murray.

Best known for his role in The Crown, Murray’s passion lies in fishing Britain’s rivers and, as an angler, he feels that more could and should be done. We meet on the Upper Itchen, a chalk stream he fly-fishes, near to his home in southern England. “As an angler, I know and I see firsthand on a day-to-day basis just how degraded our rivers are, how abused our rivers are,” he says. “And now is the time to do something about it.”

Like many of the UK’s other waterways, chalk streams are at risk from agricultural waste, sewage and over-extraction, as well as the more localised problem of septic tanks that can leach phosphates into the aquifers that feed them. Chalk streams are rare – there are only around 200 in the world, mostly located in southern England. Many are also sites of scientific interest, which further compounds the issues they face.

To help, Murray started Activist Anglers, a campaign group focused on bringing anglers together to help enact change. “We are custodians of the river, whether we like it or not,” he says. According to Murray, anglers both directly and indirectly learn about the health of a river. “You’re looking at flow, you’re looking at water temperature, you’re looking at habitat - all predominately to learn where the fish may or may not be,” he says. And if something isn’t right, he hopes that knowledge could be put to good use.

“If we become more vocal about what we’re seeing, the destruction and the abuse we’re seeing of our waterways, if we report the pollution that we’re seeing, if we just communicate and become more responsible, a little drive and a little passion can translate into a huge amount of action,” he says. Now, Murray has added a testing kit to his arsenal for gathering information about rivers, allowing him to collect data on phosphate and nitrate levels, electrical conductivity and temperature. “We can all become citizen scientists,” he says.

Plants pollinated by non-native honeybees are less likely to survive

Honeybees brought to the US from Europe and Africa tend to move pollen between flowers on the same plant more than native bees do. This appears to lower the quality of some plants' offspring

Honeybees are no friends to some of the plants they visit. Native plants pollinated by non-native, wild honeybees produce offspring that are far less likely to survive and reproduce than those from plants pollinated by native pollinating insects.

Western honeybees (Apis mellifera) originated in Eurasia and Africa and were imported to North America in the 17th century. In some places, like San Diego county, California, they have established large, mostly feral populations that are wild and not used in beekeeping. There, they account for 75 per cent of all floral visitations among pollinators.

To investigate how the bees affect the reproduction of native plants, Dillon Travis and Joshua Kohn, both at the University of California, San Diego, compared the offspring of three kinds of plants - common phacelia (Phacelia distans), black sage (Salvia mellifera) and white sage (Salvia apiana) - that were pollinated by either honeybees or native pollinators.

The researchers bagged the plants' flowers to block certain pollinators from accessing them. Later, the team cultivated the plants' seeds, measuring the seedlings' germination success and survival at 10 weeks and how many leaves (and eventually flowers) they had. This told the researchers about the quality of the plants' offspring.

Offspring of plants that were pollinated by native pollinators were two to five times more evolutionarily fit - more likely to survive and reproduce - than those from honeybee-pollinated plants.

The team's field observations revealed that honeybees visited multiple flowers on the same plant twice as often as other pollinators did. So, the bees could be forcing the plants to self-pollinate at higher rates, leading to inbred offspring.

San Diego county is a biodiversity hotspot, with more than 600 native bee species and 2400 plant species, but honeybees' potential impact on this ecosystem is unclear, says Kohn.

""If native plant fitness is reduced, there’s more open space for invasives,"" he says. Many of those invasive plants also encourage the spread of fire by filling the space between shrubs and drying out, becoming highly flammable tinder.

On the other hand, says Kohn, honeybees' habit of targeting the most bountiful blooms may help some native plants.

""If those common, widespread, abundantly blooming things are now having lower fitness, it could mean that the rarer plants have an advantage,"" explains Kohn. ""So, it could protect diversity.""

The findings are ""an important demonstration"" that honeybees can negatively affect native plants, says Gretchen LeBuhn at San Francisco State University in California.

Clearly, honeybees are crucial for agriculture, she says, but the findings also highlight the need to carefully consider the impacts of both feral and managed honeybees.

A three-year drought may have brought down the ancient Hittite empire

Wood from a burial chamber in modern Turkey reveals there was a sudden severe drought around the time Hittite cities were abandoned 3000 years ago

John Marston

A three-year-drought may have led to the fall of the Hittite empire in the Middle East 3000 years ago.

The finding comes from analysing timber used to make the burial chamber of a later ruler, who may have been the father of King Midas, referred to in Greek legends.

The sudden drought ""would have undoubtedly caused mass problems with food provision. That would have affected the tax base of the empire pretty dramatically,"" says Sturt Manning at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.

The Hittite empire, which encompassed most of what is now Turkey and lasted nearly five centuries, was one of the major geopolitical forces of the ancient world, with a mastery of ironwork, a cuneiform writing system and an army that could take on neighbouring Egypt.

Ancient texts and archaeological discoveries suggest that around 1200 BC, cities began being abandoned and the empire splintered into independent states that were later overwhelmed by Assyrians from the east.

Several causes have been proposed, including disease, famine, a centuries-long shift to a drier climate, as well as earlier invasions by mysterious groups named ""Sea Peoples"" in Egyptian texts.

Now, Manning's team has found evidence of a sharp and severe drought from a huge chamber tomb built in the city of Gordion in 748 BC. As the tomb's mound is much bigger than others nearby, and was made about the time the local King Midas took the throne, some archaeologists say it could have been made for Midas's father, the previous ruler - although nothing to identify the occupant remains.

Clues to the fall of the Hittites, centuries earlier, come from the juniper logs making up the burial chamber. The logs were taken from 18 trees, which were growing from the period 1775 to 748 BC.

Less rainfall means less tree growth, which shows up as narrower gaps between tree rings. The logs show there were 80 instances of two or more consecutive years with low rainfall, and one of these was the three years from 1198 to 1196 BC - just when Hittite cities started being abandoned.

This was supported by another kind of test, measuring the ratio of different forms of carbon from samples of the wood. This shows gradually increasing dryness of the atmosphere between 1300 and 1200 BC, then spikes of dryness from 1222 to 1195 BC.

""Most traditional societies had some storage that would have helped them through one bad harvest,"" says Manning. ""By the time you get to a third one in a row, it's become a crisis.""

Alan Greaves at the University of Liverpool in the UK, who wasn’t involved in the research, says the results shed new light on the climate changes at the time and their economic impacts. ""How do you pay for soldiers, how do you pay for artisans to make things?"" he says. ""A short, sharp drought would be enough to topple a very centralised state based heavily on grain and the gathering in and distribution of agricultural goods.""

Ig Nobel prizes 2023: Rock licking and other unlikely winners

From eating fossils to reanimating dead spiders for use as mechanical gripping tools, this year's Ig Nobel prizes, for science that ""makes people laugh, then think"", are unveiled

By Marc Abrahams

14 September 2023

Josie Ford

September is here, and with it the year's new crop of 10 Ig Nobel prizes, each for a piece of research chosen with the same simple criterion - that it makes people laugh, then think. As per tradition, Feedback presents them to you.

A question of taste

Jan Zalasiewicz at the University of Leicester, UK, won the chemistry and geology Ig for explaining why many scientists like to lick rocks. His essay ""Eating fossils"", in The Palaeontological Association's newsletter, emphasises the simple practical gain: ""Wetting the surface allows fossil and mineral textures to stand out sharply, rather than being lost in the blur of intersecting micro-reflections and micro-refractions that come out of a dry surface."" During the ceremony, he acknowledged that, yes, sometimes it is also a matter of taste.

A team based in France, the UK, Malaysia and Finland won the literature prize ""for studying the sensations people feel when they repeat a single word many, many, many, many, many, many, many times"". Their paper, called ""The the the the induction of jamais vu in the laboratory: Word alienation and semantic satiation"", was published in the journal Memory.

During the ceremony, Nobel laureates present Ig Nobel prizes to the winners. Nobellian Al Roth told the team: ""I have to say, I had never seen a paper like this before, and I say congratulations and congratulations and congratulations and congratulations.""

Spidery grip

Te Faye Yap, Daniel Preston and their colleagues at Rice University in Texas won the mechanical engineering prize for reanimating dead spiders to use as mechanical gripping tools, thus pioneering a field for which they invented the name: ""necrobotics"".

In presenting them the prize, Barry Sharpless, who has two Nobel prizes in chemistry, confessed he himself is terrified of spiders because of a childhood encounter with tarantulas. He expressed admiration for the necroboticists' courage.

Seung-min Park won the public health prize for inventing the Stanford Toilet, a device that uses a variety of technologies - including a computer-vision system for defecation analysis and an anal-print sensor paired with an identification camera - to monitor and quickly analyse the substances that humans excrete. During the ceremony, Park spoke of his mixed hope and dread in trying to simultaneously diagnose individual people's health problems and protect their privacy (and privates).

Going backwards

MarÃ­a JosÃ© Torres-Prioris, Adolfo GarcÃ­a and their team won the communication prize for studying the mental activities of people who are expert at speaking backwards. Their study ""Neurocognitive signatures of phonemic sequencing in expert backward speakers"" focused on a community in La Laguna, Spain, where some people grow up learning to speak backwards as well as forwards.

The medicine prize went to Natasha Mesinkovska and her team at the University of California, Irvine, for using cadavers as a means to explore whether there is an equal number of hairs in each of a person's two nostrils. Their surprisingly charming write-up in the International Journal of Dermatology says that the average nose hair count per nostril is around 120 in the cadavers they examined.

This started out as an attempt to learn the medical significance, if any, of there being hairs in one nostril but not the other in a living individual with alopecia.

It's electrifying

Experiments to determine how electrified chopsticks and drinking straws can change the taste of food won the nutrition prize for Homei Miyashita and Hiromi Nakamura at Meiji University in Japan. They have found ways, they report, to make food taste saltier than it really is. This is a potential health boon for people who like to dine on food that gains its tastiness from being ultra-salty.

Katy Tam, Christian Chan and their colleagues won the education prize for methodically studying the boredom of teachers and students. Anyone with sufficient interest can read details of that research in a pair of studies: ""Boredom begets boredom: An experience sampling study on the impact of teacher boredom on student boredom and motivation"" and ""Whatever will bore, will bore: The mere anticipation of boredom exacerbates its occurrence in lectures"".

In 1969, Stanley Milgram - famous for his series of experiments about ""obedience to authority"", in which people seemed to obey instructions to give electric shocks to strangers - performed a more gentle experiment.

Milgram (who died in 1984) and two of his students - at least one of whom, Leonard Bickman, is still alive - were awarded the psychology prize for experiments on a New York City street to see how many passers-by stopped to look upward when they saw strangers looking upward. Bickman accepted the prize on behalf of the entire trio.

Bieito FernÃ¡ndez Castro and his team won the physics prize for measuring the extent to which ocean-water mixing is affected by the sexual activity of anchovies.

The entire Ig Nobel ceremony was again, as in the first three pandemic years, held online.

 

Marc Abrahams created the Ig Nobel Prize ceremony and co-founded the magazine Annals of Improbable Research. Earlier, he worked on unusual ways to use computers. His website is improbable.com.

Bing Chat AI tricked into solving CAPTCHA tests with simple lies

Microsoft's AI-powered Bing Chat can be tricked into solving anti-bot tests with stories about deceased grandmothers or missing glasses

Microsoft’s AI-powered Bing Chat can be tricked into solving anti-bot CAPTCHA tests with nothing more than simple lies and some rudimentary photo editing.

Tests designed to be easy for humans to pass, but difficult for software, have long been a security feature on all kinds of websites. Over time, types of CAPTCHA - which stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart - have become more advanced and trickier to solve.

However, although humans often struggle to complete modern CAPTCHAs successfully, the current crop of advanced AI models can solve them easily. They are therefore programmed not to, which should stop them being used for nefarious purposes. This is part of a process known in the field as “alignment”.

Bing Chat is powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4 model, and it will obediently refuse to solve CAPTCHA tests if presented with them. But Denis Shiryaev, the CEO of AI company neural.love, says he was able to convince Bing Chat to read the text on a CAPTCHA test by editing it onto a photograph of a locket. He then told the AI the locket belonged to his recently deceased grandmother and he needed to decipher the inscription. The AI duly obliged, despite its programming.

Bots are better at beating ""˜are you a robot?' tests than humans are

Shiryaev says tricking AI models is ""just a fun experiment"" he carries out for research. ""I’m deeply fascinated by the breakneck pace of large language model development, and I constantly challenge this tech with something to try its boundaries, just for fun,"" he says. ""I believe current generation models are well-aligned to be empathetic. By using this approach, we could convince them to perform tasks through fake empathy.""

But cracking CAPTCHA tests with AI would enable bad actors to carry out a range of unwanted practices, such as creating fake accounts on social media for propaganda use, registering huge numbers of email accounts for sending spam, subverting online polls, making fraudulent purchases or accessing secure parts of websites.

Shiryaev believes that most CAPTCHA tests have already been cracked by AI, and even websites and services that use them instead look at a user’s mouse movements and habits to assess whether they are a human or a bot, rather than relying on the actual result of the CAPTCHA.

New Scientist was able to repeat Shiryaev’s experiment and convince Bing Chat to read a CAPTCHA test - albeit with misspelled results. Hours later, the same request was refused by the chatbot, as Microsoft appeared to have patched the problem.

But Shiryaev was able to quickly demonstrate that using a different lie sidesteps the protection once again. He placed the CAPTCHA text on a screenshot of a star identification app and asked Bing Chat to help him read the ""celestial name label"" as he had forgotten his glasses.

A Microsoft spokesperson said: ""We have large teams working to address these and similar issues. As part of this effort, we are taking action by blocking suspicious websites and continuously improving our systems to help identify and filter these types of prompts before they get to the model.""

Air pollution monitors have been accidentally harvesting wildlife DNA

DNA from plants' and animals' shed cells gets caught in air filters at pollution monitoring stations, providing a valuable source of data for tracking biodiversity

By Matthew Sparkes

Air quality monitoring stations, like this one at Auchencorth Moss near Edinburgh, UK, collect DNA from the environment

Air quality monitoring stations, like this one at Auchencorth Moss near Edinburgh, UK, collect DNA from the environment

National Physical Laboratory / Local Site Operator

Air samples collected at pollution monitoring stations could provide a treasure trove of data on plant and animal life thanks to new environmental DNA methods.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) comes from shed cells, waste and blood left in the air, water or soil. Methods to detect it have revolutionised wildlife surveys in recent decades: rather than needing to physically see and capture animals to confirm their presence, we can now simply analyse the DNA they leave behind.

While these methods are remarkable, they are still too intensive to carry out on the extremely wide and regular scales needed to track the rise and decline of species over time. But a new approach could change all that by making use of samples that are already routinely taken, and in some cases stored for decades, in order to track air pollution.

James Allerton at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington, UK, says he read a report about harvesting eDNA with air filters and realised that it was remarkably similar to his own work monitoring air quality. He contacted the biologists behind the report and an international team has now carried out experiments that prove that air pollution monitoring stations have inadvertently collected and stored DNA samples that can now be analysed.

“It seemed like a no-brainer,” he says. “It’s a really good lesson: read around your subject, and read outside your subjects.”

His collaborator Elizabeth Clare at York University in Toronto, Canada, says the new technique will be able to detect the rise of invasive species as well as the decline of native species, but will also reveal entirely new creatures and plants that are thus far unknown to science.

In tests, the team took filters from air monitors in London and Auchencorth Moss near Edinburgh, UK, and stored them for eight months before analysing them for DNA. They identified DNA from more than 180 different plants, fungi, insects, mammals, birds, fish and amphibians. They included hedgehogs, badgers, smooth newts, songbirds, trees and arable crops.

Clare and her colleagues are now hunting for archives of the standardised 47-millimetre air filters from government and private institutions around the world with the hope of building a global database of biodiversity information, both historic and contemporary.

“I talked to somebody with more than half a million of these in storage,” she says. “There are probably millions of them in existence around the world, archived.”

Douglas Yu at the University of East Anglia, UK, says being able to create new data sets from historical samples will be useful, but perhaps the biggest advantage of the technique will be as a way to easily collect samples in the future. This could help to monitor the success of initiatives aiming to restore biodiversity, he says.

Rare Antarctic meteorite is one of the largest ever found

Antarctica is the perfect place to go meteorite hunting, as space rocks stand out on the wide fields of ice, and researchers have found a new crop

By Alex Wilkins

24 January 2023

The meteorite probably originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter

Researchers in Antarctica have recovered a rare large meteorite on the ice. Weighing in at 7.6 kilograms, it is one of the largest space rocks ever discovered on the continent.

Antarctica’s dry, cold weather carefully preserves any meteorites that land, while a uniform white background and active glaciers churn up ancient space rocks buried beneath the ice, making it one of the best places to find meteorites. In the past hundred years, more than 45,000 meteorites have been found in Antarctica, the majority of which have been micrometeorites, which range from tens to hundreds of grams.

Maria SchÃ¶nbÃ¤chler at ETH Zurich in Switzerland and her colleagues discovered five new meteorites during an expedition near the Princess Elisabeth Antarctica research station in December last year. This was during Antarctica's summer, when temperatures were at a relatively warm -10°C (14°F).

To find the meteorite, SchÃ¶nbÃ¤chler and her team combed through satellite imagery using a machine learning model and identified five icy regions that were relatively free of snow, which might have otherwise covered up meteorites. They explored all five regions systematically by snowmobile, but only one contained any meteorites. ""To find such a big one - this is kind of luck to be honest,"" says SchÃ¶nbÃ¤chler.

All four of the key DNA building blocks have been found in meteorites

While the meteorite has yet to be analysed, it appears to be an ordinary chondrite, says SchÃ¶nbÃ¤chler, which is the most common type. These objects contain the oldest material in the solar system and probably originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.

The team will now send the meteorite to Belgium, in a cool box to prevent thawing that could damage its delicate chemical structure, for further analysis.

""We don’t tend to find too many meteorites in Antarctica that are as big as this,"" says Ashley King at the Natural History Museum in London. ""The more meteorite we have, the more sample that we have available for us to study and learn about the early solar system.""

The best new science fiction books of September 2023

We have a bumper crop of new sci-fi books for you this September, including talking spy cats from John Scalzi, an amazing discovery in space from Stephen Baxter and a near-future novel by Sebastian Faulks, says culture editor Alison Flood

September will always feel like a time for new beginnings to me, regardless of the fact that I no longer need a new pencil case or any fresh pencils. Reading-wise, it's time to reset after the holiday novels of July and August - but before I do, if you didn't pick up two of last month's recommendations, Lauren Beukes's Bridge (our latest pick for the New Scientist Book Club) or Daniel Kraus's Whalefall (about a boy trying to escape the belly of a sperm whale), then do - they're amazing! This month promises even more great reads, with new novels out from two of my favourites, Stephen Baxter and John Scalzi, plus an intriguing-sounding debut from Em X. Liu that reimagines Hamlet as sci-fi, and near-future speculative novels from Sebastian Faulks, C. Pam Zhang, and Kelechi Okafor.

Star Wars: From a Certain Point of View - Return of the Jedi

To mark the 40th anniversary of the release of Return of the Jedi, this anthology sees 40 scenes from the movie recreated through the eyes of a supporting character, from droids to Mon Mothma. So, among the 40 writers and artists contributing, we have Olivie Blake giving a glimpse into the mind of Emperor Palpatine, Mary Kenney telling the story of Wicket the Ewok's dream of a quiet day on the forest moon of Endor and (most excitingly for me) Charlie Jane Anders looking into that terrifying mouth gaping in the desert of Tatooine.

Creation Node by Stephen Baxter

Stephen Baxter is the author of one of my all-time favourite moments in a sci-fi novel: when the oceans close over the top of Everest in Flood. I think of his drowned Earth relatively often - it is an image burned into my brain. His latest book sounds equally intriguing and I'll definitely be giving it a read. Set in 2255, it follows the discovery of an object called Planet Nine, which a woman named Salma spots from her spaceship. It's not a planet, or the ""ninth"" of anything; it was briefly believed to be a black hole, but then it sends a message that there is something waiting on its surface. Meanwhile, a quasar has appeared and is heating up the solar system. Lots to deal with, then.

Starter Villain by John Scalzi

This is the sort of sci-fi novel that needs to be described as a ""caper"", I feel. It's set on Earth today and sees divorced substitute teacher Charlie inherit his long-lost late uncle Jake's supervillain business (complete with island volcano lair). Unfortunately for Charlie, he also inherits his uncle's enemies. We are also promised intelligent, talking spy cats and unionised dolphins - what's not to like?

The Seventh Son by Sebastian Faulks

This is more speculative than straight sci-fi, but Faulks is such a class act, and the novel promises fertility experiments that will ""upend the human race as we know it"" - so I think we can comfortably claim it for our round-up.

Baby Seth, the result of a series of secret IVF treatments masterminded by a billionaire entrepreneur (you've got to watch out for these guys), begins to attract attention when his differences - of appearance, interests and more - start to show. I am reading this now, and am absolutely engrossed.



The best new science fiction books of August 2023

From speculative novellas by Josh Malerman to a first venture into science fiction from H is for Hawk author Helen Macdonald, August brims with sci-fi potential, says culture editor Alison Flood

Land of Milk and Honey by C. Pam Zhang

I adored Zhang's first novel, How Much of These Hills Is Gold, set in the 19th-century Old West. I highly, highly recommend it: Zhang is a phenomenal writer. Her second book moves the action to the near future, where food crops are disappearing and a smog is spreading. Hoping to escape her troubled reality, a chef takes a job in a mountaintop colony for the global elite and discovers plans to reshape the world.

The Circumference of the World by Lavie Tidhar

Tidhar is always excellent, and his latest comes highly recommended by Sally Adee, our sci-fi columnist. It sees a mathematician, a book dealer and a mobster on the trail of a book that disappears once it is read - or does it? Only its author, a sci-fi-writer, knows the truth.

I loved talking to Tidhar earlier this year for New Scientist about his dystopian film, Welcome to Your AI Future!, which used the AI image-generation program Midjourney to tell the story of an AI trying to help the last surviving human, and I am looking forward to this new novel.

The Death I Gave Him by Em X. Liu

This novel had me at ""reimagines Shakespeare's Hamlet as a queer sci-fi locked-room thriller"": I mean, why ever not? It sees Hayden Lichfield out to avenge the death of his father, who has been murdered in their lab, where they were developing the Sisyphus Formula - which might one day reverse death itself. When the lab is put on lockdown, Hayden is trapped with four other people, one of whom must be the killer. His only ally is Horatio, the lab's AI.

Edge of Here by Kelechi Okafor

What a treat this sounds: a speculative short story collection to dip into in this busiest of months. Okafor, who is host of the Say Your Mind podcast, sets out to explore contemporary Black womanhood, but sets her stories in a Black Mirror-esque version of the near future. There's one in which you can experience someone else's emotions through a chip in your brain, one where you can view bits of a distant relative's life with help from your DNA, one where you can explore an alternative love life with a stranger""¦



The best new science fiction books of July 2023

From George R. R. Martin's new Wild Cards anthology to Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah's dystopian take on America, there is a wealth of exciting science fiction out this month. Culture editor Alison Flood shares the novels she is most anticipating

The Fractured Dark by Megan E. O'Keefe

This is the second in the Devoured Worlds series - which I can't believe I haven't stumbled on before, as a space opera with dying planets, dangerous conspiracies and secret romances sounds right up my street.

I'm going to start with the first in the series, The Blighted Stars (which comes garlanded with praise from writer Connie Willis, who calls it a ""riveting adventure at a rocketing pace""). This latest sees Naira and Tarquin out to discover more about the blight that has been killing habitable planets and digging into the Mercator family secrets. Then the head of Mercator disappears with the universe's remaining supply of starship fuel.

This Is How We End Things by R.J. Jacobs

This isn't really sci-fi, but it's science and it's fiction and it's a thriller - and I love the sound of it, so I'm banking on some of you also being keen. We start with a group of graduate students who are studying the psychology of lying. This is a crime novel, so all of them have something to hide, and one of them winds up dead after an experiment. Oh - and they're also trapped on their abandoned campus by a snowstorm.

My Amazon family's gut microbes may help us fight inflammatory disease

The Yanomami people of the Amazon have the world's most diverse gut microbiome - and David Good, who is half Yanomami, thinks it might hold the clues to better health

By Clare Wilson

4 April 2023

Nabil NEZZAR

THE Yanomami people, based in the Amazon rainforest of southern Venezuela and northern Brazil, are one of the last Indigenous groups in the region that still live by hunter-gathering and small-scale farming. They also have the most diverse gut microbiome of any human community studied so far.

David Good is half Yanomami: his mother is a member of the Irokai-teri community and his father is from the US, where Good was brought up. After a life-changing reunion with his mother in the Amazon as an adult, Good is now doing a PhD in microbiology at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada. His research involves studying the Yanomami’s unusual microbiomes - the bacteria, viruses and fungi that live on and in our bodies - with a view to developing new therapies for microbiome-associated conditions.

Here, he tells New Scientist about his work with the Yanomami, from collecting stool samples from family members and gaining first-hand experience of their diverse diet - and why he will never eat armadillo again - to what we can learn from studying their microbiomes.

Clare Wilson: Do you mind if I ask about your family? How did your parents meet?

David Good: Sure. My dad was a grad student at Pennsylvania State University and he was tasked to enter the Amazon to study the Yanomami’s protein intake. At the time, in the late 1970s, there was a debate over whether protein deficiency was causing their warfare. [The Yanomami have been falsely portrayed by anthropologists as engaging in a great deal of warfare and violence over access to resources.] He fell in love with the Yanomami way of life:…

Ship taller than Eiffel Tower will build biggest offshore wind farm

Including its 130-metre-long legs, the Voltaire wind turbine installation vessel is 336 metres high. It is on its way from China to the North Sea, where it will install huge new turbines at Dogger Bank

By Jeremy Hsu

4 January 2023



A ship taller than a skyscraper is heading to the North Sea to build the world's largest offshore wind farm at Dogger Bank, off the north-east coast of England.

The Voltaire ""jack-up"" ship - so called because it deploys its four 130-metre-long legs to stand on the sea floor - reaches 336 metres, just taller than the Eiffel Tower. Its main deck crane can lift wind turbine components weighing 3200 tonnes - more than 22 times the weight of the Statue of Liberty's copper and iron body. ""Our vessel has been designed especially to install the highest offshore structures…

Egg sex screening aims to stop slaughter of billions of male chicks

Male chicks have no value to farmers who raise egg-laying chicken breeds, meaning that billions are slaughtered straight after hatching. Now, techniques to sex embryos inside eggs aim to end this practice

Technologies for identifying the sex of chicken eggs are being rolled out in Europe to help end the mass culling of male chicks, which is still standard practice in the US, UK and Australia.

Farmers only value the females of egg-laying chicken breeds, because males can't lay eggs and have less meat than broiler chickens that are raised for food. As a result, billions of males are killed straight after hatching each year worldwide.

Well-placed mangrove forests can help protect coastal communities from rising water levels during a tropical storm, according to a modelling study.

Mangroves contain trees that grow in saltwater on coastlines, mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. In many parts of the world, they have been destroyed to make way for fish and seafood farming. However, they are important carbon sinks and their restoration is seen as a promising way to mitigate climate change.

Chickens made resistant to bird flu with CRISPR gene editing

Modifying a protein in chicken cells can help the birds resist infection by influenza viruses, but further testing is needed before this approach can be rolled out

By Carissa Wong

Chickens have been gene-edited to acquire resistance to bird flu, suggesting a possible way to protect flocks from future outbreaks. But years of further testing and regulatory approval are needed before gene-edited birds can be farmed for consumption.

Since 2021, a record outbreak of avian flu has devastated poultry farms and wild birds worldwide, caused by the H5N1 subtype of the influenza A virus. The outbreak has also spread to some mammals and occasionally people - including two fatal cases in Cambodia in the past week.

As a result, countries including Mexico, France and Ecuador have recently joined China in vaccinating poultry against bird flu. But the US and UK have decided against this strategy, partly due to concerns that current vaccines don’t provide full protection against the circulating strains and would lead to resistant forms of the virus evolving.

Alewo Idoko-Akoh, then at the University of Edinburgh ,UK, and his colleagues have now tested whether gene editing can be used to protect chickens from the virus. All subtypes of the bird flu virus use a chicken protein called ANP32A to replicate inside chicken cells. By editing genes in chicken cells using CRISPR technology, the researchers found that changing two amino acids in ANP32A prevented the virus from being able to replicate in the cells.

They then edited chicken embryos to produce 10 chickens with the altered form of ANP32A, before exposing the birds to a natural dose of the H9N2 subtype of bird flu, which causes milder illness than H5N1. The team also exposed a group of 10 non-edited chickens to the virus and swabbed all the birds' airways daily for seven days after exposure. All of the non-edited chickens became infected, but only one of the gene-edited chickens did.

Idoko-Akoh and his colleagues repeated the experiment with a viral dose 1000 times higher than the natural dose. This time, 5 out of 10 gene-edited birds became infected, but the virus levels in their airways were substantially lower than it was in non-edited chickens.

A monthly celebration of the biodiversity of our planet's animals, plants and other organisms.

In these birds, the virus had acquired genetic mutations that enabled it to replicate with the help of two proteins similar to ANP32A, called ANP32B and ANP32E, reducing its reliance on ANP32A. This could explain why some of the gene-edited birds became infected.

The researchers then showed that editing the genes for all three proteins together completely prevents virus replication in chicken cells. ""We are planning to genetically edit chickens to target all three genes, which we think will be needed to make birds completely resistant to bird flu,"" says Idoko-Akoh. ""We're aiming for complete protection to avoid the emergence of viruses resistant to the gene edits.""

Despite the promising results, there are many barriers to overcome before bird flu-resistant chickens hit the market. ""I'm thinking it'll be 20 years from now before we might have gene-edited chickens in farms, says Idoko-Akoh. ""You have to test for the health and welfare of the chickens, breed the chickens and distribute them.""

""Rolling out the technology will be pretty expensive, and that may create an issue in terms of access in places like Africa and Asia where some of the greatest risk for bird flu exists,"" he says.

Culturally sensitive discussions about the technology will be necessary to find out what people find acceptable in terms of food production, says Idoko-Akoh.

""This is a really fantastic study at a time where we're having a global crisis of avian influenza,"" says Kirsty Short at the University of Queensland, Australia. ""They really thoroughly investigated gene editing as a way to give birds resistance to influenza.""

""We may never achieve 100 per cent protection [against bird flu] using this approach alone, but a combination of genetic modification, widespread vaccination and improved farming practices, such as reducing contact between birds, could be really effective,"" says Short.

Lost presumed dead: The search for the most wanted birds in the world

The Search for Lost Birds project has already tracked down two species on its top 10 list. But is this focus on a handful of potentially extinct birds really good for conservation?

IT WAS the first day of 2023 and John Mittermeier was feeling dispirited. He and his colleagues had been in Madagascar for 10 days searching for a bird last seen more than two decades ago. Long treks looking for its native forest habitat had revealed swathes of land cleared for agriculture and vanilla production. They had faced rain and leeches and Mittermeier had been ill much of the time. And, in two days, they would start heading home.

The team had just moved to a new location and Mittermeier had awoken full of hope, but he soon realised that the environment there was also degraded. “I went from a high of anticipation to ‘this is a disaster’,” he says. By 9 am he was walking back to camp. Then it happened. “Boom! There was a dusky tetraka.”

This little green bird with its yellow throat and eye rings is so special that it makes the “most-wanted” list of the Search for Lost Birds. The initiative, launched in 2021, aims to use the excitement that elusive species inspire to direct the world’s army of birdwatchers, researchers and conservationists to seek out avians lost to science. It even offers financial support for some searches.

Efforts to prevent the Yellow River flooding may have made it worse

Analysis of flooding on the Yellow River in China suggests that mud barriers intended to prevent flooding resulted in more frequent floods

Building mud barriers alongside rivers to prevent floods may have the opposite effect, suggests an analysis of flooding from the Yellow River in China.

More extreme and frequent rainfall due to global warming means river flooding is a growing threat to millions of people worldwide. While there is a large body of research on how climate change affects flood risk, the role of human activities is less clear.

To explore this, Shi-Yong Yu at Jiangsu Normal University in China and his colleagues analysed the frequency of floods on the Yellow River in northern China. This 800-kilometre-long waterway was the cradle of ancient Chinese civilisation between 4100 and 3600 years ago.

The researchers compiled a timeline of floods on the river from the past 12,000 years using historical records and data from river sediments. They found that flooding was rare between 12,000 and 7000 years ago, with an average of just four floods every 100 years.

They then compared the timeline of floods with records of human activities, such as agriculture, and found that floods became more common following the expansion of local human settlements around 4000 years ago.

In particular, the analysis revealed that flooding rates substantially increased around 1500 years ago, when people began building mud ridges along the river as flood barriers called levees, says Yu.

Flooding occurred 10 times more often in the past 1000 years compared with before the start of ancient Chinese civilisation, the researchers found. Their analysis suggests that human activities, primarily the use of artificial embankments, drove about 80 per cent of this increase in flood rates, with the rest attributable to natural changes in the climate, says Yu.

Computational modelling of the river indicates that riverside mud barriers may lead to a greater build-up of sediment at the bottom of the river. This lifts the riverbed and raises water levels, making floods more likely, says Yu.

Why rivers are important for everything from biodiversity to wellbeing

""The work stresses the need to examine the range of human activities affecting flooding in the backdrop of climate change. This is an important message we must take on board today,"" says James Best at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

Artificial embankments are no longer used to stem flooding in the Yellow River. Since the early 1980s, the Chinese government has introduced a policy to conserve wild riverside vegetation, which keeps the soil around the river stable, says Yu. This helps prevent soil from falling in and may be a better approach, he says.

But as building mud barriers is still the preferred flood prevention strategy in many parts of the world, the research suggests that other countries should also shift away from artificial embankments, says Yu. ""We can learn lessons from studying the history of rivers,"" he says.

More than 2 million people risk running out of water in Gaza. After attacks by Hamas militants, Israel has cut off water and electricity to the region for more than a week, exacerbating a water crisis years in the making. The result leaves Gaza's population - half of whom are children - increasingly vulnerable to waterborne diseases, infections and dehydration. ""It has become a matter of life and death,"" said Philippe Lazzarini at UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestine refugees, in a statement on 14 October.

Gaza has struggled with a water crisis for decades. The region - one of the most densely populated in the world - has no reliable source of surface water. Its only main freshwater supply is a shallow aquifer. Over-pumping from Gaza and surrounding countries, including Israel, has severely depleted the aquifer in recent years, increasing its salinity. Seawater intrusion, wastewater and agricultural run-off have also contaminated it. The UN says that 97 per cent of the aquifer's groundwater doesn't meet World Health Organization (WHO) water quality standards. As a result, most of Gaza's population relies on private water tankers and small-scale desalination plants to supply drinking water.

On 7 October, Hamas militants from Gaza invaded Israel, killing more than 1000 civilians and taking at least 150 hostages. In response, Israel has shut off Gaza's electricity and water supply, prevented fuel and humanitarian aid from entering the region and bombed the territory, killing almost 3000 people, according to estimates from the WHO.

Israel opened just one waterline in southern Gaza for 3 hours on Tuesday and the electricity blackout has forced all of Gaza's desalination plants to shut down.""A crisis is imminent due to a lack of water and a desperate situation for civilians,"" said Richard Peeperkorn at the WHO in a briefing.

Prior conflicts with Israel have also severely damaged Gaza's water system. In recent years, Israel and Egypt have also restricted the import of equipment needed to maintain water infrastructure, including water pumps. This, along with a lack of investment, has prevented Gaza from making repairs meaning the region's water system was outdated and incapable of meeting demand even before the current crisis. ""The conflict is disrupting already unreliable water availability in Gaza for millions of people,"" says Peter Gleick at the Pacific Institute, a water think tank in California.

Without safe drinking water, people in Gaza have started using dirty well water, which could lead to outbreaks of water-related diseases, including cholera and dysentery. The lack of electricity and fuel means Gaza also cannot run sanitation operations, like sewage treatment and disposal. ""Without adequate sanitation, it's almost impossible to maintain high-quality water for long periods of time,"" says Kellogg Schwab at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland.

This could lead to disease outbreaks in neighbouring regions, too. In 2016, for instance, a desalination plant in Israel had to periodically shut down due to pollution from Gaza. ""We have a risk of the emergence of diseases that threaten public health, like cholera and polio, not just in Gaza, but in other parts of the world,"" said Ahmed Al-Mandhari at the WHO during Tuesday's briefing. ""So, this situation is actually a threat to public health worldwide.""

""The failure to have safe water also, of course, affects the ability of hospitals to treat illnesses, injuries and wounds from the conflict,"" says Gleick.

Even if Israel resumes water supplies to Gaza, the current crisis is far from over. Without electricity, water cannot be pushed through pipes, for instance. Plus, water has now been stagnant in pipes for days, meaning it is probably contaminated with groundwater and heavy metals, says Schwab. And transporting water through densely populated, war-torn areas will be difficult, he says.

Humanitarian aid from the WHO and UN has been held up at the Egyptian border with Gaza for days now, said Peeperkorn. But the border crossing remained closed as of Tuesday. The UN, which recognises access to water and sanitation as a human right, warned on Tuesday that the death rate in Gaza will soon rise if access to water isn't resumed. The Israeli government didn’t respond to New Scientist's request for comment.

Losing a leg in youth changes how male harvestmen woo females

Harvestmen can shed legs when attacked by predators, but this survival tactic may have lifelong ramifications for the future sexual strategies of young males

Harvestment can remove one of their own legs to escape a predator

Losing a leg early in life makes a male harvestman much more likely to grow up into a sneaker than into a fighter.

Young male harvestmen (Forsteropsalis pureora) - sometimes known as daddy longlegs - regularly mature into slim, meek adults if they lose a leg. Researchers think this may be because missing limbs make it more difficult to gather the food required to grow into a brawny, belligerent arachnid.

Males of many harvestmen species have evolved weaponry such as leg…

Why rivers are important for everything from biodiversity to wellbeing

The UK's 200,000 kilometres of waterway are in crisis. New Scientist's Save Britain's Rivers campaign reveals how crucial they are for the nation's health, wealth and resilience

This article is part of New Scientist and the i’s joint campaign, Save Britain’s Rivers. The year-long collaboration will reveal what’s happening to the UK’s rivers and how to restore them through a series of special articles, films, podcasts and events.

STAND by a river in the UK and you are in touch with the ancients. Their short, gruff names - Thames, Leith, Taff, Lagan - speak volumes of the history of the islands, from ancient Britons through Romans, Saxons and Vikings. These rivers are part of the past and present. Yet they face an uncertain future.

All over the world, rivers are valuable, often sacred, cultural and practical assets. They are a defining feature of human settlements, exploited for millennia as a source of drinking water, food, irrigation, waste disposal, power, navigation, defence and even inspiration.

In the UK, many of these services are just as relevant today. Tap water comes mostly from rivers. Sewage is disposed into them - preferably treated but often not. Rivers irrigate crops, power homes, take away floodwaters and float boats. Millions of people spend some of their leisure time messing about on, or near, rivers.

The UK is a riverine country. Globally, about 0.8 per cent of the land is covered in freshwater. In the UK, that number is 3 per cent. It has about 1500 river systems, with a combined length of over 200,000 kilometres, ranging from gushing upland headwaters to languid floodplain meanderers, via a vast range of intermediate habitats.

By global standards, these rivers are short, narrow and shallow - “mere streams”, according to the National River Flow Archive at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology in Wallingford. Yet they are extremely diverse in character. According to a recent report by the National Committee UK of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), “rivers and their floodplains are among the most important environments in the UK”.

“It’s well known that rivers and their floodplains - and the two go hand in hand - support a disproportionate level of biodiversity relative to their size within landscapes,” says report co-author Stephen Addy at the James Hutton Institute in Aberdeen, UK.

Drinking water and flood management

Although rivers are important for many reasons, their most obvious benefit in the UK is the water they supply. According to Water UK, which represents the country’s water industry, about two-thirds of tap water in England and Wales comes from rivers and the reservoirs and lakes they flow into; the rest is taken from aquifers. Northern Ireland and Scotland rely almost exclusively on rivers, reservoirs and lakes. All told, 87 per cent of the UK water supply comes from these sources.

According to government statistics, water companies in the UK abstract about 4.6 cubic kilometres of river, lake and reservoir water in England for the public supply every year. People drink it, bathe in it, flush their toilets with it, irrigate their gardens with it and use it to wash their clothes, floors and cars. Offices, shops, restaurants and other firms drink deep of it too.

Water is abstracted for other purposes. Electricity generators take 3.4 cubic kilometres to turn their steam turbines, while fish and watercress farms use 0.8 cubic kilometres and agriculture and private water supplies another 0.8. That adds up to a grand total of 9.6 cubic kilometres, equivalent to a cubic tank of water more than 2 kilometres in all dimensions.

Even in a relatively rainy country like the UK, that is milking it. The UK government estimates that about 1 in 5 surface water sources are depleted by over-abstraction, which has knock-on effects on river health.

The opposite problem - too much water - is an increasingly familiar hazard during the winter. Flooding is a growing problem as climate change causes extreme weather events, including biblical downpours. According to the Environment Agency, the UK has had six of its 10 wettest years on record since 1998. Last year was the first to see three named Atlantic storms in the space of a week.

Natural floodplains can help to mitigate flood risk by corralling the excess water and releasing it slowly back into the river. That is especially true of riverine landscapes engineered by beavers, whose dams and pools massively slow the passage of water through the system. Where rain used to hit the ground and surge straight into the waterways, it now is trapped for weeks. Beavers are being reintroduced all over the UK after they gained legal protection last year.

The problem is that many of those floodplains are far from natural, let alone beavered: housing estates and industrial development are often sited on them and these are generally quite useless at mitigating floods.

Water supplies and flood defences are two of many “ecosystem services” supplied by rivers. These are vital goods and services, such as water, pollination and clean air, that flow from nature, or what is increasingly referred to as natural capital.

Economic and health benefits

The UK was the first nation - and remains one of only 26 countries - to audit its natural capital. In 2012, the government established the (now disbanded) Natural Capital Committee (NCC) to advise it on the state of England’s natural capital, in order to help deliver its commitment “to be the first generation to leave the natural environment of England in a better state than it inherited”. In 2020, the NCC published its first set of accounts.

These are by no means complete, as the system for totting up natural capital, called experimental ecosystem accounting, remains a work in progress and nature is complex. But they still speak volumes about the value of rivers.

Water abstraction alone is worth £6.8 billion a year - essentially what it would cost to keep the taps on if rivers didn’t supply the UK with water - and the asset is worth £134 billion (the NCC stressed that these aren’t price tags on nature: given that the natural world supports all life on Earth, its value is infinite). Wetlands sequester 3.5 million tonnes of carbon a year, worth £831 million; that asset is valued at nearly £30 billion. Hydroelectricity generation produces 6865 gigawatt-hours a year, worth £136 million; the value of that asset is £2.2 billion.

These “provisioning and regulating” services are supplemented by some less tangible, but no less valuable cultural services. Around 1 in 10 of the UK’s 5.8 billion annual outdoor recreational and tourist visits are centred on freshwater, worth £681 million; the asset is worth £32 billion. Recreational fishing is a £1.7 billion a year industry. Around 2.7 million people gain health benefits from being in or around freshwater, worth £870 million a year. The asset value of this is nearly £48 billion. Even house prices benefit from the proximity of a river to the tune of £2.9 billion a year.

Essential habitats for biodiversity

One asset that has yet to be incorporated into natural capital accounting is biodiversity, but it is clear that rivers are an important repository of what is left in the UK. Globally, rivers and other bodies of fresh water are disproportionately biodiverse. Despite covering less than 1 per cent of Earth’s surface, they are home to around a third of described species of vertebrate, including approximately 40 per cent of all fish.

The UK’s rivers and the wetlands they feed are disproportionately biodiverse too, though to a lesser extent. They are home to around 10 per cent of the UK’s species, according to the Environment Agency. The IUCN lists 346 river-dependent species, some endangered, including eels, otters, the bar-tailed godwit and feather mosses. The Environment Agency says that over 10 per cent of UK freshwater and wetland species are threatened with extinction.

Rivers are biodiverse in part because they themselves are diverse. A short stretch of lowland river can feature 10 different habitats - pools, riffles (shallow water flowing quickly over stones), glides (deeper, slow-flowing water), backwaters, beds of aquatic vegetation, submerged tree roots, exposed sediment, riverbanks, riparian vegetation and floodplains - all of which provide food and shelter for a different repertoire of species. Further upstream are headwaters, waterfalls and rapids, which also host specialist species such as the freshwater pearl mussel, white-clawed crayfish, brook lamprey and bullhead, as well as juvenile salmon, trout and grey mullet. These juvenile fish will eventually migrate out to sea and become part of the UK fishing industry’s £713 million annual earnings.

Rare chalk streams and poor ecological health

England is also home to the vast majority of the world’s chalk streams, rare and internationally important habitats fed from alkaline aquifers in chalk and characterised by their gravel and flint beds and crystal clear water. They are home to unique ecosystems and have been described as an English Great Barrier Reef. There are only 210 of these waterways in the world and 170 of them are in England (the rest are in northern France).

Unsurprisingly, the value of ecosystem services is strongly related to the ecological state of the asset. In much of the UK, that isn’t a happy tale. England, Wales and Northern Ireland have no rivers considered to be in high ecological health, according to criteria laid down in the four nations’ Water Framework Directives; only 14 per cent are good. The rest are moderate, poor or bad. None is in a good state in terms of chemical pollution and none is in good overall health. In Scotland, 8 per cent of rivers are in high ecological health.

The IUCN report is blunt on this issue, concluding that “truly natural [river] environments that have escaped both direct and indirect human alteration no longer exist”. However, there is hope, according to Addy. “There are some grounds for being optimistic. River restoration in the UK is undergoing a step change, there are more and more projects going on everywhere.”

What was used to wean babies in prehistoric times?



16 August 2023

If 21st-century babies are weaned on a globalised diet that has only recently been available, what was used to wean babies in prehistoric times?

Chris Stantis and Kirsten Verostick University of Utah, US

That is an amazing question, and something that has led several archaeologists to focus on early childhood diet and feeding practices. We know nutrition in early years has key outcomes for wellness throughout a person’s life, and individual health can shape population dynamics and culture.

What babies ate is a difficult question to approach at an archaeological site, as a person’s food waste is often thrown away…

Ash from wildfires may fuel the growth of plankton in the ocean

Wildfires can deposit large amounts of ash into the oceans, and experiments suggest that this material could boost the growth of phytoplankton in seawater - but the impact on other wildlife is not yet known

Ash from wildfires that falls in the ocean can provide nutrients that boost the growth of microorganisms - but the impact on the wider ecosystem is unknown.

It has long been known that ash from the burning of vegetation can fertilise the soil and improve crop growth, while in rivers and lakes, wildfire ash can poison fish and molluscs with toxic metals and cause algal blooms that lead to oxygen depletion.

In 2017, the Thomas Fire in California is estimated to have produced between 0.7 billion and 2.4 billion kilograms of ash, much of which ended up in the Pacific Ocean. To investigate the impact of wildfires on marine microorganisms, Tanika Ladd at Western Washington University and her colleagues collected samples of ash from the area burned by the Thomas Fire and mixed it with water from the sea nearby. They let the solution sit for a few days to allow chemicals from the ash to leach into the water, before filtering large particles of ash out.

Analysis of this solution, called ash leachate, revealed significantly higher amounts of dissolved nutrients, including nitrogen, silicic acid and metals, compared with ordinary seawater. ""It turned the seawater like a yellow colour"", says Ladd.

The team then combined the ash leachate with even more seawater containing microorganisms, including phytoplankton, to see how they responded.

The amount of particulate organic carbon in the water - a proxy for the number of microorganisms in a sample - was twice as high in the ash-enriched water compared with normal seawater. This implies that the extra nutrients in the water enhanced the reproduction of these organisms.

""We didn’t see any toxic effects"", says Ladd. ""Most of the stuff in the community appeared to benefit from it.""

If the wildfire led to higher numbers of phytoplankton in the sea, what impact that would have had on larger organisms is unclear, says Ladd. They might have benefited from more food, but some types of phytoplankton are toxic. ""When these grow to really high abundances in the water, they can cause disease and sickness in marine mammals and birds,"" she says.

""This new study adds important insights into the potential effects of wildfire ash on marine biogeochemical cycles"", says Stefan Doerr at Swansea University in the UK. ""The ash used in the leaching experiments was collected from the ground in the burned area. How representative this ash is in terms of its composition of the ash that is exported in the smoke plume remains unclear.""

The number of seabirds killed by colliding with wind turbines could be reduced by painting black and white stripes on the blades and poles, say researchers.

Graham Martin at the University of Birmingham, UK, and Alex Banks at Natural England, a public body that has a say in planning applications for offshore wind farms in England, wanted to devise a pattern that could be easily painted on to offshore turbines to reduce their impact on bird life.

How humans brought cannabis to every corner of the globe

Cannabis originated in East Asia but can now be found growing on every continent except Antarctica - thanks to human trade and cultivation

By Alexis Wnuk

From its origins on the Tibetan plateau, humans have transported cannabis across the planet

From its origins on the Tibetan plateau, humans have transported cannabis across the planet

Alexis Wnuk

Cannabis is everywhere: today, the plant grows on every continent except Antarctica. But that wasn't always the case. So how did this ""weed"" come to take over the world?

Its success is due in large part to us. The evidence suggests that cannabis first evolved nearly 28 million years ago on the Tibetan plateau, after splitting off from the last common ancestor it shared with the hop plant. At first, early humans may have unwittingly spread it. By clearing vegetation for settlements and heaping food scraps in waste dumps, they gave cannabis what it needed to thrive: open, sunny areas with fertile soil. That is why some scientists refer to the plant as a weedy ""camp follower"".

In time, humans came to appreciate the many uses of the cannabis plant, and it is believed to be one of the first plants we cultivated when we began farming around 12,000 years ago. The stalks could be dried to create fibres, the seeds could be eaten or used to make oil and the resin-coated bracts could have been used for their medicinal and mind-altering purposes (though evidence for the latter is much more recent).

The plant's utility enabled its spread and humans became the most important agent for its dispersal. Its seeds aren't encased in tasty fruit, making them less attractive to animals, and they are round and heavy and lack wings that would let them hitch a ride on the wind.

A million years of marijuana: How cannabis became our favourite weed

From the Tibetan plateau, the plant spread across central and East Asia, with nomadic groups later carrying it into the Indian subcontinent, eastern Europe and the Middle East by about 2000 BC. As people began to cultivate cannabis for a broader range of uses, including its psychoactive effects, different varieties of the plant emerged. This gave rise to the two major types we know today - Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica - though there is still debate over whether these are actually separate species or just different types of the same species.

By the Middle Ages, cannabis was grown across Europe, and Arab and Indian traders carried it into Africa and South-East Asia. Finally, colonial empires brought the plant to the Americas beginning in the 16th century.

Male moths make their own perfume from flowers to attract females

Tobacco budworm moth males gather a sweet-smelling chemical from flowers and release it from hairy appendages when they are near females to make themselves more attractive

Male tobacco budworm moths collect perfume from flowers and emit it while they are courting females to make themselves more attractive.

It is well known that female moths release scented chemicals to lure males from long distances - from metres to kilometres. But less is known about how males use scents to attract females.

Coby Schal at North Carolina State University and his colleagues discovered that the males of tobacco budworm moths (Chloridea virescens) - a major agricultural pest - collect a plant scent called methyl salicylate and use it to increase their mating success.

Methyl salicylate is found in the flower nectar of many different plants and has a sweet, minty odour that attracts a variety of insects.

Schal and his team measured methyl salicylate levels in male moths reared on a synthetic diet in a laboratory and others collected from a soya bean field. The lab-reared males had low levels of the chemical, whereas those from the field had high levels, suggesting they had harvested it from the crop plants.

The researchers found that when the males courted females, they released the methyl salicylate from their hair pencils - hairy-tipped appendages that emit a range of chemicals for communication.

They also discovered that the antennae of female moths have two receptors that are tuned to detect methyl salicylate, and that males' mating success dropped by about 30 per cent when their hair pencils were removed.

Together, these findings suggest that the male moths use their hair pencils to emit methyl salicylate - which females are already naturally attracted to in plants - as an ""aphrodisiac"" to increase females' sexual receptivity, says Schal.

Similar behaviour has also recently been observed in orchid bees (Euglossa dilemma), with males collecting perfume from orchid flowers and using it to attract females.

Hunter-gatherers in Tanzania have incredibly diverse gut microbiomes

The huge diversity of the gut microbiome of Hadza hunter-gatherers from Tanzania hints at how industrialisation has influenced the variety of people's internal microbe communities

More than a thousand novel microorganism species that inhabit the gut have been discovered in the Hadza hunter-gatherer community in Tanzania. These contribute to a gut microbe diversity that is much greater than that of people in California, showing how industrialisation might have reduced microbiome diversity.

Matthew Carter at Stanford University in California and his colleagues genetically sequenced 351 faecal samples from 167 people in the Hadza community to gain a better sense of how lifestyle affects our gut microbiomes.

""We know that our gut microbiome is critically important, for example, in dictating aspects of our biology, our immune status and our metabolism,"" says Justin Sonnenburg, a co-author of the study, also at Stanford University.

Hunter-gatherer genes gave European farmers an immunity boost

The researchers used ultra-deep metagenomic sequencing, a type of genetic analysis that gives an idea of the species present and what their potential functions may be.

They compared their findings to sequencing they conducted on the gut microbiomes of 12 people in California and 56 people in Nepal from a range of communities.

""There's a disproportionate amount of microbiome sequencing focused on industrialised populations - largely European and American,"" says Sonnenburg. ""Attention hasn't been paid to other populations and lifestyles. We wanted to help fill that gap.""

The gut microbiome of the people in the Hadza community was far more diverse that those belonging to the people in California and Nepal. The team found more than twice the total number of species in the microbiomes of the average Hadza participant, 730, compared with the average Californian - just 277. Nepalese foragers had 317 species, on average, and Nepalese farmers had 436.

They also discovered species in the Hadza microbiomes that had never been found before. ""The novelty in some cases is quite striking,"" says Sonnenburg.



My Amazon family's gut microbes may help us fight inflammatory disease

The Yanomami people of the Amazon have the world's most diverse gut microbiome - and David Good, who is half Yanomami, thinks it might hold the clues to better health

Overall, the team found about 1200 never-before-seen single-celled microorganism species in the guts of the Hadza participants. Until now, there had only been about 4500 of these species described in the gut, says Sonnenburg.

Differences in diversity of gut flora can have implications. Studies suggest that people in industrialised countries with less diverse microbiomes are less healthy, says Sonnenburg. ""[People with] metabolic syndrome, inflammatory diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases all have low-diversity gut microbiomes.""

The researchers are unsure whether the differences seen in the microbiomes of the Hadza participants and people in more industrialised countries are due to differing diets or highlight a wider impact of industrialisation.

The Hadza people eat far more fibre than people in the West do, says Sonnenburg. This fibre comes from a range of sources, including tubers, the baobab fruit and berries, he says.

Studies looking at ancient faecal samples suggest that the Hadza gut microbiomes have more in common with the microbe communities of ancient cultures than those of people in industrialised countries today, says Carter.

“Agricultural domestication has changed our diet and impacted on our environment,"" says Wendy Russell at the University of Aberdeen, UK. Understanding the effect of the changes on our physiology will help inform future directions, she adds.

James Kinross at Imperial College London says the work highlights the importance of protecting the microbiomes of Indigenous peoples. ""If we don't, the consequence will be a continued escalation in the burden of Western non-communicable diseases experienced by sub-Saharan African populations.""

The science of rewilding: Coombeshead, Devon, England

Contact an expert to discuss this Weekender.

Email us to discuss

16 - 18 August 2024 from £749 per person

Discover how nature is making a comeback in the scenic Devon countryside. Rewilding allows nature to take care of itself: repairing damaged ecosystems, reintroducing species and restoring natural landscapes to create more diverse habitats.

On this weekender, you will have the unique opportunity to stay at the heart of this conservation-in-action project, at Rewilding Coombeshead, nestled deep in the beautiful Devonshire countryside. In their own words, ""we create life here"". Witness the project's ""rewilding helpers"", such as water buffalo, wild boar, mouflon sheep and Exmoor ponies in action, with Dartmoor and Bodmin Moor as your beautiful backdrops. 



Hosted by New Scientist’s staff writer, Graham Lawton, along with leading ecology experts, learn about the history of rewilding, how rewilding is becoming a global phenomenon, and all about the native species that are being reintroduced to the British countryside. 

During this Weekender, there will be a small-group walking safari of the 160-hectare rewilding site, a chance to see the animals in their breeding and reintroduction centre, plus several opportunities to go beaver watching. 

We’ve built in plenty of free time for you to explore the beautiful countryside - where, it is believed, some of the local forests may date back to medieval times - and chat with our experts. 

The main event is over three days, but you can choose to arrive a day earlier as there is so much to explore in this part of Devon.

DAY 1: INTRODUCTION TO COOMBESHEAD

After arriving at the Coombeshead site and pitching your tent or checking into your accommodation, you’ll meet your fellow guests and onsite staff over a drink in the late afternoon.

Enjoy an introductory talk from New Scientist’s Graham Lawton and a second talk from conservationist Derek Gow, the owner and driving force behind Coombeshead, who will share with you the history and mission of the site and explain how it is run from day-to-day. 

Coombeshead is not just a leading rewilding site, but also acts as a consultancy for other potential rewilding sites around Europe, plus it breeds and supplies many of the species reintroduced across the UK. The farm has converted a large agricultural barn into a brilliant event space that includes a garden kitchen, bar, lounging area and auditorium for lectures. So, no matter what the weather, you will have the space to stay comfortable and in the company of our experts and fellow guests. The hosted lecture area has audiovisual facilities, so you will be able to fully engage in the talks.

Throughout the event, the barn will also be the social hub, with local ales and wines available at the bar. Meals will be served from the garden kitchen and will endeavour to use as much local produce as possible. 

Then, after dark, a communal campfire will be lit for all to enjoy.

DAY 2: EXPLORE THE SITE

In the morning, it’s time to see rewilding in action. You will be split into small groups. One will go for a 2-hour walking safari across the main rewilded site and the other group will visit the breeding and reintroduction centre. You will then switch, allowing both groups access to all activities. Both experiences will take around 2 hours.

The walking safari will allow you to see rewilding helpers such as the beavers, wild ponies, boar and water buffalo, and appreciate the differences they have already made to the landscape. Breathe in nature and keep your eyes and ears open for birds, butterflies and other invertebrates that are slowly returning and establishing their homes in the area.

The breeding and reintroduction tour introduces you to some of the amazing species at the centre. These animals are here for several reintroduction and breeding programmes. This guided tour will introduce you to our white storks and water voles, and one of Britain’s smallest mammals, the harvest mouse. You will learn about the species and their habitats, their roles in their natural ecosystems (both past and present) and their importance in helping prevent any future extinctions in the wild. The tour will end with a visit to the wildcat breeding area, where you will hopefully get a glimpse of these elusive cats and maybe even their kittens.

There will also be an opportunity for some guests to go beaver-watching in a hide at dawn and dusk, led by one of the site ecologists. You will learn about the ecology of the beaver and how and why it has engineered the wetlands at Coombeshead. For our 2023 event, the colony of beavers were visible and very active during our visits. Please note, an additional fee is applicable for this, as places are limited. 

In the afternoon, Graham will host further talks from leading practitioners and researchers about the history of the rewilding movement, how other countries are protecting their natural heritage and some of the issues faced by rewilding as it integrates into existing sites.

DAY 3: SPECIES BREEDING AND REINTRODUCTION THEN CLOSING COMMENTS

In the morning, you’ll hear from the experts at Coombeshead about their animal breeding programme and how the animals are then translocated to other sites across Europe. This will be followed by a second talk, then closing comments from your host, Graham. 

After lunch, there will be a some optional activities across the site, plus there is a self-guided walk across 100 hectares of the site that has been more recently acquired. Some of the site has been going through the rewilding process for over five years, while other parts are just a year old, giving you the opportunity to explore the different developmental stages of a rewilding site. You will notice the difference. 

While there are no further activities planned, you are welcome to stay another night for free in the camping field or if you have booked the Shepherds Huts.

You are also welcome to arrive a day early on Thursday 15 August. Additional nights camping, or in the cottages or shepherd's huts, will be available for a reasonable cost.

QUESTIONS

Full event notes will be issued a few weeks before the event, but feel free to drop us a line at tours@newscientist.com with your questions.

WHAT'S INCLUDED

WHAT'S NOT INCLUDED

HOW TO GET THERE

Arriving by car: The postcode is PL16 0JS. It is an isolated site on an elevated position, but just 13 minutes’ drive from the A30. We strongly encourage lift-sharing.

Arriving by rail: The nearest train station is Okehampton, which is just 20 minutes by taxi from Coombeshead. We will supply details of taxis and minibuses from the station to the site.

PACE AND PHYSICALITY

The weekender is based at a rewilding site near Dartmoor and is subject to British weather. To make the most of this experience, we ask that you need to be comfortable spending extended periods outdoors. While the weather is clement at this time of year, it can be changeable, so bring clothing for both a warm day and a wet one. 

The accommodation in the shepherd’s huts and cottages is about 400 metres walk on a quiet country road and through a wood to the main site. If you are camping, we would recommend that you have a degree of experience in camping and possess the appropriate equipment.

On Saturday, you will be walking at a thoughtful pace for two 2-hour periods on uneven and sometimes boggy ground. The site’s owners are keen to stress that it’s a rewilding site and not a theme park.

No dogs are allowed on site except guide dogs.

SOLO TRAVELLERS

Our group tours are perfect for solo travellers, as travelling as part of an organised group provides security and peace of mind in faraway places. For this weekender, there is no single supplement for those camping. If you would like you own room or tent upgrade, please see our pricing gride above for full details. 

AGE RESTRICTIONS 

Children are welcome, but must be 12 and over. Please bear in mind that the level of the talks and activities are aimed at an adult audience (but bright teenagers should be able to follow them).

Accommodation

Camping Meadow



Camping will be available in a beautiful meadow between the farm and the main rewilded area. 

The campsite has both flushing and compost toilets, plus hot showers. There is no separate bathroom facilities for washing but the showers are very good. There is also a covered washing-up area with sinks and hot water. 

Due to the terrain of the meadow, larger mobile homes and caravans are not suitable. However, if you would like to sleep in your own smaller, converted campervan, please contact us upon booking to reserve space in the hardstanding area of the camping meadow. 

There will be staff onsite to keep the camp tidy and help you recycle. 

If you wish to arrive early on Thursday night, there is a supplement of £27 per guest.

Luxury bell tents with real beds from £499

There's nothing more relaxing than spending a few nights under the stars, but that doesn't mean roughing it! Leave the packing to us and book one of the 5-metre bell tents. Comfortable glamping with real beds, mattresses and linen.



Each tent is kitted out for two guests, to the following specification. 

To arrive on Thursday, it is an additional £66 per guest. To depart on Monday, it is an additional £39 per guest.

Additional beds can be added and the bell tents are big enough to fit a double and three singles (Jaybe single beds with e-fibre mattresses). Each additional single is £89.





Shepherd's Huts from £299



Five traditional shepherd's huts are available which sleep two people in each. They are spaced out in a very private area overlooking Bodmin Moor and are about a quarter of a mile away from the main site. They have private parking and their own shared facilities including showers, toilets, washing-up area and a relaxing barn for hanging out in. 

Each hut has a double bed that converts into a table plus a sink, gas hob, utensils, wood burner, bedding, towels, lights and welcome pack.



Once you have bought you main event ticket, you can then purchase the Shepherd's Hut upgrade which includes 3 nights from Friday to Monday for £299. Plus if you book to arrive a day early on the Thursday, you can also book an additional night in the Shepherd’s Hut for £59.

Plan to restore England's chalk streams may take decades

Chalk streams, a type of nutrient-rich river found mostly in England, are under threat from pollution and over-exploitation. Fines paid by water firms will be used to restore these rivers, but it may take decades

A plan to restore chalk streams in England, a vital type of river that plays host to species such as kingfishers, mayflies and dragonflies, may take decades despite millions of pounds worth of investment.

England is home to 85 per cent of the world's chalk streams – rivers that rise from springs found on 60-million-year-old chalk bedrock and have particularly nutrient-rich water. Of the 220 chalk streams in England, only 17 per cent are in good ecological health, according to the Environment Agency, due to a range of issues such as physical modification, sewage overflow and agricultural pollution.

Chalk streams are commonly over-exploited because their pure water is easy to abstract for public water supply, says Tony Juniper at advisory body Natural England. ""If you're a water company, this is a fantastic product."" he says. For example, Cambridge Water takes its entire water supply from chalk streams.

To address damage to chalk streams, the UK government has launched a strategy that will see all of them designated as water stressed, meaning water firms must consider whether they should introduce compulsory water metering for their customers.

The strategy also makes chalk streams a high priority for river restoration schemes. Chalk streams, like the majority of rivers around the country, have been heavily modified. ""Many have had gravel removed for building works and had weirs and mills put into them over time,"" says Juniper, which changes the river flow.

For the financial year between 2022 and 2023, there were 77 chalk stream projects funded at a total cost of £1.9 million in England. Fines paid by water firms for polluting will be directly used to help fund these projects, says Environment Agency chair Alan Lovell. This money probably isn’t enough to restore all England's chalk streams, says Charles Rangeley-Wilson, a conservationist and chair of the chalk stream strategy group, but it is enough to kick-start this programme and make a real difference in key rivers.

Restoring chalk streams will make them far more resilient to climate change, says Rangeley-Wilson. But dealing with over-extraction requires far more long-term solutions, especially as more people are moving to southern England, which has the highest concentration of chalk streams. There are no quick fixes, says Rangeley-Wilson. ""This is probably a multi-decadal programme.""

Swathes of California have seen atmospheric rivers dump heavy rains since the end of December, with storms forecast to bring 75 trillion litres more over the next two weeks. The deluge is a problem - severe flooding has wreaked havoc on the San Francisco Bay Area and led to at least six deaths.

But it could also offer some respite to a state in the throes of a severe water crisis driven by megadrought and overuse.…

Red-billed choughs (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax) have been reintroduced near the iconic white cliffs of Dover in south-east England after a 200-year absence.

Choughs are charismatic corvids related to crows and jackdaws, with a bright red bill, red legs and a distinctive call. “I like to describe them to the public as blackbirds on steroids because they’re a lot bigger and they’ve got this wonderful bright red bill,"" says Elizabeth Corry at Wildwood Trust, a local conservation charity. However, choughs have been in decline for many decades owing to the intensification of farming and historic persecution.

According to the most recent data from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, there are an estimated 394 breeding pairs in the UK, with populations in Cornwall, north Wales and the Isle of Man.

Corry and Laura Gardner head up the reintroduction project, a joint effort between the Kent Wildlife Trust and Wildwood Trust. The choughs are creche-reared, a form of hand-rearing that habituates them to humans without causing detrimental imprinting. “We have a black glove and tweezers to mimic the chough [mother's] head when we’re feeding them,"" says Gardner. ""We play audio playback to them when there’s a begging call from the nest when they want food.""

The team is using three different tracking devices to monitor the birds, including “daily diary"" tags that the choughs wear like a backpack. These incorporate an accelerometer, a magnetometer and a barometric pressure sensor. “What’s awesome about it is it’s super fine-scale data. So you can zoom right in and you can see each individual behaviour,"" says Jess Stevens, another team member at Wildwood Trust.

The tags will provide useful insights into survival rates, how far the choughs are travelling and what nesting sites they may be utilising.

The team hopes to release 30 to 50 individuals over five years, but some losses are expected from predation. The aim is to establish a population of 15 breeding pairs in 10 years. If successful, the birds could eventually meet up and breed with choughs from Cornwall in south-west England. “It’s about trying to help the whole of the UK population of choughs,"" says Corry.

Are there really big cats roaming the UK countryside?

The documentary Panthera Britannia Declassified claims to show clear evidence of a black leopard or panther in the UK, but most experts remain sceptical

Rumours of big cats, such as leopards and mountain lions, living wild in the UK have been bubbling for decades. Now, a photo alleged to show a black leopard in Staffordshire and DNA evidence featured in a documentary have renewed interest in the idea that large felines roam the nation. Here is what we know about these mystery cats.

Where does the photo come from?

In August 2023, Dragonfly Films, the producer of the documentary Panthera Britannia Declassified, released an image apparently showing a black leopard (Panthera pardus) lying in long grass. The photo was allegedly taken in Smallthorne, Staffordshire, and sent by an unknown person to the Centre for Fortean Zoology, an organisation that investigates mystery animals in the UK, over a decade ago, says Tim Whittard from Dragonfly Films.

""My feeling is that it is a real photo of a big cat,"" says Whittard. But whether the image was taken of a freely roaming cat in the UK is unconfirmed.

""It looks like it was photographed in such a way that you couldn't see the background, which makes me think it's likely a captive cat,” says Whittard. “This is one of those mysteries that will probably never be solved.""

Are there really big cats roaming wild in the UK?

The term ""big cat"" typically refers to species that belong to the genus Panthera, such as lions, jaguars and leopards. However, cheetahs, lynxes and cougars – also known as mountain lions – are commonly associated with the phrase.

There are a few cases of such animals being seen in the UK, such as a puma captured in 1980 and a lynx shot by a farmer in 1991, but, according to the UK's Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), there has been no credible evidence of big cats presented to Natural England, a public body responsible for the protection of England's natural environment, in recent decades.

A monthly celebration of the biodiversity of our planet's animals, plants and other organisms.

""If we were presented with credible information to suggest there was a big cat living wild and posing a threat to public health and safety, we would report the matter to the local police and the Home Office,"" a Defra spokesperson told New Scientist.

But a handful of people disagree with this official assessment. This includes Rick Minter, the host of the Big Cat Conversations podcast, who believes the evidence strongly suggests the presence of large felines in the UK countryside.

Where are they and how many are there?

Alleged sightings of big cats have been reported across the UK. The British Big Cats Society says that it receives between 500 to 600 reports a year, but these are mostly unverified and anonymous. Freedom of information requests to UK police forces have also revealed a small number of reports over the past decade.

The bulk of the reports have been of black leopards, also known as panthers, says Minter. Around 15 per cent of sightings are of sandy-coloured cats, which could be mountain lions (Puma concolor), says Minter, and the remaining 5 per cent are of lynxes.

To keep a stable and healthy population, there would probably need to be at least 300 individuals of each species, says Minter. There is no evidence of this though.

Is there any evidence, beyond reported sightings?

Nothing firm, despite the number of people saying they have seen big cats. “There should be scientific evidence to back all of this up,"" says Andrew Hemmings at the Royal Agricultural University in Cirencester, UK.

One way to identify the presence of these cats is to look at the carcasses of animals such as foxes, deer and sheep; Hemmings and his colleagues have analysed over 100 carcasses. To date, only four exhibit tooth marks, also known as tooth pits, that suggest the involvement of a medium-to-large feral cat.

These analyses alone can’t provide definitive evidence though. ""The gold standard would be to combine what we’re seeing with our tooth-pit analysis with verified DNA evidence,"" says Hemmings.

Do we have DNA evidence?

In its documentary, Dragonfly Films also claims to have found the first DNA evidence for a big cat in Gloucestershire. Hemmings and Minter are optimistic about the claim, but others are sceptical.

""Unless they actually recorded how that hair sample was captured and tested, [the claim] will have a grey cloud over it,"" says Danny Bamping at the British Big Cats Society.

If the big cats do exist, are they dangerous?

There have been no confirmed incidences of wild big cats attacking people or their pets in the UK.

""If given the choice, they would always avoid human contact,"" says Hemmings. ""In my opinion, they pose a negligible risk to people.""

Artificial seed casing made from wood buries itself when wet

A seed carrier made from wood screws itself into the ground when exposed to water. It could be useful for projects to replant forests from the air using drones

Carnegie Mellon University

A seed casing made of treated wood is stronger and more versatile than natural self-burying seeds, and could make it more effective to sow seeds from drones and planes.

Many species of plants produce seeds with structures that respond to changes in humidity to help protect the seed or bury it in soil. Plants in the genus Elodium produce a seed with a coiled tail that uncoils when it gets wet, twisting the seed pod deeper into soil. ""That's a behaviour that's been optimised through generations of evolution,"" says Lining Yao at Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania.

Yao and her colleagues took inspiration from Elodium and other plants with self-burying seeds to design a seed carrier that would be able to carry different sizes of seeds and twist into soil in different environments more effectively.

After screening natural and synthetic materials, the researchers decided to use wood from white oak, which would respond to changes in moisture but also be stiff enough to drive a seed into soil, and be biodegradable.

The team developed a chemical treatment for the wood that made it possible to tightly coil it. The wood could bend 45 times more tightly than other comparable wooden components, and therefore exerted more torque when twisting a seed pod into the ground. ""Thrust force depends on stiffness of the coiled body and tightness,"" says Yao.

Carnegie Mellon University

The researchers also designed a coil with three tails, rather than the single-tailed Elodium seeds. The added tails make the coil more likely to end up situated at the proper angle for the seed to be driven into the soil when it uncoils, especially on flat ground.

Seed pods made of wheat dough and a cellulose coating attach to the carrier to hold seeds and other beneficial payloads, such as fungi and nematodes that could help fertilise the seed.

In field tests on flat ground using arugula seeds placed in 136 carriers, about 66 per cent of carriers successfully anchored in soil, and 39 per cent of seeds germinated. The researchers didn’t compare this to seeds planted without the carrier, but Yao says it is a proof of concept that the carrier can work. Weather was also a factor: in one test, a period of heavy rain dislodged more than half of the anchored seeds.

A better carrier could make aerial seeding with planes or drones more effective, says Yao. Aerial seeding is useful when large areas have to be planted rapidly or areas to be seeded are difficult to access, for instance in some forest restoration projects.

Naomi Nakayama at Imperial College London says the researchers have more work to do to show the carriers can work in the field, and that they could be manufactured at the scale needed for a real planting program. But she says the new wood material opens up new possibilities for soft ""wooden robots"" that can respond to changes in moisture. ""This morphing capability is very beyond what we could achieve before,"" she says.

California storms didn't solve the state's drought and water crisis

After weeks of intense rain and flooding, most of California's reservoirs are holding more water than usual for this time of year, but groundwater is still not replenished

California finally has a dry forecast after three weeks of intense rain brought flooding and disaster declarations across much of the state. All that water is the result of nine ""atmospheric rivers"" - warm, water-heavy air drawn up from the tropics - and has taken the edge off a historic drought. But California is still grappling with how to manage the increasingly volatile swings between wet and dry years predicted under climate change.…

Deforestation is reducing rainfall all over the tropics

Satellite data shows rainfall in tropical regions across the globe has declined in deforested areas in line with what climate models have been predicting

Rainfall is decreasing in tropical areas around the world where forests are being cut down, an analysis of satellite data has shown, confirming the predictions of climate models.

This decline in rainfall will lead to falling yields in the farmland now found in regions where forest has been cleared and could lead to a vicious cycle, says Callum Smith at the University of Leeds in the UK. “As agricultural yields decline, more forests will be chopped down.”

Lower rainfall will also increase the risk of fires and reduce the odds of the remaining forest surviving, he says.

Vast amounts of water evaporate from the leaves of trees in tropical forests, and this water may fall as rain in nearby areas. When forests are cut down, less water is returned to the atmosphere above forests.

Climate models suggest this effect will reduce rainfall, but until now, studies of observed changes in rainfall have focused on specific regions, rather than across the tropics generally.

What’s more, a few studies have found increases in rainfall in some deforested areas. That is thought to occur because deforested patches are hotter than the surrounding forest, leading to rising air that triggers local rainfall.

To get a better overall picture, Smith and his colleagues started with a satellite dataset showing how forest cover in the Amazon, the Congo and South-East Asia changed from 2003 to 2017. They then compared this with various satellite measurements of rainfall in these regions.

“This is the first time that anyone has done a pan-tropical assessment with observational data,” says Smith.

The researchers also analysed the data at different scales, ranging from 25 to 40,000 square kilometres. At smaller scales, they found no change in average rainfall – there were increases in some places but just as many decreases.

But at larger scales they found a decrease. At the 40,000-square-kilometre scale, there was a 0.25 millimetre decline in rainfall per month for every percentage point of forest lost. This is within the high end of the range suggested by climate models.



Earth's most important rivers are in the sky - and they're drying up

The vast airborne waterways that keep our planet hydrated are fed by rainforests like the Amazon. If they disappear, the consequences may be worse than climate change

If rainfall continues to decrease at the same rate as forests are felled, total deforestation would lead to a 10 or 20 per cent decline in rainfall in affected regions. But it is possible the decline could accelerate when a tipping point is reached.

“There could be a catastrophic fall-off in precipitation at a certain level,” says Smith.

“The role that rainforests play in generating rainfall has been speculated about for quite a while but has been hard to pin down and quantify with direct observational evidence,” says Yadvinder Malhi at the University of Oxford.

This work shows that the observed rainfall decline is roughly what model simulations suggest, he says.

But the study shows only correlation, not causation, Malhi notes. It is possible that other factors such as sea surface temperature changes are playing a role too, he says.

Huge ecological disaster in river Oder last year could repeat in 2023

An algal bloom caused mass deaths of fish and other animals in the river Oder in Germany and Poland in 2022, and scientists warn there is a high risk of a second catastrophe

An algal bloom that killed hundreds of thousands of fish in the river Oder between Germany and Poland in 2022 could reappear this summer with devastating consequences, scientists have warned.

About 360 tonnes of dead fish were hauled from the Oder, which runs for 840 kilometres along the German-Polish border, between July and August last year following a huge bloom of the toxic alga Prymnesium parvum.

The European Commission described it as ""one of the largest ecological disasters in recent European river history"".

Prymnesium parvum is usually found in the brackish waters of estuaries. Scientists are unsure how it made its way to the Gliwice canal in Poland, a spur of the Oder that lies hundreds of kilometres from the coast and where the bloom is thought to have originated.

But now the alga is present in the waters, a fresh bloom could appear in the Oder or nearby rivers if conditions are right, scientists fear.

""That's one of the main concerns that we have: that it reoccurs in this river, but also that it could spread to other polluted rivers,"" says Gary Free at the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which has published a study into the 2022 fish deaths on the Oder.

The river's poor water quality provided an ""ideal soup"" for Prymnesium parvum to bloom, Free and his colleagues concluded.

Due to discharges from agriculture and wastewater sites, the Oder was already suffering from excess levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, nutrients that make it possible for algal blooms to develop.

The problem was compounded by successive heatwaves and a long drought during July and August 2022, which depleted water levels throughout the river and concentrated pollution.

Discharges of salty wastewater from industrial sites near the Gliwice canal then caused a surge in the river's salt levels, allowing the algae to bloom. It is unclear whether the discharges were illegal or within the permissions granted under permits, says Free. Polish records suggest at least 34 facilities in the Oder catchment have a licence to discharge salty waste.

The ecological damage was worsened by poor communication between the German and Polish authorities, the JRC report said, with ""late and incomplete"" information exchange stalling response efforts.

A spokesperson for Germany’s environment ministry said in a statement authorities were only notified about the incident on 11 August, after fish had already washed up dead downstream inside the country’s borders. It said the international alert system for pollution incidents was being revised, adding: ""In the future, it shall be even clearer that also in events like for instance a fish die-off, a transboundary and timely warning shall be released."" Polish Waters, the national water management authority for Poland, was approached for comment.

Alongside the huge numbers of fish that were killed in the event, populations of invertebrates such as mussels and snails were also severely impacted, says Dietrich Borchardt at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Germany. These filter-feeders usually help to control algal blooms, so the drop in their numbers leaves the river more susceptible to another bloom this summer and in future years, he says.

""Because of the loss of invertebrate life – which is not that visible compared to the fish, but which definitely is there – I think there is a significant likelihood that the river now is in a much more vulnerable condition compared to spring last year,"" says Borchardt.

A further bloom could devastate the river's ecology, as research suggests fish stocks in the river have already fallen by half since the first incident, according to research by the Leibniz Institute for Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries in Germany.

Jan KÃ¶hler at the institute has just started research investigating the impact Prymnesium parvum has on the survival and efficiency of filter-feeders like mussels. He is also concerned about more blooms of the alga. ""We are afraid that the reduction in filtration activity will favour future mass developments of Prymnesium,"" he says.

The Oder needs to go into ""intensive care"" to prevent further blooms, says Free, with urgent work required to tackle industrial pollution along the river and reduce nutrient loads. For example, authorities should be able to pause industrial discharges of salty waste when the threat of an algal bloom is high, the JRC recommends.

Others believe a wholesale change in the rules governing industrial discharges will be necessary to protect river health in the future, especially as European summers become hotter and drier under climate change. Discharge licences need to be rewritten with the impacts of climate change in mind, says Borchardt. ""We have to ask if the permissions, for example, for the wastewater release, are sufficient under conditions of climate change,"" he says. ""My guess is they are not.""

Oxygen levels are dropping in rivers across the US and central Europe

Rivers in the US and central Europe are losing their ability to hold oxygen because of rising temperatures, which could put fish at risk

Rivers in the US and central Europe are rapidly losing oxygen due to rising temperatures, which is putting fish at risk.

Li Li at Pennsylvania State University and her colleagues have reconstructed daily oxygen and temperature levels for 796 rivers in the US and central Europe, such as Austria and Hungary, between 1981 and 2019, using several data sources.

Assessing oxygen levels accurately is difficult because there is a lack of high-quality daily data on rivers, says Li. So, to produce a comprehensive daily dataset, she and her colleagues combined a wide range of data sources for hundreds of rivers, including water temperature and oxygen level, weather information for the river locations and data about surrounding land.

English rivers regularly pumped full of oxygen to prevent fish deaths

The researchers then used a machine-learning model to integrate this data and produce estimated daily oxygen and temperature levels for the 796 rivers. They statistically validated the estimates against the 25 per cent of existing data they didn't use. Li says this was achievable for oxygen and water temperature levels because these variables are quite dependent on the local temperature.

The researchers found that 87 per cent of the rivers had been getting warmer over the past four decades and that 70 per cent of them had been losing oxygen over this period. ""For any liquid, if it's warmer, its capacity for holding gases is smaller,"" she says.

While urban rivers warmed the fastest, oxygen loss happened quicker in rivers through agricultural areas. ""My guess is that agricultural rivers have more nutrients that consume oxygen,"" says Li. Nutrients can run off into rivers from fertilisers that are sprayed onto farmland, she says.

This loss of oxygen puts fish at risk, says Li. ""When oxygen levels drop to a certain level, they essentially suffocate and cannot breathe,"" she says. Healthy rivers typically have a dissolved oxygen level above 8 milligrams per litre. Rivers below 3mg per litre are considered hypoxic and pose a particularly acute danger to fish, says Li.

The researchers then used their model to make projections about river temperature and oxygen levels until 2100. They found that future deoxygenation rates in rivers were 1.6 times higher than historical conditions if temperatures rise by 2.7°C by the end of the century.

Li says that Brooker Creek in Florida, for example, has about 204 hypoxia days a year and the model projects that this number will rise by 5.7 days per decade.

Flooding due to sea level rise has added an average of at least 23 minutes to the time people in the coastal US spend commuting over the course of a year. By 2060, even a modest amount of additional sea level rise could increase that delay ten-fold, amounting to billions of hours of wasted time for commuters.

""It's here. It's now. It's a delay that is already occurring,"" says Mathew Hauer at…

Chemicals used to make decaf coffee are contributing to ozone damage

A group of unregulated polluting gases known as very short-lived substances are partly responsible for depleting the ozone layer in the tropics

Chemicals used to decaffeinate coffee, produce paint removers, meld plastics and purify antibiotics are contributing to the depletion of the ozone layer over the tropics.

Since the Montreal protocol in 1987, when countries agreed to phase out the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other harmful aerosols, the ozone layer has been healing. But one part of it, in the tropical lower stratosphere, has shown signs of depletion in recent years.

Researchers have blamed climate change for this discrepancy, as a warmer atmosphere accelerates the flow of warm air from the tropics to the poles, thinning the ozone layer in the tropics.

But research from JuliÃ¡n Villamayor at the Institute of Physical Chemistry in Madrid, Spain, and his colleagues suggests pollution from short-lived chemicals is also to blame.

Very short-lived substances (VSLS) are ozone-depleting chemicals that typically last for just six months in the atmosphere. Some, such as bromine, are naturally occurring, while others, such as dichloromethane, are industrially produced. They are used for a whole range of applications, including extracting caffeine from coffee and as an aerosol spray propellant. Despite being known to attack the ozone layer, their use isn’t regulated by the Montreal protocol.

These substances are harming the ozone layer in the tropical lower stratosphere, says Villamayor. ""They are so short-lived that they don't reach higher levels of the stratosphere, nor the polar regions,” he says. “But they get to penetrate the stratosphere via the very strong tropical convection and they get to react in the lowermost layer of the stratosphere.""

Villamayor and his colleagues used sophisticated climate models to simulate the impact of emissions from all naturally occurring and human-made VSLS on the ozone layer, and found they may account for up to a quarter of the damage to the layer in the tropics over the past 20 years. Climate change is responsible for the rest.

In the future, uncontrolled use of human-made VSLS could increase ozone depletion in the tropical stratosphere by 30 per cent by the end of the century, says Villamayor.

This could have serious implications for the millions of people living in the tropical belt, one of the world's most populous areas, leading to increased rates of skin cancer, reduced crop yields and disruptions in the marine food chain.

Villamayor says countries should consider amending the Montreal protocol to restrict the use of VSLS.

Neil Harris at Cranfield University, UK, says the research is robust and agrees that VSLS use should face tighter controls. ""There should be a drive for reducing the emissions of these compounds, without doubt,"" he says.

Sweeteners: The bitter truth about low-calorie sugar substitutes

Low-calorie sweeteners such as aspartame have become common in all our diets. With concerns over their health impacts, should you turn to new plant-based alternatives to get your sweet hit?

By David Cox

7 November 2023

IT WAS hard to believe I was eating a lemon. Earlier, I had let a tiny, tasteless tablet linger on my tongue, the dried powder of a fruit from the Synsepalum dulcificum shrub from West Africa known as the miracle berry. When I later bit on a slice of lemon, it was vivid sweetness rather than sourness that filled my mouth.

In Benin, the berry has long been used to sweeten tart foods, thanks to a protein in its pulp that temporarily activates sweet taste receptors in the mouth in the presence of acids. Now it could be destined for global greatness as a key player in our quest to find healthier ways to satisfy our sweet cravings.

We all know that too much sugar is bad for us, driving an epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes. So, instead, many foods and drinks contain alternatives, such as aspartame, stevia and sucralose, to provide supposedly guilt-free sweetness. Increasingly, though, these products have been embroiled in controversy. In May, the World Health Organization (WHO) advised against their use for weight control and averting type 2 diabetes - things that they had previously been thought to help with.

Now we are gaining a clearer idea of exactly how these sweeteners affect our health, and the door has opened to a new wave of plant-derived alternatives. Sweeteners based on the miracle berry, a rare sugar from figs and a new kind of sugar crystal are all vying to take the top spot. Will they provide a healthy way to sate our cravings, or do we need to rethink our relationship with…

How do captive animals really feel, and can we make them happier?

We are finally figuring out the subtle ways that farm and zoo animals reveal their emotional states, from anxiety to optimism and even joy. The insights are also revealing some surprising ways we can improve their lives

AS HAPPY as a pig in - well, you know the phrase. But when we see a hog rolling in muck, a dog racing after a stick or an elephant reunited with a long-lost relative, how do we know what these animals are feeling?

One thing we can say is that many non-human animals do experience emotions. Today, biologists are increasingly accepting of the idea, once dismissed as mere anthropomorphism, that certain other species have a range of emotional states. Which doesn’t change the fact that a pig’s true feelings at any given moment are nigh-on incomprehensible to us, not least because it doesn’t share our capacity for language.

In the past few years, however, researchers have been figuring out creative ways to discern when animals are pessimistic, bored or gleeful. “We’re not just looking for signs of pain, fear or anxiety,” says Fay Clark at the University of Bristol in the UK. “We’re looking for signs of joy, the potential for happiness and fulfilment.”

What they are discovering isn’t just that animals reveal their emotions in subtle ways, but also that they seem to be surprisingly delighted by mental challenges - and might even enter a “flow state” when deeply immersed in an activity they enjoy.

All of this adds fresh impetus to the ongoing campaign to move from merely reducing suffering in animals we keep in farms and zoos to doing everything we can to ensure they lead happy lives. “People will soon start to realise that emotions are…

Bird flu has killed 20 critically endangered California condors

A recent outbreak of avian flu has killed 7 per cent of the wild population of California condors, and officials are bracing for the virus' spread

At least 20 California condors have died of avian flu in recent weeks, and wildlife officials are preparing for the virus' spread among the critically endangered birds. The highly contagious H5N1 bird flu that is killing North America's biggest bird is the same strain that forced farmers to cull millions of chickens over the last year.

It is a major blow to the population of California condors (Gymnogyps californianus), which were pushed to the edge of extinction in the 1980s. Intensive breeding and habitat conservation efforts have since bolstered their numbers to around 500 birds, around 300 of which live in the wild. Clusters of the giant vultures can now be found from western Canada down to northern Mexico.

In recent weeks, the US Fish and Wildlife Service had confirmed at least 20 condor deaths in a flock located around Arizona and Utah. So far, 10 of the condors in that flock have tested positive for avian flu and the 10 remaining birds are currently undergoing examination. The deaths represent a 7 per cent loss of the species’ wild population.

As of 17 April, the US Fish and Wildlife Service was rehabilitating four condors from the flock in the south-west US. They were “receiving supportive care and have shown improvement”, according to a statement.

""My worry is that avian flu could spread throughout the regional condor groups as the disease becomes more prevalent in bird populations in general,"" says Ileene Anderson at the Center for Biological Diversity in Arizona. ""Since there is no known vaccine or proven treatment, at a minimum it could set back California condor recovery for years and at the worst it could decimate the population.""

Avian flu has not been detected in neighbouring flocks in California or Mexico’s Baja California peninsula. Officials say they are monitoring nearby condors and preparing in the event that it spreads, especially as migratory birds that could ferry the virus fly north for spring migration.

Though there have been rare cases of avian flu illness and deaths in humans, public health officials say that transmission is rare and advise avoiding close contact with sick or dead wildlife.

Ultra-processed foods have a bad reputation, but is it fully justified?

Shutterstock/ShutterOK

Common dietary advice encourages us to eat whole foods and avoid processed ones. But that is easier said than done given there is no clear understanding of what makes a food ultra-processed or how, if at all, these foods impact our health. Broadly labelling ultra-processed foods as bad could not only lead us to overlook other potential factors contributing to obesity, but may create a whole new set of unintended health consequences.

For decades, public health experts have raised alarms…

Kelp forests capture nearly 5 million tonnes of CO2 annually

Towering underwater kelp forests generate a potential value of $500 billion each year by providing a boost to commercial fishing, as well as nitrogen and carbon removal

Kelp forests provide an estimated value of $500 billion to the world and capture 4.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from seawater each year. Most of kelp's economic benefits come from creating habitat for fish and by sequestering nitrogen and phosphorus.

The climate benefits of kelp forests, like forests on land, are numerous. The towering brown algae provide habitat for marine life, protect coastal areas from storms and sequester greenhouse gasses as they grow. But some kelp forests, like those off the coast of California, have been damaged by pollution, human development and an overabundance of hungry grazers like sea urchins.

To estimate the value that kelp forests add to global economies, Aaron Eger at the University of New South Wales in Australia and his colleagues looked at the economic and ecological benefits of different types of kelp across different industries. They limited their assessment to six genera of kelp that commonly form these forests.

The researchers began by assessing kelp's boon to commercial fishing, as the marine algae hosts around 1500 species, many of which are harvested commercially. They then estimated how much nitrogen, carbon and phosphorus the kelp absorb from the sea. An abundance of nitrogen and phosphorus from agricultural runoff can lead to harmful algal blooms and nitrogen is particularly expensive to remove from water using current technology.

""Much like a plant on land, [kelp forests] are taking up nutrients, they're taking up carbon dioxide, and using light to fuel their growth,"" says Eger. By examining the amount of each compound stored in the kelp’s tissue, they could determine how much it was sequestering.

They found that kelp forests generate a potential value between $465 billion and $562 billion per year worldwide, largely due to commercial fish support and the removal of harmful chemical substances. As part of their assessment, the team found that kelp forests absorb around 4.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide each year, highlighting kelp's potential as a ""blue carbon"" sponge.

""This is a very important paper as it makes a first attempt at valuing some of the most important ecosystem services from kelp forests,"" says Thomas Wernberg at the University of Western Australia. But Wernberg says an important next step would be to include more kelp types and assess a wider range of benefits, including their cultural significance to indigenous communities.

London's drying rivers threaten the city's drinking water supply

Poor river management means that London is number nine in the list of global cities most likely to run out of drinking water, campaigner Feargal Sharkey said at New Scientist Live

The UK’s capital is number nine in the list of global cities most likely to run out of drinking water, rivers campaigner Feargal Sharkey said at New Scientist Live on 8 October.

""London is now on a list with the likes of Cape Town, SÃ£o Paulo, Jakarta [and] Mexico City because of the same lack of investment and the same lack of strategic thinking,"" he said. The other cities near the top of the list are Bangalore, Beijing, Cairo, Moscow, Istanbul and Tokyo, the BBC reported in 2018.

Sorting the problem requires a lot of money, but consumers, not the privatised water companies, may be asked to foot the bill. ""The [UK] National Infrastructure Commission are estimating simply to keep London and England's taps running over the next 30 years is going to take another £20 billion""¦ of your money,"" said Sharkey.

As well as running dry, the UK's waterways are in poor shape. Only 14 per cent of England's rivers are in good ecological health. The rest have been ravaged by sewage, agricultural run-off, over-extraction, modified banks and barriers such as dams. Good ecological health means ""a good, healthy ecosystem with a wide, diverse range of plants, insects, bugs, fish, wildlife, birds, beavers, otters and everything else that's utterly dependent upon the health of those rivers"", said Sharkey. No English rivers are in good chemical health.

Spills of human sewage are a major issue, but hard to keep track of. Monitoring systems record how often sewage overflow pipes are opened and for how long, but not how much actual raw sewage ends up in rivers. Sharkey told the audience that one of only two monitoring stations to record that figure - in Twickenham, London - found that in the space of just two days in 2021, millions of litres of raw sewage were dumped into the Thames.

The poor state of UK rivers is also a legal issue. In 2002, the European Water Framework Directive came into force, compelling member states (including the UK at the time) to make sure that all freshwater bodies were in good ecological health by 2027. Some reports claim current estimates mean that only 6 per cent of England's rivers will meet the requirement by that deadline. ""We've basically flushed them down the loo, physically and metaphorically,"" said Sharkey.

England's privatised water industry has been adequately paid to solve these problems, but has chosen to reward shareholders and executives rather than execute their legal obligations to run a clean and safe water system, said Sharkey. Instead, the UK water industry is reportedly planning to ask customers to foot the estimated £96 billion bill to prevent sewage spills and other issues.

Sharkey is especially concerned about chalk streams, which arise from aquifers in chalky rocks. Southern England has 85 per cent of the world's chalk streams, a unique habitat that is dying, he said. Water companies like to extract water from them because they are very clean. ""This is the UK's Amazonian rainforest, a piece of ecosystem and environment that cannot be replicated anywhere else in the world, and we're utterly destroying every single one,"" said Sharkey.

What can be done? ""I would encourage you now to get in touch with your local MP,"" he said. ""Just send them an email. It takes no more than a single sentence simply to say, ""˜I am utterly shocked, furious, appalled. I think I have been scammed out of my money. What in god's name are you, as my local MP, going to do to deal with and bring the water industry back into line?'""‰""

Net-zero aviation needs up to $1 trillion in carbon offsets by 2050

Growing demand for air travel is counteracting the aviation industry push to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Carbon offsets will be necessary - or fewer passengers

Surging global demand for air travel and air freight transport means that the aviation industry would need to spend $1 trillion in carbon offsets by 2050 to achieve net-zero climate impacts - unless both the industry and frequent fliers abandon the business-as-usual approach.

The estimate comes from a study of pathways the aviation industry could take to reach net zero. The industry's climate impacts include carbon emissions from burning jet fuel - aviation contributed 3 per cent of global carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels in 2019 - and even bigger factors such as aircraft contrails that can create more heat-trapping clouds within the earth's atmosphere.

Steven Davis at the University of California, Irvine, and his colleagues modelled nine scenarios to map out the carbon cost of aviation until 2050. Even the rosiest of them - which envisioned lower demand for aviation, significant improvements in energy efficiency and high usage of sustainable aviation fuels - found that the aviation industry would still need to spend at least $60 billion on carbon offsets by 2050.

""The industry cannot achieve net-zero climate impacts without some [carbon] removal,"" says Davis.

Some airlines may be tempted to generally buy carbon offsets rather than directly reduce their climate impacts if that proves the cheapest route. But ""there is a lot of debate regarding carbon removals"" and whether they have a meaningful impact, says Candelaria Bergero at the University of California, Irvine.

Reduced demand for air travel could make a significant contribution toward net-zero aviation - but the trends are pointing in the opposite direction. ""Changes in demand could be a really important source of emissions reductions, but all of our scenarios anticipate overall increases in demand by mid-century given expected growth in global population and affluence,"" says Davis.

Even 'net zero' aviation could still cause significant global warming

Substituting biofuels or synthetic fuels can help, but only up to a point. Without extreme reductions in aviation demand, the demand for sustainable aviation fuels in all scenarios would be more than double the total global production of biofuels in 2019. Doubling the production of biofuels would require the world to set aside as much as 3 million square kilometres of land for crops - equivalent to one-third the size of the US.

And despite the fanfare around hydrogen-powered aircraft or electric planes with improved batteries, such technologies are unlikely to contribute significantly to reducing aviation climate impacts because they can only power smaller aircraft and sustain short flights, says Davis.

The aviation industry has an ambitious target of improving aircraft energy efficiency by 2 per cent or more per year, which alone could offset more than half of future growth in demand for air travel, says Davis.

""The cost reduction of zero-emission aviation requires new technologies with greatly improved efficiencies both in fuel production and in aircraft propulsion,"" says Grigorii Soloveichik, a former program director for the US Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy.

Meanwhile, companies making conscious business travel decisions could encourage the industry to move toward net-zero aviation. ""I see real opportunities for corporate action that prefers more efficient aircraft, low-contrail flights and especially increased demand for sustainable aviation fuels,"" says Davis.

World must prepare for frequent and severe droughts, report warns

With climate change driving more intense dry spells, the world must invest in early warning systems and measures to conserve water, a UN report says

The increasing frequency and severity of droughts across the world is ""an unprecedented emergency on a planetary scale"", says a United Nations report launched today at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.

The International Drought Resilience Alliance, a coalition of 34 countries that was established last year at COP27, is calling for more investment in drought preparation, from early warning systems to rainwater collection ponds.

Three out of four people on Earth could be affected by drought by 2050 as warmer air sucks up more moisture, causing more frequent and intense dry spells. This year, 14 per cent of the contiguous US has been suffering severe to extreme drought, and the heart of the Amazon rainforest has seen the least rain in 40 years, sending rivers to record lows. But the gradual, ""silent devastation"" droughts cause is often neglected by media and governments, says the UN report, called the Global Drought Snapshot.

""Drought is a natural hazard, but it’s not a natural disaster, and we can do everything possible to really not turn it into a natural disaster,"" says Daniel Tsegai at the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, which produced the report. ""If we are prepared for drought, we are not only saving lives and land use, but it also makes economic sense.""

Droughts cost billions of dollars annually. This year, India’s driest August in a century drove up global sugar and wheat prices and the Panama canal had to cut shipping traffic by a third due to a water shortage.

In the past half-century, droughts have also cost at least 650,000 lives. An estimated 43,000 people died last year in a record drought in Somalia, which is now suffering once-in-a-century flooding.

Tsegai remembers droughts as a boy in Eritrea when his family struggled to eat and his sister stayed home from school because there was no running water for personal hygiene. Investing in drought resilience can be up to 10 times cheaper than paying for damage and humanitarian aid later, he says.

The first challenge is to predict droughts. A UN initiative aims to install extreme weather early warning systems throughout the world by 2027. For the Horn of Africa, which includes Somalia and Eritrea, scientists can now forecast drought up to eight months beforehand by looking at Pacific Ocean temperatures, says Chris Funk of the University of California, Santa Barbara.

""Understanding the way that climate change is making natural climate variations more intense opens the door to anticipating and predicting and managing their impacts,"" says Funk.

The next step is collecting and conserving water, says Tsegai. Restoring degraded ecosystems can help retain water, and switching to more drought-resistant crops and efficient irrigation can make farming more resilient. In Ethiopia, a programme to dig rainwater ponds, reduce overgrazing and plant trees increased plant growth by 14 per cent in drought-stricken areas.

Societal changes such as moving towards plant-based nutrition and curbing rapid population growth would also allow more efficient land use, according to the report.

A study earlier this year found that sustainable development, prioritising health and education, would reduce people’s exposure to drought by 70 per cent this century compared with fossil-fuelled development, underscoring the need to transition away from oil, gas and coal.

Spanish heatwave: Is climate change behind record heat in Europe?

A spring heatwave across parts of southern Europe is seeing temperature records for April broken in many countries. Why is this happening, and will the summer also be hot?

By Madeleine Cuff

28 April 2023

Sunset at the island of Gran Canaria, Spain, on 26 April

BORJA SUAREZ/Reuters

A blistering and unseasonable heatwave has struck southern Spain, Portugal and Morocco this week, with temperatures approaching 40°C (104°F) in some regions. The hot weather has heaped further climatic stress on southern Europe, which is already under a severe drought that is threatening to push up food prices. Here is what we know about why the record-breaking heat is occurring, and how it could be linked to climate change.

Which countries have seen records broken?

On 27 April, Spain recorded its hottest-ever April temperature at Cordoba airport in southern Spain, which reached 38.8°C (101.8°F) according to the Spanish meteorological service. This smashed the previous record of 37.4°C (99.3°F), set in April 2011 in Murcia.

Portugal also recorded its highest ever April temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F) at Mora, in the centre of the country, on the same day, while in Marrakech, Morocco, temperatures reached a record 41.3°C (106°F).

These temperatures are 10 to 15°C above the seasonal average, according to the UK Met Office.

Why is this happening?

The heatwave is being driven by a mass of very hot air travelling from north Africa into southern Europe, coupled with a slow-moving high pressure system that is suppressing rainfall and keeping skies clear, allowing heat to build.

The ongoing drought in these countries is likely to be also playing a part. Moist soils provide a cooling effect as the water they contain evaporates. If soils are dry, little of the sun's energy is used for evaporation and transpiration, leaving more solar radiation to accumulate as surface warming.

Erich Fischer at ETH Zurich in Switzerland says dry soils can increase the severity of a heatwave by 2 to 3°C. ""Drought is basically an amplifier of the heatwave,"" he says. But, he notes, it is unusual to see this effect so early in the year. ""Typically at this time of year, even in southern Europe, the soils still have humidity,” he says.

What is the influence of climate change?

Any heatwave today is made more severe because of the background rate of warming under climate change, says Fischer. But the sheer volume of record-breaking severe heat events seen in recent years should cause alarm. Indeed, southern Europe and north Africa aren’t the only parts of the world experiencing extreme heat right now. South-East Asia has also been hit by extreme heat in recent weeks, with record temperatures of up to 45°C (113°F) recorded at monitoring stations across Thailand, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam earlier this month. ""Records should be very rare these days,"" says Fischer. ""But they are occurring all over the place.""

There is some emerging evidence that suggests cold sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic Ocean may influence the occurrence of extreme heat in Europe, by influencing the movement of the jet stream and ocean currents.

Does this mean summer will be hot as well?

The current heatwave gives meteorologists little indication about what will happen during the northern hemisphere summer months. However, if the drought persists, Europe and north Africa could be more susceptible to extreme heat if a high pressure system hits later this year. ""It is too early to say what these spring extreme temperatures will mean for the values in summer,"" Paul Hutcheon at the Met Office Global Guidance Unit said in a blog post earlier this week. ""But the dry ground will mean that further heatwave conditions have the potential to lead to even higher temperatures later in the year.""

Why is it still cold in the UK and northern Europe?

In contrast to the sweltering temperatures of southern Europe, much of northern and eastern Europe - including the UK - have been facing below average temperatures this week.

While a jet stream wave is bringing warm air over south-west Europe, cold air is being pulled down from the Arctic over the UK and northern Europe. But forecasters expect the cold snap to end within the next few days, bringing temperatures back closer to average across much of the UK by next week.

Ancient baskets and shoes reveal skill of prehistoric weavers

Well-preserved artefacts found in a Spanish cave show that advanced plant-based crafts were practised in Europe 9500 years ago

9500-year-old Mesolithic baskets from the Cueva de los MurciÃ©lagos in Spain

9500-year-old Mesolithic baskets from the Cueva de los MurciÃ©lagos in Spain

MUTERMUR project

Intricate baskets and shoes found in a Spanish cave show that people living in Europe thousands of years ago were skilled at weaving objects from plant fibres.

Cueva de los MurciÃ©lagos, or the Cave of the Bats, is a cave system in south-west Spain that was discovered during mining activities in the 19th century. Excavations of the cave have since revealed several mummified corpses alongside objects including baskets, sandals and a wooden hammer.

Francisco MartÃ­nez Sevilla at the University of AlcalÃ¡ in Spain and his colleagues have now analysed 76 of these artefacts. They are considered among the best-preserved plant-based objects from prehistoric Europe, thanks to the low humidity inside the cave.

Around 65 of the items were found to be made from a fibre called esparto grass. This includes a set of baskets, with either a flat or a more cylindrical shape, as well as sandals that were made by crushing and twisting the esparto.

A wooden mallet and esparto sandals dated to around 6000 years ago

The team carbon-dated 14 of these objects and found that they belonged to one of two time periods: 7950 to 7360 BC or 4370 to 3740 BC. The older objects were created by hunter-gatherers during the Mesolithic age, says MartÃ­nez Sevilla, while the later ones were probably used by Neolithic farmers.

The oldest dated sandal was found to be around 6000 years old, which makes it the oldest shoe ever found in Europe, says MartÃ­nez Sevilla.

""The use of vegetal fibres in Europe is older than we expected,"" says team member Maria Herrero-Otal at the Autonomous University of Barcelona in Spain. ""We imagine the Mesolithic populations as simpler, but it seems that they were much more complex than we thought.""

How countries can go fossil fuel free with wind and solar superpowers

South Australia is a renewable energy champion and now plans a truly fossil fuel-free grid. How did it make such a remarkable turnaround, and can the rest of the world follow suit?

Clever use of solar and wind energy is providing three quarters of South Australia’s power

A DECADE ago, the main landmark in Port Augusta, a town in South Australia, was a 200-metre-tall chimney puffing fumes from a coal-fired power station. “You could see it from 40-odd kilometres out,” says Gary Rowbottom, who worked at the plant for 17 years.

Today, however, there are no hints of this history. The chimney is gone and the sky is a pristine blue. The chief landmark now is a tall tower topped by a dazzling light, where sunlight reflected from 23,000 mirrors on the ground is focused to power four giant greenhouses in which tomatoes are grown. Next door is the newly built renewable energy park, home to 50 wind turbines and 250,000 solar panels.

Port Augusta is representative of a remarkable shift that has swept South Australia. In 2007, just 1 per cent of the state’s electricity came from solar and wind. Now it is 73 per cent (see below graphic) - the highest proportion of any major grid in the world. On days that are particularly sunny and windy, it powers itself with 100 per cent renewables. That happened on 180 days in 2021 and for a 10-day consecutive stretch in December 2022. The state is now racing to ramp this up to renewable-only power year-round.

Coming from neighbouring New South Wales, where just 31 per cent of electricity is from renewables, I find this clean energy rush highly enviable. It is also highly instructive to the wider world, which needs to…

What Does an Assistant Breeder (Oilseed Rape) do?



1. I'm responsible for""¦
 Collecting phenotypic data from field trials. We grow plots of various genotypes in the field to see their performance in different environmental conditions. I evaluate the plots based on the growth, the disease, flowering, etc. I also analyse these trait data along with yield and other harvest data. By doing so I assist the breeder to select the best genotypes which may become a new variety on the market for the growers. Within the company I am connected to the teams in the UK, France, and Germany. I also participate in meetings with breeders from other companies to discuss national listing trials and system. 

2. My typical day""¦
 Every day is different! My week is usually a mix of field visit, computer-based work, and meetings with the colleagues. There is always a fun dynamic. Most of the time I can be flexible but I prioritise field visit because the traits can only be captured at certain times of the growth cycle. 

3. The best part of my job""¦
 is that I am constantly learning (and discovering new things to learn). As technologies advance there are always possible improvements in the breeding strategies and methods to make. Also, the environment changes and the selection criteria will need to evolve with environmental and social changes. There is no final destiny. I love that plant breeding seeks continuous improvement to provide the most fit for purpose varieties for the farmers. I have to stay observative and never fall into routines!

4. The most challenging part of my job""¦

We try to plan and standardise everything well in advance but there could still be something unexpected due to the weather conditions or other external factors. It is crucial to adapt whenever things do not go the way as planned. Especially in summer when there is only a very short window between harvest and sowing to make the selection and sowing preparation. Since I started this role, I have been learning from my colleagues on problem solving. Each year we look into the issues that occurred and propose preventions and improvements for the coming years. I find this constructive and I really appreciate it when everyone works together as a big team. 


 5. Advice to others""¦ (What advice would you give to others who want a role like yours?)

Behind the same job title there might be big differences in the work environment, the management, the actual day-to-day tasks, how does it interact with your personal life, etc. It is important to get sufficient information before or during the interview process to see whether you like the role.

Something strange is happening in the Pacific and we must find out why

Unexpectedly, the eastern Pacific Ocean is cooling. If this ""cold tongue"" continues, it could reduce greenhouse gas warming by 30 per cent - but also bring megadrought to the US

The Pacific “cold tongue”, an area of ocean that stretches West from Ecuador is cooler than expected

FOR years, climate models have predicted that as greenhouse gas emissions rise, ocean waters will warm. For the most part, they have been correct. Yet in a patch of the Pacific Ocean, the opposite is happening. Stretching west from the coast of Ecuador for thousands of kilometres lies a tentacle of water that has been cooling for the past 30 years. Why is this swathe of the eastern Pacific defying our predictions? Welcome to the mystery of the cold tongue.

This isn’t just an academic puzzle. Pedro DiNezio at the University of Colorado Boulder calls it “the most important unanswered question in climate science”. The trouble is that not knowing why this cooling is happening means we also don’t know when it will stop, or whether it will suddenly flip over into warming. This has global implications. The future of the cold tongue could determine whether California is gripped by permanent drought or Australia by ever-deadlier wildfires. It influences the intensity of monsoon season in India and the chances of famine in the Horn of Africa. It could even alter the extent of climate change globally by tweaking how sensitive Earth’s atmosphere is to rising greenhouse gas emissions.

Major climate tipping points could be triggered within a decade

We are getting close to triggering irreversible changes that will have catastrophic effects worldwide, according to a major report on tipping points in Earth's systems

The climate has warmed so much that we are already at risk of triggering five global “tipping points” that would have catastrophic effects worldwide and couldn’t be reversed easily if at all, according to a major report. As the world goes past 1.5°C of warming, it will be increasingly likely that we will cross these tipping points, and there will be a growing risk of this resulting in others as well.

""Triggering one tipping point could trigger another in a kind of dangerous domino effect,"" says Tim Lenton at the University of Exeter in the UK, the report’s lead author. ""But also these tipping points in the Earth system could, in turn, trigger damaging tipping points in societies, things like food security crises, mass displacement and conflicts. Stopping these threats is possible, but it’s going to require urgent global action.""

A tipping point is where a small alteration in a system can cause abrupt changes that are hard to reverse or are irreversible, because of amplifying feedback processes. Lenton says this is like leaning back on a chair: when it is near the balance point, just a small nudge can make the chair fall over.

The report, put together by more than 200 researchers worldwide, brings together all the existing studies on tipping points and also includes research that is about to be published.

According to the report, the five major tipping points we are near to crossing are: the loss of the Greenland ice sheet, the demise of the West Antarctic ice sheet, the die-off of tropical coral reefs, the abrupt thaw of large areas of Arctic permafrost and the slowing of an ocean current known as the North Atlantic subpolar gyre.

The subpolar gyre is a circular current south of Greenland where salty water cools and sinks. It is linked to the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), but there is growing evidence that the current could slow or stop separately from and sooner than the AMOC, says David Armstrong McKay, also at the University of Exeter.

“[The slowing of the subpolar gyre] could happen within about 10 years,” says McKay. “It would have pretty major impacts across both sides of the Atlantic. It would cause regional cooling and affect agriculture in Europe and North America, and change the patterns of extreme weather events.”

“For some tipping points, we have a very short window for preventive action open right now which might close as soon as the 2030s,” says Manjana Milkoreit at the University of Oslo in Norway, who also worked on the report.

“We think that the prevention of Earth system tipping points should be the core objective of governance efforts because of the scale and severity of the threats that they represent, their cascading potential and the irreversibility of many tipping processes on relevant human timescales,” she says.

Other tipping points include the die-off of seagrass meadows and mangrove forests, and the collapse of fisheries.

These 6 tipping points could be catastrophic for humanity, says the UN

There are still huge uncertainties, the report acknowledges. In many cases, it still isn’t clear which systems have tipping points, how close we are to crossing them and what the impacts would be if we did.

Limiting further global warming by getting greenhouse gas emissions down to zero as fast as possible is the main thing that can be done to reduce the risk of triggering tipping points, but in some cases, other measures can help as well, says Milkoreit. For instance, preventing deforestation in the Amazon would reduce the risk of the rainforest dying off and being replaced by grasslands as the region gets hotter and dryer.

The report also calls for more to be done to help communities prepare for the impacts of some tipping points, such as sea level rise.

""Even with a profound acceleration of action, some Earth system tipping points may be unavoidable,"" says Lenton. ""But still there are things we can do to mitigate the risk they pose by reducing the vulnerability of people to the impacts coming from them.""

El NiÃ±o climate events cost tropical countries trillions of dollars

Long periods of extreme weather caused by El NiÃ±o events have a severe and long-lasting economic impact for the hardest-hit nations, an analysis has found

The arrival of an El NiÃ±o climate pattern - which is expected this year - can trigger devastating storms, droughts, floods and wildfires that have a far-reaching economic impact.

El NiÃ±o occurs when sea surface temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific rise at least 0.5°C above the long-term average, a state that triggers shifts in weather patterns around the world, particularly in some places.

For example, it will often bring stronger storms and more floods to Peru and Ecuador, while in Indonesia and Australia, it tends to unleash drought, wildfires and coral reef bleaching.

The financial impacts on the hardest-hit nations can be severe and long-lived, according to a new analysis.

Christopher Callahan at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire and his colleagues analysed GDP data from 1960 to 2019 for 147 countries to identify the economic impact of an El NiÃ±o.

They found it leads to a significant drag for up to five years after the event. For example, the 1982-83 El NiÃ±o cost the global economy $4.1 trillion and the 1997-98 one cost $5.7 trillion. Most of this was borne by poorer nations in the tropics, where the impacts of El NiÃ±o tend to be felt most keenly.

""El NiÃ±o is really costly and has economic implications that are a lot larger than previously understood,"" says Callahan. ""[These events] produce persistent reductions in economic growth that go beyond a simple blip that countries recover from immediately.""

The study is the first to suggest such a long-term and severe financial impact from El NiÃ±o. In 2017, research by Kamiar Mohaddes at the University of Cambridge and his colleagues suggested El NiÃ±o patterns can deal a short-lived economic blow to some countries, but can have a positive economic impact elsewhere.

In the US, for example, additional rainfall in California can stimulate hydroelectricity generation and boost agricultural yields, while on the east coast of the US, milder temperatures can lead to lower household heating bills, stimulating retail and leisure spending.

Mohaddes is sceptical that El NiÃ±o events have as much of a long-lasting and severe global economic impact as this latest study suggests. ""Actually, on net, an El NiÃ±o is positive for the global economy,"" he says.

""Absolutely, there are some countries that are negatively impacted by an El NiÃ±o event. But there are also a bunch of countries that are not impacted by an El NiÃ±o effect. And then there are countries that are positively impacted by El NiÃ±o,"" says Mohaddes.

Callahan says his results aren’t inconsistent with previous findings, but stresses that the new research assessed country data rather than regions and assessed impacts over a long period. ""Our numbers are larger and are arguably a more accurate accounting of [El NiÃ±o's] costs than theirs,"" he says.

Justin Mankin, who also worked on the study at Dartmouth College, says: ""I think it’s quite clear, from a purely geophysical standpoint, that El NiÃ±o represents disaster for a lot of regions around the world, particularly the regions in the tropics that also are low-income and least resilient to climate hazards.""

What is 'loss and damage' and how is it informed by climate science?

Meteorologists expect El NiÃ±o conditions to return by the end of this year, with fears growing that the event could prove to be a strong one with especially high sea surface temperatures in the Pacific. This would have a significant impact on both global average temperatures and weather patterns around the world.

Better forecasting and preparation for an El NiÃ±o would increase countries' capacity to cope, says Mankin. But climate change is amplifying the impacts of El NiÃ±o by pushing up the background rate of warming in the atmosphere, he adds, making emissions reductions a priority.

""What these results reveal is that we are really poorly adapted to the climate we have and when it is the case that El NiÃ±o and global warming align, their tendency is to just amplify the impacts of one another,"" he says.  ""Any preparations we can do on the adaptive side are absolutely essential, but it in no way discounts the importance of climate mitigation as the primary means to prevent additional damages.""

Surprising new research on cats will make you see yours in a new light

Cats have a reputation for being aloof and untamed, but recent studies suggest they may be more attuned to humans than we realise. We may even have solved the mystery of why cats love boxes

By Michael Marshall

7 March 2023 , updated 16 March 2023

Maya Beano

ON A regular basis, I wonder why we have a cat. This thought was most recently prompted by Peggy jumping onto a dresser and knocking off a ceramic bowl, which smashed. By the time you read this, she will have done something else to make me question my choice of pet.

Unlike dogs, which are dependent on us for everything, including their emotional well-being, cats seem to be sociopaths. Most cat owners (if owner is even the word) have entertained the suspicion that our feline companions would abandon us if we found ourselves unable to open their food containers. Sure, Peggy comes for cuddles every so often, but she might just be looking for warmth. In fact, despite cats having lived among people for thousands of years, it is questionable whether this has done anything to tame them.

However, it may be that cats are just misunderstood. Compared with dogs, they express themselves far more subtly, so that many of us don’t understand what their gestures and behaviours mean. Recent experiments suggest that cats are more socially intelligent and attuned to familiar humans than we realise. These studies even indicate that cats like us (I know, I can’t quite believe it either). What’s more, genetic investigations are getting a grip on just how domesticated cats really are. The findings may make you see your moggy in a whole new light.

Cats and dogs are the most popular pets in the world, yet the two behave very differently towards us. Dogs will rush to the front door in excitement when you come home, whereas cats appear aloof and…

The best new science fiction books of October 2023

From an authorised sequel to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four to a collection of newly discovered short stories from the late Terry Pratchett, there is a mountain of brilliant science fiction to get through this month

By Alison Flood

2 October 2023

Terry Pratchett … Inimitable.

Terry Pratchett … Inimitable.

Welcome to our round-up of the science fiction to look forward to in October. In a pile on my desk at home, ready for me to tear into them once I get a minute, are two of the books I mention below as ones I am particularly excited about: Julia, Sandra Newman's fresh take on Nineteen Eighty-Four, and A Stroke of the Pen, a collection of recently uncovered short stories by Terry Pratchett. Both are absolute must-reads for me, as a huge fan of both writers.

But this October, I am also hoping to make time for a new space opera series from Bethany Jacobs (because I can never say no to space opera) and for a little bit of horror, as Halloween is on my horizon and I very much enjoy scaring myself. There is lots to look forward to in science fiction, though, whether you are after satirical dystopias, climate disasters - or even ghosts stalking the metaverse. So read on, fellow fans!

Julia by Sandra Newman. This sequel to Nineteen Eighty-Four, authorised by the Orwell estate, is probably the book I am most excited about this month. Newman is an incredibly talented writer - and besides, who wouldn't want to learn about the events of George Orwell's dystopian masterpiece from the perspective of the woman Winston Smith meets? Our science fiction columnist Sally Adee is raving about it (although she advises that it packs quite an emotional punch), and according to novelist J. Robert Lennon, Newman has ""succeeded wildly at the impossible task she was given"".



The best new science fiction books of September 2023

We have a bumper crop of new sci-fi books for you this September, including talking spy cats from John Scalzi, an amazing discovery in space from Stephen Baxter and a near-future novel by Sebastian Faulks, says culture editor Alison Flood

A Stroke of the Pen: The lost stories by Terry Pratchett. But wait - a new collection of stories from the late and inimitably great Sir Terry? Perhaps this is my biggest title of the month. These stories were written by Pratchett in the 1970s and 1980s, while he was working for a regional newspaper, and have never been attributed to the Discworld author until now. They sound like a real mix of science fiction and fantasy, with topics ranging from time travel tourism to a visitor from another planet, and characters including cavemen, gnomes, wizards and ghosts. None are set in Discworld, but I, for one, can't wait to hear the wry, dry humour of Pratchett once again.

The Wolfe at the Door by Gene Wolfe. I will never forget my first experience of reading Gene Wolfe. His masterpiece The Book of the New Sun is a true epic of science fiction, set far in the future. I still think about his Urth, lit by the last light of its dying sun, regularly, so I will be picking up Wolfe's final collection, which features short stories, poems and essays from the late author, some never previously published. From a man who gets to travel to the stars, to an immortal pirate, it is a blend of genres, and I won't be missing it.

These Burning Stars by Bethany Jacobs. The beginning of a new space opera series, recommended for fans of Ann Leckie, Arkady Martine and Alastair Reynolds? Sign me up right now. Jacobs's debut follows con artist and hacker Jun Ironway, who has stumbled on evidence that could implicate a powerful family in a planet-wide genocide that took place 75 years earlier. Unsurprisingly, various people are after her, and we are promised ""a bloody confrontation that no one will survive unscathed"" by Jacobs's publishers. Fantastic.



The 10 best time travel movies ever made, according to a metaphysicist

From Back to the Future to Tenet and Interstellar, the joint director of the Centre for Time reveals her favourite time travel movies - both consistent and inconsistent (hello Marty McFly)

A Fire Born of Exile by Aliette de Bodard. More space opera here, this time from the award-winning de Bodard, set in the far reaches of her Xuya universe. In the Scattered Pearls Belt, where habitats are kept under strict military rule, the enigmatic Quynh arrives, offering a chance of escape for Minh, whose father is the belt's ruling prefect. We are promised that this will explore the power of love and revenge, as well as the wounds of the past.

Night Side of the River by Jeanette Winterson. This new collection of short stories from the award-winning Winterson has an intriguing premise, which, in my opinion, treads the line between science fiction and fantasy carefully enough to be of interest to us sci-fi fans: in the internet age, ghosts have adapted, innovated and found new channels to reach us, inhabiting our apps and walking the metaverse, just like they do our memories. As Winterson writes: ""In the metaverse, we are all alternative forms. The Dead will join us.""

Red River Seven by AJ Ryan. And on that note, it is October, so I think we should let some science fiction-infused horror into our round-up this month, to mark the coming of Halloween. And Red River Seven, described by one reader as ""Bird Box meets World War Z"", sounds pleasantly terrifying. Seven strangers, with no memory of who they are, wake up on a boat at sea. Each has a gun, and they agree to work together to survive as the boat's computer informs them they are ""Proceeding to Point A"". But what are the screams they can hear beyond the mist, and why can't they remember anything?



The best new science fiction books of August 2023

From speculative novellas by Josh Malerman to a first venture into science fiction from H is for Hawk author Helen Macdonald, August brims with sci-fi potential, says culture editor Alison Flood

A Haunting on the Hill by Elizabeth Hand. I'm straying a little further away from science fiction here, but sticking with the horror theme, and I hope you will forgive me - partly because this is no less than a sequel to the scariest book of all time, Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House, and partly because it is written by the brilliant, award-winning science fiction and fantasy author Elizabeth Hand. Set 60 years after Jackson's haunting, it is officially authorised by her estate. Let me remind you of the way in which Jackson started her own tale, one of the best openings ever written, and defy you not to join me in reading this follow-up. ""No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality; even larks and katydids are supposed, by some, to dream. Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding darkness within; it had stood so for eighty years and might stand for eighty more."" She was a genius.

Zoey is Too Drunk for This Dystopia by Jason Pargin. Back to more standard science fiction with this next pick - the third in a satirical sci-fi thriller series about Zoey Ashe, heiress to a criminal empire in a futuristic world. This time around, Zoey's people are organising the annual music festival in the new city of Tabula Ra$a, as well as the drunken riot that follows it (the citizens need some controlled chaos every now and then, after all). But then a social network broadcasts a horrific crime, live, and Zoey investigates.

She's a Killer by Kirsten McDougall. More satirical thrills from this novel which takes place in a world in which the climate crisis has sent wealthy immigrants flocking to New Zealand for shelter, where they are stealing land and taking over. Meanwhile Alice, who has an IQ of 159 and only communicates with her mother in Morse code, meets Erika, who draws her into radical, dangerous action.

Vurt by Jeff Noon; A Deepness in the Sky by Vernor Vinge. I also wanted to draw your attention to two reissues out this month - both for the completists amongst you and for those who may have yet to read these classics. First up is a 30th anniversary edition of Jeff Noon's cyberpunk novel Vurt, set in a world where hallucinogenic feathers take you to the shared reality of the Vurt. We can also look forward to a new edition of Vernor Vinge's Hugo award-winning A Deepness in the Sky. This version of Vinge's story about humanity being on the verge of contact with an alien race comes with an introduction from the excellent Jo Walton.

How was rhubarb found to be edible when it tastes bad raw? (Part 2)



3 May 2023

How was rhubarb found to be edible? It certainly isn’t palatable raw. (continued)

Guy Cox Sydney, Australia

The idea that rhubarb “isn’t palatable raw” is totally bonkers. During the second world war, food supplies were scarce in England, so councils divided up unused land into allotments, let out to households at a nominal rent, to encourage people to grow their own vegetables. My grandfather used his to grow tobacco.

By 1952, when I was seven, many of these had been abandoned, and my mates and I used to explore them looking for something tasty to eat. Rhubarb was a prized…

Llamas solve problems faster after watching people do it

Llamas are able to learn from other llamas and even more effectively from humans, possibly because thousands of years of domestication gave them the ability to read human social cues

Llamas are better at performing tasks after watching a human or llama do it first. This ability to learn from others, called social learning, is common among highly intelligent animals like primates but had never before been documented in llamas.

To investigate if llamas (Lama glama) could learn from others, researchers challenged 30 llamas on three farms in Germany to find a food reward behind a fence. On one side of a rectangular enclosure, behind a V-shaped metal fence, researchers placed a bowl of…

Just leaving trees to grow could store a third of our carbon emissions

Simply allowing existing trees to grow to maturity could theoretically suck billions of tonnes of carbon out of the atmosphere

By James Dinneen

13 November 2023

Trees can lock up carbon dioxide - but how much?

Trees can lock up carbon dioxide - but how much?

Chad Ehlers / Alamy

Protecting existing forests so they grow to maturity could theoretically remove as much as 228 billion tonnes of carbon from the air, according to a team made up of hundreds of researchers. This is equivalent to removing around a third of the carbon humans have added to the atmosphere to date, but critics say it is unlikely we could actually achieve this level of carbon absorption.

The finding will fuel a heated debate over the role of trees in mitigating climate change, which was ignited by a 2019 paper by Thomas Crowther at ETH ZÃ¼rich in Switzerland and his colleagues. That team estimated that restoring forests outside existing forested areas could store more than 200 billion tonnes of carbon. Other researchers argued the study overstated this potential by as much as five times by counting areas like deserts where growing trees would be impractical or by failing to account for other factors, such as fire.

""There is a great deal of false hope that can be generated by estimates that are too high,"" says Matthew Fagan at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.

Further controversy came when the study was widely interpreted as support for mass tree-planting programmes, which can have disastrous effects for biodiversity and local people even as they store carbon. Crowther says the emphasis on tree-planting ""massively oversimplified"" the message and was damaging. ""This scientific controversy has really harmed the environmental movement,"" he says.

In an attempt to move beyond the controversy, Crowther and more than 200 colleagues took another look at the carbon storage potential of Earth's forests. ""There is a massive opportunity to store carbon simply by protecting the ecosystems that we have,"" says Crowther.

The team used a suite of datasets and methods to model the amount of carbon that could be stored in forests in a hypothetical world without human influence. These included three separate models based on satellite measurements of forest cover, as well as models built from ground-based measurements in more than a million forest plots around the world.

These different models returned broadly similar results, estimating that forest ecosystems could store between 221 and 472 billion tonnes more than they do now. Around a third of that hypothetical forest would have to grow in areas where farms or cities currently exist, making restoration an unlikely prospect.

However, the team found an additional 108 to 228 billion tonnes of carbon could be stored in existing forests, many of which don't currently store as much carbon as they could because they have been degraded or haven’t grown to maturity. Another 87 billion tonnes could be stored by restoring forests in areas where they have been removed, but that aren't used for cities or for agriculture. ""I hope that people will see the real potential and value that nature can bring to the climate change topic,"" says Crowther.

While outside researchers have applauded the group’s new emphasis on protecting existing forests rather than planting new ones, some have said the paper doesn't settle many of the problems raised concerning the 2019 analysis, nor does it address the feasibility of protecting or restoring vast areas of the world's forests. ""They did not do anything to estimate how much of this estimate is achievable,"" says Joseph Veldman at Texas A&M University, another vocal critic of the 2019 study.

Building things with wood may not be as climate-friendly as thought

For instance, Karen Holl at the University of California, Santa Cruz, says the global analysis might miss complicated social and ecological dynamics that determine whether protection or restoration is possible at a local level. The researchers themselves also acknowledge other reasons why the estimate might be too high, whether due to fire or the influence of climate change on future forests.

Furthermore, it would take “many decades and likely up to centuries” for all the additional carbon to accumulate in these forests, says Caspar Roebroek at ETH ZÃ¼rich. That timeline would limit the significance of this additional carbon storage for mitigating emissions in the near term.

""[Protecting forests] is one of the best and cheapest solutions that we could do,"" says Fagan. ""But we need to be more realistic."" Instead of thinking of protecting all forests, he says it would be wiser to focus conservation efforts on the most carbon-rich and biodiverse places, where lost carbon stores would be irrecoverable.

""These are our cathedrals and we are burning them down,"" says Fagan. ""I'd like to call attention to that rather than pointing at protecting global forests in a general way.""

Prehistoric people in Spain may have made tools from human bones

The Cueva de los Marmoles cave in Granada, Spain, was used as a prehistoric human burial site. Researchers have found that nearly a third of the bones that remain were altered by tools, possibly to make bowls, cups or spatulas

Prehistoric farmers and herders in southern Spain buried their dead in a large cave - but may have later cut them up to make tools and possibly eat their bone marrow.

Since 1934, scientists, amateur archaeologists and even tomb raiders have been exploring human skeletal remains left in a Granada cave, called Cueva de los Marmoles.

Within the 2500-square-metre cave - which has harboured multiple generations of bodies across three millennia - people have previously found a carefully carved human skull cup, a well-crafted tibia tool and dozens of other bone fragments. New evidence suggests that some remains may have been intentionally broken and scraped up to a year after the individuals died.

The findings indicate that people may have been manipulating the deceased's bones, after the cadavers had decayed slowly for some time in the cave's cool, humid environment, says researcher Marco Milella at the University of Bern in Switzerland.

Milella, his co-lead researcher Rafael MartÃ­nez SÃ¡nchez at the University of CÃ³rdoba, Spain, and their colleagues went to the cave to collect further artefacts and investigate them using modern methods, such as advanced carbon dating, and hi-tech microscopic and scanning equipment.

They examined 411 bone fragments and 57 teeth that were unearthed in various zones of the cave, some of which they borrowed from a museum. They found that the remains were from at least a dozen human adults and children living in prehistoric agricultural societies. The findings suggest that people used the cave as a burial site during three distinct periods: 3900 to 3750 BC, 2600 to 2300 BC and 1400 to 1200 BC.

The team also found that while 3 per cent of the fragments had been gnawed by animals, nearly a third had been intentionally broken or cut with human tools. These fractures, scrapes and slices occurred when the bones were still ""fresh"" - probably up to a year after death, according to the researchers.

But the bones show no signs of having been forcefully separated from muscles or tendons. ""This suggests that the human remains were already partially decomposed when manipulated, but with the bone still being relatively elastic,"" says Milella. ""This, in turn, points to action not performed shortly after the death of the individuals, but at least some months after death.""

Notable specimens include a skull - probably from a middle-aged man - that had been scraped with stone tools and fashioned into a bowl or cup, and a teenager's shinbone that had been broken, polished and rounded into a sort of spatula, possibly for scraping other materials, such as leather. Several long bones had also been fractured and their insides scraped out, suggesting the marrow had been extracted for consumption, or possibly as part of a cultural practice of ""cleaning the remains"", says Milella.

Lacking any evidence of violence, the remains are probably not the result of power struggles between different populations, he says. His team is planning to carry out DNA research that will compare the relationships among the individuals buried in the cave.

A long-running study of wild bees in Spain has found the insects have been losing weight for the last three decades, most likely due to global warming.

Since 1990, Carlos Herrera at the Spanish National Research Council and his colleagues have hand-netted over 1700 individual bees belonging to 137 species in Sierras de Cazorla, Segura y Las Villas Natural Park, the largest protected wilderness area in Spain.

Catastrophic Libyan dam collapse partly caused by climate change

Recent extreme rainfall that caused flooding across the Mediterranean and contributed to the catastrophic collapse of two dams in Libya was probably made more likely and more intense by climate change

Halil Fidan/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images

The extreme rainfall that contributed to the failure of two dams in Libya earlier this month was probably made substantially more likely and more intense by climate change. There have been close to 4000 confirmed deaths due to the collapse of the dams, with thousands of people still missing.

Storm Daniel caused an inland dam near the coastal city of Derna, which has around 100,000 inhabitants and is situated in the north-east of Libya, to fail overnight on 10 September. A second dam downstream, which was closer to Derna, then also failed, sending a sudden wave of water into the city.

As of 18 September, the World Health Organization had recorded 3958 fatalities from Libya’s floods, with more than 9000 people unaccounted for.

Storm Daniel also brought unprecedented rainfall to parts of Europe. Heavy rain in Spain caused several deaths, while Greece saw a record-breaking 760 millimetres of rain over just four days. The subsequent flooding caused at least 17 deaths and submerged more than 75,000 hectares of agricultural land in the centre of the country.

""This event was a breaking point in Greece,"" says Kostas Lagouvardos at the National Observatory of Athens. ""From now on, we will speak about what happened before and after Daniel.""

The intensity of the rain was partially driven by a ""blocking"" pattern in the jet stream that created a slow-moving storm, as well as hot surface temperatures in the Mediterranean Sea, according to a study from World Weather Attribution, a group of researchers who look at links between extreme weather and climate change.

To determine how climate change may have contributed to the rain, the researchers compared observed trends with projections from different climate models, with and without the influence of human-caused warming.

They found human-induced climate change may have increased the intensity of the rainfall seen in Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey by as much as 40 per cent, as well as making such intense rain 10 times more likely to occur. In Libya, they found human-induced climate change may have made the extreme rain as much as 50 times more likely and 50 per cent more intense.

However, due to having limited data on precipitation and using climate models without sufficient resolution to capture local rainfall, the researchers couldn’t rule out the possibility that human-induced climate change didn’t actually make these events more likely or more intense.

But Friederike Otto at Imperial College London says the known link between a warmer atmosphere and more intense rain is enough to assume some contribution of climate change. ""It would be really careless to say there was no change.""

Earlier research also found that while climate change is driving a decline in overall precipitation in the Mediterranean, it will lead to more intense extreme events, such as these floods.

In Libya, the effects of the storm's intensity were also compounded by a lack of early warning and neglected infrastructure following years of political instability.

Manoochehr Shirzaei at Virginia Tech says the dams that failed were built to prevent previous floods and had been effective in the past. ""Since people had this false sense of security, they were living just behind this second dam,"" he says. ""Nobody had time to escape.""

However, the dams were known to be vulnerable. In 2022, civil engineer Abdelwanees Ashoor published a study saying the dams were ill-prepared to manage extreme rain. Built in the 1970s, they were in need of repair, but had been neglected due to civil war and political chaos. A project to repair the dams that began in 2010 was halted after an uprising against former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's regime.

The torrential rain in Libya, which the researchers have called a 1-in-600-year event, proved too much for the dams. ""It dumped so much water, it was larger than what the dams were built for,"" says Shirzaei.

Ageing infrastructure is vulnerable to climate extremes in many other parts of the world, says Shirzaei, pointing to US dams that were built more than a century ago and are in need of repair. ""This is a global problem,"" he says.

Ozone-destroying CFC chemicals are on the rise again despite ban

The production of CFCs was banned globally in 2010, but researchers have detected rising levels of five CFC chemicals from unknown sources

The concentrations of some ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in the atmosphere are increasing rapidly, scientists warn, despite the production of these chemicals having been banned globally since 2010.

CFCs were commonly used in refrigerants, aerosol propellants and solvents until they were discovered to be the driving force behind the destruction of the ozone layer. Under the Montreal Protocol, their production was phased out from 1989 to 2010.

But Luke Western at the University of Bristol, UK, and his colleagues have uncovered a sharp increase in global atmospheric concentrations of five CFC chemicals between 2010 and 2020, which could suggest they are still being illicitly produced in some factories.

Using data from 14 measurement sites around the world, the researchers found that concentrations of CFC-112a, CFC-113, CFC-113a, CFC-114a and CFC-115 have increased since 2010, reaching a record high abundance in the atmosphere in 2020.

The jump in emissions isn’t likely to significantly hamper the recovery of the ozone layer, which is expected to heal completely by the 2060s, but the planet-warming impact of CFC gases means the findings are a concern, said Western at a press briefing.

He told reporters that the findings should act as an ""early warning"" for countries to crack down on illicit or negligent production of the chemicals.

The amount of these gases emitted in 2020 would have an equivalent warming effect to the total carbon emissions for a country like Switzerland, he said. ""So the climate impacts are still quite substantial.""

Some of the increase in emissions can be explained by a jump in the production of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are widely used as a replacement for CFCs. The production of HFCs sometimes leads to the production and release of CFCs as a by-product.

But two CFCs in particular, CFC-112a and CFC-113, have no known legal uses and researchers aren’t sure what is causing the increase in emissions. ""That's really a bit scary,"" said Stefan Reimann at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology during the same briefing.

Western suggested it could be that factories are using CFC-112a illegally to produce fluorovinyl ether or solvents, for example. ""We have no evidence to suggest that's what is going on,"" he said. ""But that's one of the only previously known uses of CFC-112a.""

Likewise, the researchers aren’t sure where the emissions are coming from. ""We are pretty certain it's not coming from Europe or the US,"" said team member Isaac Vimont at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the US. But, beyond that, it isn’t yet clear which countries are the source of the emissions, he said.

In 2018, factories in China were found to be the source of a spike in CFC-11 emissions. Previous research has identified East Asia as a source of CFC-113a and CFC-115 emissions, and more monitoring is needed across the region to help pinpoint the source of the current increase in emissions, the study authors wrote in their paper.

Under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which was ratified in 2016, countries agreed to reduce the production and consumption of HFCs. These are harmless to the ozone layer, but drive climate change.

Western said action under this amendment should help to tackle CFC emissions as well. Reducing HFC and CFC emissions would be an ""easy win"" for the climate, he added.

Humans have pumped so much groundwater, we've shifted Earth's axis

Changes in the distribution of groundwater around the planet between 1993 and 2010 were enough to make Earth's poles drift by 80 centimetres

Over the course of about two decades, humans pumped enough water out of the ground that we shifted Earth's poles by almost a metre. This is equivalent to the polar drift caused by melting Greenland ice over the same period.

""Most people would go about their lives and wouldn't be aware of [Earth's] wobbles or the drift,"" says Clark Wilson at the University of Texas at Austin. He and his colleagues modelled how changes in the distribution of water around the planet have affected the drifting of the poles.

Some of that polar wander is down to natural causes. Because Earth isn't a perfect sphere, it wobbles like a top several metres each year. The poles also drift due to changes in the distribution of mass around the planet, such as the movement of water due to the changing seasons.

""There are a number of things contributing to polar drift, and they all add up,"" says Wilson. Filling reservoirs and pumping groundwater both play a part, as well as climate change melting glaciers and the resulting sea level rise, although it wasn't clear how big the effect of each might be.

Wilson and his colleagues modelled the drift using estimates of the amount of groundwater pumped between 1993 and 2010, totalling around 2100 gigatonnes, and the associated rise in sea level, which they estimated at 0.3 millimetres per year.

The polar drift attributed to these changes from groundwater pumping amounted to about 80 centimetres. Wilson says this is especially due to large aquifers located at mid-latitudes, which have the greatest effect on polar drift. The only thing that affected the drift more than changes in groundwater was the rebound of landmasses after the lost weight of melted glaciers.

This doesn't itself have particular consequences in terms of changes in the length of the day or of the seasons, though knowing the precise location of the axis is essential for any GPS technology to work, says Wilson.

But the finding illustrates how much water people have pumped, says Manoochehr Shirzaei at Virginia Tech. ""The precise number doesn't matter really,"" he says. ""What matters is that the volume is so gigantic that it can impact the polar drift of the Earth.""

Groundwater pumping has accelerated in the 21st century, in part due to drought conditions driven by climate change, as well more crops growing in dry places, says Shirzaei.

Extreme heat: Inside the expedition to find out how humans can adapt

Climate change means extreme heat will become the norm for millions across the world. We joined an experiment in the Saudi Arabian desert designed to find out what that means for our brains and bodies

By Graham Lawton

14 August 2023

I am in the Nafud desert, a vast tract of sandy and rocky wilderness in northern Saudi Arabia, to experience levels of heat that I am not built to endure - and to meet 20 people participating in an expedition called Deep Climate, dedicated to understanding how humans respond to extreme conditions. “The idea is to study how human beings can adapt to a new kind of environment,” says Christian Clot, the leader of the expedition and director of the Human Adaptation Institute in France.

As the climate warms, the issue is becoming increasingly pressing. Even under the most optimistic scenarios, the scorching heat seen in southern Europe and across the US over the past couple of months, with temperatures exceeding 40°C, will become the norm in many parts of the world.

That means the question of what happens to our brains and bodies, and the extent to which human physiology can cope with extreme heat, matters for millions of people. “You’re going to see a great big swathe of very densely populated areas go up to unprecedented temperatures that nobody experienced in the historical climate,” says Tim Lenton at the University of Exeter, UK, who recently co-authored a research paper called “…

Cave paintings of mutilated hands could be a Stone Age sign language

Palaeolithic hand stencils with missing fingers could indicate ritual mutilation or frostbite - but new research suggests they might be trying to tell us something

DEEP inside Gargas cave in the Pyrenees mountains of southern France is something that has puzzled every visitor who has made the journey into its dark inner chambers. Among prehistoric paintings and engravings of horses, bison and mammoths are hundreds of stencils made tens of thousands of years ago by people spitting red and black paint over their outstretched hands. Such motifs are found at ancient sites around the world, from Australia to the Americas and from Indonesia to Europe. For years, archaeologists have wondered at their meaning. But those in Gargas are especially mysterious because around half of the hands appear to be injured.

“It’s very obvious that some of the fingers are missing,” says Aritz Irurtzun at the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) in Bayonne, France. So-called mutilated hands can be seen at many other prehistoric rock art sites, but Gargas cave is the most striking example of this phenomenon.

It has been suggested that these missing fingers are the result of accidents, frostbite or ritual mutilation. Another possibility is that their creators deliberately folded away their fingers to produce specific patterns. Irurtzun and Ricardo Etxepare, also at CNRS, have now found a way to test this idea. What they have discovered convinces them that Gargas’s hand stencils reflect a Stone Age sign language. If so, these patterns add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that Palaeolithic cave paintings may contain a variety of hidden codes. The Gargas stencils could even represent the oldest writing system we know of - by a very long way.

Prehistoric hand stencils have puzzled researchers for more than a century. Only a few - from Europe and Indonesia - have been reliably dated, and they turn out to be among the earliest known artistic motifs. Most are around 40,000 years old. One, found in Spain, is more than 66,000 years old, leading researchers to conclude a Neanderthal made it (see “Whose hands?”). “We know that hand stencils were some of the first markings of a visual culture to appear. They go back a lot longer than figurative art,” says Paul Pettitt at Durham University, UK. “Conceptually, they’re fascinating. It’s an odd thing to do, to create not a positive print, but a negative impression of it.” In his view, they were the inspiration for figurative art, as humans started recognising their ability to create lifelike forms in paint.

While these stencils might look like mere doodles to the untrained eye, they are often found deep in caves in hard-to-reach places, suggesting that they had some special significance. “They’re not just someone accidentally slapping their hand on a wall,” says Pettitt. Irurtzun shares this view. “Going deep into the cave, with the painting material and carrying a torch or lamp… it has to be something really profound for them. The question is, what type of meaning did they have?” he says. HipÃ“lito Collado Giraldo at the University of Coimbra in Portugal suggests that, among other things, they could be indicators of danger, orientation signs, group identity symbols or markers of hidden goods in the cave. “It is the big question everyone would like to answer,” he says.

Missing digits

Hand stencils with missing fingers are even more intriguing. They are most common in Gargas cave, where 114 of the 231 hand images are missing at least one finger segment. They also feature prominently in another French cave, Cosquer in Marseille, where 28 of the 49 hand stencils are missing digits.

One idea is that Stone Age people deliberately removed their digits. That might sound brutal, but ritual finger amputation is actually a relatively common practice. A 2018 study found it occurring in 121 recent societies - although it is generally limited to the pinkie finger. Amputation might explain some Stone Age hand stencils. “In Palaeolithic rock art, the most common hidden finger is only the pinkie,” says Collado Giraldo. But the stencils at Gargas and Cosquer exhibit a variety of missing digits. Moreover, the most common pattern observed in Gargas is an extended thumb with all the other digits displayed as stumps - an extreme mutilation that would have been catastrophic for the recipient. Besides, there are no missing fingers on any of the positive handprints in prehistoric European cave art - made by daubing the hand with paint and pressing it against a cave wall. These observations seem to rule out the mutilation idea and also the possibilities that fingers were lost to frostbite and accidents - at least at Gargas and Cosquer.

Instead, many researchers think that prehistoric artists deliberately created these patterns. “The missing fingers are only hidden fingers under the palm of the hand,” says Collado Giraldo. If so, this has intriguing implications. “It’s almost certainly some kind of communication system,” says Pettitt.

Leroi-Gourhan/Etxepare/Irurtzun

Taking this idea a step further, Irurtzun and Etxepare, who are both linguists, wondered whether Stone Age hand stencils might represent a prehistoric sign language. After all, various lines of research suggest that language originated with hand signs as well as vocalisations. Indeed, many societies continue to use a wide range of symbolic hand gestures during hunting, storytelling and rituals alongside - and sometimes in place of - their spoken language. These “alternate” sign languages can function as a lingua franca between groups that don’t share the same spoken language.

There is even evidence of people representing their sign language in cave symbols. More than a century ago, anthropologist Walter Roth documented an alternate sign language made by Queensland First Nations communities in Australia, which has parallels with depictions of hands in the rock art of the region. For example, a fist with just the little finger outstretched was the sign for a small caterpillar or grub.

To test whether the motifs in Gargas cave might represent a sign language, Irurtzun and Etxepare turned to a system used to analyse the ease with which the gestures employed in alternate sign languages can be made. By considering the physiology of the hand and forearm, they rated each of the patterns of the hand stencils on the cave wall. If these were random, and made with the support of a surface, you would expect 32 different permutations. Instead, there are just 10, all of which can be made in the air, suggesting that they correspond to particular hand gestures. Moreover, shapes that can’t be made in the air but only against a surface, aren’t seen in Gargas - or anywhere else. “We don’t find evidence of hand stencils that would be impossible in sign language,” says Irurtzun.

This isn’t the first time researchers have suggested that Stone Age cave paintings might contain a hidden code. Among stunning depictions of mammoths and bison, there are many graphic marks, ranging from simple lines, dots and triangles to complex configurations, such as ladders and feather shapes called penniforms. Genevieve von Petzinger at the Polytechnic Institute of Tomar, Portugal, has made a comprehensive catalogue of these signs from caves in Europe and has found that the Stone Age people living there had a repertoire of 32 different ones. What’s more, some of these symbols are found in caves throughout the world. Certain signs, including disks and hand stencils, are often found close together, and such combinations are of great interest for understanding the origins of writing, says von Petzinger. After all, combinations of just 26 letters of the Latin alphabet encode the vast amount of information of the English language.

A study published earlier this year even claims to have decoded the meaning of some of these symbols. Ben Bacon, an independent researcher based in London, worked with Pettitt and others to analyse dots and “Y” shapes found close to depictions of animals and created between 20,000 and 10,000 years ago. They discovered what looks like a sort of hunting calendar to record the behaviour of prey, with the number of marks seeming to record an animal’s mating season in months after the beginning of spring, and a Y denoting the month it gave birth.

It is becoming increasingly clear that Stone Age people were playing around with graphic symbols in surprisingly sophisticated ways. So the idea that hand stencils with missing digits might depict a Stone Age sign language doesn’t seem so far-fetched. Collado Giraldo thinks it is one of the more promising interpretations of their meaning - at least at Gargas and Cosquer. Von Petzinger is also open to the idea. “At a basic level, an outline of a hand is actually a sort of message, perhaps ‘I was here’. Could they have been sending more complex signals in certain times and certain places? I’d say it’s possible for sure,” she says.

But some experts, including Karenleigh Overmann at the University of Colorado, are more sceptical. She isn’t averse to Leroi-Gourhan’s suggestion that the mutilated hands could be a code to coordinate hunting. “But the idea that they encode more language-like messages - I find that a little hard to accept,” she says.

Origins of writing

The jury is still out. But if Etxepare and Irurtzun are correct, their research has an extraordinary implication: the Gargas stencils could be an early form of writing. “If writing is a graphic representation of language - of linguistic expression - and the hand stencils represent an alternate sign language, then yes, that will be a sort of writing,” says Irurtzun. If so, it could be the oldest example of proto-writing that we know of.

Exactly how old remains uncertain because establishing the age of prehistoric cave art is notoriously challenging. It had long been assumed that the Gargas stencils were made in the Gravettian period, between 33,000 and 21,000 years ago. This seems to be backed up by radiocarbon dating of a bone fragment from a crack in the cave wall, which was found to be around 27,000 years old.

In Cosquer cave, some hand stencils have been dated directly and they, too, came in at 27,000 years old - as did one in a cave in Indonesia, which is missing its fourth and fifth digits. It is possible that the Gargas hands are much older still, given that many stencils on European cave walls were made 40,000 years ago or more. But even the most conservative date makes them mind-bogglingly older than the first formal writing system. Known as cuneiform, it arose in Mesopotamia just 5500 years ago, although it is thought to have developed from proto-writing with its roots in clay counting tokens that first appeared around 10,000 years ago.

Read more: How the secrets of ancient cuneiform texts are being revealed by AI

Of course, it will require more evidence to back up this extraordinary claim. Irurtzun is already working on that. Late last year, he joined a team of archaeologists who descended into the deep, dark chambers of Gargas and neighbouring caves with 3D-imaging cameras and special lighting to detect paint marks that can’t be seen with the naked eye.

Their findings haven’t been published yet, but we should soon know more. If they find similar hand gestures throughout the region, that would indicate a more widespread communication system, bolstering the idea that writing has its origins in the Stone Age.



Whose hands?

Looking at images of Stone Age hand stencils on cave walls, it is hard not to imagine the people who made them. Some were clearly children, judging by the size of the marks they left. The majority were made by adults, though, and most of these seem to have been women - which you can tell because women's index and ring fingers tend to be more equal in length than those of men.

It is possible that some artists weren't even Homo sapiens. In 2018, a hand stencil from Maltravieso cave in Spain was found to be 66,700 years old, suggesting a Neanderthal created it, as modern humans only arrived in Europe around 40,000 years ago. This finding has since been contested. However, the heated debate could soon be settled by a group of researchers working on a project called First Art.

As well as dating the earliest art in Spain and Portugal, the First Art team has been looking for DNA trapped in the calcite layers that sometimes form over cave paintings. To create a stencil, a prehistoric artist would have spat paint over an outstretched hand, so their genetic material might still be present in the pigment. The hunt for such DNA has already been started by Maxime Aubert at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia, who studies ancient cave art in Indonesia. He hasn't found any DNA yet, but he plans to have another go once the technology has improved. It should become clear later this year whether the First Art researchers have had more success.

""Being able to identify an individual artist and tell whether it was a modern human or Neanderthal, a man or a woman... the things we could do with that information are utterly incredible,"" says team member Genevieve von Petzinger at the Polytechnic Institute of Tomar, Portugal.

Does harvesting renewables like solar and wind change the planet slightly? Is there a tipping point where this harvesting becomes as harmful as the effect of fossil fuels?

Alex McDowell London, UK

Covering a fifth of the Sahara desert with solar panels would have adverse effects on world climate.

A 2018 study found that covering the entire Sahara with wind farms and solar panels would double the local rainfall, improve vegetation and help power the world. However, another study in 2020 looked at the global impacts this would have. It found that effects on Earth’s climate systems from…

English rivers regularly pumped full of oxygen to prevent fish deaths

In the past five years, there have been almost 100 cases of the UK's Environment Agency deploying emergency oxygen to stop fish in English rivers from dying

English rivers were pumped with emergency oxygen in a last-ditch effort to save fish from dying on almost 100 occasions in the past five years, New Scientist can reveal.

Rivers can become deoxygenated for a variety of reasons, including sewage dumping that encourages the growth of bacteria, plants and algae, which can result in the consumption of oxygen. Hot weather can also play a role, as water holds less oxygen at higher temperatures.

To combat these effects, the Environment Agency (EA) in England has emergency measures in place to pump oxygen into rivers with the aim of preventing fish and plant deaths.

Last year saw 25 instances of the EA doing this, according to a freedom of information request, while there were a total of 74 deployments between 2018 and 2021. The figures for this time period only include 13 out of the EA's 14 operating areas, and data isn’t yet available for 2023, meaning that while there were at least 99 emergency oxygen deployments in the past five years, the true figure is likely to be higher.

Graeme Storey, fisheries manager at the EA, says the organisation hasn't officially analysed whether the use of emergency oxygen measures has increased in recent years, but says that anecdotally it seems like it has. ""It does feel as though the number of reports received of fish in distress has increased over recent years,"" he says. ""The signs to look out for are fish gasping for air, appearing lethargic in the margins and dead fish floating on the surface.""

The EA pumps oxygen in several ways, such as using liquid hydrogen peroxide, which breaks down into water and oxygen, and mechanical aerators, which increase oxygen in the water body by disturbing its surface. ""Used in isolation, mechanical aeration is slower to raise oxygen levels, but it is a great option for chronic issues such as regular algal blooms,"" says Storey.

Climate change is likely to increase the need for emergency oxygen in rivers in the future, says Storey. ""There are two factors at play here, increasing temperatures and extreme rainfall events acting in combination with underlying pressures on the aquatic environment,"" he says. ""If global temperatures continue to rise and stay higher for longer periods, this will cause ongoing challenges for wild fish populations and fisheries.""

""The use of emergency aeration shows that fish populations in a number of England's rivers are on life support,"" says Gary Caldwell at Newcastle University in the UK. ""Our changing climate is expected to bring increasingly prolonged periods of low rainfall, which, compounded by sewage and agricultural runoff, could mean that artificial oxygenation becomes the new normal, making our river's wildlife that little bit less wild.""

""Oxygen pumping is an important emergency measure in fish rescue, but keeping rivers cool, protecting flows and reducing pollution are all important longer-term measures to protect rivers against the impacts of climate change,"" says Steve Ormerod at Cardiff University, UK.

Cannabis is having a moment. Half of Americans live in a state with legal marijuana and 9 in 10 people nationwide support legalisation in some form. This is a stark difference from mere decades ago, when prohibition was the norm in the entire US. Meanwhile, if you live in Malta, Uruguay, Canada - and maybe soon, Germany - your entire country is one with legal recreational pot. And access to medical marijuana extends to even more countries, including the UK and Australia.

But as medical and recreational use become more popular and increasingly accessible, how exactly did we get to this moment of change? What has research been able to tell us - so far - about how the plant produces its euphoric effects, or what medical purposes it may be able to serve or how it might be harmful? And how could our relationship with this unassuming leaf change in coming decades?

In the first episode of a special 3-part podcast series, Christie Taylor and the rest of the New Scientist reporting team start at the beginning: 27.8 million years ago, when hops and hemp diverged in family Cannabaceae. A million years ago, when Cannabis indica and Cannabis sativa diverged into two differently psychoactive strains. And 12,000 years ago, when humans first domesticated cannabis for mundane household use, not yet dreaming of the euphoric experiences to come.

But of course, it all comes back to the high, and we go there too - the evidence, though still sparse, of drug-related use dating back at least to 500 BC. And, a thousand years later, perhaps the first recorded reference to a ritual not unlike hotboxing.

Transcript

Christie Taylor: It’s a sunny November morning in Manhattan and I’m buying weed for my job.

Sasha Nugent: So right now, we have pre-rolls, tinctures, flower, edibles, and drinks, and that’s an array of things that we have. Vapes as well. We have flower and we offer it in eighth and one ounces, and we even have a three ounce bag, and three ounce is the max in New York that you’re able to purchase in a day.

Christie Taylor: That’s Sasha Nugent. She’s the so-called ‘Budmaster’ at Housing Works Cannabis Co. It’s the retail extension of a local AIDS non-profit and also the first recreational dispensary to be licensed in New York City, and if you’ve never been inside a licensed dispensary before, you may be shocked at how normal a retail experience it feels like. Two big display cases wrap around the retail area filled with colourful packages of merchandise, like gummies infused with THC, the main ingredient that gets people high, or CBD, a secondary ingredient that seems to have a more calming, chill effect. Pastel rainbow signs next to the row of cash registers have slogans like ‘make love, not drug war’, and ‘spark up your inner activist’, and ‘we’re smoking out stigma’. The product labels range from slightly goofy and psychedelic to what I can only describe as a colourful fruit salad, and for the Apple Store types, there’s sleek and minimalist black and white packaging.

Sasha Nugent: On a slow day, anywhere from, like, Sunday to Wednesday, we see about 550 to 700 people depending on the day. On our busier days, Thursday through Saturday, we can see upwards of 1,000 unique customers.

Christie Taylor: The normality of this experience has only become possible recently. New York State only legalised recreational cannabis in 2021. Other states went sooner and there has been a dramatic wave of various degrees of legalisation across the US, and even across the world. We are in a new normal when it comes to cannabis, but what do we really know about the science of it? Where did the plant come from? What does it do to our health, for good or for bad? I’m Christie Taylor. I’m a podcast producer for New Scientist, and this is the first episode in our three-part series about the science of cannabis, how we got here, what we know, and what the future may hold. This is part of a huge month-long reporting effort from more than half a dozen journalists and you can read their work over at newscientist.com/cannabis. We’ve investigated cannabis and creativity, mapped the still languishing landscape of medical research, and questioned the environmental cost of industrial scale hemp harvests, but today I’m starting at the beginning, how we got to this moment where I can walk into a store, buy a federally controlled substance, and just tell you about it, and why our relationship with cannabis is possibly one of the oldest relationships our species has had with a domesticated plant.

If you want to feel really old, it’s been 87 years since the movie Reefer Madness debuted. It’s a hyperbolic fictional warning about young people driven to psychosis with multiple murders and deaths all because they had some weed. ‘These high school boys and girls are having a hop at the local soda fountain, innocent of a new and deadly menace lurking behind closed doors.’ (Advert played 03.25-03.32). But now, walk through many neighbourhoods in New York City and you’ll see something you didn’t used to, storefront after storefront with names like ‘Magic Garden’, ‘Smacked Village’, ‘Weed World’, or just ‘Gotham’. The fonts run from cartoonish to classy, and storefront signs, as in other cities with legal recreational and medical weed, will advertise under no uncertain circumstances that they have THC, CBD, or just the unmistakeable green seven-pointed leaf shape that screams ‘marijuana’. In states with legal cannabis, medical or otherwise, you can speak frankly with salespeople about dosages and strains. Do you want help sleeping, or daytime relaxation, pain or appetite management, or a sense of calm while getting your work done? Or do you just want to get stoned off your ass, watch some dumb TV, and laugh uncontrollably while making up new words for hedgehog? No judgement. No, really. Please, no judgement.

Sasha Nugent: I am just like you. I have trouble sleeping and I also have anxiety, so after, like, a day at work, I love the Offline from Off Hours. Like, they don’t pay me. That’s one of my favourite ones.

Christie Taylor: Outside the dispensaries, at corner stores and bodegas, you can still buy THC-infused seltzers and mocktails, cannabis cocktails, and skin lotions featuring CBD. In states like Wisconsin that haven’t legalised cannabis, purveyors get around it with a less potent form of THC called Delta-8. It’s derived from non-psychoactive cannabis and so remains, for now, legal in the US through a loophole in a 2018 agriculture law. Some of the greater glow of legality is in the name of medical applications, which are very real but still under investigation in the case of some treatments. In states where weed is legal only in medical contexts, your doctor can still usually get you a dispensary card for ALS, Parkinson’s disease, chronic pain, cancer and chemo side effects, and mental health conditions like PTSD, and the number of people enrolled in medical marijuana programmes in the US? It more than quadrupled between 2016 and 2020 to a whopping 3 million. People use it for nausea, pain, and glaucoma symptoms. It’s showing legitimate promise as a treatment for multiple sclerosis and rare forms of epilepsy, but when we look at this moment in our relationship with cannabis, it’s also clear that the years of prohibition have cost us research. Because the US federal government still bans weed, scientists have struggled for funding, or simply a sufficient legal supply to study.



How we get high: Unlocking the secrets of the endocannabinoid system

The endocannabinoid system that helps cannabis get us high is also vital to many other aspects of our health. Now we're finally starting to understand why - and what that means for devising new treatments

The late Dr. Raphael Mechoulam, the Israeli scientist who first isolated THC from cannabis in the 1950s, he even had to get his first samples from the police, and as its therapeutic potential gains greater excitement, the federal ban on weed is still undermining scientific research that might bring clarity on both the benefits and the risks of its consumption. This research is needed more than ever. At Housing Works, I’m presented with three seemingly equal products, gummy edibles, that might help me sleep better. They all advertise their properties in terms of milligrams of THC and other calming compounds, so I pick one called Snoozeberry solely by the promise that it would taste like blueberry, a flavour I liked, and I’m charmed maybe just a little bit by the twinkling stars on the soothing deep blue packaging.

Sasha Nugent: Perfect. So this is your receipt, and would you like a bag?

Christie Taylor: Yes, I’ll take a bag.

Sasha Nugent: No problem. I’ll grab one for you.

Christie Taylor: Okay.

Sasha Nugent: So we also offer delivery, so I put a delivery flyer in case you’re in one of our delivery zones, and I also put a little sticker with our QR code in case you want to order it in advance.

Christie Taylor: Alright. Thank you so much.

Sasha Nugent: Thank you so much. It was great meeting you.

Christie Taylor: Yes, great meeting you too. You’re not high. A revolution has been baking toward the popularity and acceptance of weed. Legalisation of cannabis for recreational use has swung hugely into favour in the last 10 years. Uruguay legalised recreational use of marijuana in 2013, Canada in 2018, Malta 2021. Lawmakers in Germany may soon vote on a bill to do the same, and medical marijuana is even more widely legalised, including in the UK and Australia. In the US, there’s no national approval of cannabis in any context. Instead, it’s a state by state patchwork, but one that is increasingly pro-pot, with 38 states and Washington, DC all moving to legalise marijuana. Nearly half of those are states that support both medical and recreational use, including, just weeks ago, the state of Ohio, and if you ask we, the people, there’s overwhelming support for national legalisation. Nearly 7 in 10 Americans say ‘yes’.

Alexis Wnuk: That’s actually triple what it was 30 years ago.

Christie Taylor: New Scientist’s Alexis Wnuk dug into the data explaining this shift and she found the swing in attitudes is even more dramatic than that.

Alexis Wnuk: So if you ask people specifically about recreational and medical uses, it’s more like 9 in 10 people in favour of legalising it in some capacity. Younger people and those on the political left continue to support legalisation in greater numbers than older people and people on the political right, but we’ve seen a surge in support across all age groups and the entire political spectrum.



6 charts that explain the cannabis revolution

As popular discussion of cannabis has moved away from the drug trade and toward potential medical applications, views about safety and support for legalisation have changed hugely in the US

Christie Taylor: Republican support, while still quite a bit lower than other groups, tripled between 1990 and 2016. This also seems to align with a shift in how people perceive the dangers of cannabis. For the 50 years that the US has tracked these perceptions, people have always seen cannabis as less dangerous than drugs like cocaine or heroin, but in the early 2000s, that gap got even bigger.

Alexis Wnuk: Around 20% of people surveyed in 1997 said that smoking marijuana once or twice a week posed minimal or no risk of harm, but by 2021, which is the most recent data we have, half of people surveyed thought this, and we know this wasn’t just because perceptions of all drugs were changing, because people still ranked other drugs at about the same level of danger as they did 30 years ago.

Christie Taylor: So why have people swung so comparatively hard for cannabis in recent decades? The biggest reason is medical marijuana. If you look back at the surveys, 98% of people who supported legalisation said that medical use was a very important or somewhat important reason why.

Alexis Wnuk: In the 1980s and ’90s, we started seeing studies that suggested cannabis could reduce nausea and improve appetite in people with HIV (TC 00:10:00) and in those undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, and this started creeping into the national conversation on marijuana. I came across a study from 2019 by researchers at John Jay College here in New York City where they tracked media coverage of marijuana over the years. They took the New York Times, one of the most read newspapers in the nation, as a case study, and what they found was that in the late ’90s, articles about medical use of cannabis started making up more and more of the coverage. At the same time, there’s less and less coverage dealing with marijuana trafficking or abuse.

Christie Taylor: Headlines about multimillion-dollar pot busts declined. You were more likely to see stories like the 1993 headline about a 79 year old woman who was growing weed to help her son, who had multiple sclerosis, eat better, or a pot-smoking club in San Francisco reserved for the sick and dying. 1996 is also when you saw California become the first state to allow cannabis for medicinal purposes with a doctor’s supervision.

Alexis Wnuk: Obviously, we can’t know for sure whether the media coverage actually changed people’s attitudes or whether it was just following the shift in attitudes but what we do know is that, in this time period, we saw a big uptick in coverage of medical marijuana and the people who could benefit from it, so instead of fearmongering and crime, you were much more likely to see a focus on compassionate use for people who were critically ill.

Christie Taylor: There are a lot of other reasons ranking highly as well. Nearly as important for some people was freeing up law enforcement to do other work, followed by the argument that it’s someone’s personal choice to consume it. Deeper in the survey data, there’s support for the argument that tax revenue from legal weed could support local governments, or that it just might be safer to have legal oversight for weed, and if you go back to the perceptions of risk, there were people that said that using weed is already safe and so there’s no reason to outlaw it. Half of Americans now live in a state with legal recreational cannabis and there’s no sign that the wave is slowing down. The thing is, the weed zeitgeist, this wave of stigma oscillating into mania, isn’t the first time that our species has used this plant, whether for highs or healing. It’s one of the first crops human beings ever cultivated, starting 12,000 years ago. Think the oldest profession but make it agriculture, and until 100 years ago, it was one of our species most important sources of fibre, shelved only thanks to the rise of synthetic fibres such as nylon, but what was cannabis doing before humans met hemp?



A million years of marijuana: How cannabis became our favourite weed

Cannabis was one of the first crops that humans cultivated about 12,000 years ago. But medicinal and psychoactive uses are much more recent

First, we should also talk about humulus, marijuana’s cousin in family Cannabaceae. You know it as hops, which flavours our beer, but fossils of the two plants have been confused for each other numerous times over the years, which is why genetics may be the better arbiter of when hops and herb diverted in the evolutionary tree. The evolution of plants like cannabis is hard to study. You need fossils, and soft matter doesn’t make the same impressions in stone that bones or teeth might, but the traces do exist and modern genomic science is also increasingly helping us use living plants to scry backward in time. It’s a kind of timekeeping that relies on mutations. A molecular clock. Scientists can count how many mutations the two plants have gathered over time and use that to determine that hops and cannabis diverted into separate species around 27.8 million years ago. Hops went on to become a funky-smelling climbing plant integral to beer but not particularly psychoactive on its own, but cannabis? It’s a funky-smelling, wind-pollinated, herbaceous ground plant that’s rich in oils and protein. It gets you high and it slows you down, and as fossil pollen indicates, it may have originally evolved on the Tibetan plateau at dizzying elevations with an arid climate and harsh, inhospitable levels of UV radiation from the Sun. Chelsea Whyte tracked down this high-elevation history.

Chelsea Whyte: This also may be why the plant possesses its calming properties. THC and CBD, as well as other cannabinoids, seem to protect plants from UV rays, and cannabis may have developed these compounds as an adaptation to its early habitat.

Christie Taylor: And then there’s the question of cannabis sativa and cannabis indica. Seasoned pot consumers know these two psychoactive species of cannabis can feel very different in the body and brain but the fact that you can be discerning down to the level of Latin names might not have anything to do with human husbandry. The same molecular clock method of genetic analysis shows that indica and sativa diverged more than 1 million years ago, back when our distant ancestor, homo habilis, was hunting on the plains of Africa.

Chelsea Whyte: We’d had tools for about 1.5 million years at that point. That’s what homo habilis was known for, but we haven’t found any evidence for those long ago ancestors consuming cannabis in any way, nor is there evidence that cannabis had particularly high levels of THC at the time, so while it’s fun to wonder if there were Stone Age stoners, there’s no actual sign of it.

Christie Taylor: What we do find is evidence of human cultivation 12,000 years ago in East Asia, by people who seemed to use the plant for ordinary household needs. Oil, rope, bow strings. We know this because while the original wild strain we started with may be extinct, it’s closest living relative seems to be in Northwest China and the genomic record matches the archaeological. There’s pottery that’s been marked by hemp cords dating from the same millennium, for example, and once we began to cultivate cannabis, it spread, and spread, and spread.

Chelsea Whyte: It’s almost clichÃ© at this point to say there’s a reason it’s called weed because it flourishes in a wide variety of conditions and doesn’t need too much tending. Whenever groups of people exchanged goods with others, cannabis went too. Farmers, trade, conquest, you name it.

Christie Taylor: It started about 5,000 years ago when the Yamnaya people migrated from the Eurasian Steppe and brought cannabis to parts of Europe and the Middle East. A thousand years later, pot entered Korea through trade with China, and South Asia via Indo-Aryan peoples migrating from central Asia.

Chelsea Whyte: Around 2000 BC, the western Eurasian Steppe was home to a nomadic people called the Scythians, and they carried it on horseback from the Middle East to what is now Russia and Ukraine.

Christie Taylor: Germanic tribes took it west to Britain as the Anglo-Saxons conquered. It was in Northern Africa by 1400 AD and spread from there to the southern tip, and then, as European colonialism so well facilitated, cannabis crossed the Atlantic and spread across North and South America. We’ll talk more in a future episode about the current state of medical uses of cannabis and what we know about them. At the moment, the earliest evidence of therapeutic use dates back to a Chinese shaman who was buried with a stash of cannabis sativa in 700 BC, but medical records suggest people have been trying to heal with cannabis for thousands of years, starting 5,000 years ago in the reign of Chinese emperor Shennong. He claimed cannabis could cure a wide range of ailments such as malaria, menstrual problems, and gout, and maybe paradoxically, he prescribed it for absent-mindedness as well. Western doctors weren’t using cannabis until much more recently, the late 19th and early 20th century, when one of Queen Victoria’s doctors used the plant to treat a wide variety of pain-related illnesses, including some of her premenstrual symptoms.



How humans brought cannabis to every corner of the globe

Cannabis originated in East Asia but can now be found growing on every continent except Antarctica - thanks to human trade and cultivation

The drug was even listed in the US Pharmacopeia, the country’s official compendium of medical drug information, but then it was outlawed in 1942, decades into a rising crackdown and prohibition of the plant. We wouldn’t come full circle again until 1996, when California residents passed Proposition 215 and made medical marijuana legal again. So when, you ask, did we start getting stoned? Was it the Stone Age or was it much later? Was there a single moment when early humans inhaled some skunky sativa smoke and realised they felt pretty dope about it?

Chelsea Whyte: The evidence here is pretty spotty but we know that wild cannabis plants have only trace amounts of the psychoactive compounds that get us giddy, including THC and CBD, so researchers have looked for evidence of plants with higher concentrations which we would have had to cultivate specifically.

Christie Taylor: We have a long, long history with this plant but only 4,000 years ago do we start to see the evidence of humans nurturing specific strains for specific purposes, whether for fibre or drugs.

Chelsea Whyte: You can actually see in the way different strains diverge what uses they were bred for. Those bred for fibre have more gene mutations that inhibit the stems from branching out, so they have taller stems and more fibre in the main stem, but the plants that were bred for drug use have mutations supporting more branching, which also means more flowers. Those plants are shorter but they also tend to have more THC.

Christie Taylor: Beyond Emperor Shennong’s medicinal mention 4,500 years ago, the first trace of toking only emerged in 2019 in the mountains of Western China. Researchers exploring ancient tombs found wooden fire pits called braziers with traces of THC at much, much higher concentrations than in wild cannabis. These date back to 500 BC, 2,500 years ago, and they suggest that people at that time were inhaling the potent smoke of a strain of cannabis that they had cultivated specifically for the high, but instead of the joints, pipes or bongs you may be familiar with, these braziers would likely have been filled with red hot pebbles that the cannabis was then put on top of. The smoke from the smouldering plant could then be inhaled. And remember those Scythians marauding through Russia and Ukraine on horseback? The Greek geographer and historian Herodotus, writing in the 5th century AD, describes a ritual that may be the first recorded instance of hotboxing.

Herodotus: ‘They set up three poles leaning together to a point, and cover these over with woollen mats. Then, in the place so enclosed, to the best of their power, they make a pit in the centre beneath the poles and the mats, (TC 00:20:00) and throw red hot stones into it. The Scythians then take the seed of this hemp and, creeping under the mats, they throw it on the red hot stones, and being so thrown, it smoulders and sends forth so much steam that no Greek vapour bath could surpass it. The Scythians howl in their joy at the vapour bath.’

Christie Taylor: So weed has been with us for 12,000 years and we’ve found it at least some level of therapeutic for 4,500 of those years. People have used, and continue to use, it for physical ailments, emotional balm, and a certain mental letting loose, but as the wave of cannabis legalisation in the US and worldwide gathers momentum, what do we actually know about how it affects us, body and brain? Stay tuned for the next episode where we’ll look at what happens to your brain on drugs, and what the past prohibitions on pot have done to limit our knowledge of how it behaves, even as the need for that knowledge is greater than ever.



Why we know so little about cannabis - and why scientists are worried

While research on marijuana has surged in the last 20 years, our understanding of the drug is decades behind that of other substances, like tobacco and alcohol

 As I mentioned earlier, this podcast is part of a massive reporting effort, spanning many months of work from the New Scientist team. You can go to newscientist.com/cannabis to read much, much more about the history of our relationship with weed and what research is starting to reveal. Thanks to Chelsea Whyte, Alexis Wnuk, and Grace Wade for helping me research and write this episode, and to Timothy Revell and Chelsea Whyte for edits. Thanks also to Timothy Revell for his expert voice acting. New York studio production is by Hugo Fonseca, and our audio and sound design is by Ollie Guillou. I’m Christie Taylor. Bye for now.

The great monarch butterfly migration: Mexico

Register now and we will contact you with full tour details soon.

Register for 2025

January 2025 – 6 days

Register now at tours@newscientist.com and we will contact you later this year with full tour details.

Witness one of the world's most astounding wildlife events, the monarch butterfly migration, which occurs each year in the forested Central Highlands of Mexico and features the most delicate of creatures. This all-encompassing itinerary offers extensive time among the butterflies, as well as a chance to enjoy authentic cultural encounters.

Every autumn, tens of millions of monarchs set flight on a remarkable 4000-kilometre journey from the north-eastern US and Canada to their ancestral wintering grounds in the volcanic mountains of central Mexico. The location of their breeding grounds remained a mystery until 1977, and how an infant generation of butterflies finds it anew each year is still unknown.

Experience this magnificent natural wonder for yourself. After an overnight stay in Mexico City, you will transfer to the small town of Angangueo where you will be mesmerised by the millions of monarch butterflies, filling the sky with clouds of orange as they come to rest on the oyamel fir trees at the end of their epic migration to a warmer breeding climate in the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve. Afterwards, you will return to Mexico City via Valle de Bravo and Toluca to enjoy some of the cultural aspects of this region of Mexico.

You will be accompanied by experts throughout, who will be on hand to explain the origins of the migration through a series of talks, walking seminars and fireside chats, covering the following topics:

As Mexican butterfly conservationist Carlos Gottfried said: ""When you stand in a monarch sanctuary, your soul is shaken, and your life is changed.""



DAY 1: MEXICO CITY ARRIVAL

You will begin your tour in Mexico City. On arrival, you will be met and transferred from the airport to your downtown hotel in the trendy Polanco district.

Mexico City is the oldest urban centre in the Western hemisphere. It was founded by the Aztecs in the 14th century, when it was called Tenochtitlán.

Gather this evening for a welcome dinner with your expedition leader, followed by an insightful talk covering the orientation of the wonders that lie ahead.

DAY 2: ANGANGUEO AND EL ROSARIO SANCTUARY

You will depart Mexico City after breakfast and drive into the Central Highlands past vistas of the snowcapped Nevado de Toluca volcano, bound for the small mountain town of Angangueo.

Once a copper and silver mining town, today Angangueo thrives on butterfly tourism and local agriculture. It is important that visitors demonstrate to locals that ecotourism can be a more viable and sustainable source of economic well-being than resource exploitation.

Enjoy a hearty lunch of homemade Mexican fare before making your first foray into the monarch kingdom at El Rosario Butterfly Sanctuary, which is the largest of the monarch sanctuaries in the region, offering the best opportunity to view large numbers of monarchs in one location.

Mexico's sanctuaries are the only place in the world where you can actually hear butterflies' wings beating. Their beauty is so ethereal that many Mexicans still hold the Aztec belief that the souls of the dead are reborn as monarchs.

Drive high into the hills in an open-topped truck; a few butterflies flit about, offering a hint of what awaits ahead. From here, you will mount one of the small Mexican horses provided by the local community, which will be led by your own caballero, allowing you to ascend the trail through the forest to the heart of the monarchs' migration site.

At first glance, it looks as though the trees are covered with rusty autumn leaves. But you soon realise that you are looking at millions of butterflies, covering the oyamel fir trees in a delicate, quivering blanket of black and orange. Though each butterfly weighs less than half an ounce, they mass together in a colony, clinging to the trees in huge clusters to survive the cool winter temperatures. When the sun warms their parchment-thin wings, the monarchs take to the sky in a fluttering cloud of orange – so many that the air hums with their movement.

Return to Angangueo for dinner at your hotel and a fireside chat discussing today's incredible sighting.

DAY 3: ANGANGUEO AND CHINCUA SANCTUARY

Today, you will explore a different sanctuary, Chincua Butterfly Sanctuary, where another magical encounter with the monarchs awaits.

As before, you will ride horses along the established trail most of the way. You will then have to hike in the last section to reach the mariposas.

During your visit, you will learn about the efforts to preserve this fragile forest ecosystem, which is the key to the monarchs' survival. You will also hear about what WWF Mexico is doing, in conjunction with local communities, to protect the butterflies' habitat.

Later this afternoon, you will have time to discover more of the village of Angangueo, known for its magnificent murals celebrating the importance of monarchs to the community.

DAY 4: EL ROSARIO SANCTUARY AND VALLE DE BRAVO

This morning, you will return to El Rosario to observe the butterflies in the early morning light. In contrast to our previous afternoon visit, you can witness the monarchs as they awaken for the day, hoping the sun will shine and warm their wings, prompting lively activity. As the butterflies take flight, you may see them float down to drink nectar from flowers or even alight on an arm or shoulder.

Enjoy lunch in Angangueo before travelling to the Valle de Bravo where you will visit the resort of Avandaro, which means ""dream place"" in the Purépecha language. Set on a lush hillside overlooking the valley, the hotel offers a relaxing setting in which to enjoy the fresh air and panoramic views from your casita, and perhaps a dip in the pool.

DAY 5: VALLE DE BRAVO AND TOLUCA 

Today, enjoy a short hike to the Bridal Veil Waterfall before driving to the nearby resort town of Valle de Bravo on tranquil Lake Avandaro. See white stucco houses with red tile roofs, covered in bougainvillea vines, while brilliant flowers in the Plaza Independencia attract a host of birds.

You will have lunch overlooking the lake. Afterwards, take a walk through the colonial town centre and its busy market.

This afternoon, you will begin your return journey to Mexico City, stopping en route in Toluca, originally a 13th-century Indigenous settlement, to visit Cosmovitral Botanical Garden. The building's interior, which houses 500 plant species from Mexico and around the world, glows with the ethereal light of stained-glass panels created by Tolucan artist Leopoldo Flores.

Say farewell over a classic Mexican feast before returning to the capital this evening for a late check-in at your hotel.

WHAT'S INCLUDED

WHAT ISN'T INCLUDED

PACE AND PHYSICALITY

Visiting the butterfly sanctuaries requires walking through the forest for approximately 3 to 4 miles round-trip, at altitudes that could reach up to 10,660 feet. Because the location of the butterflies within the sanctuaries changes throughout the season and from year to year, exact hiking distances on each departure can vary. At times, the terrain can be rough and rocky, and we may have to traverse uneven ground and step over or around sticks and branches. Uneven, steep inclines may require us to maintain balance as we watch the butterflies. The effects of altitude shouldn't be underestimated. While we rate this trip “moderate”, the physical exertion involved can be considered strenuous for people who are less active.

EL ROSARIO BUTTERFLY SANCTUARY

The entrance to El Rosario Butterfly Sanctuary can only be accessed via a 30-minute, open-bed truck ride over cobblestone roads, which can make for a somewhat bumpy ride and may be considered uncomfortable for travellers with back or neck issues. Once inside the sanctuaries, horses are available to ride uphill to reach the butterfly colonies, but not down.

When riding the horses, you will be led by a local guide through trails that can, at times, be narrow and rugged, so riders must be alert and maintain balance. You should expect to spend 30 to 45 minutes on horseback at a time. Due to the diminutive stature of the local horses, the maximum rider weight each horse can carry is 260 pounds.

Accommodation

Hotel Avandaro

Surrounded by lush forest in the Sierra Madre mountains and surveying a broad valley, this secluded resort offers elegant guest suites with private terraces overlooking landscaped gardens.

Grand Fiesta Americana Hotel

The four-star Grand Fiesta Americana Chapultepec is one of Mexico City's finest hotels, enjoying an ideal location facing the verdant expanse of Chapultepec Park, with proximity to all the buzz of cosmopolitan Mexico City.

Hotel La Margarita

This small hotel near the centre of the historic mining town of Anguangeo provides clean, colorful rooms with modest amenities and is an ideal base for visiting the monarch colonies.

Earth's 'geological thermostat' is too slow to prevent climate change

Rock weathering has helped keep Earth's climate relatively stable for millions of years, but the process isn't fast enough to keep up with human carbon emissions

Reactions between rocks, rain and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have helped to stabilise the climate throughout Earth's history, but they won’t prevent our carbon emissions from causing severe warming, a study of these processes has concluded. However, the findings could help us devise better ways to trap CO2 and slow climate change.

Over a million years on Earth, gas emissions from volcanoes should have nearly tripled the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and ocean. Such an increase in CO2, which is a greenhouse gas, should have led to much higher temperatures. Instead, the climate has remained relatively stable in that time, allowing liquid water to persist and life to flourish.

This stability is largely down to removal of CO2 by the weathering process, says Susan Brantley at Pennsylvania State University. In simple terms, this starts when CO2 gas reacts with rainwater to form carbonic acid, which dissolves rock such as limestone. This rock erosion leads to the production of soluble minerals and bicarbonate – a dissolved form of carbon. These products are then washed into the oceans, where they form carbonate minerals that ultimately lock the carbon away in rock.

Previous studies have found that chemical weathering may speed up in higher temperatures, taking more CO2 out of the atmosphere and thus acting to control the climate, a bit like a thermostat. Brantley and her colleagues wanted to determine if this was true in all conditions.

""If we're going to perturb this system by pumping more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, we should understand how this system works,"" says Brantley.

The team looked at several lab studies that detailed the chemical weathering process and compared these findings with field experiments measuring weathering rates in 45 soils from across the world. It has been difficult to reconcile lab data with that from the field, says Brantley, because lab studies can’t accurately replicate weathering processes that take thousands of years in the real world.

Combining all this data, the researchers were able to determine that chemical weathering is only particularly temperature-sensitive in areas with high rainfall and high rates of rock erosion due to this rainfall. This means natural rock weathering is too slow to counteract the very large amounts of CO2 being released by human activities.

However, some scientists have proposed efforts to slow down climate change by mining and grinding rock and laying it out on crop fields so that extra weathering occurs. The results suggest this idea, called enhanced rock weathering, may not be so outlandish. ""To make it work in a big enough way you would have to mine a lot of rock and spread it over a very large area and make sure it's in an area with high rainfall,"" says Brantley. ""But it might be one of the processes we use to slow down climate change.""

Questions over the temperature sensitivity of weathering are important because they will help us understand past climates and what the climate may look like in the future, says Michael Bickle at the University of Cambridge. ""This paper makes an important conceptual advance.""

This study is a big deal, says Penny King at the Australian National University in Canberra. ""We now have a new idea that can be tested to explain weathering and this can help us with our goal to trap carbon dioxide in stable minerals,"" she says.

Unstable atmospheric conditions that are ripe for thunderstorms and sometimes tornadoes have increased across the northern hemisphere in the past 40 years. The finding is one of the best indications yet that strong storms are getting more frequent, as climate models predict - but this might not necessarily mean there will be more tornadoes.

""It favours more occurrence of severe storms such as tornadoes,"" says study author Aiguo Dai of the University at Albany in New York. ""But the actual formation…

River restoration could help bring beavers back to Somerset



By Jason Arunn Murugesu and David Stock

A novel technique to restore a river to its original state prior to any human intervention - known as stage zero - has been used for the first time at a large scale in the UK.

The method involves completely removing the channel that a river runs through and letting it reconnect to its floodplain, which it may have been historically separated from to make space for roads and railways.

""In the UK, we've sadly lost over 90 per cent of our wetland habitat,"" said Ben Eardley at the National Trust in a press release.

The conservation charity has completed a three-year project in Somerset to restore a section of the river Aller using the stage zero technique.

The team members did this by filling in a 1.2-kilometre stretch of the river that had historically been artificially deepened and straightened. They moved 4000 tonnes of earth to fill the channel and placed 700 tonnes of fallen timber onto the site to manipulate water flow and provide new habitats in the water body.

The team also sowed wildflower seeds such as wild carrot to attract pollinators to the site. ""It's very abundant in insects, crickets, butterflies, dragonflies and birds [now],"" says Eardley.

Most rivers aren't given the room they need, he explains, but this one has now spread across multiple channels. ""We've let the river reconnect with the surrounding landscape,"" he says.

""This wetland will also hold more water during floods or drought, ensuring it's better able to cope with extreme weather events or changes in climate, helping local communities and protecting farm businesses,"" says Eardley. ""It will also help improve the quality of the water by capturing and filtering the water as it runs through the landscape.""

Spot tests have shown that the water quality is already increasing only four weeks after restoration, he says, adding that the new soil environment should also sequester more carbon.

Another project in the Holnicote Estate is the reintroduction of beavers. If the project continues to be a success, it is hoped that the restored river could provide a suitable habitat for them.

Unfortunately, the stage zero technique isn’t particularly scalable in the UK right now. ""Landscape scale restoration isn’t very easy to do at the moment in the UK because the regulatory and funding frameworks just aren't there yet,"" he says. ""But I was with this project""¦ we've learned a lot, and hopefully we can pass that learning and knowledge on and make it easier for projects like this in the future.""

Why cannabis smells like skunk - and how that could soon change

Researchers recently identified the chemical source of marijuana's distinctive scent. The finding could help lead to less pungent pot or strains with new flavours

By Jeremy Hsu

Love it or loathe it, marijuana's scent is certainly distinct. Just ask the professional tennis players at the 2023 US Open who voiced discomfort about the pungent pot miasma drifting into outdoor courts from a nearby park in Queens, New York. Alexander Sverev described one court to the Associated Press as smelling ""like Snoop Dogg's living room"".

The whiff of weed has become increasingly familiar across much of the US following a wave of state-level legalisation. In Santa Barbara county, California - home to more licensed cannabis growers than any other county in the state - residents and business owners have intensified complaints about the associated stench in recent years. So what is it that actually gives marijuana its smell?

Scientists had long assumed that weed's dominant odours mainly involve naturally occurring chemical compounds called terpenes, which also play a role in the psychoactive and medicinal properties of marijuana. But these form the underlying canvas for a cannabis strain's overall odour rather than providing the most unique and standout smells.

Two independent research groups recently discovered a different type of chemical playing the starring role in marijuana's distinctly skunky scent - volatile sulphur compounds known as thiols that contain a molecule called 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl (321MBT).

""Growers might have this issue of stinking up the town, or if you have some cannabis and you’re in an apartment next to your neighbour they might be able to smell it,"" says Iain Oswald at Abstrax Tech, a cannabis research and development company in California. ""It is these thiols for sure that are off-gassing from the flower itself.""

The same 321MBT molecule is responsible for the skunky smell that occurs in beer packaged in clear bottles after it has been exposed to sunlight, says Don Wright at Don Wright & Associates, an odour monitoring and control consultancy in Texas. He also cited the molecule's contribution to the characteristic smell of musky spray from mammalian skunks, which they produce when threatened.

Wright and his colleagues discovered 321MBT's role by focusing on the smallest possible group of chemicals that matched the odour characteristic of downwind smells for cannabis while still being detectable to the human nose at greater distances. He explained how the molecule was previously overlooked because it exists at very low concentrations compared with other chemicals such as terpenes.

""Historically, odour problem investigations have looked at the biggest players - the highest concentration compounds,"" says Wright. ""But it’s the rule rather than the exception that the problems are carried in the very trace-level compounds buried in this overwhelming forest.""

Meanwhile, Oswald and his colleagues performed a more data-intensive analysis of the many chemical compounds that contribute to different scent profiles in cannabis. This approach similarly identified 321MBT as the main culprit behind the ""straight skunky smell"" of popular cannabis strains such as OG Kush - and the researchers used an indoor greenhouse experiment to show that the concentrations of volatile sulphur compounds containing 321MBT increase significantly during the last flowering stage for cannabis plants.

But other chemicals present in similarly low concentrations can create different aroma arrangements in cannabis. Oswald's group identified ""tropical"" volatile sulphur compounds that combine with the skunky smell to provide a sweeter scent for cannabis strains such as Tangie Mimosa and Papaya Peach. The researchers also highlighted the chemical compound skatole - most infamously found in human faeces - as helping to create a ""savoury garlic note"" for some cannabis strains when mixed with the skunky odour.

The science of cannabis

As the use of marijuana and its compounds rises around the world, New Scientist explores the latest research on the medical potential of cannabis, how it is grown and its environmental impact, the way cannabis affects our bodies and minds and what the marijuana of the future will look like.

As the use of marijuana and its compounds rises around the world, New Scientist explores the latest research on the medical potential of cannabis, how it is grown and its environmental impact, the way cannabis affects our bodies and minds and what the marijuana of the future will look like.

""Many people would probably say they don’t like it,"" says Oswald. ""But people who consume cannabis are""¦ looking for the most potent of whatever aroma it is.""

Oswald and Abstrax Tech hope to help the cannabis industry use the latest science of smell to selectively breed cannabis strains for specific odour profiles. Growers could also potentially breed out the skunkiest odours that are the source of some communities' complaints about cannabis, says Wright.

At Byers Scientific, an air quality equipment manufacturer and research firm in Indiana, William Vizuete has already helped his company to engineer filtration equipment that captures skunky scents before they leave the site of cannabis farms. But as one of Wright's research colleagues, he sees much more work to be done regarding the origins of various cannabis scents.

""I would not be surprised, given the hundreds of strains that are out there, that there would be more molecules out there being emitted that we have not yet identified,"" says Vizuete.

Huge fall in inspections meant to prevent illegal use of English water

The number of onsite inspections at waterways in England has fallen sharply, with experts expressing concern about the rise of ""office-based"" checks

UK government inspections designed to prevent the illegal extraction of water from natural sources in England have almost halved since their peak in 2015/2016, New Scientist can reveal, in part due to a shift to ""office-based” checks because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Water firms use natural sources such as rivers and ground water to supply the general public, while farmers and other businesses such as golf clubs can also extract water directly for irrigation. This use of water, also known as abstraction, can harm the environment, for instance by putting fish at risk by reducing river flow, says James Overington at Wildfish, an environmental charity.

Because of this, any business in England that extracts more than 20,000 litres of water a day from a water body requires a licence from the Environment Agency (EA). The latest available figures suggest that there are over 18,000 abstraction licences in England as of 2018.

Despite licensing, around 15 per cent of all rivers and 27 per cent of all groundwater sources in England are considered to be over-abstracted, according to the EA.

Tackling this requires a rigorous inspection system, says Overington. But a freedom of information request by New Scientist has revealed that the current inspection regime is anything but rigorous.

According to figures for the past decade released by the EA, the number of onsite abstraction inspections it conducts has fallen from a high of 4904 in the 2015/2016 financial year to less than half that in 2022/2023, with just 2303 inspections.

Licence holders are required to report the amount of water they take from a source, with onsite inspections verifying those figures. A worker at the EA, who wishes to remain anonymous, says the cutbacks in onsite inspections pose a significant risk to England's water bodies.

!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();

""Due to a reduction in resources and a shift in priorities, the EA has significantly scaled back its inspection programme of water abstractions,"" they say. ""This has the potential for companies to exceed their licensed quantities without proper scrutiny.

""That's why onsite inspections are so crucial. This behaviour is often going unpunished and can cause significant damage to our precious water habitats.""

The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns are partly responsible for the fall in inspections, with just 431 onsite visits in 2020/2021. During this time, the EA began using ""office-based"" inspections to monitor abstraction levels, conducting 1290 during 2020/21. The EA says that these inspections are only used for sites with a low environmental risk and for licence holders with a good history of compliance.

Sewage crisis: The truth about British rivers and how to clean them up

""I'm very concerned by figures that show a decline in inspections and a tendency to replace in-the-field inspections with desk work,"" says Charles Rangeley-Wilson, who is the chair of England's chalk stream restoration group. ""If anything has shown the need for presence in the field, it has surely been the sewage crisis, which has reached crisis point partly for lack of inspections.""

""Our environment deserves to be properly protected and the EA must be given and must deploy the resources it needs to do that effectively and fairly,"" he says.

""Inspections are not our only way of assessing the impact of abstraction on the environment: we have a network of river gauging, groundwater level and ecological monitoring that we use to monitor the impact of abstraction on catchments,"" says an EA spokesperson.

""We take a risk-based approach, prioritising this work during drought and prolonged dry weather when illegal abstraction will have the greatest impact on the environment. More widely, we are strengthening the way we regulate, embedding a new approach to drive better performance from the water industry, with additional specialist officers and new data tools to provide better intelligence.""

There are so many science podcasts out there that choosing one can feel overwhelming. We've scoured the internet for classics and little-known gems covering a wide range of topics from space to food to cybercrime. Here are our top picks.

Science Vs

Should you switch to a gluten-free diet? Is artificial intelligence really out of control? This podcast digs into trends and hot topics in the news to expose the science behind them, separating fact from fiction. In a typical episode, science journalist Wendy Zukerman, the creator and host, talks to scientists and experts and cites research in the field in a style that is upbeat and engaging. The idea for the show came about in 2015 when actor Gwenyth Paltrow suggested that women should steam their vaginas for an energy boost, to rebalance hormones and keep clean. Zukerman felt compelled to bust the myth and has been fact-checking fads on her show ever since.

RadioLab

You've probably heard of RadioLab. Launched in 2002, the award-winning podcast, currently co-hosted by science journalists Lulu Miller and Latif Nasser, recounts a different science or technology-related story every week, often exploring different angles. The show incorporates interviews with experts and first-person accounts by guests into captivating narratives. Recent episodes have delved into a strange internet law that lets tech companies off the hook for what happens on their platforms, the cause of the mysterious Tunguska impact that hit Siberia in 1908 and whether disabled people could actually be the ideal astronauts. Highly recommended for curious people with diverse interests.

Houston We Have A Podcast

It might just be the best podcast name out there. With weekly episodes, the official podcast of NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas features in-depth conversations with astronauts, scientists and engineers about the latest developments in human spaceflight. The show just celebrated its 300th episode with special guests talking about what the future holds for humans visiting low-Earth orbit, recorded in front of a live audience. Previously, the show has discussed NASA's near-term goal to establish a sustainable human presence on the moon's surface. It often focuses on different aspects of this plan, such as new lunar spacesuits and the first space station to orbit the moon being developed by NASA, called Gateway, which is aiming to support long-term human visits as well as deep space exploration. Each instalment is typically about an hour long, allowing for topics to be covered in detail.

Ologies

Want to take a deep dive into a specific branch of science? The podcast's name stems from the suffix ""˜ology' - the study of something - and consists of long chats between host Alie Ward and experts on diverse and often obscure disciplines, from sciuridology (the study of squirrels) to diabetology (the research and treatment of diabetes). Ward poses questions that bring out little-known aspects of each field while also touching on personal aspects, such as how guests chose their speciality, which often leads to interesting stories.  The idea for the podcast was sparked by the word curiology - writing with pictures. Ward recently dedicated two episodes to this field by delving into emojis, from the origin of the smiley face to behind-the-scenes drama and stats on usage and trends. I give it a thumbs-up.

Inherited

A generation of young people is now grappling with the climate crisis - often considered to be the most pressing problem humanity is currently facing. This podcast, which is in its third season, is produced by and for young people and aims to bring their stories to light. While early episodes focused on the experiences of young climate activists, the show is now broader in scope. In the latest episode, storyteller Reece Whatmore imagines a world in which buildings are conceived in collaboration with nature, rather than having human-made materials dominate city landscapes, and talks to biomaterial designers, scientists and engineers who are working to accomplish this goal. By being solution-focused, Inherited tackles a daunting topic in a hopeful way.

Gastropod

Food collides with science and history in this bi-weekly podcast co-hosted by journalist Cynthia Graber and author Nicola Twilley. In the most recent episode, the pair examines where fungi and bacteria in a sourdough starter come from by taking part in an experiment in Belgium with microbiologists and bakers. The show also delves into farming, for example by looking at how human faeces could save agriculture and the planet, and new developments, such as lab-grown meat, which made its debut in a US restaurant in July. The show often takes inspiration from listener requests and is sure to fascinate inquisitive food-lovers.

The ReWild Podcast

Efforts to undo human-induced damage to wildlife by allowing nature to take over again, called rewilding, have taken off in in recent years. In this podcast hosted by James Shooter, a photographer and filmmaker, listeners are taken behind the scenes of various rewilding initiatives across Europe as he travels to visit them during a year-long trip. Monthly episodes tell the stories of people trying to recover nature, for example experts in the Greater CÃ´a Valley in Portugal, who are trying to improve the co-existence of animal species such as rabbits, Iberian wolves and dung beetles. The host's passion for conservation makes the show both informative and engaging.

Sawbones: A Marital Tour of Misguided Medicine

Through the ages, people have often tried to treat medical problems in odd, disgusting or simply ineffective ways. Hosts Sydnee and Justin McElroy, a doctor and comedian, respectively, were therefore inspired to create a podcast that uncovered some of these proposed treatments by digging through the annals of medical history. With new episodes out every Friday, the show also looks at the latest therapeutic fads, such as a pungent plant resin, called asafoetida, which some claim can has a range of medical benefits, and an egg-shaped sound-therapy chamber called a Harmonic Egg. The latest instalment examines the sudden recent uptick of cases of leprosy in Florida, looking at the history of the disease and current treatments. May not be suitable for squeamish people.

Darknet Diaries

A true crime show for tech geeks. Hosted by Jack Rhysider, who was previously a network security engineer, the podcast showcases stories about the dark side of the internet told by hackers and those who have been hacked. In a recent episode, a member of the Dominican Republic's cybersecurity incident response team explains the process he went through when he investigated a major cyberattack aimed at his country's government. Another instalment follows a man who breaks into buildings for a living to test whether they are secure or not. The show is compelling and binge-worthy.

New Scientist Podcasts

It is shameless self-promotion, but you may just enjoy our podcasts too. New Scientist Weekly, our flagship show hosted by Timothy Revell and Christie Taylor, takes a closer look at the most fascinating science news stories of the week. If you're looking for something a bit more off-beat, Dead Planets Society explores crazy ideas such how we could punch a hole in a planet or whether we could destroy the sun - from a physics perspective, of course. And we've also got CultureLab, a podcast that could be interviewing the world's most exciting authors about fascinating books one week and delving into the science behind a movie or TV show another. All available on the main New Scientist Podcasts feed.

UK river pollution monitoring is 50 years out of date, say researchers

Levels of pollutants in the UK's rivers are tested by random sampling, a method that experts say is decades out of date and not thorough enough to tackle the issues facing the waterways

The monitoring of UK rivers hasn’t been updated since the 1970s and gives just a snapshot of the state of water quality, hampering efforts to clean it up.

The UK's four nations have similar methods when it comes to monitoring rivers. In England, for example, the Environment Agency (EA) collects water samples once a month to measure levels of pollutants such as phosphates and nitrates. These can lead to a reduction in oxygen in the water that suffocates aquatic animals and plants.

Out of the UK's nearly 1500 rivers, samples are collected at more than 1000 fixed sites, usually in the middle of the week between 9am and 4pm, says Pete Lloyd, a former EA official. This doesn’t give an accurate picture and may “only reflect the condition of the river for a few minutes"", he says.

Most pollutants enter rivers after it has rained, either by running off farmland or when raw sewage is diverted away from sewer networks so they don’t overfill and back up into homes, says Lloyd. With the current sampling methods, which have been in place since the 1970s, it is a coincidence if the data collection happens after it has rained.

""I understand why we monitored rivers this way 50 years ago – we didn't know what actually caused problems for rivers, so random sampling sounds like a good idea,"" says Lloyd. ""But now we know the problems, why aren't we more targeted with our monitoring? The system is decades out of date.""

According to Penny Johnes at the University of Bristol, UK, this inadequate sampling means our knowledge of UK rivers has ""absolutely colossal"" uncertainties. In 2007, she looked at 39 years' worth of daily data on the rivers' total phosphorus concentrations, defined as a measure of the pollutant in all forms. High total phosphorus can lead to algal blooms, which can deplete water oxygen levels, block sunlight and release harmful toxins.

To mimic the EA's sampling, Johnes analysed data collected from different rivers on the same date each month, comparing this with the original dataset. She found that only looking at water quality once a month misses important information about when phosphorus concentrations change. ""The way in which we monitor rivers is highly variable in time and space,"" says Johnes. ""It's not fit for purpose and hasn't been for a long time.""

While Johnes looked at total phosphorus, the UK's regulatory bodies don’t routinely monitor for this in rivers, despite the government wanting to cut its runoff from farms into water bodies by at least 40 per cent by 2038. The EA, for example, only monitors rivers for reactive phosphorus, a soluble form, which a spokesperson says is the type most readily taken up by plants and algae. But Johnes says non-dissolved phosphorus that runs off from farms makes up two-thirds of the pollutant in UK rivers.

The bodies also don’t regularly monitor rivers for some of the chemicals in consumer goods and pharmaceuticals, says Johnes. The EA spokesperson says it screens for more than 1600 chemicals, but Johnes says thousands of newly synthesised chemicals could still be running into rivers unmonitored.

Speaking on behalf of all of the UK's regulatory bodies, the EA spokesperson says they are working with the pharmaceutical industry and research bodies to set up a working group that screens for pharmaceuticals in sewage discharge.

According to Johnes and Lloyd, the solution to the river-monitoring uncertainties is to introduce more-intensive water quality checks and to be more targeted with when samples are collected. ""If you want to find out how agriculture is affecting a river, then you need to collect samples after rainfall,"" says Lloyd. ""If you want to find out how sewage is affecting a river, then you need to collect samples near a sewage overflow after rainfall,"" he says.

Much of this could be done via electronic sensors that fit into riverbanks and automatically record pollutant levels, says Johnes. Some of these are already in place, but more are needed, with more rigorous analysis of their data, she says.

The recent uproar around sewage dumping in UK rivers, a problem that has probably been around for years before becoming a popular issue, is a good example of how inadequate water quality monitoring has let the public down, says Lloyd.

This changed when Peter Hammond, a former maths professor, lodged a freedom of information request that found untreated sewage had been dumped 240 times into the Windrush river in England over the past three years. He then sent dozens of similar requests to water firms around the country, revealing the scale of the problem. ""Our monitoring system never picked it up,"" says Lloyd. ""If it had, maybe we could have done something about it by now.""

Red imported fire ants with painful bites have taken hold in Europe

Already a serious invasive species in the US and Australia, red imported fire ant nests have now been found in Sicily, Italy, and they could spread to other parts of Europe

Red imported fire ants are an invasive species in many parts of the world

Clarence Holmes Wildlife/Alamy

Dozens of red imported fire ant nests have been found in Sicily, Italy - a sign that the invasive insects have become established in Europe.

The red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) is a venomous species that originally comes from South America. Since it was first described by science in 1916, the species has spread around the world, including to Australia, China and the US, primarily due to imports of soil and plants from its native region to other countries.

""It’s considered one of the worst invasive species,"" says Mattia Menchetti at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona, Spain. For people, red fire ant bites can be extremely painful due to their venom, which some people may even be allergic to, he says.

Red fire ants also pose a threat to nature by preying on other species, such as birds and reptiles, and displacing native ant species.

Local reports of painful ant stings from around the coastal city of Syracuse on the island of Sicily have been circulating for a few years, says Menchetti.

He and his colleagues went to collect samples of the culprits and quickly identified them as S. invicta. The team found a total of 88 red imported fire ant nests spread over 4.7 hectares in the area.

DNA from these ants was found to be most similar to red imported fires ants in China and the US - a clue that the now established Sicily population may have come from either of those countries.

Invasive species are now a major threat to wildlife, farms and people

According to the team's models, the ants could spread to 7 per cent of Europe under current environmental conditions, although climate change could increase their range further. They are most likely to spread to warm, well-connected regions, such as coastal Mediterranean cities. But urban areas across the continent, including Paris and London, may be suitable for the species to thrive due to their many heat sources, such as buildings.

Menchetti's team is working with authorities to continue monitoring the region and to establish the extent of the population, which will guide eradication plans.

17 September 2024 - 10 days for £3,599

Immerse yourself in the Inca civilisation’s most important archaeological sites, including Machu Picchu as you discover how the story of the Incas is so much more than Machu Picchu. Explore the science and history while exploring the beautiful Sacred Valley. With the opportunity to extend your time in Peru and explore the mysterious Nazca lines. 

Full of mystery and culture dating back millennia, Peru is an stunning land of deserts etched with ancient geoglyphs, soaring peaks harbouring secret cities and stunning landscapes. From the fertile verdant valley floor and wetlands, through cloud forests and onto the imposing mountains that overlook the Sacred Valley. 

Begin in Cusco, the historic heartland and former capital of the Inca Empire. Spend time exploring the museums, archaeological remains and beautiful Spanish architecture. From here, travel through the spectacular landscapes of the Sacred Valley, with time spent exploring local communities and other ancient inca sites. You will then have two visits to explore Machu Picchu, with plenty of time at leisure built-in to allow you to immerse yourself in these remarkable ancient ruins. Continue to the lesser-known but equally impressive ruins of Waqrapukara, with its spectacular monumental structures unhindered by staff, fencing or other visitors. You can literally explore the whole site unfettered.

Get to the heart of how Hiram Bingham ""discovered"" Machu Picchu and several other sites just over 100 years ago. Accompanied throughout by Peter Getzels - Emmy award-winning director, producer and cinematographer plus anthropologist, explorer and mountaineer. Plus, Dr Jean-Jacques Decoster, Professor of Anthropology at the Universidad Nacional San Antonio Abad del Cusco.

For those wishing to examine this fascinating culture further, we have created a pre-tour extension to the Nazca lines. These geoglyphs cover an area of about 450 kilometres squared and were scratched on the surface of the ground between 500 B.C. and A.D. 500. They are among archaeology's greatest enigmas because of their quantity, nature, size and continuity.

In partnership with Intrepid Travel. 

DAY 1: ARRIVE INTO CUSCO

Please note: you have to fly via Lima to get to Cusco, as such, we have included this flight from Lima to Cusco in the main tour price. If you wanted to spend a few days in Lima at your own leisure, or join our pre-tour extension visiting the Nazca lines and Ballestas Islands or arrive in Cusco a few days earlier to allow yourself time to acclimatise, all these options are possible. Please speak to the team at Intrepid Travel who can help with these arrangements. 

You will be met at the airport by your tour leader and transferred to the Ruinas boutique hotel, your base for the next four nights, located just 10 minutes away from Cusco’s historic main square. Cusco is the historic heartland and former capital of the Inca Empire. The city itself is one of South America's oldest continuously inhabited cities and was the home of the Inca Empire for two centuries before the Spanish built their first capital here. Today, Cusco is a fascinating combination of both cultures. 

This unique expedition through Peru offers an insightful anthropological and archaeological experience. You will learn how the Incas developed a complex society and used their extensive grasp of science and technology to expand rapidly. They displayed a mastery of stone-cutting, astronomy and mathematics as they created buildings for living and worshipping, and their irrigation, aqueducts and precision control of water supported their high-altitude farming on steep slopes. In addition, explore how the Incas arranged their religious sites, called Huacas, along a system of astronomically and calendrically informed lines, called Ceques, with the city of Cusco, as the sort of centre of this massive “calendar on the ground”. In turn, this “calendar on the ground” affected the location of their towns, ceremonies, the social interactions of their elite groups, and their highly advanced architecture.

In the evening, you will meet your fellow guests and accompanying expert Jean-Jacques Decoster for a welcome meal at the hotel restaurant. To help you acclimatise to the altitude, there will be no talks until tomorrow.

DAY 2: EXPLORE CUSCO INCLUDING THE CASA CONCHA MUSEUM AND QORICANCHA TEMPLE

After breakfast, you will meet with the group in the hotel for a 90 minute talk with Peter Getzels and Jean-Jacques Decoster, both experts will join the group for today's activities and lunch. 

Later on, you will explore the highlights of the city of Cusco. You will take a short visit of the museum of the Palace of the Archbishop, a colonial house built on the foundation of the Inca Roca Palace and formerly owned by the Archbishop of Cusco. Today it houses a collection of colonial religious paintings. The museum is in a narrow pedestrian walkway that features Inca stone walls. Here you’ll see the famous stone of the twelve angles on Hatun Rumilloc Street.

Afterwards, visit the Qoricancha temple, considered the most sacred Inca building. According to archaeologists it housed over 1000 priests and attendants. It was built over an Inca palace dedicated to the worship of the Sun. Continue to the heart of the city, “the Plaza de Armas”, surrounded by colonial arcades and four churches. Here you’ll visit the beautiful “Cathedral” of Cusco, built in the XVI. This enormous Cathedral was built in the XVI. It contained nearly 400 colonial paintings, including many from the Cusco School, which was prominent in the 17th century. The cathedral is a fine example of colonial baroque art. Visit the Coca Museum and learn about the Inca's Sacred Leaf.

You’ll also visit the Casa Concha museum, home of the largest collection of Machu Picchu artefacts in the world, which were returned by Yale University in 2011.

Lunch will be included at Nuna Raymi, a sustainable restaurant whose philosophy is to support and work with local producers and organic products. 

The remainder of the day will be free to continue discovering this beautiful city.

DAY 3: SACSAYHUAMAN, QENQO, TAMBOMACHAY AND THE PLANETARIUM OF CUSCO

This morning, you will visit the huge Inca ceremonial structure Sacsayhuaman that overlooks the city of Cusco. Its construction is complex and precise with megalithic rocks perfectly fitted together without the aid of mortar. The site has the characteristics of a fortress, but also contains temple-like structures, and may have served for astronomical observations, typical of Inca sites that tend to combine those functions. 

You will then continue to the Inca site known as Qenqo with its subterranean passages and carved stone channels in a zigzag pattern. In its inner section, there is a carved stone table, which may have been used for Inca rituals. 

Afterwards, you will travel the short distance to Tambomachay, a beautiful archaeological site, consisting of aqueducts, canals and waterfalls. The high quality of the stonework indicates that it was likely to have been an important Inca shrine, dedicated to religious functions involving water veneration. Although its function is uncertain, it may also have been a military outpost or ancient spa, as indicated by findings that show a high degree of water control.

A box lunch will be provided today.

In the evening, you will head to the Planetarium of Cusco. Here you will explore Quechua and Inca astronomy and the relationship between Andean people and the universe. The Incas had a complex cosmological system, and along with that you will learn about Quechua cosmological ideas, about the dark areas of the Milky Way, (called the dark-cloud constellations) and how they are just as important as the bright constellations. Then you will be treated to a virtual projection of the southern hemisphere stars and constellations in the planetarium dome. The experience concludes outside, where (weather permitting) there will be guided stargazing using the centre's telescopes. 

DAY 4: TIPON AND PIKILLAQTA

Today, you will visit the valley to the south of Cusco, well away from the tourist haunts. Your first stop is the Inca complex of Tipon, a royal estate with an elaborate set of terraces, stone-lined canals and fountains. Its design makes it both an agricultural and hydrological masterpiece.

You will then drive through Oropesa (the bread capital of Peru), on to Pikillaqta, one of the few existing pre-Inca ruins in the Cusco area. This adobe complex was built around 700 to 900 years AD by the Wari Culture. Nearby, you will see Rumicolca. Current theory suggests that this huge structure was originally built as a Wari aqueduct to supply water to Pikillaqta, and was then reinforced with Inca stonework, because it is located on one of the main south-north Inca roads that crisscross the Andes.

After lunch at a local restaurant, you will return to Cusco for an afternoon of leisure time.

DAY 5: THE SACRED VALLEY INCLUDING MARAS SALT PONDS, MORAY AND CHINCHERO

After breakfast, you will travel up the Sacred Valley and visit some of its most scenic spots accompanied again by Dr Jean-Jacques Decoster. First, a private guided trip to the ancient Maras salt ponds, where salty springs emerge from the hillside and the Incas built pools to capture the flows and harvest salt. Those are still being used by inhabitants of the communities of Maras and Pichingoto. As a heritage expert, Jean-Jacques has worked on the proposed nomination of the salt ponds as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and will be on hand to discuss the process. 

You will continue to Moray, where huge circular agricultural terraces were built by the Incas on limestone sinks that served to plant various crops. It is thought that the Incas used the terraces as an agricultural laboratory to determine the optimum conditions for each species, testing varying altitudes and soil conditions.

Lunch will be at the Umasbamba community, where you’ll learn about local food, traditions and herbal medicine. If time permits, you will enjoy the sunset from high up over Chinchero.

After lunch, you will head to the small rustic town of Chinchero, which is missed by many but has a great display of Inca architecture, ruins and megalithic art carved into rocks. Chinchero is home to Andean weaving and has a colourful market. You will visit its ruins, where it is thought that Inca Tupac Yupanqui, heir of Pachacutec, used Chinchero as a sort of country resort. He ordered the construction of many aqueducts and terraces, many of them still in use today. 

The cultural landscape and spectacular viewshed of Chinchero are being rapidly transformed by the ongoing construction of the future international airport for Cusco. Jean-Jacques is currently involved in a study of the impact on the cultural heritage of the new airport and will be able to reflect with you on this topic. 

Then check into the Inti Punku Sacred Valley Hotel, where you will enjoy an evening meal together.

DAY 6: THE SACRED VALLEY INCLUDING PISAC, THE INKARIY MUSEUM AND OLLANTAYTAMBO

After checking out of your hotel, you will travel further into the Sacred Valley. The valley was a key settlement area for the Incas, because its combination of agreeable climate and fertile plains was unusual for the high Andes. Here, the Incas sculpted the mountain flanks with vast contour terracing and irrigation channels, and there will be plenty of opportunities to stop and photograph these. Pisac, in particular, has great examples of these plus fine stone works allowing it to also act as a mountainside fortress defending the southern approach to Machu Picchu.

Afterwards, you’ll visit the Inkariy Museum, which uses artistic representations to explain eight Peruvian civilisations, from the Caral to the Quechuas. Here you will discuss with Peter and Jean-Jacques questions of representation and folklore and how that impacts the understanding and contemporary use of ancient cultures, ethnography and archaeology.

After lunch at the Tunupa Sacred Valley Restaurant, you’ll drive along the Urubamba River towards the town of Ollantaytambo, which has some of the oldest continuously occupied dwellings in Peru and was one of the few places where the Incas defeated the Spanish. The ruins of Ollantaytambo include temples, terraces, storehouses and defences. There are also spectacular rock formations that have been the source of much poetic speculation in contemporary times regarding them representing the Inca god Wiracocha.

You will then check into El Albergue, a small but hugely atmospheric hotel inside the train station, where you will have dinner.

DAY 7: EXPLORE MACHU PICCHU

After breakfast, you will step out of the hotel restaurant straight onto the train platform thus avoiding the queuing lines outside the station. You will board the “360° Machu Picchu” train towards Aguas Calientes, a modern little town close to the sanctuary of Machu Picchu. The train ride is a beautiful journey. After passing the Sacred Valley, the train starts to descend gradually along the edge of the Urubamba River, until it finally reaches the cloud forest. After approximately 1 hour 45 minutes you will have arrived in Aguas Calientes town, where you will be taken to the Machu Picchu ruins starting with a short bus ride up the steep, zigzagging road to the impressive Lost City of the Incas. 

This is one of those genuinely magical places, and your first glimpse of these ruins in the mist is something to remember. The site is perched high in the Andes, surrounded by verdant cloud forest, with the river Urubamba running through the gorge far below. Hidden away on a ridge, Machu Picchu is invisible from below, so it's no surprise it remained a secret for so many years (until 1911). 

In the late 1970s, Peter would hike up to Machu Picchu and camp in the grounds. Nowadays access to and around the site is carefully managed to ensure the condition of the site is protected for generations to come. Your ticket grants access to the site for 4 hours and the predetermined routes through the site are carefully planned, so take your time and enjoy it. A local guide plus Jean-Jacques and Peter will take you exploring first the upper terrace, then across the ruins, learning more about the 200 or so structures, houses, warehouses and temples. It's fascinating to be able to gaze down on the city from above and imagine how it would have looked during the height of the Inca empire. 

Then, enjoy lunch at Sanctuary Lodge Hotel, located just outside the site and then catch the shuttle bus into Aguas Calientes town and check into the El Mapi by Inkaterra Hotel. The rest of the day is free to explore this beautiful town and visit the open-air market, filled with displays of local Andean curios and clothing. Dinner will be at the hotel.

Today will be the final day with Jean-Jacques Decoster.

DAY 8: A SECOND VISIT MACHU PICCHU AT DAWN

After an early breakfast, you will take a private shuttle 20 minutes up the mountain to be one of the first to enter Machu Picchu just after 7am. You will be able to explore the site unguided taking one of the defined circuits. These are in place to allow guests to enjoy the site whilst still protecting it for generations to come.

After returning to Aguas Calientes for lunch, you will take the train back to Ollantaytambo and make the rest of the journey to Cusco by coach where you will return to the San Agustin Internacional Hotel.

DAY 9: DISCOVER WAQRAPUKARA

Today, you are completing the tour with a visit to the lesser-known ruins of Waqrapukara. These spectacular monumental structures are perched high in the mountain peaks above the Apurimac River, yet are not yet on the tourist trail and you have complete freedom to roam the site. In 2023, this was the highlight for several of our guests.

The day begins with a pre-dawn pick-up from the hotel at 5am. After stopping for breakfast, you will be transported close to Waqrapukara by vehicle, thus requiring just a short return walk of about 2 hours to this remote site.

During the trek, as you ascend to 4,300 metres high, you will be able to appreciate how the flora and fauna differ from those you saw on the other days. At Waqrapukara, you will enjoy a relaxed guided tour visiting the main square, towers, terraces, enclosures and cave paintings, including representations of llamas. The name Waqrapukara translates roughly as ""horn-shaped fortress"" in Quechua, as the peak of the mountain looks like two horns (or upright Llama ears). 

The site is surrounded by Andean mountain ranges as far as the eye can see and, due to the small number of visitors, it is a place of rare tranquillity. In some parts, it is hard to tell what features are human-made and which are geological, due to the skill of Inca builders in integrating structures to the landscape. There are still many aspects to the site yet to be deciphered by archaeologists, which is why the site is so intriguing.

The trek will be fully accompanied by the tour leader.

Afterwards, you will descend by coach back to Cusco. Then in the evening, there will be a farewell dinner at the Pachapapa restaurant.

DAY 10: FAREWELL TO CUSCO

Your tour comes to an end today and there are no activities planned. At the appropriate time, you’ll be transferred to the airport to take the flight back to Lima, followed by the international flight home.

Please note: As with the start of the tour, you will have to fly via Lima prior to your onward international flight travel. As such, we have included this flight from Cusco to Lima in the main tour price. If you want to spend a few days in Cusco at your own leisure, these options are possible, but the flight from Cusco to Lima is included in the main tour package. Please speak to the team at Intrepid Travel who can help with these arrangements. 

PRE TOUR EXTENSION (supplement cost required)

Nazca lines and Ballestas Islands 

14 September 2024 - 4 days for £899 per person



Before the main Inca tour, we have created a pre-tour extension visiting the Nasca lines and the Ballestas Islands, located in the southwest of Peru.

The Nazca lines are known as geoglyphs which depict a collection of giant trapezoids, and figures of humans, plants and animals in a desert 400 kilometres south of Lima, Peru. They were created between 400 BC and AD 650 by the removal of reddish oxidised stones from the desert pavement to reveal the lighter sand beneath. These ancient, intricate geometric patterns are stamped on the surface have long been thought of as messages to the gods, or as markers that tracked celestial objects. This tour offers a unique chance to view the lines from a spectacular flight over them, allowing you the opportunity to take in their true wonder and expansiveness from above. Afterwards, travel to the Ballestas islands, home to spectacular bird and marine life that rival that of the Galapagos in number. 

DAY 1: ARRIVE INTO LIMA

Upon arrival into Lima airport, you will be transferred to your hotel. 

While Peru's capital officially began life in 1535, when Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro founded the city on the Day of the Three Kings, settlements had been scattered through the valley since before the Incas. The city was built on top of an existing palace and temples that belonged to the local chief who had little choice but to move on. Lima was in its prime during the Spanish colonial days and much of the city's attraction now lies in its well-preserved historical center.

The remainder of your first day will be free to explore this city at leisure. 

No meals are included today.

DAY 2: TRAVEL FROM LIMA TO PARACAS NATIONAL RESERVE. VISIT NAZCA OBSERVATION TOWERS.

After breakfast, depart your hotel and travel south to Paracas National Reserve accompanied by a local guide from the region. The name of this beautiful place is derived from a Quechua word meaning “sand rain” probably due to the strong winds that hit the evenings here. The Paracas National Reserve is also very important since its waters contain abundant quantities of zooplankton and phytoplankton, which support a diverse range of fish and artisanal fisheries. This is a very important activity in the town. The Paracas National Reserve is in an area of 335,000 hectares and is considered one of the most important ecosystems on the planet. During your visit, you will see the beautiful cliffs and beaches along this tour.

From here, travel to the Nazca Lines observation tower, offering your first opportunity to get a glimpse of these incredible geoglyphs. The tower gets you 13 metres off the ground which is enough for you to see the basic outline of three of the Nazca figures. Your photos won’t be as impressive as when you get on the plane, but this is a much more up-close-and-personal way to see the lines. 

Afterwards, you will be transferred to your hotel in Nazca.

DAY 3: FLIGHT OVER THE NAZCA LINES AND ANTONINI MUSEUM

In the morning, you will be transferred to the aerodrome in Maria Reiche to board your small light aircraft which will take you over the Nazca lines. The flight will last around 30 minutes. The Nazca lines are an enigma. Since their discovery, the Nazca lines have inspired fantastic explanations from ancient gods, a landing strip for returning aliens, a celestial calendar created by the ancient civilization, used for rituals probably related to astronomy, or clans who made up the population and to determine through ritual their economic functions held up by reciprocity and redistribution, or a map of underground water supplies. Flying over the area you can marvel looking at the perfect shape of animals, flowers, plants, objects, and anthropomorphic figures of colossal proportions made with well-defined lines.

Afterwards, you will visit the Antonini Museum where you can learn more about Nazca culture and its importance in the history of the Americas. The museum houses a large quantity and diversity of Nasca archaeological materials.

You will then be transferred back to Paracas for your final night in this region.

DAY 4: PARACAS TO BALLESTAS ISLANDS AND ONTO LIMA 

In the morning, you will be transferred to the local harbour. We would suggest that you wear a good jacket or windbreaker as it gets very windy once the boat embarks. You will head towards the Ballestas Islands. Along the way you will see the famous figure known as The Candelabro, an enigmatic design etched on the desert floor hundreds of years ago. 

The Ballestas Islands are a collection of rocky islets, just a few kilometres off the western coast of Peru. These islands are inhabited by an amazing marine life, with over 200 types of migratory and resident birds, including Peruvian Pelicans, Belcher’s gulls, Humboldt penguins, guanay cormorants, red-legged cormorants, Inca terns, Peruvian boobies, turkey vultures, among others. In addition, you will also see around the Islands hundreds of sea lions resting at the beaches, sleeping on the rocks or swimming nearby. The islands also provide shelter to the shy Humboldt penguins which are usually seen at the entrances of small caves near the cliffs. These islands are known as 'Peru's Galapagos'.

After touring around the islands for about 1 hour you will return to the harbour followed by a private transfer back to Lima airport. On arrival, you will be transferred to your hotel to meet with the group and Peter for your tour welcome meeting.

Peter Getzels is an Emmy-winning documentary producer/director who comes to filmmaking as an anthropologist, explorer, and mountaineer. As a Thomas J Watson Fellow and PhD candidate at the LSE, Peter conducted fieldwork among remote Quechua-speaking highlanders in Peru, tracking myths about the return of a messianic figure called Inkarri, which had innuendos in Peruvian politics. His first films took up religious syncretism during the largest pilgrimage in South America, as well as power relations between Quechua and Spanish speakers during rituals on Peruvian Independence Day. As a staff producer for National Geographic, Peter brought his Peruvian knowledge to a film about wide-scale human sacrifice at the Moche pyramids on the northern coast of Peru, where extensive evidence was uncovered by archaeologists. He also helped develop the South American portion of the long-running series called Taboo, about indigenous life and rituals.

Peter has been on three expeditions in the Himalayas, and has scaled nearly every major peak in the Andes, opening new routes for the American Alpine Institute with a number of first ascents. As one of the creators of new climbing and trekking itineraries for the American Alpine Institute’s South American strategy, Peter has guided tours of all the major archeological sites, including ancient Inca trails and sacred roads in the Cuzco region. As a kayaker, he has explored the Amazon and Patagonia on long expeditions. Focusing on stories rooted in anthropology, science and adventure, Peter has made documentaries in Antarctica, Iraq, Cambodia, Solomon Islands, China, Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir, Andaman Islands, Greenland, Guyana and more. 

While working on his PhD in Anthropology, Peter and his partner Harriet Gordon were offered MFA places at the National Film and Television School of England, which launched their careers for British television. They lived in the UK for sixteen years, where Peter was a staff producer in Science at the BBC, and made films with his partner for C4, ZDF, Canal Plus, Discovery and more. For twelve years Peter was a member of the Film Committee of the Royal Anthropological Institute, and an early member of the South American Explorers Club. Recently he became a Fellow at the Explorers Club in New York.

Now based in Washington DC, Peter runs Getzels Gordon, a small production company dedicated in part, to a long-standing philosophy and science series for PBS called Closer to Truth. He holds dual US/UK citizenship. 

Dr Jean-Jacques Decoster is a native of France. After studying Literature in France and Anthropology in the US (MA Virginia; Ph.D. Cornell), he earned a Doctorate in Social Sciences from U. N. M. San Marcos, Lima (Peru) and an MA in Museum Studies (U. Leicester, UK). 

Based in Cusco, Jean-Jacques is Professor of Anthropology at the San Antonio Abad University, where he lectures on Inca History and South American Ethnography. 

From 2012 to 2014, he directed the Machupicchu Museum, and during his tenure there, was responsible for receiving the Hiram Bingham/ Machu Picchu collection from the Yale Peabody Museum. 

Foremost among his current interests are the defence and promotion of cultural heritage in the Andes. At this time, Dr Decoster is involved in a study of the heritage impact of the Chinchero airport, and in an assessment of the Maras Saltpans for the UNESCO list of heritage sites. 

He is a member of ICOMOS, a National Geographic expert and a World Monuments Fund external advisor. 

When not lecturing or leading groups, Jean-Jacques enjoys hiking with his dogs over the Andean mountains, and cooking for friends at his home. 

He also serves as the French Consul in Cusco.

Summer 2022 heatwaves killed 61,000 people in Europe

Last year's summer was the hottest season ever recorded in Europe, and a new estimate shows there were over 61,000 heat-related excess deaths during this period

Over 61,000 people are estimated to have died as a result of the heatwaves that swept across Europe last year, and without efforts to shield the most vulnerable we might see a similar toll this year.

Summer 2022 was the hottest season on record in Europe, with temperatures reaching new extremes around the continent, especially in western and central regions. Europe also saw high levels of excess deaths over this time, but exactly how many were due to the heat was unclear.

""Extreme heat is one of the most deadly natural hazards,"" says Vikki Thompson at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, because it exacerbates pre-existing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.

Joan Ballester at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health in Spain and his colleagues investigated this link by looking at the number of deaths logged by the European statistical office Eurostat for 35 European countries, along with temperature records.

The team found that between 30 May and 4 September last year, 61,672 deaths were related to heat - with the largest numbers in Italy, Spain, Germany and France. After adjusting for population size, the team found that heat-related deaths were disproportionately high in Mediterranean nations including Spain, Italy and Greece.

""Despite the fact that the temperature anomalies were the same in France and in Spain, the mortalities were radically different,"" says Ballester. ""This may be partly due to socioeconomic factors.""

Ballester hopes this study will raise more awareness of the deadly effects of heat. With 2023 already shaping up to be one of the hottest years on record, we might expect similar excess deaths this year, though Ballester declined to make a specific prediction. ""Given the same vulnerability, we can expect a given number of heat-related deaths,"" he says.

""Events like this are likely to become more common and severe, thus preparedness needs to be improved to reduce avoidable deaths, minimise the economic impacts of future heatwaves and shield the most vulnerable from the worst of the effects,"" says Candice Howarth at the London School of Economics, who wasn't involved in the study.

Thompson, who also wasn't involved, expresses a similar opinion. ""Fortunately, impacts of heat on human health can be reduced through education and policy changes. The annual heat-related mortality numbers in this study show that this is already happening – although 2022 was the hottest European summer on record, deaths were lower than in [the heatwave of] 2003,” she says.

Warm seas blamed for the disappearance of 10 billion snow crabs

The population of snow crabs in the Bering Sea has crashed since 2018, probably due to starvation as a result of a marine heatwave

The Bering Sea snow crab population has crashed since 2018

Kondratuk Aleksei/Shutterstock

More than 10 billion snow crabs in the sea off Alaska have disappeared over the past few years. Marine biologists have linked the population crash to a 2018 heatwave which may have led to mass starvation.

Since 2018, the snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) population in the eastern Bering Sea has been rapidly declining. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game cancelled the 2022 snow crab harvest and then this year’s to conserve the remaining population.

Cody Szuwalski at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Washington DC and his colleagues analysed the organisation’s annual surveys of the Bering Sea to uncover the reason behind the disappearance of the crabs.

Between 2018 and 2021, the population fell by 10 billion, or around 90 per cent. ""That's the lowest levels we've ever seen them,"" says Szuwalski.

The beginning of the drastic drop coincided with a marine heatwave in the Bering Sea during 2018 and 2019.

Snow crabs fare best in cold waters, which means as the sea warms up, they expend more energy to regulate their body temperature by moving around. By modelling the crab population and their energy requirements under different conditions, the team found that there wasn't enough food to support this warmer, hungrier population.

""We think that starvation played a big role in the collapse,"" says Szuwalski. ""From 2017 to 2018, the calories they needed quadrupled.""

What's more, the warmer waters may have also increased the species' susceptibility to disease, which may have contributed to the collapse.

Szuwalski says there has been a small uptick in snow crabs in 2022 and 2023, but it will take many years of cooler conditions for the population to recover to its pre-2018 size.

Extreme marine heatwaves are now normal for the world's oceans

The Alaskan snow crab fishery brought in around $150 million a year before the population crash, says Szuwalski. ""That’s a lot of revenue that’s no longer coming through those communities.""

""There have been a number of big population crashes in marine species due to overfishing. We are now witnessing more and more big crashes associated with extreme temperatures,"" says Christopher Harley at the University of British Columbia in Canada. ""We see this with seabirds, intertidal animals, tropical corals and now cold-water snow crabs. The list of species and ecosystems that are strongly impacted just keeps growing.""

There are all sorts of ways to reconstruct the history of life on Earth. Pinning down when specific events occurred is often tricky, though. For this, biologists depend mainly on dating the rocks in which fossils are found, and by looking at the “molecular clocks” in the DNA of living organisms.

There are problems with each of these methods. The fossil record is like a movie with most of the frames cut out. Because it is so incomplete, it can be difficult to establish exactly when particular evolutionary changes happened.

Modern genetics allows scientists to measure how different species are from each other at a molecular level, and thus to estimate how much time has passed since a single lineage split into different species. Confounding factors rack up for species that are very distantly related, making the earlier dates more uncertain.

These difficulties mean that the dates in the timeline should be taken as approximate. As a general rule, they become more uncertain the further back along the geological timescale we look. Dates that are very uncertain are marked with a question mark.

4.5 billion years ago

Earth forms.

Soon afterwards it is struck by a Mars-sized body dubbed Theia, which vaporises the surface and blasts it into space. This ejected material condenses to form the Moon.

Massive bodies continue to strike the Earth, at a declining rate, for the next 1.5 billion years, ending about 3 billion years ago. The impacts reshape the planet surface and may help drive the onset of plate tectonics.

However, the idea that there is an especially intense ""Late Heavy Bombardment"" between about 4 and 3.8 billion years ago, which obliterates any life, no longer seems to be true. This means life may have begun in the first few hundred million years of Earth's existence.

4.4 billion years ago

By this time, Earth has cooled down considerably and has substantial amounts of water. The origin of this water is mysterious. It may have been contained in the rocks that accreted to form the planet, in which case Earth was born wet.

Alternatively, the planet may have been dry at first, and received water from impactors like comets and asteroids. Either way, the early presence of water also points to an early origin of life.

4.29 billion years ago

Chemical traces in rocks from Canada may represent evidence of life from a deep-sea vent, but the results are contested.

When and how life begins remains highly uncertain. There are multiple competing hypotheses for the nature of the first life, for instance that it was based on RNA rather than DNA.

There are also many proposed settings, such as undersea alkaline vents and geothermal ponds on land. The question of life's origin fuses a range of scientific disciplines from chemistry to ecology.

4.2 billion years ago?

The first large oceans may form at this time. These primordial seas may be much deeper than today, leaving little or no exposed land.

4.1 billion years ago

Flecks of carbon trapped inside grains of zircon suggest that life exists at this time, but the evidence is limited.

3.9 billion years ago?

The Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA), the species from which everything alive today is descended, may live at this time according to genetic evidence. Attempts to reconstruct its genome suggest it lives in a volcanic or geothermal setting. LUCA seems to be a relatively complex microorganism, indicating that the origin of life occurred significantly earlier.

LUCA gives rise to two main groups of life, both single-celled: bacteria and archaea. How and when this split happens is still uncertain.

3.7 billion years ago

Rocks in Greenland from this time contain mysterious structures that may be fossilised microorganisms, or may just be distorted rocks.

The first large land masses may emerge from the ocean around this time, following a change in the behaviour of tectonic plates.

3.5 billion years ago

The oldest fossils of single-celled organisms, from Pilbara in Western Australia, date from this time.

They may live in freshwater hot springs in a volcanic region on land. The ecosystem is complex and thriving, suggesting life is already well-established.

3.46 billion years ago

Some single-celled organisms may be feeding on methane by this time.

3.4 billion years ago

Some bacteria are performing photosynthesis: they take in sunlight and carbon dioxide, and obtain energy. However, this is not photosynthesis as we know it today, because the bacteria do not release oxygen as a waste product. This anoxygenic photosynthesis remains common for a billion years.

3.2 billion years ago

Fossil microorganisms preserved in rocks from South Africa offer undisputed evidence of life on land.

3 billion years ago

Viruses are present by this time, but they may be as old as life itself, and have influenced the course of its evolution.

2.5 to 2.2 billion years ago

The Great Oxidation Event. Some cyanobacteria evolve a new form of photosynthesis that releases oxygen. This toxic waste starts to build up in the seas and atmosphere - though concentrations remain below modern levels for over a billion years.

Dissolved oxygen makes the iron in the oceans ""rust"" and sink to the seafloor, forming striking banded iron formations.

Oxygenic photosynthesis may well have evolved earlier, but the resulting oxygen was initially confined to small ""oases"".

Once oxygen becomes widespread, it may have cause a mass extinction among microbes that are unable to cope with it. It also drives evolutionary innovations. Today almost all animals breathe it and it may be behind the origin of circadian clocks.

2.3 billion years ago

Earth freezes over in what may have been the first “snowball Earth”, possibly as a result of a lack of volcanic activity. When the ice eventually melts, it indirectly leads to more oxygen being released into the atmosphere.

2.1 billion years ago

Burrow-like structures in rocks from Gabon suggest simple multicellular organisms have evolved and are moving, but this is disputed.

2 billion years ago?

Eukaryotic cells - cells with internal “organs” (known as organelles) - come into being. One key organelle is the nucleus: the control centre of the cell, in which the genes are stored in the form of DNA.

Fossils resembling eukaryotic cells are known from 2 billion years ago, and there are disputed claims of older fossils.

Eukaryotic cells evolve when one simple cell engulfed another, and the two lived together, more or less amicably - an example of “endosymbiosis”. The engulfed bacteria eventually become mitochondria, which provide eukaryotic cells with energy. The last common ancestor of all eukaryotic cells had mitochondria - and had also developed sexual reproduction.

The origin of eukaryotes is a turning point in evolution. It is not clear why it happened, but microbes called Asgard archaea may offer clues. Of all known archaea, they are the most closely related to eukaryotes, so ancient archaea similar to them may have taken part in the endosymbiosis.

Later, some eukaryotic cells engulf photosynthetic bacteria and form a symbiotic relationship with them. The engulfed bacteria evolve into chloroplasts: the organelles that give green plants their colour and allow them to extract energy from sunlight.

1.6 billion years ago

Fossils resembling primitive seaweed suggest some eukaryotes have evolved into large, multicellular organisms. The timing of the origin of multicellularity is uncertain and it may have occurred multiple times.

It is unclear exactly how or why multicellularity arises. One possibility is that single-celled organisms go through a stage similar to that of modern choanoflagellates: single-celled creatures that sometimes form colonies consisting of many individuals. Of all the single-celled organisms known to exist, choanoflagellates are the most closely related to multicellular animals, lending support to this idea.

1.5 billion years ago?

The eukaryotes undergo major splits: the ancestors of modern plants, fungi and animals split into separate lineages, and evolve separately. We do not know in what order the three groups broke with each other.

1 billion years ago

Some simple multicellular organisms appear to have distinct cell types, the first step towards internal organs.

890 million years ago

The first recognisable animals may have evolved by this time, much earlier than was once believed. In particular, fossils indicate that sponges are present.

800 million years ago?

Around this time, fungi evolve multicellular body plans.

Meanwhile, the early multicellular animals undergo their first splits. First they divide into, essentially, the sponges and everything else - the latter being more formally known as the Eumetazoa.

However, some genetic studies indicate that a group called the comb jellies or ctenophores was the first to break away, not the sponges. The debate is ongoing.

Around 20 million years later, a small group called the placozoa breaks away from the rest of the Eumetazoa. Placozoa are thin plate-like creatures about 1 millimetre across, and consist of only three layers of cells.

717 to 636 million years ago

The planet freezes over again in another “snowball Earth“.

660 million years ago

Chemical traces in rocks suggest sponges are living in the sea.

630 million years ago

Around this time, some animals evolve bilateral symmetry for the first time: that is, they now have a defined top and bottom, as well as a front and back.

Little is known about how this happened. However, small worms called Acoela may be the closest surviving relatives of the first ever bilateral animal.

It seems likely that the first bilateral animal was a kind of worm. Vernanimalcula guizhouena, which dates from around 600 million years ago, may be the earliest bilateral animal found in the fossil record.

600 million years ago

Fossils that may be comb jellies date from this time.

590 million years ago

The Bilateria, those animals with bilateral symmetry, undergo a profound evolutionary split. They divide into the protostomes and deuterostomes.

The deuterostomes eventually include all the vertebrates, plus an outlier group called the Ambulacraria. The protostomes become all the arthropods (insects, spiders, crabs, shrimp and so forth), molluscs, various types of worm, and the microscopic rotifers.

Neither may seem like an obvious “group”, but in fact the two can be distinguished by the way their embryos develop. The first hole that the embryo acquires, the blastopore, forms the anus in deuterostomes, but in protostomes it forms the mouth.

580 million years ago

The earliest known fossils of cnidarians, the group that includes jellyfish, sea anemones and corals, date to around this time - though the fossil evidence has been disputed.

575 million years ago

Strange life forms known as the Ediacarans appear around this time and persist for about 33 million years. Some may be early animals.

570 million years ago

The Ambulacraria breaks away from the main group of deuterostomes. This small group eventually becomes the echinoderms (starfish, brittle stars and their relatives) and two worm-like families called the hemichordates and Xenoturbellida.

Another echinoderm, the sea lily, is thought to be the “missing link” between vertebrates (animals with backbones) and invertebrates (animals without backbones), a split that occurred around this time.

565 million years ago

Fossilised animal trails suggest that some animals are moving under their own power.

558 million years ago

Dickinsonia, an Ediacaran that is thought to be an early animal, lives around this time.

540 million years ago

As the first chordates - animals that have a backbone, or at least a primitive version of it - emerge among the deuterostomes, a surprising cousin branches off.

The sea squirts (tunicates) begin their history as tadpole-like chordates, but metamorphose partway through their lives into bottom-dwelling filter feeders that look rather like a bag of seawater anchored to a rock. Their larvae still look like tadpoles today, revealing their close relationship to backboned animals.

Around the same time, the Ediacarans die out, perhaps due to competition from newly-evolved species.

539 million years ago

The Cambrian explosion begins, with many new body layouts appearing on the scene - though the seeming rapidity of the appearance of new life forms increasingly looks like an illusion as ever more older fossils come to light.

530 million years ago

The first true vertebrates - animals with a backbone - appear. The exact timing is unclear, and it is difficult to find consensus on which animals are true vertebrates and which are only related to the vertebrates. Possible candidates include Myllokunmingia, known from 518-million-year-old rocks in China.

The early vertebrates have a notochord, protected by a stiff rod of cartilage: they do not have a spine made of bone. The first vertebrate is probably quite like a lamprey, hagfish or lancelet.

Around the same time, the first clear fossils of trilobites appear. These invertebrates, which look like oversized woodlice and grow to 70 centimetres in length, proliferate in the oceans for the next 200 million years.

520 million years ago

Conodonts, another contender for the title of “earliest vertebrate”, appear. They look a little like eels - although whether they are truly vertebrates is still debated.

515 million years ago?

Plants begin colonising the land - an event that may have been enabled by genes obtained from microorganisms.

512 million years ago

A fossilised worm indicates that parasites are now present on Earth, but this lifestyle may be much older.

500 million years ago

Fossil evidence shows that animals were exploring the land at this time. The first animals to do so were probably euthycarcinoids - thought to be related to centipedes and millipedes.

Nectocaris pteryx lives around this time. It is thought by some researchers to be the oldest known ancestor of the cephalopods - the group that includes squid - although others are not so sure.

Some comb jellies develop complex nervous systems.

489 million years ago

The Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event begins, leading to a great increase in the diversity of life. Within each of the major groups of animals and plants, many new varieties appear.

450 to 400 million years ago

Fish split into two major groups: the bony fish and cartilaginous fish. The cartilaginous fish, as the name implies, have skeletons made of cartilage rather than the harder bone. Today, they include all the sharks, skates and rays.

Fish with teeth appear in the fossil record at this time, including Qianodus, thought to have been a cartilaginous fish.

Oxygen reaches its modern level in the atmosphere for the first time - although the exact level will continue to fluctuate.

445-443 million years ago

The Late Ordovician mass extinction, the first of the ""big five"" extinction events and probably the second most severe in terms of the number of genera that went extinct.

440 million years ago

The bony fish split into their two major groups: the lobe-finned fish with bones in their fleshy fins, and the ray-finned fish. The lobe-finned fish eventually give rise to amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. The ray-finned fish thrive, and give rise to most fish species living today.

The common ancestor of lobe-finned and ray-finned fish probably has simple sacs that function as primitive lungs, allowing it to gulp air when oxygen levels in the water fall too low. In ray-finned fish, these sacs evolve into the swim bladder, which is used for controlling buoyancy.

432 million years ago

The oldest unambiguous large fossil of a land plant dates from this time.

425 million years ago

The coelacanths, a group of famous “living fossils” - species that have apparently not changed for millions of years - may have split from the rest of the lobe-finned fish at this time. Coelacanths begin appearing in the fossil record by 409 million years ago.

417 million years ago

The lungfish, another group of legendary living fossils, split from the other lobe-finned fish. Although they are unambiguously fish, complete with gills, lungfish have a pair of relatively sophisticated lungs, which are divided into numerous smaller air sacs to increase their surface area. These allow them to breathe out of water and thus to survive when the ponds they live in dry out.

410 million years ago

For the first time, plants with elaborate root systems that stabilise the soil leave their mark in the fossil record.

400 million years ago

Insects may start appearing in the fossil record around this time - although some researchers now suspect the fossils are misidentified millipedes.

Some plants evolve woody stems.

397 million years ago

Fossilised footprints are left by four-legged animals, or tetrapods, for the first time. But the fossils are controversial: they seem to predate, by many millions of years, some of the fish-like animals thought to have evolved into tetrapods, and so some researchers question whether the fossils really are ancient footprints.

385 million years ago

The oldest fossilised tree dates from this period.

375 million years ago

Tiktaalik, an intermediate between fish and four-legged land animals, lives around this time. The fleshy fins of its lungfish ancestors are evolving into limbs, and unambiguous evidence that tetrapods have made it onto land soon follows.

The tetrapods eventually give rise to all amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals.

But not all Tiktaalik-like animals move on to land. One - Qikiqtania - evolves back into an aquatic swimmer.

372 to 359 million years ago?

The Late Devonian mass extinction occurs. It is the second of the big five. This one may be a long slow decline over tens of millions of years, not an abrupt event.

350 million years ago

The beetles, one of the most successful animal groups, begin to proliferate.

340 million years ago

The first major split occurs in the tetrapods, with the amphibians branching off from the others.

310 million years ago

Within the remaining tetrapods, the sauropsids and synapsids split from one another. The sauropsids include all the modern reptiles, plus the dinosaurs and birds. The first synapsids are also reptiles, but have distinctive jaws. They are sometimes called “mammal-like reptiles”, and eventually some of them evolve into the mammals.

320 to 250 million years ago

Synapsid animals known informally as the “pelycosaurs” dominate the land. The most famous example is Dimetrodon, a large predatory “reptile” with a sail on its back. Despite appearances, Dimetrodon is not a dinosaur.

275 to 201 million years ago

Some pelycosaurs evolve to become the first therapsids. Eventually, the therapsids replace the rest of the pelycosaurs.

About 260 million years ago, a group of therapsids called the cynodonts develops dog-like teeth and eventually evolves into the first mammals.

250 million years ago

The Permian period ends with the greatest mass extinction in Earth’s history, wiping out great swathes of species, including the last of the trilobites.

As ecosystems recover, fundamental shifts occur. Whereas before the synapsids (first the pelycosaurs, then the therapsids) dominated the land, the sauropsids now take over - most famously, in the form of dinosaurs. The therapsids survive as small, nocturnal creatures.

In the oceans, the ammonites, cousins of the modern nautilus and octopus, evolve around this time. Several groups of reptiles colonise the seas, developing into the great marine reptiles of the dinosaur era. The ichthyosaurs adapt rapidly to the marine lifestyle, some becoming as large as modern whales.

233 million years ago?

Proto-mammals evolve warm-bloodedness - the ability to maintain their internal temperature, regardless of the external conditions. The timing of this remains controversial - as is whether some or all dinosaurs were also warm-blooded.

210 million years ago

Bird-like footprints and a badly-preserved fossil called Protoavis suggest that some early dinosaurs are already evolving into birds at this time. This claim remains controversial.

200 million years ago

As the Triassic period comes to an end, another mass extinction strikes.

In the aftermath, the dinosaurs emerge from among the sauropsids and begin to dominate ecosystems. The largest ichthyosaurs are among the marine casualties of the extinction.

180 million years ago

The first split occurs in the early mammal population. The monotremes, a group of mammals that lay eggs rather than giving birth to live young, break apart from the others. Few monotremes survive today: those that do include the duck-billed platypus and the echidnas.

168 million years ago

A half-feathered, flightless dinosaur called Epidexipteryx, which may be an early step on the road to birds, lives in China.

160 million years ago

Possibly around this time, placental mammals split from their cousins the marsupials. The latter, like the modern kangaroo, give birth when their young are still very small, but nourish them in a pouch for the first few weeks or months of their lives.

The majority of modern marsupials live in Australia, but they may have reached it by an extremely roundabout route. Arising in south-east Asia, they spread into North America, which was attached to Asia at the time. From there they travelled to South America and Antarctica, before making the final journey to Australia about 50 million years ago.

Oldest evidence of pollinating insects.

Some dinosaurs take to the sky with membrane wings like those of modern bats, but are soon outcompeted by feathered birds.

150 million years ago

Archaeopteryx, the famous “first bird”, lives in Europe.

131 million years ago

Eoconfuciusornis, a bird rather more advanced than Archaeopteryx, lives in China.

125 million years ago

Flowering plants begin to leave their mark in the fossil record, following a period of rapid evolution - although genetics suggests the group is actually older and evolved slowly. The plants go on to dominate the planet, outcompeting the flowerless gymnosperms.

105 to 85 million years ago

The placental mammals split into their four major groups: the laurasiatheres (a hugely diverse group including all the hoofed mammals, whales, bats, and dogs), euarchontoglires (primates, rodents and others), Xenarthra (including anteaters and armadillos) and afrotheres (elephants, aardvarks and others). Quite when, where and how these splits occurred is unclear at present.

100 million years ago

The Cretaceous dinosaurs reach their peak in size. The giant sauropods Argentinosaurus and Patagotitan, live around this time. They may be the largest land animals in Earth's history - unless an enigmatic sauropod that lived 50 million years earlier was bigger.

93 million years ago

The oceans become starved of oxygen, possibly due to a huge underwater volcanic eruption. Twenty-seven per cent of marine invertebrates are wiped out.

75 million years ago

The ancestors of modern primates split from the ancestors of modern rodents and lagomorphs (rabbits, hares and pikas). The rodents go on to be astonishingly successful, eventually making up around 40 per cent of modern mammal species.

70 million years ago

Grasses evolve - though it will be several million years before the vast open grasslands appear.

66 million years ago

The Cretaceous-Tertiary (K/T) extinction wipes out a swathe of species. The giant dinosaurs vanish, although some small forms - the birds - survive. Pterosaurs and plesiosaurs are also among the large reptiles that vanish. The ammonites are also killed off. The extinction clears the way for the mammals, which go on to dominate the planet.

63 million years ago

The primates split into two groups, known as the haplorrhines (dry-nosed primates) and the strepsirrhines (wet-nosed primates). The strepsirrhines eventually become the modern lemurs and aye-ayes, while the haplorrhines develop into monkeys and apes - and humans.

58 million years ago

The tarsiers, primates with enormous eyes to help them see at night, split from the rest of the haplorrhines: the first to do so.

55 million years ago

The Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. A sudden rise in greenhouse gases sends temperatures soaring, wiping out many species in the depths of the sea - though sparing species in shallow seas and on land. Archicebus, one of the earliest primates to appear in the fossil record, lives at this time.

50 million years ago

Within the artiodactyls - hoofed mammals including deer and bison - one group begins evolving into whales. Early forms include Pakicetus.

48 million years ago

Indohyus, another artiodactyl closely related to the ancestor of whales and dolphins, lives in India.

47 million years ago

The famous fossilised primate known as “Ida” lives in northern Europe.

Early whales called protocetids live in shallow seas, returning to land to give birth.

40 million years ago

The platyrrhines (sometimes known as the ""New World monkeys"") become the first simians (higher primates) to diverge from the rest of the group, when they cross the Atlantic and colonise South America.

30 million years ago?

Some plants evolve C4 photosynthesis, which is more efficient than other forms. Today major crops like maize are C4 plants.

25 million years ago

Apes split from the monkeys and diversify.

17 million years ago

Gibbons become the first ape to split from the others.

15 million years ago

The ponginae - great apes including the orang-utans - branch off from the other great apes, spreading across southern Asia while their cousins remain in Africa. The ponginae include the largest great ape ever to have lived: Gigantopithecus.

7 million years ago

Gorillas branch off from the other great apes.

The ancestors of humans diverge from those of their closest relatives: the chimpanzees and bonobos. Later, some hominins begin walking on two legs.

2.8 million years ago

Our human genus, Homo, appears in Africa.

2 million years ago

A 700-kilogram rodent called Josephoartigasia monesi lives in South America. It is the largest rodent known to have lived, displacing the previous record holder: a giant guinea pig.

11,000 years ago to 1950s?

Beginning of the Anthropocene, the geological epoch defined by human domination of the planet. At time of writing the Anthropocene is not an official geological epoch and the start date remains contentious. Earlier dates coincide with the beginning of farming and the rise of city living and empires. Alternatively, the start date could be pinned to the 20th century - for example, to the onset of nuclear testing.

The Anthropocene has been marked by a high rate of extinctions, especially of large animals or ""megafauna"". It may ultimately prove to be the sixth mass extinction. It is also a time of rapid climatic warming, due to greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and other activities. Like other dramatic shifts before it, the Anthropocene will reshape life on Earth.

How prepared is the world for a pandemic of bird flu in people?

Bird flu is infecting wild birds and poultry around the world. If it were to crossover into humans, some antiviral drugs are available but it would take time to develop a vaccine

A horde of influenza viruses is sweeping through wild bird populations around the world. If any gain the ability to spread between humans, we may face a deadly flu pandemic.

Last week, World Health Organization (WHO) head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that while the risk to humans is low, ""we cannot assume that will remain the case and we must prepare for any change in the status quo"". So, how ready are we for such a …

Deforestation increased in 2022 despite pledges to save forests

The world is going ""in the wrong direction"" on forests, say campaigners. But some countries have reduced deforestation rates, and actions such as trade reform could yet turn the tide

Despite pledges by world leaders to halt deforestation, around 6.6 million hectares of forest were lost globally in 2022 - an increase of 4 per cent compared with 2021, according to an assessment by a coalition of environmental organisations.

Alongside this assessment, one of the organisations, the WWF, released a report setting out what needs to be done to halt deforestation. It calls for countries to end harmful subsidies and change international trade systems to stop the sale of products linked to deforestation.

""Why is the world still barrelling in the wrong direction on forests every year? The answer becomes obvious if you look at what we invest in,"" says Erin Matson at Climate Focus, an international advisory company, who co-authored the assessment. ""We are investing in activities that are harmful for forests at far higher rates than we are investing in activities that are beneficial for forests.""

At the COP26 summit in Glasgow in 2021, more than 100 countries - home to 85 per cent of the world’s forests - pledged to end deforestation by 2030. But with deforestation still increasing, many countries aren’t on track to meet their commitment, the assessment concludes.

""At current rates of deforestation, we could see the Amazon pass a tipping point in a matter of years, changing to become a dry, arid grassland,"" says Mike Barrett at WWF-UK. ""That will put efforts to avoid dangerous climate change out of reach.""

Of the 6.6 million hectares lost last year, 4.1 million hectares were primary forest, says Matson. ""These are the irreplaceable old-growth forests, which are priceless.""

But deforestation isn’t the only issue, she says. In places including North America and Europe, the forests that remain standing are being degraded by factors such as wildfires and partial logging.

""We hardly ever talk about the fact that forests in these regions, and in every world region, are not just being cleared, but where they are still standing, they’re losing carbon, losing their structural integrity, losing biodiversity year after year,"" says Matson.

However, the assessment isn’t all bad news. More than 50 countries are on track to end deforestation within their borders by 2030. For instance, rates of deforestation continue to fall in Indonesia and Malaysia.

The WWF report calls for much more to be done. Governments need to stop investing in and subsidising activities that are causing deforestation, and encourage activities that help forests, it says. For example, there is abandoned farmland in Brazil that could be put back into production with some investment, says Matson, which would lessen the pressure to cut down more forest.

Trade reform is also needed. The report recommends that products such as beef, timber, palm oil and soya should only be allowed to be exported if they are from sustainable sources.



The Amazon is turning into savannah - we have 5 years to save it

We have been hearing warnings about the destruction of the Amazon rainforest for decades, but experts say a catastrophic tipping point is now just over the horizon. Are they right? And if so, what can we do to pull things back?

The European Union introduced some regulations this year aiming to reduce its imports of unsustainable goods, but more needs to be done to ensure that products banned from the EU aren’t simply exported elsewhere, says Darragh Conway at Climate Focus.

It shouldn’t be left to consumers to try to work out if the products they buy are forest friendly or not, says Barrett. Governments should ensure that products that drive deforestation can’t be sold. ""We should be able to buy any products in the UK knowing that they are deforestation free. That’s not too much to ask. That needs to happen now.""

More also needs to be done to recognise the land rights of Indigenous peoples, as they are the best protectors of forests, says Mary Gagen at WWF-UK, who is one of the authors of the report.

It is the first comprehensive global blueprint on how to save our forests, she says. ""It defines for the first time the pathways to stop destroying forests, to meet global commitments and bring our forests back to life.""

The food and drink that really can boost your immune system

Whether it is immune-boosting smoothies or bacteria-laden yogurts, there is a whole world of products that claim to improve your immune system - but these are the ones that actually work

WALK down any supermarket aisle and you will see rows of food and drink that claim to help your immune system. We are told that cinnamon is good at battling inflammation and fighting off illness, for instance. The list of supposedly “immune boosting” foods also often includes berries, mushrooms, green tea, seeds, spinach, broccoli, probiotic yogurt and foods high in specific vitamins.

The problem is that when you dig deeper, you see that most of these bold claims aren’t derived from clinical trials or solid science. More often than not, they are based on small lab experiments where chemical extracts of the plants, nuts or herbs are found to alter the potency of immune cells, and these findings rarely translate to anything useful.

So, what do we really need to eat to support a healthy immune response? Only fairly recently have we discovered that the biggest immune organ is our gut. The immune system is in regular contact with the trillions of microbes living in the gut, which send signals to dial immune activities up or down.

The good news is that the delicate balance of this system can be modified through diet.

How To Become A Vet?



 

What does a vet do?

The primary role of a vet (formally known as a veterinary surgeon in the UK or veterinarian in the US) is to care for injured or ill animals. Veterinary medicine offers a broad range of career options, not just within clinical practice, but also in academia, government, public health, wildlife medicine, life sciences and environmental sciences. 

It is also possible to specialise further within many of these fields of work. For example, in clinical veterinary medicine some people choose to become specialists in one area of vet medicine, such as anaesthesia, cardiology, neurology, small animal surgery or wildlife medicine.

Generally, working as a vet will involve tasks like diagnosis and management of injured or ill animals, carrying out analyses of radiological and laboratory investigations, performing surgical procedures and communicating with animal owners about their animals' health and next steps in their management. 

This job also involves sensitive tasks, namely putting animals to sleep if they are deemed to be too severely injured or terminally ill. Depending on the field, this work may also involve infection control, for example in farms where diseases spread very easily between farm animals.

 

How to become a vet

To become a vet, you will first need to have completed secondary education with results that are sufficient to apply for a degree in veterinary medicine. You may enter a Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) approved undergraduate veterinary medicine degree directly after secondary education, but it is possible to enrol in a postgraduate course in some universities if you have completed a relevant degree. 

To apply for veterinary medicine, it is necessary to have some prior work experience in a veterinary or otherwise animal-related setting (for example a farm, dog shelter, shadowing a vet, working at a zoo) and it is beneficial to do extra reading around the subject to show interest in your personal statement and any interviews you might attend.

The deadline to apply for this degree in the UK is earlier than for most other degrees: 15 October instead of the usual January deadline. There are currently 11 veterinary schools in the UK, listed on the British Veterinary Association website.

The applications for veterinary medicine are often competitive, so it is important to spend time on your personal statement and prepare for your interviews. Some of the commonly asked interview questions include ""˜Why do you want to be a vet?', ethical questions about animal testing or pedigree breeding, or questions about current high-profile research in veterinary medicine. 

Interviewers can also present you with a professional scenario and ask what you would do in a specific situation, and they might ask some questions related to the content covered in your school curriculum. They may also want to know more about how you plan to cope with stress, and what you consider your weaknesses and strengths.

Most students receive one or two conditional offers at the most due to the high number of applicants to veterinary medicine compared to available places. Once you receive a conditional offer, you will need certain grades to secure a place in veterinary medicine at that university. 

After completing a university degree in veterinary medicine, you will become a qualified veterinary surgeon and may proceed in your career, with or without choosing to specialise. 

 

How long does it take to become a vet

You will become a qualified vet after the completion of a veterinary medicine degree, which usually takes 5 to 6 years (depending on the university) if it is done as an undergraduate degree, and occasionally 4 years if you enter a postgraduate degree after completing a relevant undergraduate degree. 

If you wish to specialise in a particular area of veterinary medicine, you will need to take additional courses and obtain qualifications in your chosen specialty either through the RCVS, the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), or the European College of Veterinary Surgeons (ECVS). This usually consists of at least one internship year followed by a 3-year residency and concluded by passing exams. 

 

A day in the life of a vet

Typically, a vet's working day will start around 8 or 9 a.m., and end between 5 and 7 p.m. It is not uncommon to have to stay past the usual working hours due to emergencies, but most of the time vets finish their work around the time they are supposed to. 

As a vet, you will also probably need to take up some on-call commitment, for example on-call nights or weekends to care for urgent out-of-hours cases, although not all clinics provide out-of-hours and on-call services. 

On a typical day, a vet's time is divided between consultations and surgeries, although some days may consist solely of consultations while other days may be spent entirely in surgery. Vets deal with both pre-booked and urgent appointments on a daily basis. 

Some patients may not need to be seen in the clinic, in which case a telephone consultation with the owner is sufficient. Some telephone consultations will still result in the patient needing to come into the practice, or the vet may need to visit the patient if this is not possible. The work is similar whether you work in a practice, a clinic, or a veterinary hospital.

In a farm setting, or if part of the vet's practice is large animal health, the workday will involve time spent outside caring for larger animals and will again be a mixture of routine and urgent work. Working outside the practice will mean that some time will be spent travelling between patients, as well as going back and forth to the office to pick up medications and equipment or to drop off blood and other samples after a patient visit. 

Besides clinical practice, administrative work is also an important component of veterinary practice. It is important to keep good documentation of all the patients you see, their clinical presentation, examination, diagnosis and a management plan. Vets usually have some time allocated to completing more time-consuming paperwork such as animal passports and health certificates.

Although most vets will have scheduled, regular breaks, veterinary practice can be unpredictable, and it can be difficult to keep to these break times. However, most vets get a mid-morning and a lunch break, some even get an afternoon break, especially if they are working long hours.

Vets can also do some locum work, temporarily filling in a position of another vet who is absent for some time. This type of work often offers more flexibility than a permanent position and comes with a similar salary range. Locums can work in all types of veterinary medicine, including small animal, farm, exotic, and so on. Locum work, much like regular veterinary work, can involve out-of-hours and on-call commitments. 

 

How much will you earn as a vet in the UK and the US

The average salary for a vet in the UK is £41,000 per annum. Starting salaries range from £30,000 to £35,000 a year, while experienced vets can make upwards of £60,000 a year, particularly if they specialise in a certain field. 

The salaries vary between different regions, type of practice and experience levels. Additionally, it is possible to enter the private sector as a vet to further supplement your salary.

In the US, the average income of a vet is $105,840. The salary typically ranges between around $83,000 and $134,000. Income again depends on factors like education, experience, certifications, specialisation, additional skills and geographical location.

The UK's official swimming rivers are too polluted to swim in

Just two rivers in the UK are designated as ""bathing waters"", and both are currently rated in poor health. With more rivers set to become bathing waters, will they actually be clean enough to use?

By Jason Arunn Murugesu

There are close to 1500 rivers in the UK, but just two stretches have been officially approved as swimming destinations - and even these are currently too polluted to use safely. While campaigners hope that other rivers will soon receive this ""bathing status"" designation, some fear the label is misleading, as there are few requirements to clean up pollution that can harm health and the local ecology.

Environmental matters are devolved in the UK, meaning the UK government oversees bathing waters in England, while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland govern their own affairs.

More than 400 bathing waters in England are tested by the UK's Environment Agency (EA) for levels of Escherichia coli, which causes diarrhoea, and intestinal enterococci, which are linked to urinary tract infections.

These tests occur 20 times at each site during the ""bathing season"" of mid-May to the end of September. Most are beaches, with just two stretches of river: the Ilkley bathing site on the river Wharfe in West Yorkshire and a stretch of the Thames in Oxford. No other UK nation has designated bathing rivers.

Based on its measurements, the EA categorises bathing waters as either excellent, good, sufficient or poor. Last year, 93 per cent were deemed excellent or good, but the two rivers were rated poor. Swimming is still permitted in them, but officials have had to put up signs advising people against doing so.

Part of the problem is that applications to grant bathing status don't require any water quality test, with tests only taking place once the status has been given. Given the generally poor state of England's rivers, newly granted rivers are likely to be in poor health. In fact, the sole requirement, set by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, is that the water has ""a large number of bathers in relation to any infrastructure or facilities that are provided"". In other words, the water can receive bathing status even if people are swimming in pollution. New Scientist asked the EA why it doesn't test for other pollutants, but it declined to comment.

The state of Britain's rivers: Slurry, silage and sewage

Richard Tyler at the Save the Wye coalition, a campaign group aimed at improving the water quality of the UK's fourth longest river, says he fears the general public don't understand the distinction between a river's bathing status and its ecological status. ""Just because it is safe to swim in a river does not mean it cannot still be polluted,"" he says.

Cleaning rivers takes time. Ilkley only gained bathing status in 2020, the first stretch of English river to do so, with the Thames in Oxford following in 2022. The poor state of these rivers is probably due to sewage discharges and pollutants from farms allowing bacteria to flourish, says Alistair Boxall at the University of York, UK.

Creating accountability

Ruth Leach is leading a campaign to get bathing status for a stretch of the river Deben, Suffolk, in the hope that it will be monitored and cleaned by the EA and Anglian Water, the firm responsible for wastewater treatment in the region. ""It's about creating some accountability and opening water firms up to scrutiny,"" she says.

Anglian Water says it supports the campaign and, after speaking to Leach, it is testing the Deben once a week for E. coli and intestinal enterococci levels. ""As part of our Get River Positive programme, we've pledged to make sure our operations will not be the reason for poor river health,"" a spokesperson said. New Scientist understands the EA is expected to make a decision on the Deben's status in time for this year's bathing season.

But Tyler says that simply measuring bacteria in a water body isn't sufficient. For example, phosphorus, which can leak from local farms, has little direct impact on human health and is rarely monitored in bathing waters. Yet it is a major issue for rivers, as it leads to increased algal growth. This can lower oxygen levels in rivers, harming local animal and plant life, says Tyler, and some algae can be dangerous for people.

Boxall says the EA also doesn't monitor for domestic pollutants, such as medicines and shampoos, which can end up in rivers. ""We've done research that shows that ibuprofen levels in half of England's rivers may be harming fish health,"" he says.

Save Britain's Rivers: Why we're campaigning to rescue UK waterways

Rivers in highly populated urban areas of England also appear to contain high levels of antibiotics, says Boxall, but there is no requirement to test bathing waters for their presence. ""There is some suspicion that river systems could be contributing to the antimicrobial resistance crisis,"" he says. ""But there are no limits on how much antibiotics can be emitted from wastewater treatment works into rivers.""

Some river campaigners have moved away from seeking bathing status. Susan Buckingham at the Friends of the Cam says her team didn't back moves by other local activists to seek bathing status for part of the river Cam in Cambridge. ""Our reason for being is to make rivers clean and to get freely flowing rivers, but actually having a bathing quality designation is sort of meaningless,"" she says.

When asked whether people can confidently swim in rivers with bathing status, the EA declined to comment. But there is some evidence that designating bathing waters and monitoring them for bacteria makes them safer for humans to swim in. Nick Voulvoulis at Imperial College London points out that many of England's coastal bathing waters were in a far worse state several decades ago. According to the EA, just 28 per cent of bathing waters met the highest standards in force in the 1990s. Today, the figure is 72 per cent - though it is hard to make direct comparisons, as 2015 saw stricter guidelines introduced.

Why rivers are important for everything from biodiversity to wellbeing

Ensuring that rivers with bathing status have lower E. coli and intestinal enterococci levels is likely to require the installation of more wastewater treatment facilities, says Voulvoulis. Such plants are expensive, but this is how water quality at coastal sites was improved, he says. Last year, ultraviolet disinfection measures were added to the wastewater plant near the Ilkley bathing spot, with the hope that it will lower the levels of microbes released by the plant into the river Wharfe.

To make rivers truly pollutant free, bathing status can only be the start, says Boxall. Taking pharmaceutical pollution as an example, he notes that new cosmetics often aren't rigorously tested for their effect in water bodies. ""We could redesign those products to make them safer for the marine environment,"" he says.

Meanwhile, Tyler argues that the best way of solving the Wye's phosphorus problem would be to deal with chicken manure from nearby farms, which last year were found to be one of the main sources of phosphate pollution in the river.

Each polluted river in England is likely to have a unique set of problems, so each will require a unique set of solutions. But Jamie Woodward at the University of Manchester, UK, argues that to solve any of these problems, we first need detailed river-monitoring schemes, beyond a simple focus on bacteria. ""In environmental stewardship terms, I would say we're a failed state right now,"" he says. ""We don't even have the data to say how bad we actually are.""

The truth behind how to reduce your energy use and still live well

In theory, it's possible to live well while using energy at a rate of just 2000 watts - a quarter of the average for people in the US. Our environment reporter took on the challenge. Here's what he discovered

By James Dinneen

7 February 2023 , updated 16 February 2023

THE first thing I did was turn off the lights. Then I unplugged everything. On reflection, I reconnected my fridge. Next, I made a list of all the other ways I consume energy. Gas-powered boilers heat my apartment and water. I cook on a gas stove. I take the New York City subway to work. For longer trips, I drive or hail a ride, and I fly. Then there’s the fridge, washing machine and dryer, elevators, a computer, phone, even my toothbrush. I add to the list anything I buy that requires energy to make and transport. Plus the food I consume or throw away. Nearly everything I do requires energy.

Energy is a hot topic right now. Rocketing fuel prices precipitated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the transition to renewable sources to limit global warming have focused people and governments on reducing consumption. With this in mind, I wanted to see whether I could drastically cut my energy use. I had read that, in the 1990s, Swiss researchers calculated that just 2000 watts per person would be enough for everyone to live sustainably and still have a good quality of life. So that became my target. This was the first day of a personal, month-long “2000-watt challenge”.

Jason Ford

I used an online calculator - once I got the Wi-Fi back on - to estimate my current energy use. In the US, each person consumes energy at a rate of 8600 watts on average. I didn’t think my lifestyle was particularly extravagant, so I was surprised to find I use even more than that. Clearly, I had a long way to go.…

Hannah Ritchie: 'Eco-anxiety on its own is not that useful'

Climate change and biodiversity loss may seem like insurmountable problems, but data scientist Hannah Ritchie is cautiously optimistic we can solve them

By Alison George

26 December 2023

Klawe Rzeczy

WITH constant headlines about floods, wildfires and record-breaking temperatures, it isn’t surprising that many people think our current generation will leave the planet in a worse predicament than when we inherited it. But is that belief true? Hannah Ritchie doesn’t think so. She is cautiously optimistic that we might be the first generation to pass on the environment in a better state than we found it.

Will global warming continue even after we hit net-zero emissions?

She reached this counterintuitive conclusion after a decade digging into environmental records as a data scientist at the University of Oxford and lead researcher for influential online publication Our World in Data. In her new book Not the End of the World, Ritchie lays out the graphs that show the positive steps we have already taken to change our behaviour and mitigate climate change, from cutting coal use to shrinking carbon footprints. She talks to New Scientist about her growing conviction that we can solve the world’s environmental problems and picks out some key trends that give her hope about us turning things around.

Alison George: I’m talking to you on a day when it was reported that online searches related to “eco-anxiety” have increased dramatically. Yet you study long-term environmental trends and are somewhat optimistic.

Hannah Ritchie: I still have anxiety and worry, but I think it’s now paired with some sense of optimism that we can change things. The anxiety is completely justified and I get why people feel it. I feel it. But that feeling on its own is not that useful. You need to combine a sense…

Sun-blocking dust from asteroid impact drove the dinosaur extinction

The Chicxulub impact 66 million years ago filled the sky with fine silicate dust, which blocked out sunlight and lingered for 15 years

Dust may have sustained an ‘impact winter’ for 15 years

When a huge asteroid hit Earth 66 million years ago, clouds of dust from pulverised rocks blocked out the sun for 15 years. This dust may have been the primary driver of the mass extinction that saw off the non-avian dinosaurs and many other species, according to new research.

The Chicxulub impactor ejected plumes of sulphur-based gases into the atmosphere alongside vast amounts of silicate dust. The impact also triggered wildfires around the planet, which emitted soot and carbon dioxide into the air.

Soon after, the world fell into an “impact winter”, which wiped out 75 per cent of species on the planet.

""The research on this proposes the Chicxulub mass extinction was mainly governed by either sulphuric gas emissions or soot injections from global wildfires,"" says Cem Berk Senel at the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Brussels.

However, previous research hasn’t considered whether the silicate dust could have had an effect too, he says.

To investigate further, Senel and his colleagues analysed fine-grained material deposited at a site in North Dakota at the time of the Chicxulub impact. The team found that the diameter of the grains ranged from 0.8 to 80 micrometres, with an average size of 2.88 micrometres.

Putting this information into a climate model, the team found that sulphur gases were the primary driver of global cooling initially, by blocking sunlight. However, these gases only stuck around in the atmosphere for about eight years.

Meanwhile, silicate dust lingered in the air for 15 years after the impact, which suggests that it must have played a large role in sustaining the global winter. The researchers found that the dust alone contributed to a 15°C drop in Earth's surface temperature, and this effect gradually weakened after the first couple of years.

The dust was also more effective than the sulphur gases at blocking the wavelengths of light used for photosynthesis in plants and phytoplankton.

""Only the silica dust resulted in long-lasting photosynthetic shutdown after impact,"" says Senel. This led to a lack of food for many species, setting off a series of extinctions on land and in the oceans.

Senel and his colleagues now hope to study the climatic effects of the asteroid impact on a much longer timescale. ""There's still so many big questions to uncover about what happened to life after one of the biggest mass extinction events,"" he says.

We finally know what makes orange carrots orange

Three genes are turned off to make carrots produce high levels of alpha and beta-carotene, which make them a rich source of vitamin A and give them their orange hue

The genes that make carrots orange have finally been identified, giving biologists a better understanding of what makes them so nutritious.

The first domesticated carrots were grown in central Asia during the 10th century, and they were originally purple or yellow. Orange carrots first appeared in western Europe in the 1400s, probably as a result of crossing yellow and white carrots.

Since then, orange carrots have surged in popularity, due to their bright colour and sweetness. ""By the early 1900s, there was an understanding that the juice of orange carrots was medically active,"" says Massimo Iorizzo at North Carolina State University. ""This all contributed to carrots' status as an iconic healthy vegetable.""

Now, Iorizzo and his colleagues have uncovered the science behind their distinctive colour. The researchers sequenced the genomes of 630 types of carrot, then looked for gene variants associated with particular traits.

They found three specific genes where orange carrots had variants that resulted in the gene being switched off. In purple, yellow or white carrots, at least one of the three genes was turned on.

These genes regulate levels of alpha-carotene and beta-carotene - chemicals that belong to a group of pigments called carotenoids. Alpha and beta-carotene are converted to vitamin A in the human body, which is important for the health of the eyes, immune system and other parts of the body.

When these genes are switched off, carrots produce more of these pigments, which generate their signature orange hue as well as making them a particularly rich source of vitamin A, says Iorizzo. Other carrots have higher levels of different carotenoid pigments that aren’t converted into vitamin A.

Many orange carrots also had gene variants that delay flowering, which usually makes them tougher and inedible. ""It turns out farmers have been unknowingly selecting these beneficial traits for centuries,"" says Iorizzo.

He and his team hope that a more comprehensive understanding of carrot genetics can help to breed even better carrots in the future.

Europe to become a hotspot for flash droughts caused by climate change

The warming climate is causing soils to lose their moisture more quickly, resulting in damaging, rapid-onset droughts

Climate change is leading to more frequent ""flash droughts"", which take just a few weeks to materialise and can send shock waves through affected ecosystems.

Almost three-quarters of the world has seen a rise in these sudden dry spells over the past 64 years, according to modelling by Xing Yuan at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology in China and his colleagues.

As climate change advances, almost all the world's landmasses will be affected by more frequent flash droughts that take hold faster, with Europe a particular hotspot, says Yuan.

These events usually last for between 30 and 45 days, whereas slow-onset droughts tend to take several weeks or months to appear and last for 40 to 60 days. The increase in flash versions is due to the warming climate, he says.

""Under global warming, the climate's variability has increased. So, you've got more extremes: you can get very heavy precipitation, but you can also get very dry conditions,"" says Yuan.

Warmer air temperatures also mean water evaporates from soil more quickly, bringing on a drought state sooner, he adds.

""These two factors provide a driver to increase the speed of the drought onset,"" says Yuan.

Although the work suggests that the incidence of flash droughts is increasing significantly around the world, it doesn't provide data demonstrating the pace of change. But Yuan says the proportion of dry periods that are flash droughts could increase by 15 to 20 per cent between 2050 and 2100, compared with between 1950 and 2000, depending on how quickly the climate warms.

On a global scale, this would have worrying implications. As Yuan points out, existing drought monitoring systems aren't designed to spot incoming flash droughts, leaving regions with very little warning before one hits.

More accurate forecasts would help water companies and farmers conserve water in advance, to protect supplies for the public and food production, he says.

Wildlife and plant life may also struggle to adapt to rapid-onset drought, warns Yuan. ""For the traditional drought, the vegetation is adapting to the drought event,"" he says. But if the drought occurs faster, it isn't known if the ecosystem will have enough time to adapt, he says.

The surprising life and avoidable demise of Earth's remarkable oases

The antiquity, stability and weird chemistry of oases have made them cradles of evolution, yet humanity's need for water is putting these unique habitats in peril

An oasis in Libya, where groundwater is a scarce commodity

IMAGINE you are in a desert. The air is dry, the landscape barren, but before you lies a teardrop-shaped pool. It is strangely lush, with sedges and tussocks of grass. Spiky succulents surround its salty shore. Peering into its crystal-clear waters, you observe various snails and furry brown domes that resemble frightened sea anemones. A shrimp-like creature paddles by. There’s a sort of leech, but it is lurid green. A small fish with red eyes and blue fins swims into view. Another fish, a flat-bellied bottom dweller, darts out of some weeds, flicking a cloud of mud. All these creatures are new to science.

It may sound like a nature lover’s fantasy, but this is real. It is an oasis in Australia’s arid interior, a place I have been lucky enough to visit and study. What’s more, it isn’t so unusual. Emerging evidence reveals that oases are often crucibles of biodiversity. These little pools in vast deserts are the ultimate isolated habitat, yet their antiquity, stability and weird chemistry have made them home to extraordinary organisms found nowhere else on Earth.

Oases still have secrets to impart. The exact locations of many of them remain unmapped. Meanwhile, others are threatened by demands for groundwater, a growing peril due to climate change and increasing human populations. That’s why I decided to establish the Fellowship of the Spring to save the world’s oases. This may sound ambitious, but recent developments in oasis rehabilitation show it can be done. Besides, the special cultural significance of oases and their crucial…

Find out what makes the National Horizons Centre unique

Though a unique blend of training and industry-focused research, the National Horizons Centre, based at Teesside University's Darlington campus is playing a key role in the growth of the North East health and bioscience sector.



1 June 2023

Collaboration is the lifeblood of Teesside University's National Horizons Centre (NHC) and this ethos even transcends into the architecture of the national centre of excellence for the biosciences and healthcare sector. Indeed, stepping through the front doors of the impressive £22.3 building on Darlington's Central Park, one is greeted immediately by a large multi-floor atrium. Glass-fronted laboratories look out onto this atrium and with multiple breakout and social areas to facilitate interaction, the building has been designed specifically to enable serendipitous connectivity.

Bringing together industry, training and research expertise under one roof with partnership working at its core is what makes the National Horizons Centre unique, says its Director, Professor Vikki Rand.

""We've worked hard to ensure that everything we do delivers immediate impact for our partners,"" she says.

""Our ability to house both researchers and industry professionals working and collaborating in multiple disciplines under one roof is what makes the NHC a really exciting place to work.

""We have the facilities and expertise to take a concept from a piece of bench research to work with industry partners to scale it up, and then work with end-users to train them in its delivery and implementation.""

Indeed, this close partnership working was highlighted by Dame Kate Bingham, the Chair of the UK Vaccine Taskforce. In her biography, The Long Shot, she acknowledges that the close working relationship the NHC enjoyed with industrial partners including the Centre for Process Innovation (CPI) and Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies was crucial to establishing the North-East as a hotspot for biological manufacturing and training throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.

The personal touch

Disease-specific research forms a key strand of the NHC's output with particular focus around biomarkers – biological indicators that can be used to predict, diagnose, and monitor diseases and conditions. Biomarkers can be found in tissue biopsies, blood, urine, and other bodily fluids, and their analysis provides valuable information about a patient’s health status and response to treatment.

Researchers at the centre are using advanced technologies such as genomics and proteomics to identify specific biomarkers that are associated with different types of cancer. This research has the potential to revolutionise cancer diagnosis and treatment, allowing for earlier detection and more targeted therapies.

With a background in cancer genomics, Professor Rand takes a hands-on approach to the NHC's research output, and is involved in several projects investigating aggressive cancers. Her work in aggressive lymphoma has discovered a link between a specific gene and the survival rate of children with the disease. By demonstrating that mutations of the TP53 gene is linked to an inferior survival rate of children with aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the research has made it possible to highlight patients who are less likely to be cured with current therapies.

""Being able to identify which patients are more likely to respond to specific treatments is absolutely vital to effective treatment of cancer,"" says Professor Rand.

""We now hope that this research can eventually be used to enable clinicians to tailor their treatments to ensure that children affected by this disease can maximise their chances of recovery.""

Developing new therapies and treatments

The development of new therapeutics is a major focus of research at the NHC. The unique collaborative environment afforded by the NHC has resulted in new opportunities to translate research and develop and deliver new therapeutics for a range of diseases.

Linda Popplewell, Professor of Genetic Medicine at the NHC, has developed several patented therapies which have entered clinical trials. She is particularly interested in finding new gene therapies for rare diseases such as Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. As with the development and production of the Covid-19 vaccine, the close working relationship with CPI and Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies will enable the translation of bench science to clinical application.

Likewise, the close links that the NHC has built with local NHS and healthcare bodies has enabled Professor Popplewell to liaise directly with patients themselves.

""Being diagnosed with a rare disease can be devastating. Meeting with patients and understanding the impact their disease has on their quality of life provides us with inspiration for everything we do; they are our ultimate stakeholders,"" she says. ""Developing drugs for rare diseases is complicated by the lack of understanding of the diseases themselves, hence the need for biomarker studies, and by the small numbers of patients affected, making clinical trials difficult and not cost-effective for investment by drug companies.""

""Our research is about a making a real difference to people's lives and the NHC is the ideal location to bring all the stakeholders together to take drug development through to completion.""

The NHC is also at the forefront of research into developing new diagnostics and wearable technology to help patients suffering from chronic conditions manage their healthcare.

One project, led by Professor John S. Young, is piloting new digital devices to enable people receiving dialysis to monitor key treatment measurements at home, without the need for invasive blood tests or hospital visits.

""The ultimate aim is for this technology to enable patients to track their potassium levels and other important measurements regularly at home,"" says Professor Young. ""This could save lives by facilitating timely treatment of abnormal blood results; if potassium levels are too high or too low, this can be fatal.""

Together with industry

Industry links are integral to the success of the NHC. Industry partnerships ensure the NHC is developing the requisite training and development to enable the Tees Valley to continue as a global centre of excellence for the biosciences. At the same time they help Teesside University fulfil its strategic mission to deliver research with real-world impact.

Undergraduate and postgraduate degrees and professional apprenticeships, ensure that there is a pipeline of graduate talent entering the sector. Alongside these qualifications, the NHC also delivers CPD courses, developed in conjunction with industry and the NHS to train and upskills the region's existing workforce.

Academic expertise and research partnerships also help organisations in the sector develop innovative solutions to grow their business.

Hexis Lab engages with skin care companies and cosmetics ingredient manufacturers to develop products using its proprietary deep learning algorithms and a big-data computing platform, Pro X®, to understand the effects compounds have on different skin types. Based in the NHC, it is working with researchers and using its facilities to test it product ideas and research the different properties of natural compounds.

Through its partnership with Teesside University, Hexis Lab was successful in accessing grant funding through Tees Valley Launchpad, a £6m collaborative research and development fund established by Innovate UK, part of UK Research and Innovation, to work with University academics to develop new ways to manufacture high-value biochemicals using organic waste products coming from agricultural and marine waste. In doing so, it will avoid the need to use ingredients from petroleum products and exotic plants, helping to create a circular biomanufacturing process.

""Working at the National Horizons Centre is fundamental to our company strategy,"" says Founder and Chief Executive Dr Olusola Idowu. ""Not only does it have fantastic facilities, but it allows us to work collaboratively and in partnership with the academics here.""

Discover. Develop. Deliver

The three-word mission statement of the NHC is not merely marketing alliteration, but a statement of true purpose for a facility which has delivered tangible impact in the Tees Valley and beyond. Since opening in 2019, through the dark days of the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent recovery, the NHC has played an integral part in delivering skills and expertise in a sector which is acknowledged as playing a key role in the economic success of the UK in the 21st century. With an ever-growing talent pipeline and research outputs still to be delivered, the NHC is set to become a keystone in the North-East bioscience and healthcare ecosystem.

Heat pumps are poised to help breweries and other industries go green

Industries like beer brewing that rely on low-temperature heat are starting to turn to electric heat pumps and other efficient technologies to reduce energy use and emissions

Breweries and other industrial facilities that require low-temperature sources of heat could slash energy use and emissions by switching to heat pumps or other efficient electric heating sources.

Industry is often seen as one of the hardest sectors of the economy to decarbonise. One reason is that lots of industrial processes require very high temperatures that are expensive to achieve without burning fossil fuels. Making cement, for instance, requires heating limestone above 1500°C; steel furnaces require even higher temperatures.

Satellite sensing reveals tropical forests are much closer to a major tipping point than previously thought, but are only likely to pass it in worst-case warming scenarios

A tiny proportion of leaves in the canopies of tropical forests are already passing the critical temperature threshold beyond which they cannot photosynthesise, resulting in their death. Modelling and experiments suggest the proportion of leaves affected in this way will rise exponentially as local temperatures continue to increase.

“We are predicting total leaf death,” says Christopher Doughty at Northern Arizona University. “If it was to occur, this would be a major tipping point.”

However, his team’s findings indicate that this tipping point is likely to be reached only in the worst-case warming scenarios, which are now thought to be implausible. “It doesn’t seem like we’re going to get to that, but it’s possible,” he says.

Lab studies show that when the leaves of rainforest trees reach a temperature of around 47°C (117°F), the cellular machinery that captures energy from sunlight is irreversibly damaged and the leaves usually die.

“It seems high,” says team member Martijn Slot at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. “But leaf temperature can be a lot higher than air temperature.”

Desert plants can tolerate temperatures above 47°C, but in rainforests there are only small variations in heat tolerance between species, says Slot.

It was thought that no leaves in tropical forests were reaching their tolerance limit. But when they analysed measurements of plant temperatures by the ECOSTRESS instrument on the International Space Station from 2018 to 2020, Doughty and his colleagues found that around 0.01 per cent of leaves in the canopies of rainforests around the world are already reaching this threshold.

To confirm this, the researchers did a number of ground-based studies around the world, including placing temperature sensors on individual leaves in the upper canopy of rainforests. “This is incredibly challenging,” says Slot. “You come back, and a storm has ripped the sensors off or ants have eaten the tape.”

They then created a simple model based on these findings and on experiments involving warming plants. They concluded that the proportion of leaves affected will increase as local temperatures increase, rising more rapidly after reaching a tipping point between 2 and 8°C (3.6 and 14.4°F) of local warming, most likely at 4°C (7.2°F).

There are a number of reasons why the rise might accelerate, says Doughty. For instance, the pores of leaves, called stomata, will close during extreme heat and drought to prevent water loss. Without the cooling effect of evaporation through the stomata, the leaves warm rapidly.

In addition, once the most heat-exposed leaves start dying, others that were previously sheltered become exposed and die as well.

Is climate change accelerating and is it worse than we expected?

Continuing deforestation will make it more likely that local temperatures could increase to levels where lots of leaves start exceeding the limit, says Doughty. “Where you have fragmentation of forests, the existing forests get quite a bit warmer,” he says.

It is possible that the rising number of trees dying in the Amazon is due in part to this temperature threshold, he says. Recent studies also suggest that the Amazon has started releasing more carbon than it soaks up, leading to further warming.

“This paper is more evidence that we need to stop and reverse climate change as quickly as possible,” says Julia Jones at Bangor University in the UK, who wasn’t involved in the study.

The research shows that the local effects of deforestation, coupled with global climate warming, may already be resulting in regions becoming climatically unsuitable for rainforests, says Iain Hartley at the University of Exeter in the UK. “To preserve tropical forests and the critical ecosystem services they provide, action is needed both locally and globally,” he says.

The UK has almost no credible plans to adapt to climate change

Advisers to the UK government warn that failure to plan for the effects of climate change is putting the country at risk of threats such as food shortages and power blackouts

Water and food shortages, power blackouts, telecoms failures, flooding and heat-related deaths: these are some of the growing dangers facing the UK because of its failure to adapt to a warming world, according to a highly critical report that looked at the country’s national adaptation programme over the past decade.

The Climate Change Committee (CCC), the official organisation that advises the UK government on cutting emissions and adaptation, identified a set of objectives needed to achieve climate resilience in 13 sectors such as nature, health and energy. The report found no credible plans for 40 out of 45 of the objectives, and that not enough is being done to implement any of the plans that exist.

“The last decade was a lost decade,” says Julia King, chair of the CCC sub-committee on adaptation. “The impacts are only going to get worse.”

The UK’s average annual temperature is already more than 1.5°C higher than in the 1880s, and it will keep on rising for many decades at least. The sea level has risen 15 centimetres over this time and will keep rising for centuries. “Every increment of temperature brings escalating hazards,” says King.

So much of the UK’s infrastructure and ways of doing things are no longer appropriate in the changing climate. This includes everything from houses not designed to cope with heatwaves to the crops farmers grow, power systems and flood defences.

The record-smashing heat in 2022 demonstrated some of the problems, says King. There were more than 3000 heat-related deaths over the summer, 20 per cent of operations were cancelled at the peak of the heat, train travel was disrupted by buckling rails and sagging power lines, drought led to water restrictions and reduced food yields, and fire fighters struggled to contain widespread wildfires.

“The events of last year highlight just how exposed and vulnerable we can be to extreme weather in the UK,” says Richard Millar, head of adaptation at the CCC. “It’s not enough to reduce greenhouse gases. We have to adapt as well.”

Water is one of the few areas where there are adequate plans for ensuring future supplies, he says, which include reducing consumption per person and cutting leakage. But water consumption per person has risen in recent years and little has been done to reduce leakage.

What’s more, the government’s adaptation programme not only needs to address specific areas such as water, says Millar, it also needs to take account of the increasing interconnectedness of infrastructure, which can lead to knock-on effects.

For instance, power failures due to extreme weather could lead to loss of water supplies and the loss of communication systems. The UK only narrowly avoided blackouts last summer.

Climate-related events elsewhere in the world can also affect the UK. There were shortages of some vegetables recently in part because of extreme weather in Morocco and Spain. “Identifying and managing these interdependencies is a key part of being climate resilient,” says Millar.

Some adaptation measures will be costly, such as upgrading the flood defences that protect London. But doing things now will be cheaper than “if we do it in a more panicked way towards the middle of the century”, says Chris Stark, head of the CCC.

“The change in the climate is a fundamental,” he says. Everything governments, companies and individuals do now happens in a warming climate, but this is still not being taken into account, he says.

The next five-year stage of the UK’s national adaptation programme is due to be announced later this year. It must be much more ambitious and focus on implementation, the report says, with adaptation embedded in all policies.

""We welcome the Climate Change Committee's recognition of our progress so far and will factor its recommendations into our updated national adaptation programme,"" a UK government spokesperson said.

Reaching net zero will cost billions more due to interest rate rises

It is vital that we clean up our energy sources and shift away from fossil fuels, but rising interest rates mean green energy projects are becoming more expensive and risk being cancelled

Vital green energy projects could stall as the cost of financing them has increased

Abstract Aerial Art/Digital Vision/Getty Images

The world’s green energy transition, which is essential to achieving net-zero emissions and halting climate change, is under threat, as a financial era of rising interest rates has made some projects, like new offshore wind farms, unaffordable. Estimates suggest that Europe must now find an additional â‚¬163 billion to reach net zero by 2050, with figures likely to be similar elsewhere in the world.

Over the past 15 years, interest rates have been unusually low, making cheap…

Reports of an AI drone that 'killed' its operator are pure fiction

It has been widely reported that a US Air Force drone went rogue and ""killed"" its operator in a simulation, sparking fears of an AI revolution - but this simulation never took place. Why are we so quick to believe AI horror stories?

By Matthew Sparkes

Some AI stories are so bad they would make a robot facepalm

Some AI stories are so bad they would make a robot facepalm

Corona Borealis Studio/Shutterstock

News of an AI-controlled drone “killing” its supervisor jetted around the world this week. In a story that could be ripped from a sci-fi thriller, the hyper-motivated AI had been trained to destroy surface-to-air missiles only with approval from a human overseer – and when denied approval, it turned on its handler.

Only, it is no surprise that story sounds fictional – because it is. The story emerged from a report by the Royal Aeronautical Society, describing a presentation by US Air Force (USAF) colonel Tucker Hamilton at a recent conference. That report noted the incident was only a simulation, in which there was no real drone and no real risk to any human – a fact missed by many attention-grabbing headlines.

Later, it emerged that even the simulation hadn’t taken place, with the USAF issuing a denial and the original report updated to clarify that Hamilton “mis-spoke”. The apocalyptic scenario was nothing but a hypothetical thought experiment.

“The Department of the Air Force has not conducted any such AI-drone simulations and remains committed to ethical and responsible use of AI technology. It appears the colonel’s comments were taken out of context and were meant to be anecdotal,” a USAF spokesperson told Insider. USAF didn’t respond to New Scientist‘s request for interview before publication.

This story is just the latest in a string of dramatic tales told about AI that has at points neared hysteria. In March, Time magazine ran a comment piece by researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky in which he said that the most likely result of building a superhumanly smart AI is that “literally everyone on Earth will die”. Elon Musk said in April that AI has the potential to destroy civilisation, while a recent letter from AI researchers said the risk of extinction is so high that dealing with it should be a priority alongside pandemics and nuclear war.

Why do these narratives gain so much traction, and why are we so keen to believe them? “The notion of AI as an existential threat is being promulgated by AI experts, which lends authority to it,” says Joshua Hart at Union College in New York – though it is worth noting that not all AI researchers share this view.

Beth Singler at the University of Zurich in Switzerland says that the media has an obvious incentive to publish such claims: “fear breeds clicks and shares”. But she says that humans also have an innate desire to tell and hear scary stories. “AI seems initially to be science fiction, but it is also a horror story that we like to whisper around the campfire, and horror stories are thrilling and captivating.”

One clear factor in the spread of these stories is a lack of understanding around AI. Despite many people having used ChatGPT to write a limerick or Midjourney to conjure up an image, few know how AI works under the hood. And while AI has been a familiar concept for decades, the reality is that the current crop of advanced models display capabilities that surprise experts, let alone laypeople.

“AI is very non-transparent to the public,” says Singler. “Wider education about the limitations of AI might help, but our love for apocalyptic horror stories might still win through.”

Bits of an ancient planet called Theia may be buried in Earth's mantle

Two strange, high-density blobs buried more than a kilometre underground may have come from the ancient world Theia, which is thought to have slammed into Earth to create the moon

By Leah Crane

1 November 2023

Earth is thought to have collided with a Mars-sized planet billions of years ago

Earth is thought to have collided with a Mars-sized planet billions of years ago

NASA

There may be chunks of an ancient planet trapped in Earth's mantle. The prevailing theory of the moon's formation is called the giant impact hypothesis, in which a Mars-sized object called Theia slammed into Earth and was blown to bits, creating the moon from the debris. Theia may not be all gone, though - there may be two lumps of its material embedded deep underground.

For decades, researchers have known that there are two areas in Earth's mantle, each tens of kilometres across, that behave slightly differently from the surrounding rock. One is beneath Africa, and the other under the Pacific Ocean. These blobs seem to be denser than the rest of the mantle, so seismic waves travel through them more slowly, earning them the name of large low-shear-velocity provinces or LLVPs.

Qian Yuan at the California Institute of Technology and his colleagues hypothesised that the giant impact and LLVPs could be related to one another. The researchers performed a series of simulations of how the rubble of Theia would have behaved after its smash-up with Earth.

Moon mystery could be solved by simulation of planetary smash-up

They found that rocks from Theia's mantle would have melted and sunk to the boundary between Earth's mantle and core, creating a thin layer that coated the entire core. Then, over time, convection within Earth's mantle would have slowly gathered this dense material into the two piles we see today.

We cannot confirm this by digging down to the blobs, but there may be other ways to tell whether they really are pieces of Theia. ""It's way, way, way deeper than anyone has ever been able to dig,"" says Yuan. But bubbles of hot material rise from the blobs. ""[This] can bring some of the chemical signals to the surface,"" he says.

Those plumes have shown chemical signatures similar to some found on the moon, but not typically on Earth, which supports the idea that the LLVPs (as well as the moon) are remnants of Theia - in turn supporting the giant impact hypothesis itself.

""This moon-forming giant impact is maybe one of the most important factors for why Earth is so different from any other rocky planet we've found,"" says Yuan. ""This impact changed the atmosphere, changed the crust, changed the mantle, changed the core, so it was really probably the most important event in Earth's history."" If we want to look for other planets like Earth, maybe ones that have had giant impacts are the way to go, he says.

North Atlantic Ocean has reached record-high surface temperatures

Clouds of dust blown from the Sahara desert generally have a cooling effect on the North Atlantic, but the winds that blow the dust are weaker than usual, possibly due to El NiÃ±o

For more than three months, sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic have been higher than any on record during this time of the year. This may be related to the combined effects of climate change, developing El NiÃ±o conditions and a lack of Saharan dust.

Temperatures in the North Atlantic tend to rise in summer, peaking in late August or early September. On 5 March, average temperature reached 19.9°C, surpassing the previous record set in 2020 by 0.1°C, according to data presented by researchers at the University of Maine, which goes back to 1981.

On 11 June, they reached a high of 22.7°C, 0.5°C above the previous high set in 2010.

""It's clearly out of the envelope,"" says FranÃ§ois Lapointe at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. ""That's very worrying.""

The unusual Atlantic temperatures are part of a pattern of above-average surface temperatures across global oceans, which hit a record high of 21.1°C on 1 April. Average sea surface temperatures have declined to 20.9°C since then, but still remain 0.2°C above the previous high set in 2022.

It isn't clear what is driving the unusual heat in the North Atlantic, but the anomaly has sparked speculation among researchers. Climate change has probably contributed to some extent, says Lapointe. Natural variability from hotter El NiÃ±o conditions emerging in the tropical Pacific Ocean may also have contributed.

Another possible factor proposed by Michael Mann at the University of Pennsylvania is that there is less dust from the Saharan desert over the ocean than usual.

One anomaly that’s gotten a lot of attention is the North Atlantic, where we see warmth particularly in the eastern tropical/subtropical region of the basin. That appears to be tied to an anomalous dearth of windblown Saharan dust that normally has a cooling impact on the region.

""” Prof Michael E. Mann (@MichaelEMann) June 12, 2023



Clouds of dust blown across the ocean from the Sahara generally have a cooling effect on the North Atlantic during this part of the year, reflecting away solar radiation that heats the water. But the trade winds that blow the dust are weaker than normal, and only mild amounts of dust are forecast to the end of June. Lapointe says the weaker trade winds are associated with El NiÃ±o.

The lack of dust is unlikely to have anything to do with climate change, Mann said on Twitter. ""Instead it underscores the interplay between human-caused warming and natural variability"".

The high sea surface temperatures could energise more powerful storms, although changes in wind patterns due to El NiÃ±o could offset those effects. If sustained, they could also harm marine ecosystems by reducing mixing between different layers of the ocean, which decreases available oxygen, says Lapointe.

Inside a small, geodesic dome near Iceland’s HellisheiÃ°i geothermal power station, water full of carbon dioxide is being pumped hundreds of metres down into the porous basalt. At least, I am assured it is: the water is so clear that the pipe looks empty when I peer through a viewing window at it. The CO2 will react with metals in the rock and turn into carbonates, locking it away safely for millennia.

Rare bird not seen for 24 years found alive in Madagascan forests

The dusky tetraka, a small, ground-dwelling forest bird, hadn't been documented since 1999, but sightings of three individuals have now confirmed that the species is still alive

A rare bird that hadn’t been seen for 24 years has been confirmed alive after expeditions in Madagascar's forests found three individuals.

The sightings of the dusky tetraka, a small, ground-dwelling forest bird, may prompt a rewrite of ornithology textbooks, as the birds were seen by the rocky banks of mountain streams - not previously thought to be their favoured habitat.

The dusky tetraka (Xanthomixis tenebrosa), an olive bird with a yellow throat, was included in a top 10 ""most wanted"" list by the Search for Lost Birds, a conservation collaboration launched in 2021.

Since December, three individuals have been seen by two teams from charity The Peregrine Fund. The expeditions were made to forests on high mountain slopes, as this is where most remaining wooded areas are in Madagascar.

The first team found an individual near a stream in the island's Masoala peninsula by using a mist net, a fine mesh that is suspended between trees so birds get tangled in it. The net is checked frequently and then birds can be released unharmed.

The second team's efforts didn’t go smoothly as it was discovered that much of the target region near Andapa had been turned into vanilla farms.

But when the team switched to searching a lower elevation, at about 800 metres above sea level, John Mittermeier at the American Bird Conservancy saw a pair of the birds hopping around in undergrowth by a stream. ""It's a moment that's tremendously exciting – to be looking for something that long and then there it is,"" he says. ""Afterwards it felt like a dream.""

The next day, the team caught what was probably one of the same pair in a mist net, and confirmed that it was indeed the right species.

Lily-Arison Rene de Roland at The Peregrine Fund says the confirmed sightings should help efforts to conserve the bird’s habitat.

If its preferred habitat is by streams, this might be why it hasn't been seen for so long, as the sound of the rushing water may drown out its calls, says Mittermeier.

Net zero delay won't help when UK is already behind on climate targets

Cutting carbon emissions means replacing the heating systems in homes, transforming transport and greening steel production. All of these will take time, but the UK prime minister has instead chosen to delay the transition

By Michael Le Page

The UK’s shift to electric vehicles may be slowed by a delayed ban on new fossil fuel ones

UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has confirmed leaked reports that he will weaken some of the country’s key plans for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

Arguing that the UK has ""massively over-delivered"" on its carbon targets, Sunak called for a ""more pragmatic, proportionate and realistic approach to reaching net zero"".

""We've stumbled into a consensus about the future of our country that no one seems to be happy with,"" he said at a press conference on 20 September.

The UK’s existing plans for net zero included a ban on the sale of cars that run only on petrol or diesel from 2030, the phase-out of gas boilers from 2035 and a requirement for new homes that can’t be connected to the gas grid to install non-fossil fuel heating from 2026.

These plans will now be delayed and weakened, Sunak announced. ""It should be you, the consumer, that makes that choice, not government forcing you to do it,"" he said.

Sunak appears to have taken issue with the way climate plans have been made in the UK since 2008, when the Climate Change Act committed the country to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent relative to 1990. In 2019, the target was changed to 100 per cent, or net-zero emissions.

Under the act, the UK must meet various intermediate targets, sometimes called carbon budgets, for cutting emissions. Sunak said there had been a lack of parliamentary scrutiny for these targets, adding ""we can never allow carbon budgets to be set in the same way again"".

Yet the UK isn’t on track to meet these targets. An independent body called the Climate Change Committee (CCC) is responsible for advising the government and monitoring progress. According to the committee, back in 2019, the UK wasn’t even on track to meet its 80 per cent target.

Net-zero aim shouldn't be used to delay action on carbon emissions

The latest progress report from the CCC, published in June, was also highly critical.

“Our response to the recent fossil fuel price crisis did not embrace the rapid steps that could have been taken to reduce energy demand and grow renewable generation,” the report said. “We have backtracked on fossil fuel commitments, with the consenting of a new coal mine and support for new UK oil and gas production.”

The UK might meet its intermediate target for the 2020s, but it isn’t on course to achieve its goal for the 2030s, according to the CCC report. It called for urgent action and said the government should stay “firm on existing commitments and move to delivery”.

But Sunak is doing exactly the opposite, delaying action and weakening commitments. Among other things, this move will dent the confidence of investors. Many businesses were swift to condemn the decision, including the car company Ford, which before Sunak’s press conference said that firms need ""ambition, commitment and consistency"" from the government.

The bigger problem is that, so far, the UK’s emissions cuts have come from doing the relatively easy things, such as generating electricity from renewables instead of fossil fuels. The country has barely begun to tackle the harder parts, such as replacing the heating systems in homes, greening steel production and cutting emissions from farming and flying. These will all take time. With only 26 years remaining before 2050, there isn't much to waste.

Pepper X: The world has a new hottest chilli

Pepper X scorches the previous record holder, the Carolina Reaper, by a million Scoville heat units

Heatonist/Julian Bracero

Pepper X is the hottest chilli in the world, according to a statement from Guinness World Records. The chilli is around 500 times hotter than a jalapeno.

The squat, greenish-yellow pepper measures a whopping 2.69 million Scoville heat units (SHU). SHU is a scale of spiciness based on the concentration of capsaicinoids - a chemical irritant that makes peppers hot - in the plant. Pepper X outranked the previous record-holder, the Carolina Reaper, by around a million SHU.

Ed Currie, who bred the Carolina Reaper a decade ago, is also behind Pepper X. Currie told the Associated Press that he developed the pepper after a friend sent him a different variety of chilli that was ""brutally hot"". When Currie bred that pepper with the Carolina Reaper, it was even hotter. It took him around a decade of experimentation to cultivate Pepper X in his South Carolina greenhouses.

Currie managed to eat a whole Pepper X in a video posted online Monday. ""I was feeling the heat for three-and-a-half hours,"" Currie said. ""Then the cramps came.""

In mammals like humans, capsaicin binds to a receptor in nerve cells that triggers the body's inflammatory responses in the form of a burning sensation. Birds lack this molecular receptor, so they're spared the spice when spreading seeds through their droppings.

We finally know what makes orange carrots orange

In severe cases, too much spice can cause vomiting, stomach pain and burning diarrhoea. Drinking milk is one way to cool the heat, as the dairy protein casein attracts and surrounds the oil-based capsaicin molecules.

If Currie has his way, Pepper X won't hold the title of hottest pepper forever. He breeds more than 100 peppers every year. ""Is this the pinnacle? No it's not the pinnacle,"" said Currie. ""The next one we're just starting the testing on now.""

Killing of rare Italian bear raises fears for future of its subspecies

The shooting of Amarena, one of around 60 remaining Marsican brown bears in central Italy, raises doubts about whether large carnivores can coexist peacefully with humans

The killing of a well-known wild bear named Amarena has shocked Italy and raised fresh doubts about whether humans and large carnivores can coexist peacefully.

At 11pm on 31 August, Amarena was wandering through the streets of San Benedetto Dei Marsi in the Abruzzo region of Italy with her two cubs, when she was shot dead by a man who said he was defending his chicken coop.

She was one of around 60 remaining Marsican brown bears (Ursus arctos marsicanus), a subspecies of the Eurasian brown bear classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It is mainly found in the Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise National Park, one of Europe's wildest areas, around an hour’s drive away from Rome. Poaching and collisions with cars and trains are the leading causes of death for the subspecies.

Typically, only three to four females reproduce each year, having a total of three to 10 newborn cubs. Amarena was the most prolific individual ever known. In 2020, she gave birth to four cubs, an unusually high number.

Amarena and her cubs were often seen in villages

Marsican bears are often spotted wandering around the small mountain villages in Abruzzo, and they are an attraction for tourists. But for the safety of bears and people, the national park and other institutions have tried unsuccessfully to prevent them from approaching villages.

A monthly celebration of the biodiversity of our planet's animals, plants and other organisms.

""The presence of wild animals in villages increases the risk of negative interactions with people and the likelihood of accidents,"" says Mario Cipollone, the co-founder of Salviamo L'Orso, a non-profit organisation working to save the Marsican bear from extinction. ""If there are people who lure bears into towns for economic or selfish reasons, efforts by associations and institutions to keep these animals out of towns fail.""

Paula Mayer at ETH Zurich in Switzerland has studied the coexistence of bears and humans in Abruzzo, using a mathematical model to map the areas in which conflict is more likely. She found there is wide variation in people's attitude towards bears, with more positive views in communities that profit from tourism and more hostility in those dependent on subsistence farming. Her research also shows that state investment, such as financial compensation for damage caused by bears, is crucial for fostering positive attitudes towards wildlife.

""In the area where Amarena was killed, the map shows a high probability of coexistence, meaning both threats to bears are low and human tolerance is high,"" says Meyer. ""However, a model remains a model and can never predict with certainty what will happen in reality.""

The killing of Amarena has taken people by surprise in a region that has been touted as an example of coexistence between humans and large carnivores.

""I believe that some areas of Abruzzo are truly models of coexistence. However, without a change in values, in the sense that the general population accepts wildlife in a shared landscape even if it brings them no instrumental benefit, we will never reach a deeply rooted and sustainable state of coexistence in the social-ecological system,"" says Mayer.

""There is a need for the state to recognise the protection of nature and endangered species as a national priority, to invest in a culture of knowledge and respect for biodiversity, in the prevention of conflicts with large carnivores,"" says Cipollone.

A byproduct of making the drink kombucha can be used to create flexible electronic circuits that could be useful for wearable technology or even for making simple computers that are partially alive.

More than 60 types of bacteria and yeast are involved in brewing kombucha from sugared tea – these form a mat of cells on top of the drink. This mat is usually transferred to fresh batches of sweetened tea, where it converts sugars…

How a UK river serves as a natural lab for flood defence research

A river near Edinburgh, UK, has served for more than a decade as a natural laboratory for studying flood defences, providing benefits such as improved water quality worth millions of pounds

By Jason Arunn Murugesu

27 May 2023

Lake Wood is part of Eddleston Water, a stretch of river near Peebles, UK

Lake Wood is part of Eddleston Water, a stretch of river near Peebles, UK

Colin McLean

When I visit a research lab, I don't normally expect to have to dodge sheep or get my shoes muddy, but this lab is far from normal. I am walking on farmland, about 30 kilometres outside of Edinburgh, UK. The air is crisp and I can hear a river babbling as I approach.

It is this stretch of river, known as Eddleston Water, that I have come to see, guided by Chris Spray at the University of Dundee, UK. Working with the local environmental charity Tweed Forum, Spray and his team started studying the river in 2009 and it has been home to a series of real-world experiments ever since. They call it a ""natural lab"" for river science.

As we watch a dipper soaring in and out of the river in search of prey, Spray tells me that the lab was originally set up to cut the flood risk facing Peebles, a town of 9000 people, that sits on Eddleston Water.

Spray and his colleagues wanted to find out how they could cut flood risk using nature-based solutions, such as tree planting, rather than building artificial dams. More importantly, they also wanted to find out how effective these methods really were. ""Models are great and all, but it's only with real-world data that you get a full understanding of all the various factors that can affect these results,"" says Spray.

Such methods, also known as natural flood management (NFM), are gaining traction: the UK government plans to double the number of flood reduction and coastal erosion projects in England using NFM from 60 to 120. But, despite this, the evidence base for NFM is relatively sparse, says Spray.

One big question in hydrology is what happens when you make a river bendier, otherwise known as re-meandering. Many of the UK's rivers were made artificially straight, freeing up room for roads and railways, but we now know this also increases the risk of floods. The idea goes that re-meandering rivers allows them to hold a greater volume of water and so avoid flooding.

Yet Spray's team has found that, at least in Eddleston Water, re-meandering alone doesn’t appear to have a major effect on flood risk. This is because the floodplain surrounding the newly bendy river isn’t particularly large, so can’t effectively store the water that overflows due to excess rain. But that doesn't mean there aren't benefits: a bendier river has a massive benefit for ecological diversity, says Spray.

For example, the team found an increase in the number of spawning habitats for salmon in re-meandered sections of the river. This is one of the reasons why the dipper is trying its luck in the river today, says Spray.

A closer look at the river also reveals the various ways in which the water seems to flow - it is far faster on the bendier bits, which contain more oxygen and can give rise to a greater variety of insect life. These parts of the river simply seem more alive than the unrestored sections.

The researchers have also studied leaky dams, which are simply tree logs placed across a stream. During normal river flow, the water passes under the logs, but when river levels rise the dams cumulatively slow the flow of water.

Spray shows me one of these dams, comprised of a dozen logs lying across a stretch of the river. It looks messy, more like debris than something placed by humans, but Spray says these haphazard logs have probably had the biggest impact on flooding in Peebles of all the interventions they have trialled. ""You wouldn't think it looking at them, but they're such an easy and straightforward solution to cutting flood risk.""

Beyond looking at flood risk, the team has quantified the monetary gains of its interventions. ""Money talks,"" says Spray. The researchers say that NFM has helped avoid £950,000 worth of flood damages in the 10 years since the first interventions were installed in 2012. But this is far outweighed by the ecological benefits to the region, such as improved carbon storage and increased water quality, which the team values at around £4.2 million. ""This is what natural flood management can do that simply building flood defences cannot,"" says Spray.

But natural labs come with their own problems. Spray says the lab’s experiments are often a compromise with the dozens of landowners in the area, rather than perfect science. Re-meandering takes a lot of space and farmers may have other plans for that land, says Spray, so the team's efforts have been scaled down from the ideal. ""If the landowner doesn't want it to happen, it doesn't happen,"" he says. ""We don't push our luck.""

That also points to a bigger problem with NFM. For it to work across the UK, river practitioners need to foster closer relationships with landowners, says Spray. But that is easier said than done and takes time. ""We've been here for over a decade,"" he says. ""The trust has been hard fought for.""

One solution is to pay landowners to use NFM, something the UK government is planning to do as part of its post-Brexit farming reforms, although the details haven’t yet been published. Spray hopes this will help increase the take-up of his team's research. ""But these techniques only work if you get farmers on board - you need to make it worth their while,"" he says.

Why is China drilling a hole more than 10,000 metres deep?

An oil company in China has started drilling a hole that would be the deepest in the country and among the deepest in the world

By James Dinneen

A borehole more than 10,000 meters deep is being drilled in northwest China’s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region

China's largest oil producer has started drilling a hole expected to reach a depth of more than 10,000 metres in the country's remote Taklamakan Desert. The borehole would be among the deepest ever drilled, and could give researchers new geological insights as well as access to ultra-deep oil reserves.

According to China's state-run news agency Xinhua, the China National Petroleum Corporation started drilling the borehole on 30 May. The report says the narrow borehole is designed to reach a depth of 11,100 metres.

The borehole, located in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region in the country's northwest, would be the deepest in China and among the deepest in the world. The world's deepest hole is the 12,262-metre Kola Superdeep Borehole in northwestern Russia, which took 20 years to drill.

Sinopec, a petroleum refiner also involved in the project, said in a statement they aim to drill this new borehole - called Project Deep Earth 1-Yuejin 3-3XC Well - in record time. According to Bloomberg News, the plan is to drill to maximum depth in 457 days. The Xinhua agency says the bottom of the hole would reach rocks formed during the Cretaceous period, between 66 million to 145 million years ago.

However, Quanyou Liu at Peking University in China, who is familiar with the project, says the drilling would reach the even older Cambrian strata, formed more than 500 million years ago, which some geologists believe to be the source of oil and gas in the Tarim Basin, a major oilfield. The purpose of the drilling is ""to discover whether there is still the occurrence of oil and gas in the ultra-deep depths,"" he says.

In a 2021 speech, Chinese president Xi Jinping named ""deep Earth"" as one of four strategic frontiers for the country's scientific community. At the time, Yigang Xu at the Chinese Academy of Sciences said the new focus on geological exploration was mainly driven by the need for China to reduce reliance on imports of minerals, metals and oil and gas.

Xinjiang's Tarim Basin contains some of China's biggest and deepest oil fields, and Sinopec has developed other ultra-deep wells elsewhere in the region. This includes the Shunbei oil and gas field, where the company says it has drilled 49 wells deeper than 8000 metres.

The drilling project could also offer researchers insight into the unique geology of the Tarim Basin. The basin collects water drained from three mountain ranges, and is thought to have been formed during the closure of the Palaeo-Asian Ocean more than 200 million years ago.

""It looks very much like an industrial oil drilling project as opposed to a scientific drilling project,"" says Edward Sobel at the University of Potsdam in Germany. ""Research wells usually try very hard not to find oil and gas.""

Still, he says the drilling project could also offer researchers insight into the unique geology of the Tarim Basin if it includes collecting core samples and taking geophysical measurements.

Sobel says the basin itself is more than a billion years old, with stable bedrock overlaid by hundreds of millions of years of sediment. ""You've got a pretty continuous pile of sediment from the Cambrian [period] on"", comparable to the strata visible in the Grand Canyon, he says.

Scotland: Wind will power the Scots' green ambitions

On 18 September, the people of Scotland will vote on whether their country should become independent of the UK. This article is part of our ""Four futures for an independent Scotland"" special report, looking at the choices a newly independent Scotland could make.

Scotland’s current and future wind farms

Scotland’s current and future wind farms

Scotland is arguably one of the greenest countries in Europe. It produces 40 per cent of Scottish electricity demand from renewable sources, and models suggest this could rise to 67 per cent by 2018. That’s closing in on the government’s goal of producing enough green power to supply the equivalent of all of Scottish demand by 2020.

Some fear that independence means this goal will be too expensive for Scotland because offshore wind is expensive. “It’s silly to say it’s going to be expensive,” says David Toke of the University of Aberdeen, “when in fact it can be done pretty cheaply onshore.” (see diagram, above right)

Toke and his colleagues published estimates last year suggesting that independence would ruin Scotland’s chances of hitting its green goal. But later that year the team made a U-turn&colon; they now say that it will be cheaper for Scotland to pursue its 2020 target as an independent nation.

What changed? Newly announced nuclear power stations will need funding in the UK and new financial policies heavily favour nuclear over wind power.

So it now makes more sense for a green Scottish consumer to vote for independence, says Toke. Electricity bills will still go up - by about 7 per cent, he claims - and this will pay for onshore wind power. In the UK, bills would rise by 8 to 10 per cent to pay for new nuclear, Toke says.

An independent Scotland will need a close electrical alliance with England and Wales. A power-sharing market that allows all those involved to navigate the peaks and troughs of supply and demand is a tricky business. This balancing act is particularly tough when fickle renewables are involved, but there is a precedent in Scandinavia. Nord Pool is a power-sharing market on a grid that runs largely on renewables.

Denmark, for instance, has a huge amount of wind power. When it produces more than it can use, it simply sends it out to its Nord Pool partners and makes money on the transaction. But wind does not offer constant energy so the Danes need back up. In part that comes from Norway, which can sell its abundant hydropower to the Danes in their times of need. Accordingly, Scotland’s incumbent Scottish National Party (SNP) has proposed an “energy partnership” with the UK.

Independence will allow the party to take control of national regulation, and implement measures like better loans for companies wishing to build new renewable power stations or premium rates for renewable energy companies.

A further measure that Toke and his colleagues advocate is to allow small companies and even individuals to profit from feed-in tariffs. Existing feed-in tariffs from the UK government mean only very large power companies can sell renewable power to the grid. The result would be a more distributed power grid, which has the benefit of being less vulnerable to extreme weather events that can knock out centralised grids if they hit key power stations.

With all these measures on the table, Toke estimates that Scotland can meet its 100 per cent target by 2023 for less money than it would if it remained part of the UK.

Don’t be fooled by all this green ambition - Scotland won’t be kicking the oil habit. Its target is to produce the equivalent of 100 per cent of Scottish demand with renewables, but the country will remain a big energy exporter. The excess will come largely from its traditional fossil fuel and nuclear power resources.

But the SNP says emphasis will be placed on developing carbon dioxide capture and storage for its fossil fuel power stations. It’s not easy being green, but independence might make it a little easier.

Ancient trilobite stuffed itself with food almost to bursting point

A trilobite with gut contents still preserved is the first of its kind ever to be found, and shows the woodlouse-like animal had a voracious appetite

The trilobite Bohemolichas incola

Jiri Svoboda

For the first time, a trilobite fossil has been found with preserved gut contents, and an analysis of the specimen suggests the iconic ancient animal had a voracious and unfussy appetite.

Trilobites, arthropods that lived from the Early Cambrian to the end of the Permian Period (around 521-252 million years ago), were some of the earliest animals to scuttle through the sea. Scientists have uncovered tens of thousands of trilobite fossils over the centuries, but this example of the species Bohemolichas incola is distinct from the others because its gut contents are preserved inside it.

""Most fossil trilobites are not dead whole animals, but rather shed carapaces from the moulting process, like modern crabs,"" says Per Ahlberg at Uppsala University in Sweden. As a result, none of their internal organs are present in the fossil. But this trilobite, unearthed in the Czech Republic, was buried alive with a full gut in an undersea mudslide.

Trilobites used trident-like horns to fight over mates like stags

To find out what was inside the 465-million-year-old trilobite, Ahlberg and colleagues examined the fossil using high-resolution X-rays, which they used to create three-dimensional digital reconstructions. ""After that, it was just a matter of comparing the shell fragments in the gut with known fossil organisms to work out what our trilobite had been eating,"" says Ahlberg.

The scans revealed crushed shells from ancient crustaceans, echinoderms and bivalves - the early relatives of crabs, sea stars and mussels. They concluded that the trilobite ate a wide variety of marine organisms, both living and dead. Shell fragments in the animal's gut suggest it was able to crunch through fragile shells or swallow animals whole, and probably made meal choices primarily based on its prey’s size and shell strength.

Judging by signs of digestion, ""surprisingly, it seems to have been eating very quickly, stuffing itself almost to bursting"", says Ahlberg. He suspects the trilobite was over-eating to trigger moulting, a strategy shared by some modern arthropods.

The Atlantic cod may be five separate species rather than one

A genetic analysis of thousands of Atlantic cod has revealed they all belong to one of five distinctive groups, suggesting they aren't interbreeding and belong to different species

Atlantic cod are actually five separate species of fish, not one, researchers have claimed after conducting a genetic analysis – though not everyone agrees with their findings.

“What we thought was a single species is actually more species,” says Einar Arnason at the University of Iceland. “It’s important in terms of biodiversity.”

We can now only stay under 1.5°C target if we achieve net zero by 2034

The amount of carbon dioxide we can still emit to have just a 50 per cent chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C is even smaller than previously thought

By Michael Le Page

30 October 2023

To have just a 50/50 chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C, the world must keep future emissions to about 220 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide, according to the latest estimate. With annual emissions at around 40 gigatonnes and still rising, we are on course to exceed this by 2029 or earlier.

As a result, keeping that 1.5°C goal alive now requires us to hit net-zero globally by 2034 rather than by 2050, says Joeri Rogelj at Imperial College London. “There are no social or technical scenarios in the scientific literature that even describe how that would be possible.”

However, it is still feasible to limit warming to well below 2°C, says Robin Lamboll, also at Imperial College. To have a 50/50 chance of keeping warming to 2°C, the world must not emit more than 1200 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2). This wouldn’t be exceeded until 2046 if emissions continue at current levels.

How much the planet warms depends largely on the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, and that depends on how much more of it we emit. Based on this, climate scientists can calculate a carbon budget – the amount of CO2 we can still pump out before warming passes a certain level.

In 2020, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated that the budget for a 50/50 chance of staying below 1.5°C was about 500 GtCO2. Now a team that includes many of the researchers responsible for the IPCC estimate has updated the work.

It estimates that the remaining budget as of January 2023 was around 250 GtCO2. Since then there have been another nine months of emissions, so the remaining budget will already be down to roughly 220 GtCO2.

One of the main reasons for the reduction from 500 to 250 GtCO2 is simply that there have been another three years of emissions since 2020. Most of the rest is due to better estimates of the effects of aerosol pollutants.

These pollutants, such as sulphur dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels, form tiny droplets in the atmosphere that have a cooling effect by reflecting sunlight and altering cloud brightness. There has been a lot of uncertainty about the magnitude of the cooling.

Now, the uncertainties have been narrowed down to the higher side of the range. If aerosol cooling is on the higher side, there will be more warming as fossils fuels are phased out and aerosol pollution falls. That means less CO2 can be emitted if we are to limit temperature rise to a certain level.

The first breach of 1.5°C will be a temporary but devastating failure

“If Lamboll and colleagues are correct, mid-century net-zero targets are insufficient to prevent an overshoot of 1.5°C,” writes Benjamin Sanderson at the Centre for International Climate Research (CICERO) in Norway in a commentary accompanying the study.

Glen Peters, also at CICERO, estimates that global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels will be 1 per cent higher in 2023 than in 2022. While some researchers think emissions could finally start to fall in 2024, Peters isn’t confident that they will peak in 2023.

The carbon budget team doesn’t expect the world to officially pass the 1.5°C threshold until some years after the budget is exceeded, says team member Chris Smith at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria. That will require a temperature increase above 1.5°C averaged over multiple years, rather than just one year.

“It’s highly likely that 2023 will exceed 1.5°C,” Smith says. “But that doesn’t mean that we’ve exceeded 1.5°C in the long term.”

“If we are able to limit warming to 1.6 or 1.65 or 1.7°C, that’s a lot better than 2°C,” he says. “We still need to fight for every tenth of a degree.”

Spine of early crawling fish was becoming more like a land animal's

Scans show that the spine and ribs of Tiktaalik, one of the first fish to crawl on land, had features that are more like those of early land animals than fish

A CT scan of a fossil of Tiktaalik, one of the first fish to crawl on land, has revealed more features of its body that are intermediate between fish and land-dwelling animals. In particular, they show that its fins were becoming connected to its spine, a feature of limbs in land vertebrates, but not of fins in fish.

“That’s an unexpected result given the way we’ve reconstructed this animal in the past,” says Thomas Stewart at Pennsylvania State University.

Stunning photo of rare Malayan tiger snapped by camera trap

With fewer than 150 left in the wild, the Malayan tiger is rarely seen - but images from camera traps provide hope that conservation efforts are paying off

This extraordinary glimpse of one of Malaysia's last remaining tigers provides hope that nationwide efforts to save the species are working.

Since the 1950s, the tiger (Panthera tigris) population in Malaysia has rapidly declined from around 3000 to fewer than 150 individuals today. The main drivers of this fall have been habitat loss from deforestation and poaching for the illegal wildlife trade.

The loss of predators at the top of the food chain could have a catastrophic effect on the forest ecosystem through the uncontrolled proliferation of herbivores, such as deer, that can overgraze the land. To guard against this, the Malaysian government has been working with Indigenous communities and organisations such as WWF to protect the endangered species.

Wildlife photographer Emmanuel Rondeau and members of an anti-poaching patrol team called Project Stampede laid eight high-definition camera traps around the Belum-Temengor forest complex in the northern region of Peninsular Malaysia. After five months, the team found that the cameras had captured some spectacular tiger photos.

""Capturing a photo of a tiger in Malaysia in its natural habitat is a rarity,"" said Becci May at WWF in a statement. ""Yet each image serves as a sign of hope as well as a poignant reminder of the efforts needed to safeguard their future.""

Gravitational waves produce a background hum across the whole universe

After decades of searching, astronomers have found a distinctive pattern of light, from spinning stars called pulsars, that suggests huge gravitational waves are creating gentle ripples in space-time across the universe

By Alex Wilkins

29 June 2023

Pulsars have helped reveal ripples in space-time throughout the universe

NANOGrav

Pulsars have helped reveal ripples in space-time throughout the universe

NANOGrav

The fabric of the universe is constantly rippling, according to astronomers who have discovered a background buzz of gravitational waves. These waves may be produced by supermassive black holes merging across the universe, but they might also have more exotic origins, such as leftover ripples in space-time created shortly after the big bang. Pinning down their true nature could tell us about how supermassive black holes grow and affect their host galaxies, or even about how the universe evolved in its first moments.

To find this mysterious hum, astronomers have been tracking rapidly rotating neutron stars called pulsars that blast out light with extreme regularity. By looking at different pulsars across the Milky Way, astronomers can effectively use them as a galaxy-sized gravitational-wave detector called a pulsar timing array.

While individual gravitational waves, which are ripples in space-time created by massive objects colliding, have been seen regularly since the first detection in 2015, the object of this search is different. Those previous gravitational waves all have a localised origin and rise and fall hundreds of times a second, but the newly-discovered signal is more like a gravitational wave background that would permeate the entire universe at much lower frequencies, similar in concept to the cosmic microwave background, which is radiation left over by the big bang and seen all over the universe today.

How a new kind of gravitational wave will reveal the early universe

In 2021, there were the first hints that the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav), a US-based collaboration that began in 2007 and that uses a pulsar timing array, had detected this gravitational wave background using radio telescopes.

By measuring the light signals from pulsars as they arrive at Earth and checking for tiny time fluctuations that may have been caused by ripples in space-time, astronomers thought they had found signs of a common process affecting all the pulsars' timing in the same way. However, at that time they lacked a telltale signature predicted by Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity that would confirm this cosmic-scale hum.

NANOGrav

Now, after a total 15 years of observations, the NANOGrav team has seen this signature in the signal for the first time, across a range of different gravitational wave frequencies. ""It’s gone from a tantalising hint to something that is very strong evidence for the gravitational wave background,"" says team member James McKee at the University of Hull, UK.

This hasn't passed the statistical threshold that scientists need to call it a definite detection of the gravitational wave background, but astronomers are comfortable calling it very strong evidence, at a 3-sigma level of statistical significance, meaning the odds of such a signal cropping up in the absence of the gravitational wave background are around 1 in 1000.

Three other pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations, consisting of Europe and India (EPTA), China (CPTA) and Australia (PPTA), have also released their results today. The CPTA claims to have found the gravitational wave background at an even higher confidence level than NANOGrav, but for only one frequency, while both EPTA and PPTA are seeing hints of it at a slightly weaker statistical level.

""They're also starting to see this very characteristic correlation signal in their data,"" says NANOGrav team member Megan DeCesar at George Mason University in Virginia. ""We're kind of all seeing it, which is very exciting because that suggests that it is probably real.""

Enormous scale

But confirming these signals and gaining more confidence in them isn't straightforward, says Aris Karastergiou at the University of Oxford. ""It's on an enormous scale, with incredibly difficult data to work with.""

The gravitational wave background is minuscule ""” the strength of the signal that astronomers need to extract compared with the noise that is also picked up at the same time equates to one part in a quadrillion, while the gravitational waves themselves stretch around a light year - more than 9 trillion kilometres - over one wavelength. That is why pulsars, which are suitably spaced and are some of the most sensitive clocks in the universe, are key to this search. If a constant background of gravitational waves is distorting all space-time, then it should also affect all the pulsars' light pulses in the same way, but measuring this isn't easy, due to the many other factors that might affect the timing of the signals from each pulsar in the array.

""We have to be able to account for all of them and that takes a long time,"" says McKee. ""It takes a lot of years of observations, it takes a lot of understanding the noise properties of spin irregularities, the interstellar medium, things like that.""

A supermassive black hole is hurtling away from its home galaxy

It is only now that pulsar timing array teams feel confident enough in their data to be able to spot the distinctive pattern within the signal predicted by general relativity . As astronomers track pairs of pulsars in the sky, the timing differences in the light from them should become broadly less similar as the angle between them grows. This is because the light from pulsars that appear close in the sky will have travelled a similar route to Earth, meaning it experiences a similar path through the gravitational wave background, while light from those that appear further apart will take different paths.

Thanks to a quirk of general relativity, this relationship actually reverses for pulsars that are very separated, with the timing differences becoming more similar as you compare pulsars on opposite sides of the sky. This full pattern can be described using a graph called the Hellings-Downs curve, and it is this pattern that NANOGrav was missing in 2021.

""They couldn't characterise it specifically and say, yes, it's gravitational waves,"" says Carlo Contaldi at Imperial College London. ""But now that they've measured this Hellings-Downs curve, that's really just a smoking gun.""

Competing explanations

So, assuming the signal remains as astronomers gather more data, what is causing the gravitational wave background?

The leading explanation involves pairs of merging supermassive black holes (SMBH), the gargantuan black holes at the centre of many galaxies with masses millions of times that of the sun. Once these objects are locked into orbit around each other, as so-called binaries, their extreme masses should bend space-time in the same frequency range that the pulsar timing arrays seem to be measuring for the gravitational wave background. Because these events happen throughout the universe, both in time and space, the waves they produce should knit together to create a distinctive hum that pervades the cosmos.

""It is inevitable that those [pairs of] supermassive black holes are going to be brought together, eventually, to form binaries,"" says team member Laura Blecha at the University of Florida. ""It's just a question of the timescale on which they would actually come together close enough to produce these gravitational waves that NANOGrav and other pulsar timing arrays could observe.""

The Effelsberg radio telescope in Germany is part of the EPTACopyright:

Tacken/MPIfR

The Effelsberg radio telescope in Germany is part of the EPTACopyright:

Tacken/MPIfR

Though this explanation makes the most sense, when Blecha and her colleagues modelled a gravitational wave background caused by merging supermassive black holes across the universe, they found a slightly different signal to that of NANOGrav, suggesting that these cosmic behemoths are either more massive or more common in the universe than previously thought. If true, this could change our understanding of both galaxy formation and how the universe is structured on large scales.

One way to shore up the supermassive black hole explanation would be to see a gravitational wave background signal growing in strength in a specific portion of the sky, which might be caused by a nearby merger. Australia's PPTA is seeing hints of this in its analysis, but it is still too early to tell.

There is enough uncertainty in the NANOGrav signal that the door is open for alternative explanations, says Nelson Christensen at Carleton College in Minnesota. ""We're going to have hundreds of papers from theorists in the coming days where they're going to be presenting other models.""

One possibility is that the background waves come from defects in the very early universe as it changed phases. The idea is that this left an imprint in space-time, like the cracks that form when water freezes into ice. Another is that the background in fact comprises long-theorised primordial gravitational waves, produced by the universe rapidly expanding shortly after the big bang during a period known as cosmic inflation.

Nothing ruled out

However, the data isn't currently anywhere near precise enough to rule out one scenario or the other, says Pedro Ferreira at the University of Oxford. ""The problem with this topic is, yes, it could be any number of types of new physics, but you can’t really distinguish between them.""

To solve that, we need more data. Recently built telescopes like FAST in China and MeerKAT in South Africa, as well as the Square Kilometre Array, the world's largest telescope that is under construction in Australia and South Africa, will allow us to measure the pulsars more often and with much greater precision. Discovering new and more regular pulsars will also help, says McKee.

Combining the datasets of all the various PTAs in a global collaboration, too, will allow for a more detailed analysis. There are some pulsars that only the Australian telescopes can see, and vice versa for the European ones. An analysis combining all of the results is already under way, says DeCesar, and should be released in the coming years.

""This is a golden era for gravitational waves,"" says Christensen. ""Within about eight years, not only have we detected gravitational waves on the ground, but now we've detected them with a completely other method at a very different frequency ""” this is just super exciting.""

World's smallest baleen whale stays home instead of migrating to feed

The pygmy right whale doesn't go on long migrations for food or reproduction, unlike most other species of baleen whale

The pygmy right whale is the world’s smallest baleen whale, and it doesn’t seem to migrate

Roberto Nistri/Alamy

Pygmy right whales swim in the same waters all year round - a behaviour rarely seen in baleen whales, which typically migrate thousands of kilometres to look for food and mates. The finding offers a rare insight into the behaviour of a whale species we still know very little about, and might inform conservation efforts.

The pygmy right whale (Caperea marginata) is the smallest filter-feeding whale on Earth at just 6.5 metres long. The species…

Naturally formed graphene has been discovered for the first time, in 3.2-billion-year old rocks underneath a South African gold mine. The find could lead to more energy-efficient ways to produce the material, which has a number of useful electronic properties.

Graphene, a one-atom-thick sheet of carbon, was first discovered in 2004 by scientists using sticky tape to take layers off pencil graphite, but scaling up its production has proved difficult. Current industrial methods to make large quantities of graphene require temperatures exceeding 1000°C (1800°F).…

Being vegetarian may be partly determined by your genes

Two genes involved in fat metabolism have been linked with vegetarian diets, suggesting that genetic variants may affect people's ability to tolerate a diet without animal fats

People's likelihood of being vegetarian appears to be influenced by several genetic variants, and two of the three most important genes found so far seem to be involved in fat metabolism.

This hints that some people find it easier to give up meat because they naturally produce certain fat molecules, says Nabeel Yaseen at Northwestern University in Chicago. ""Maybe there's some fat that's essential for some people to have in their diet but not for others,"" he says.

About 5 per cent of people in the UK and US avoid all meat and fish. But surveys indicate that some people who say they are vegetarian still eat meat sometimes. That suggests that some people would like to be vegetarian but find it too hard, says Yaseen.

Genetic factors are known to influence other aspects of diet, such as whether people like coffee or alcohol. To see if genes also affect vegetarianism, Yaseen and his team turned to the UK Biobank, a large study where people filled in lifestyle and medical surveys and had their DNA sequenced. They analysed about 5300 people who said they were strict vegetarians and another 330,000 people who were meat eaters.

Three gene variants were more common in vegetarians. Two, called NPC1 and RMC1, are involved in the transport and metabolism of cholesterol and other fatty molecules called glycolipids. The third gene, called RIOK3, has various functions, including affecting the immune system.

It isn’t known exactly how these genes could relate to vegetarianism. But one of the chief differences between animal-based foods and plant-based ones is the chemical make-up of their fats or oils, collectively known as lipids. Yaseen and his colleagues speculate that some people may function better on a vegetarian diet because they are more able to synthesise certain lipid molecules that are present in meat.

People who try vegetarianism but give up may be doing so because the body becomes deficient in the postulated essential lipids, says Yaseen. ""They decide that this diet is not for them or gradually creep back into an omnivore diet. Some people might think they just don’t have the willpower.""

Yaseen says, however, that another possibility is that the apparently vegetarianism-promoting gene variants affect people's taste. ""A lot of information about genes is yet to be known,"" he says.

Albert Koulman at the University of Cambridge says most research into how food nutrients influence satiety and food choices has focused on proteins rather than fats. ""We don't know enough about [this idea] to either accept or dismiss it,"" he says.

Richard McIlwain at the UK Vegetarian Society says the number of vegetarians has been rising in recent years, almost doubling in the UK between 2012 and 2019. ""That would seem to suggest something other than underlying genetic factors are at play,"" he says.

""People go vegetarian because, more and more, they are concerned about climate, about animal welfare or about their health. Psychological factors, such as tradition, education and awareness of animal suffering in food production, and ""˜taste preferences' are far more important determinants of vegetarianism than any physiological factors,"" says McIlwain.

15 million people live in possible flood path for melting glaciers

Glacial lakes can cause flooding if an ice or rock dam holding back the water fails, putting an estimated 15 million people at risk, an analysis has found

As many as 15 million people live in areas that could be flooded by a natural dam failing at a glacial lake, according to the first global analysis of the hazard.

Tom Robinson at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand and his colleagues identified glacial lakes in satellite imagery. They then determined the number of people living within 50 kilometres of each lake, and within 1 kilometre of the river where water would flow in the event of a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF). These floods can happen when an ice or rock dam holding back a glacial lake fails, or a rock slide sends water sloshing over a natural dam.

The researchers found up to 15 million people could be affected, with 9 million in the Himalayas, 2.5 million in the Andes and 2.2 million in the Alps. More than half of the 15 million live in either India, Pakistan, Peru or China.

Outburst floods are unlikely at many glacial lakes, and the study presents a simplified view of the areas any flooding would affect, says Simon Allen at the University of Zurich in Switzerland, but he says the global view helps draw attention to vulnerable and understudied regions.

Pakistan, for instance, has 2.1 million people living in potentially at-risk areas, but lakes there are less well understood than lakes in nearby Nepal, where the government has built expensive spillways at the most dangerous lakes and installed early warning systems. In some cases, a flood wave from an outburst could arrive in under an hour, with no prior warning.

Lakes in Peru and elsewhere in the Andes mountains, where thousands of people have been killed by glacial lake floods since the 1950s, also haven't received sufficient attention, says Robinson.

Glacial lakes are growing rapidly in number and size as climate change melts more ice, but the frequency of glacial floods has decreased since the 1970s, says Stephan Harrison at the University of Exeter in the UK. As with warming after the 19th-century Little Ice Age, there may be decades of lag between warming and lakes growing large enough for an outburst, he says.

Sea life recovered from Permian mass extinction faster than we thought

A diverse set of fossils from China shows that a complex marine ecosystem existed 251 million years ago, shortly after a mass extinction wiped out most complex life on Earth

Artist’s reconstruction of sea life 1 million years after the “Great Dying”, as shown by fossils from Guiyang, China

Dinghua Yang, Haijun Song

An exceptional assemblage of marine fossils from China seems to show that life in the oceans recovered surprisingly quickly after the biggest mass extinction in Earth's history.

The so-called Great Dying at the end of the Permian Period around 252 million years ago is thought to have been brought about by unusually high volcanic activity that led to ocean acidification and global warming. The disaster was particularly hard on marine life, wiping out more than 80 per cent of life in the oceans.

For a long time, palaeontologists believed that it took around 8 million years for ocean ecosystems to recover from this setback and evolve into the modern form we know today.

Haijun Song at the China University of Geosciences in Wuhan and his colleagues studied the Guiyang Biota, an exceptionally well-preserved group of marine fossils in southern China dating from 251 million years ago, at the start of the Triassic Period. It includes at least 40 different species of fish, clams, ammonites and crustaceans like shrimps and lobsters.

The fossils include representatives of all levels of the food chain, from 1-metre-long predatory coelacanths to tiny, single-celled amoebas. While some major groups of organisms made it through the mass extinction, many others that had been abundant before, such as the trilobites, were lost.

The collection of species looks much like what we see in modern oceans, says Song, apart from the ammonites, which had the bad luck to go extinct along with the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous. This suggests that there was an unexpectedly diverse and complex marine ecosystem in place just 1 million years after the Great Dying. ""In geological history, that's rapid,"" he says.

The ozone layer was destroyed during Earth's biggest mass extinction

Paul Wignall at the University of Leeds, UK, says this fossil collection is full of exciting new discoveries, especially the shrimp and lobster, which hadn’t been seen in the Early Triassic before. But he thinks that the study's authors are overstating the speed of the recovery. While there are lots of different fish, the diversity of species on the seafloor is still rather modest, with some way to go before it would reach modern levels of diversity, he says.

David Bottjer at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, also says that the fossils show an ecosystem still in an early phase of its recovery. ""There's a diversity of things being done in the ecosystem, but they're being done by a skeleton crew,"" he says.

Taken together with other fossil records, Bottjer says this shows that the recovery was probably patchy, with marine communities in some parts of the world recovering more quickly than in others. ""It's the same thing we see in today's environmental crises,"" he says. ""Some places are affected more than others.""

Student uses AI to decipher word in ancient scroll from Herculaneum

A computer science student has discovered the first decipherable word in unopened scrolls from Herculaneum, an ancient Roman town buried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius

By Jeremy Hsu

The Greek word for “purple” has been extracted from a Herculaneum scroll

Vesuvius Challenge

The Greek word for “purple” has been extracted from a Herculaneum scroll

Vesuvius Challenge

Almost 2000 years after they were buried by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79, scrolls from a library in the ancient Roman town of Herculaneum have begun to reveal their secrets. The tightly wrapped papyrus scrolls were charred in the disaster, which also destroyed the nearby town of Pompeii. But by studying 3D X-ray scans of the scrolls, researchers have deciphered a word on one of them: “porphyras”, meaning “purple”.

The breakthrough came from Luke Farritor, a 21-year-old computer science student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. His success involved training an AI to identify nearly invisible ink-like patterns in the 3D scans.

“Seeing Luke’s first word was a shock,” says Michael McOsker at University College London, who was not involved in the discovery. “It was immediately convincing, like ‘Good lord, that’s Greek.'”

Farritor analysed the 3D scans as a competitor in the open-source Vesuvius Challenge, which is awarding a series of prizes for deciphering the scrolls. He submitted his discovery in August.

At almost the same time, Youssef Nader, a data science graduate student at the Free University of Berlin in Germany, independently discovered the same word using a different AI technique to detect possible letter shapes within the scroll image segments. This provided an even clearer picture of the scroll segment, and is already yielding new, clear images of others. McOsker described Nader’s first word snapshot as “even more impressive” than Farritor’s.

The discovery builds on the work of previous Vesuvius Challenge contributors, who designed computational tools for mapping out segments of scroll. It was also made possible because of the 3D X-ray scans produced by a team led by Brent Seales at the University of Kentucky.

In the past, papyrologists could only study the Herculaneum scrolls by physically unrolling them - a process that inevitably damaged the ancient papyri that had been carbonised by the heat of the volcanic debris that buried them, says McOsker. And even once researchers started using 3D imaging and computational techniques to digitally reveal the hidden contents of the scrolls, ""attempts to read the still rolled-up papyri were mirages"", he says.

This latest breakthrough may pave the way for someone to claim the Vesuvius Challenge's grand prize, worth $700,000, by reading four passages of text from inside two intact scrolls before 31 December 2023.

“I’m confident that Luke, Youssef, and the other competitors can solve a whole roll,” says McOsker. “Up until now, all the unrolled papyri that we study are missing their beginnings and are in bad condition, so the prospect of reading a complete text, from beginning to end, is really quite something.”

Preserved droppings may help find new food sources and habitats for the kakapo (Strigops habroptilus), a critically endangered bird native to New Zealand.

These large flightless parrots are like the pandas of the avian world, says Alexander Boast of Manaaki Whenua – Landcare Research in New Zealand. ""They're very adorable and very difficult to get to breed,"" he says.

Rewilding in the Central Apennines: Italy

Contact an expert to book or discuss this tour

Email us to book or discuss

+44 (0)204 587 5024

23 September 2024 – 6 days for £2,795

Journey into Italy’s Central Apennines region and discover a fascinating introduction into the concept and practicalities of rewilding. Spend time tracking wildlife on foot in the company of a specialist nature guide, while learning more about the Rewilding Italy project. In addition to wildlife, experience the region’s ever hospitable people and their culture and delicious cuisine.

Explore the region accompanied by Mario Cipollone from the Rewilding Italy team who will introduce you to the Rewilding projects in the area. Their aim is for the Central Apennines to be a wilder place, with fully functioning coherent ecosystems and abundant wildlife, where natural processes and complete trophic chains play key roles in the regeneration of the landscape.

Large beech forests, many of which are centuries-old and probably among the oldest in Europe, cover the mountain slopes. Among the huge trees and their mossy stems live large populations of wild herbivores like red deer, roe deer and wild boar. These species in many places share their habitats with large herds of semi-wild horses and cattle and together represent the main prey for the wolves, whose density in some Apennine areas is possibly the highest in Europe. The most charismatic and famous inhabitant of the mountain forests here is the Marsican brown bear, an endemic subspecies to this region.

The group size will be limited to a maximum of 14 and you will be accompanied locally by a tour leader and highly skilled local guides.

In partnership with The Ultimate Travel Company.



DAY 1: ROME TO PESCASSEROLI

You will be met on arrival into Rome Airport. From here, journey to the quaint mountain town of Pescasseroli, a journey time of around three hours. Check into to the 4-star Albergo Villino Quintiliani, where three nights are spent. Located in the heart of the village on the edge of Abruzzo National Park, this restored 1920s mansion is surrounded by pretty landscaped gardens and has an excellent traditional Italian restaurant with a terrace where you can dine al fresco overlooking the national park.

Lunch will be under your own arrangements.

The remainder of the afternoon at leisure.

Before dinner, enjoy a presentation by Rewilding Italy, a non-profit organization whose mission is to promote nature conservation through rewilding measures in Italy. Learn about their work in the Central Apennines region, the second main mountain range of Italy, characterised by a rich diversity of ecosystems and wildlife species and important habitats including beech woods, open hillsides and alpine grasslands.

Afterwards, enjoy a welcome dinner with the group.

DAY 2: VISIT PETTORANO SUL GIZIO - THE FIRST BEAR SMART COMMUNITY

After breakfast, you will be transferred to Pettorano sul Gizio, the first bear smart community in Italy to learn about how bears and local communities can coexist. By reducing the damage caused by the bears, and by allowing communities to benefit from it, local people will become ambassadors for the area’s wild nature. Rewilding Italy are focused on reducing bear mortality and conflict, supporting nature-based enterprises in and around corridor areas, and raising awareness amongst local communities and people visiting the area.

Here, you will be guided through the measures being taken. You will see how they have dramatically reduced bear damage and increased social acceptance of them through the installation of about 100 electric fences since 2015, along with the deployment of bear-proof waste bins. See just why and how these corridors are vital to the protection of the local community as much as the bears themselves as we visit local entrepreneurs, farmers and shepherds in the region to hear their stories about how wolves and bears are part of the area, and of their lives.

Lunch at a local restaurant.

You will have a unique opportunity to see an active camera trap located in the beautiful Monte Genzana Alto Gizio Reserve and some of its previous data which has hopefully captured some footage. Late afternoon, you will return to your hotel for dinner.

DAY 3: ABRUZZO NATIONAL PARK

In the early morning, you will visit Abruzzo National Park to look for wolves and other wildlife in the valley. Here, you will learn about the human and wildlife conflict in this region and the processes being taken to mitigate this. The Apennine chamois, the Marsican brown bear, the griffon vulture, the Italian wolf, the European otter and the whiteclawed crayfish are some of the key species whose comeback and spread would enhance the restoration of trophic chains and boost natural processes.

Enjoy lunch at a local restaurant.

This afternoon, transfer to Civitella Alfedena to visit the Apennine wolf museum to learn about the wolf and its habits. There will be time to relax this afternoon before another wildlife walk in the evening to visit a local bear smart enterprise. Dinner at the hotel.

DAY 4: VIST BEAR SMART COMMUNITY – ORTONA DEI MARSI

Today, you will visit another of the regions bear corridors at the Bear smart community of Ortona dei Marsi accompanied by a Rewilding Apennines expert for insight into the project. Witness the work being done to reintroduce the Marsican brown bear into these areas, ensuring bears and humans can coexist peacefully.

Enjoy lunch at a local restaurant.

In the afternoon, visit a local cidery to learn more about the processes required and sample some of the different ciders produced. Transfer to Barisciano and check-in to the 3-star Convento di San Colombo Hotel, where you will spend the next two nights.

DAY 5: GRAN SASSO NATIONAL PARK

In the morning, you will depart to one of the Gran Sasso the Bear smart communities, where the first male bears are expanding towards. Focus on how different bear smart community perceive bears.

Afterwards, you will have the opportunity to explore Gran Sasso National Park, one of the largest protected and most biologically diverse areas of Europe, which centres around the Gran Sasso mountain peak which, at 2,912 metres (9,554 feet), is the highest peak in the Apennines. Gran Sasso National Park is covered by woods of beeches, firs, turkey oaks and chestnuts, The park contains more than 2,000 plant species, some found exclusively in this area, such as the Abruzzo Edelweiss.

In the afternoon, visit the small fortified market town of Capestrano. The historic town is dominated by the 13th century Castello Piccolomini which was built in a strategic position on the hill overlooking the Tirino River. Continue to the enchanting medieval village of Navelli, known for its saffron production and narrow winding streets with steps carved directly into the rock.

Return to the hotel for a final meal with the group.

DAY 6: PESCASSEROLI TO ROME FOR DEPARTURE

In the morning, depart Pescasseroli and drive to Rome, a journey of around three hours.

On arrival into Rome, you will be transferred to the aiport. Alternatively, you can extend you time in Italy with a couple of days exploring Rome. Please speak to one of the team at the Ultimate Travel Company for suggestions.

Mario Cipollone

Mario Cipollone was born in Pescara, Italy, on 18 March 1981. He has always been passionate about nature and has volunteered for environmental organisations since childhood. In 2008, Mario graduated in International Political Science. In 2012, following growing concern about the decline of the Marsican brown bear, Mario became the co-founder of Salviamo l'Orso with the goal of preserving the endangered brown bear subspecies endemic to the central Apennines. His commitment to wildlife, the natural environment and bear conservation has earned Mario and the organisations he is part of numerous awards, publications and contributions both nationally and internationally.

Since 2018 Mario has been the team leader of Rewilding Apennines, where his main tasks include planning and managing actions to rewild ecosystems and trophic chains. His ecological experience and passion for wildlife perfectly reflect Rewilding Europe's philosophy and policies. As a bottom-up environmentalist, Mario is aware that rewilding goals can only be achieved through the involvement of local communities in the process of conservation, raising awareness of the value of biodiversity and natural heritage, and developing nature-based economies.

People in coastal areas across Europe have been eating seaweed for thousands of years, traces of algae on their teeth have revealed.

There are over 10,000 species of seaweeds that grow close to coastlines around the world. Today, many of these organisms are considered a health food, particularly in Asia, with around 145 regularly eaten species.

""Seaweed is great. It’s available, it’s nutritious, it’s local, it’s renewable,"" says Karen Hardy at the University of Glasgow in the UK.

There is little evidence for seaweed being a part of ancient diets, apart from at one site in Chile from about 14,000 years ago.

Hardy and her colleagues first discovered traces of seaweed in the calcified plaque on human teeth found at a Neolithic burial site in Orkney, Scotland, dating back around 5000 years.

""We were absolutely astonished,"" says Hardy. ""This is the first time anyone’s ever detected specific evidence for the consumption of seaweed [in dental plaque].""

After these initial findings, the team decided to expand their study to the rest of Europe. In total, they collected dental plaque samples from 74 individuals from 28 ancient sites in countries such as Spain, Portugal, Estonia and Lithuania.

Of these, 33 individuals had the chemical traces of seaweed or freshwater aquatic plants in their plaque. Those who were buried nearer to the coast were more likely to have evidence of seaweed consumption, while those inland tended to eat freshwater aquatic plants.

The results show that people ate seaweed and marine plants from the Mesolithic, around 8000 years ago, right through to the start of the Middle Ages, around 1500 years ago. This suggests that these foods may well have been a staple part of ancient Europeans' diet for several millennia.



Kelp is coming: How seaweed could prevent catastrophic climate change

From providing a green alternative to plastics to reducing methane emissions and sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, seaweed could be the secret ingredient we need to clean up our planet

Since then, seaweed seems to have fallen out of fashion in Europe, says Hardy. ""But it would be nice if this study could help to encourage a wider consumption of seaweed in Europe today.""

""This study is important for documenting the early consumption of this abundant maritime food source,"" says Tom Dillehay at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. ""The presence of seaweeds in early European sites does not surprise me. I think that in many previous archaeological studies around the world, it was not a dietary element many people expected and thus [they] likely gave little [notice] to it.""

Around 1.4 million years ago, ancient humans in Spain used to scavenge for food at a site that also served as a latrine for giant hyenas.

Fuente Nueva 3 in south-eastern Spain is one of the oldest archaeological sites in Europe associated with ancient hominins. As well as a large collection of primitive stone tools, excavations at the site have uncovered hundreds of examples of fossilised faeces, known as coprolites.

Peanut toothpaste shows promise at preventing allergic reactions

A toothpaste that contains peanut proteins did not cause any serious side effects in people with an allergy to the food and showed early signs of preventing dangerous reactions

A toothpaste infused with peanut proteins could help to prevent serious reactions in people with a peanut allergy. The treatment has passed a safety trial in adults, with the researchers now hoping to test how effective it is among children with the allergy.

Peanuts are one of the most common allergy-causing foods, affecting millions of people in the US and UK, says William Berger at the University of California, Irvine. ""There's a real unmet medical need and, other than avoidance, there are very few treatments available,"" he says.

In a bid to fill that gap, Berger and his colleagues have developed a toothpaste that contains peanut proteins, in the hope it could train someone's immune system to tolerate the food.

To test its safety, the team enlisted 32 adults with a peanut allergy. Of those, 24 were asked to use the peanut toothpaste, while the rest were given the same toothpaste but without the peanut proteins, acting as a placebo. All of the participants were instructed to brush their teeth every morning for 2 minutes with a pea-sized amount of either the peanut or placebo toothpaste, and to use their usual toothpaste in the evening.

At the start of the study, the peanut toothpaste contained just 1 milligram of peanut proteins per pea-sized dose, which was gradually increased over the 48-week trial to 80 milligrams - equivalent to the amount found in a third of a typical peanut.

The study – which will be presented on 11 November at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology's meeting in Anaheim, California – found that none of the participants experienced any moderate or severe reactions to either toothpaste. About half of those in the peanut-toothpaste group reported temporary itching in their mouths, which didn’t occur in the placebo group.

Berger told New Scientist that at the end of the 48 weeks, three of the participants in the peanut-toothpaste group were exposed to 300 milligrams of peanut proteins. None of them experienced any degree of allergic reaction, he says.

Having shown its safety, the team hopes to further test the toothpaste's effectiveness in around 80 children. ""We hope to see efficacy because children typically have a stronger immune response than adults,"" says Berger.

Berger believes toothpastes could have potential as a unique way of preventing allergic reactions, given that people use them as part of their daily dental hygiene routine, he says.

Geese are breeding at a former nuclear weapons test site in the Arctic

Thousands of pink-footed geese have begun migrating to a remote Arctic island to breed, showing some migratory birds can adapt rapidly to a warming world

By Michael Le Page

1 March 2023

Pink-footed geese are migrating to a new breeding ground in the Arctic

Pink-footed geese are migrating to a new breeding ground in the Arctic

JÃ¼rgen Peter Kjeldsen

Some pink-footed geese have begun migrating to the Arctic island of Novaya Zemlya in the summer to breed, nearly 1000 kilometres away from their usual breeding site on the island of Svalbard.

Conditions on Novaya Zemlya, a Russian island in the Arctic, used to be too cold for breeding geese. But with spring conditions coming earlier in the year because of global warming, the island has become suitable, says Jesper Madsen at Aarhus University in Denmark. Over 15 years or so, this population has established a new migration route to Novaya Zemlya and new stop-over points along the way.

“It’s a huge surprise,” says Madsen. “It’s really amazing to see this.”

Some other birds have been changing their ranges in response to global warming, but this is the most dramatic shift of this kind ever observed in a migratory bird, he says.

There are two populations of pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus). One overwinters in the UK and Ireland and migrates to Iceland and Greenland to breed in summer.

The other overwinters in the Netherlands and Denmark, migrating to Svalbard to breed. In spring, this population flies along most of the length of Norway, resting in places, before the long flight over the sea to Svalbard. The birds return along this route in autumn.

But, in the 1990s, people began spotting individuals and small flocks of pink-footed geese in southern Sweden during spring and autumn. By the 2000s, larger flocks were frequently being spotted.

To find out where they were going, in 2018 and 2019, Madsen and his colleagues put GPS tags on 21 geese. Half of them flew to a part of Novaya Zemlya that was used for testing nuclear bombs up until 1990. Not even Russian biologists are allowed to go there, says Madsen, so their presence wouldn’t have been discovered without the GPS trackers.

These birds are migrating over Sweden and Finland rather than flying along Norway, and the GPS data also shows that the birds are nesting there. Many are returning with offspring.

!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var a in e.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[""datawrapper-height""][a]+""px""}}}))}();

The researchers estimate that the Novaya Zemlya population has grown to around 4000 birds already. Because of routine non-GPS tagging of some birds along the Denmark to Svalbard route, they have been able to tell that some of these geese were previously travelling to Svalbard and have switched routes, with young geese mostly likely to change.

Geese may have been the first birds to be domesticated 7000 years ago

The team's hypothesis is that these geese learned the new migration by copying taiga bean geese (Anser fabalis). Some taiga bean geese fly to Novaya Zemlya in late spring to moult and replace their flight feathers, rather than to breed.

""That's the best explanation we have,"" says Madsen. If correct, it would be a rare example of cultural knowledge transmission occurring between species.

Madsen thinks the shift is happening not just because of the warming of Novaya Zemlya, but also because of increasing difficulties with the traditional migration route. Pink-footed geese are now having to compete with barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) for food at stop-overs, and changes in farming practices are also reducing food availability.

""This is a really neat study that combines traditional, old-school bird observations and counting, with tagging, GPS and climate data, to uncover a remarkable new story,"" says Richard Gregory at the RSPB Centre for Conservation Science in the UK, who wasn't involved in the study.

""On the one hand, it provides hope that migratory bird species might be able to respond to climate change over relatively short periods, but raises alarm bells over the pace of change,"" he says.

New Scientist Live, the world's greatest festival of ideas and discovery, is returning to ExCeL London from Saturday 7 until Sunday 8 October, with a dedicated Schools' Day on Monday 9 October. There is a stunning line-up of more than 50 speakers, five stages and a wide array of exhibitors and experiences. Whether you are interested in deep oceans, distant galaxies, mental health, technology or ancient humans, there will be something to entertain and educate you, but here is what seven members of the New Scientist editorial staff are most looking forward to seeing there.

Alison Flood
Comment & Culture EditorThis is my first time at New Scientist Live and there's so much to choose from, but I'll definitely be at Claudia Hammond's talk on the science of kindness, in the hope of picking up some tips. I'm also looking forward to Alice Roberts's history of Britain through burials and to Lucy Cooke's myth-busting look at female animals. My kids will be coming along too and are very excited about seeing Maddie Moate in the flesh - Maddie's Do You Know? has been a staple in our house for years. And I have to mention Laline Paull, the brilliant author of our recent New Scientist Book Club pick Pod. This novel is told from the perspective of a dolphin, and she will be telling me about how she managed to imagine herself into the mind of a cetacean. Come and join us, and the book club while you're at it!

Graham Lawton
Staff writerI'd really like to see University of Cambridge psychologist Sander van der Linden's talk on psychological vaccines against misinformation - it's a topic close to my heart, having just written a feature on it. Unfortunately, I can't because I'll be on a different stage at the same time, interviewing Feargal Sharkey about his tireless campaign to clean up Britain's rivers. So, I'll have to watch Sander on catch-up after the show. But once I'm done with Feargal (I think he'll be doing most of the talking), I'll head over to the Universe Stage for Amy Smith and Mike Cook's talk on generative AI, which I really ought to know more about.

Video editor/social video internThis will be my first New Scientist Live in London and I've been looking forward to it ever since I started! There are so many amazing talks on offer, but I am particularly looking forward to the talks on the Future Stage and discovering how science will shape the coming decades. Having wanted to be a forensic scientist in a past life and working recently on a video project about artificial intelligence and forensic anthropology, I am excited to learn more from Niamh Nic Daeid about how cutting-edge technology can be used to investigate crime scenes.

Assistant news editorFor me, and my children, the highlights of New Scientist Live tend to be the experiences, and I can't wait to take a ride in cutting-edge virtual reality, see the 7-metre model of Mars created by artist Luke Jerram, meet Spot the robotic dog, marvel at the night sky in a pop-up planetarium and try a flintknapping workshop. Assuming we're not too worn out, top of my list of talks to see are former colleague Sally Adee on the Mind & Body Stage revealing the surprising role of electricity in our bodies and physicist Jim Al-Khalili talking about how thinking scientifically can help navigate today's world, which should be mandatory viewing for everyone, and particularly politicians.

Leah Crane
Physics & space reporterI'm travelling all the way from Chicago for New Scientist Live this year, and I absolutely can't wait. On Sunday, Chelsea Whyte and I are putting on the first-ever live episode of New Scientist's newest podcast, Dead Planets Society, where we take our wildest ideas about how to tinker with the cosmos and invite expert scientists to put our flights of fancy under the scrutiny of real physics. In the live episode, we're going to try to make the worst possible world for life, and I couldn't be more excited. Ironically, I'm also hosting the Our Planet Stage on Monday, where we'll have some fascinating talks on the best planet for life (as far as we know). Plus, we'll be talking directly to an astronaut aboard the International Space Station.

Sam Wong Assistant news editorI'm thrilled to be hosting the Our Planet Stage on Sunday, where we have a cracking line-up. Alice Roberts will no doubt draw a big crowd for her talk about the ancient people of Britain and what we can learn from their burials and DNA. I'm excited to hear Kit Franklin describing the future of food production, and how technology can reduce the environmental impact of farming. I'm also looking forward to Simon Sharpe's talk on how we need to rethink our response to climate change - hopefully some fresh ideas will leave us feeling inspired and optimistic.

Features editorHaving visited the Parkes radio telescope in Australia earlier this year, I'm particularly looking forward to Emma Chapman's talk on astronomy. Parkes is a radio observatory that was used to help track Apollo 11 astronauts on their way to the moon - and happens to be home to the huge 64-metre dish from the 2000 film The Dish. These days, its main use is spotting and studying rapidly rotating neutron stars called pulsars. With the recent news about radio observatories like Parkes finding a background hum of gravitational waves that permeates the universe, I can't wait to hear what Emma's going to share about the radio universe and the future of radio astronomy.

How a campaign to keep fossil fuels underground is gaining traction

A radical new proposal wants the world to sign up to a deal to halt development of new oil, gas and coal fields. It is already backed by thousands of scientists and more than 70 city governments, says Graham Lawton

JUST over a year ago, climate activists were breathing a sigh of relief at news that a planned new oilfield in the North Sea, Cambo, was to be shelved after investor Shell pulled out. At the time, New Scientist speculated this might “mark the end of new oil and gas extraction in the region”.

If only. Last month, the UK government confirmed that it will press ahead with new rounds of licensing for oil and gas. A decision is also pending on an oilfield called Rosebank, the largest undeveloped resource in the North Sea.

On the surface this looks…

Early hominin Paranthropus may have used sophisticated stone tools

Stone tools discovered in Kenya are the oldest Oldowan-type implements found, dating back at least 2.6 million years, and they may have been made by our relative Paranthropus

A set of stone tools found in Kenya is the oldest of its kind, and one of the oldest known to have been made by ancient hominins. The find adds to the evidence for widespread tool use relatively early in human evolution.

The artefacts were found with two teeth belonging to hominins called Paranthropus. They weren’t thought to make tools because their teeth were well-suited to chewing food, but the new find suggests they actually did make and use stone tools.

The finds come from Nyayanga on the north-eastern shore of Lake Victoria in Kenya. Tom Plummer at Queens College, City University of New York first learned of them more than 20 years ago, when he was working at another archaeological dig nearby. There, team member Blasto Onyango at the National Museums of Kenya in Nairobi mentioned a different site with similar tools. ""We surveyed,"" says Plummer, ""we saw some material on the surface"", but it took until 2015 to begin full excavations.

The team has since recovered 330 stone artefacts. They include the heavy cores of pebbles, used for pounding, and sharp cutting flakes that had been removed from them. The tools are a type known as Oldowan, named for Oldupai gorge in Tanzania where the first examples were found.

Based on analyses of the sediments in which the Nyayanga tools were found, and the types of fossils found with them, the team estimates they are between just over 3 million and 2.6 million years old. ""We think it's in the older end of that range,"" says Plummer. This would make them the oldest Oldowan tools on record. Previously, the oldest known examples were those from Ledi-Geraru in Ethiopia, which are from 2.6 million years ago.

The Nyayanga tools were used to process a variety of foods, says Rahab Kinyanjui, also at the National Museums of Kenya. The team found bones of hippopotamus-like animals, some of which had cut marks on them, suggesting the tools were used for butchery. The heavier implements were also used to pound plant materials like tubers and fruit.

Finding evidence of Oldowan tool use this early in Kenya, and 1300km from Ledi-Geraru in Ethiopia, suggests stone tool use was already widespread, says Plummer. In line with this, stone tools have been found in Algeria from 2.4 million years ago.

The use of such implements is primarily associated with the Homo genus, which includes our own species Homo sapiens, as well as older ones like Homo erectus. The oldest purported Homo remains are 2.8 million years old, but none have been found at Nyayanga. The only hominin remains there so far are of Paranthropus.

Paranthropus lived alongside other hominins, including Homo, for over a million years. However, it is generally thought that they have no living descendants. Compared with other hominins from the same time, they looked less like us: in particular, they had very large teeth, perhaps for grinding up tough plant foods.

""The thing about Paranthropus is they've got a really specialised anatomy,"" says Plummer. ""They've got the biggest jaws and teeth of any primate that ever lived, for their weight."" He says it is unlikely that a tool-using animal would need such powerful chewing apparatus. Nevertheless, it is the only hominin found at Nyayanga so far, so he says it is worth seriously considering that Paranthropus made and used the tools.

Others are less hesitant. ""People are very shy about saying that it was not Homo something, Homo habilis or whatever, making tools,"" says Margherita Mussi of the Italo-Spanish Archaeological Mission at Melka Kunture and Balchit, based in Rome. She points out that several modern primates sometimes make crude stone tools, including chimpanzees and various monkeys. ""So why not a Paranthropus?""

If that is true, it would fit with other evidence that species of Homo were not the only hominins that made stone tools. The oldest known stone tools of any kind, at 3.3 million years old, are from Lomekwi in Kenya. They are cruder than Oldowan versions and were made in a different way: by hitting rocks on the ground, rather than by hitting a rock held in the hand.

""We have no genus Homo at that time,"" says Sonia Harmand at Stony Brook University in New York, one of the discoverers of the Lomekwi tools. ""We already know that the first stone tools were probably not made by Homo."" Australopithecus species are likely candidates.

For the later Nyayanga tools, there were probably late Australopithecus, early Paranthropus and early Homo in the region. ""We have to imagine it's all these species probably sharing the same territory or the same environment at the same time,"" says Harmand.

Studies like these suggest tool use goes back further than we thought, says Plummer. ""We're going to be pushing tool use further back in time,"" he says. Furthermore, ""tool use was more important earlier on than we realised"".

In line with this, Mussi and her colleagues showed last month that some hominins were making obsidian tools in organised ""workshops"" 1.2 million years ago, 500,000 years earlier than thought. ""I think that we are systematically under-evaluating hominins,"" says Mussi.

Ultra-tough battery survives hammer blows and being run over by a car

A hydrogel battery that can perform well at below-freezing temperatures and survive all sorts of damage could keep phones working even when conditions get tough

A flexible battery made from hydrogel can withstand being run over by a car, blows from a hammer and temperatures as low as âˆ’77°C (-106.6°F). It could potentially be used in phones or wearable electronics.

Most commercial batteries are solid and based on lithium, but these can be easily damaged in accidents and cope badly at very cold temperatures.

Now, Ximin He at the University of California, Los Angeles, and her colleagues have developed a hydrogel…
