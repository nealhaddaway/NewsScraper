Mirror writer Nia Dalton spent a day shadowing Somerset farmer Josh Gay to see what he gets up to in 24 hours - from herding sheep to weighing cattle and eating with the seasons

Driving through the country lanes of Somerset, I've never felt more like a city girl. My car struggles to get up the narrow, muddy hills and my nose quickly adapts to the strong smell of manure at 8am. It's a world away from my comfort zone at a desk but I'm excited to take it in - cow poo and all.

As soon as I come face-to-face with farmer Josh Gay, he takes one look at my ankle wellies and gold hooped earrings and laughs, so I have a sneaky suspicion I'm not going to be cut out for farm life. Still, I'm here to learn what it's like to live as a modern-day farmer, and Josh is just that.

At 28-years-old, he is already running the family business at Newton Farm, and he's passionate about regenerative agriculture and embracing new ways of working. His team of four are all between the ages of 16 and 30, representing a new generation of farmers in a career that typically lacks interest from teens.

""It's harder to attract new people into the industry because we can't match wages that supermarkets can - especially if they're unskilled,"" Josh explains to me. Josh is the fourth generation of the Gay family to proudly run the mixed farm, following in the footsteps of his parents, Hugh and Celia - and his passion is infectious.

""I always wanted to be a cowboy when I was younger. Then when I turned 16, my parents asked me if I wanted to take over the farm one day,"" he says, giving me a tour of the barn. As we get up close and personal with the cows, Josh tells me they're his favourite animal because ""they all have personalities"" - and I can see what he means.

While I'm enjoying meeting a sow that's about to give birth to piglets, it quickly becomes apparent that we've got a lot of work to do. There's a frozen pipe, broken machinery and fences that need building at the farm shop, so we grab a chainsaw and ear defenders and climb into his tractor.

""I've knocked myself out before and put a chainsaw through my foot - but I've still got all 10 toes. Dad only has nine,"" Josh tells me, revving up the power tool. Looking down at my frozen feet, I'm hopeful that I'll return home with a full set today - though we've got a while to go.

At this time of year, Josh tends to work 8am to 6pm, and wakes up at 4:30am once a week to go to the abattoir. During lambing season, which is his favourite time of year, he can work as long as 5am to 11pm, and recalls once falling asleep in the hay. But when he does make it home in time for tea, he'll shower and join the rest of the nation watching Love Island - how could he not with farmer Will on the show?

As the morning passes, it becomes apparent that I'm not cut out for lifting logs, but I'm more than capable of tidying the barn, so he hands me a broom. Josh tells me that ""every single day is different"" and there's always a new skill to learn - which is so important for the future of farming.

""Farmers need to be able to adapt as things evolve. It's easy to stay in the past but you always have to move forward with the times,"" he explains. ""It's a lot more scientific than people realise - not just growing crops but rearing animals. We look at energy within the food composition, dry matter, soil health and micronutrients. It's really not just shovelling in a field.""

Talking about modern engineering, Josh tells me: ""There's lots of robots that will do picking, feeding and milking and I do think there's a place for them in farming. ""Robots solve a labour crisis but there's always things you can't do with a machine, so it's better to not rely on them."" While there's no robots at Newton Farm, Josh does have workers Liam, Tom and Paige who make up the extra members of the Gay family.

Around midday, I'm tasked with herding sheep from one field to another, which sounds like an easy task but proves to be otherwise. Stella the sheepdog is still in training and she's not much use - but then again, neither am I.

Walking at a fast pace and shaking a bag of dry food, I shout out ""come on, let's get moving"" to the sheep. They stare back at me quizzically and find every excuse to go AWOL, cheekily escaping down lanes and refusing to follow me in an orderly fashion. But we finally get them where they're meant to be, and I get rewarded with a lunch at the farm shop - a part of the day I could definitely get used to.

""It's very important to eat local. The UK is only 60 percent food efficient, meaning if we were to lose all our imports, we'd be out of food by August,"" Josh says. ""It's even more important to eat seasonally and stop expecting farmers to have strawberries and avocados all year round when they're not available. Right now, purple sprouting broccoli, carrots, lettuce, squashes and pumpkins are all seasonal.""

Josh explains that the farm is insecticide-free and they produce their own fertiliser - which all helps towards a sustainable future. Talking about a disconnect between food and farms, he tells me that we should all have to study agriculture in school like students in New Zealand do.

In the afternoon, we head back to the barn to weigh the calves and check they are all healthy, and I find myself stuck in the middle of the pen with no way out. ""You're not scared of cows, are you?"" Josh shouts over the constant mooing - if I wasn't before, I could be now.

When our final task is complete, I've racked up nearly 30,000 steps and I'm absolutely shattered. Though looking out at the sunset across the farm, I feel accomplished. Before I get into my car, I have one last question for Josh - and I'm almost certain his answer is going to be 'no'.

""You could definitely be a farmer. You showed the right willingness to get stuck in and you weren't afraid of much,"" he says. ""Every farmer needs to have grit, good work ethic and drive. Looking after the livestock is really important and has to be a priority too."" Despite his enthusiasm, I drive back down the country roads feeling a tad thankful that I won't have to put my wellies back on the following morning - but it sure was a lot of fun.

It comes as a third of Brits admit they are unsure what farmers really do - but two-thirds would like to learn more about where their food really comes from

Radio host Roman Kemp spent the day on a farm - to learn more about regenerative farming methods, and how farmers produce the food we eat.

It comes as two-thirds of Brits (65%) say they are keen to learn more about where their food really comes from - with a third admitting they are not sure what farmers actually do.

A poll of 2,000 adults found that many were surprised to learn that farming also involves analysing data, and taking a science-led approach to their daily tasks and duties.

And, while one in three are aware that farming is important, a quarter simply assume that a farmer's main role is to tend to livestock - rather than being involved in the production of fruit and vegetables.

In fact, it is adults over the age of 65 who are more knowledgeable about what regenerative farming means.

And McCain, which commissioned the research, sent Roman Kemp to a Rectory Farm in Oxfordshire, to learn about the farming practice, and how it can help the environment.

The Capital Breakfast radio host learned about the new practices that farmer Imogen Stanley, 32, is introducing at the farm, including planting wildflowers to attract birds and insects that help keep bad bugs at bay.

He also met soil health expert, Liz Stockdale, to understand more about how moving the soil less helps to keep it healthy.

Roman Kemp said: ""I got to ride in the tractor, and even met a soil health expert - who knew there was such a job!

""I learnt about methods including crop rotation to improve soil health, and wildflower planting to keep bad bugs at bay, as well as how McCain will be training and funding all its farmers in regenerative practices to ensure the future of our beloved chips.""

Respondents estimated only a third (34%) of their weekly food shop has been made or produced in an environmentally friendly way - however, 26% simply weren't sure how much was or wasn't.

And 31% put their trust in big businesses to make the right decisions when it comes to where their food is sourced, so they don't have to.

However, 42% admitted they have a bit of a ""sustainable blind spot"" when it comes to buying food, with a third rarely - or never - checking food packaging to make sure it's environmentally friendly.

But it is Gen Z respondents who were most likely to consider what effects the products they buy in the supermarket have on the environment, with 68% wanting to make informed choices.

Interestingly, over half (52%) of those polled, via OnePoll, do not realise that farming could have a positive role in tackling climate change.

However, some of the most common misconceptions that respondents had heard about farming included greenhouse gas emissions being higher than any other sector - and that a role in this area doesn't require any educational background.

Mark Hodge, from McCain Foods UK&I, added: ""Climate change is a real concern, especially for young people. We all want to do our bit to help, but on an individual level, the scale of change needed can feel overwhelming.

""We're hugely proud of our commitment to 100% regenerative farming by 2030. As more and more of our growers adopt these methods with the help of training and funding that we provide, consumers are able to chip in and support more sustainable farming.""

Between 1955 and 1995, more than 70,000 West African children were privately fostered by White Britons, and many of them have lived with the long-lasting impact

When Ore Ogungbayi was little, like many children, she asked her parents where babies come from. ""My mummy told me, ""˜You get them from a catalogue',"" she says.

In Ore's case, this was the truth. Her British parents had seen her baby photo in a newspaper, advertised by her Nigerian parents for private fostering while they studied in the UK. ""After an interview with my Nigerian parents, they fostered me from two months old until I was seven,"" Ore, now 57, says.

""I thought they were my parents. I knew they loved me - they had given me so much love. It never occurred to me that they were White and I was Black - or that the people who sometimes visited were my real parents."" Between 1955 and 1995, more than 70,000 West African children were privately fostered by White Britons, in a practice known as ""˜farming'.

Many of them have lived with the long-lasting impact of this controversial and unregulated practice on their life and identity ever since - often in silence. Ore's experience of ""˜farming' ended abruptly when her mum and dad panicked that her British foster parents were about to try to adopt her.

""They kidnapped me,"" she says simply. ""They invited me to a Christmas party in London, took me outside to see the rocking horse they said they had bought me and told me to get in the car. There was no rocking horse. They took me to Nigeria, a country I knew nothing about. It was very traumatic. They told me my foster parents had moved and I couldn't get in touch with them.""

Yewande Ogunnaike, 60, was farmed out at two months old with her twin sister, and moved between families. ""The first place I really remember was Leicester and I just remember darkness,"" she says. ""It was so bad we had to be removed by social services.

""I remember darkness and being beaten so badly. I don't remember the sexual abuse, but I know it happened there. I remember a cigarette being put out underneath my chin. I was beaten so hard that I wet myself, and I was forced to lick it up off the lino floor. I remember ""˜n*****', ""˜n*****', ""˜n*****'.

""I remember they made me sleep in the bath because I wet the bed, with the dog's blanket for warmth."" Yewande's mother had come from Nigeria to the UK to study, before an arranged marriage back home. In London, she met and married a Nigerian architecture student, bringing shame on her well-known Royal family.

Yewande and her twin sister escaped their foster parents, but came home to find a second set of twins had been fostered, and their father had left for a new family. Their mother was unable to cope. ""In 1970 I was taken into care and sent to a children's home at the centre of a paedophile ring,"" she says. ""There was constant sexual abuse and rape.""

Her life since has been a battle for survival, and a fight to bring up her own children alone, one of whom has complex needs. But Yewande is determined her abusive childhood will not define her. ""I want to say that this is not a story of victimhood,"" she says. ""It's a story of surviving and ultimately thriving.""

Ore and Yewande were among fostered British-Nigerians brought together by film-maker Andy Mundy-Castle for a new feature documentary White Nanny, Black Child which tells the story of the complex legacy of farming. ""Across the decades, 100,000 people may have been privately fostered in this way,"" Mundy-Castle says of his film, which invited people with experience of the private fostering scheme to a retreat with the support of psychotherapy and well-being professionals.

""I have friends who had this experience - and to many people it's just something that happened in their childhood. But when I was going on my own personal journey of identity, I became more and more interested in it. I'm British-Nigerian, so it's unifying the story of me.""

The result is an emotionally arresting film, which will be screened at the Brixton Ritzy in South London over the weekend and on Channel 5 next Tuesday. Private fostering is hinted at in the autobiographies of the musician Seal and at hlete Kriss Akabusi but, until recently, the accounts of ""˜farmed children' went largely unrecorded.

Shola Amoo's semi-autobiographical film, The Last Tree was one of the first to tackle it in 2019. Now Mundy-Castle hopes his film will bring the experiences of tens of thousands of people into the light. When Ore was in her late teens, she returned to the UK. ""My experiences with my British family were beautiful,"" she tells me. ""It was my own mum who kidnapped me.""

Aged 21, she went to her foster parents' house. ""I had a speech prepared to ask where the family had gone,"" she says. ""My foster dad opened the door. I wasn't prepared for that. I was in shock. He recognised me straight away. ""˜Ore,' he said. ""˜I'd bought you a coat for Christmas and I was waiting to give it to you when you went'. He said my British mum had to be sedated when she found out I had been taken.""

Before the foster couple passed away, Ore visited with her mother so they could make peace. ""My mum was terrified,"" she says. ""But it was OK."" Over the years, she has come to understand that her Nigerian mum also acted out of love. ""But many people were hurt along the way.""

Researchers at the University of Warwick were looking for ways to solve the labour shortage after The National Farmers' Union found two in five farmers have lost crops because there was no one to pick them

Say hello to a high-tech beast of the field that's set to save our struggling farms.

This four-legged robot dog known as Spot and an AI crop-monitoring vehicle called Crombot are possible solutions to farm labour shortages. A survey found that 40% of farmers have lost crops because there was no one to pick them. More than £60million worth of food was wasted in the first half of 2022 alone, says the National Farmers' Union.

Crombot is a four-wheeled greenhouse helper with a camera on a telescopic arm. It can tell if crops are ripe, detect pests and diseases, and has already been used to harvest strawberries in a trial dubbed ""Robocrop"" at the University of Warwick. Researchers also bought a £90,000 robot dog to try out automated harvesting and planting.

""Spot"" was designed by Boston Dynamic to cope with terrain like muddy fields. Project chief Alex Keller said: ""Spot could be an ideal solution for an agricultural monitoring robot, but is currently very expensive. We are continuing to develop our in-house robotic capabilities.""

Engineer Harry Boyce added: ""Our research with Crombot aims to address growers' scepticism of new technology."" Mr Keller said: ""We hope to hear from growers who would like to be involved in this research - finding out how they can incorporate robots in their practices too.

Shoppers in the UK may be struggling to get their hands on fresh fruit and veg right now but the surface of Moon could soon have a thriving selection with a futuristic lunar farm, scientists claim

Scientists have unveiled groundbreaking proposals for growing fresh fruit and vegetables on the surface of the Moon.

Under the plans, lunar soil could be used to help grow food in a futuristic space farm not unlike the one managed by Matt Damon's character in 2015 sci-fi flick The Martian.

It is hoped the European Space Agency project - entitled Enabling Lunar In-Situ Agriculture by Producing Fertilizer from Beneficiated Regolith - will help future human colonies survive on the barren space rock.

The impressive structure would use a hi-tech system to mechanically sort soil from the Moon (also known as regolith) before dissolving it into water.

An artist's impression shows three separate working parts to the proposed lunar farm, which includes a pump, a processing plant and a greenhouse-like structure.

Because the Moon's soil lacks all the necessary nutrients to support vegetation a method called hydroponic farming would be used, which allows plants to be grown using only water.

Ongoing experiments in the innovative technique have been taking place at the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute in collaboration with ESA, Solsys Mining and the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Space.

Though no word as been given on what vegetables would be grown on the surface of the Moon, it is hoped the study will help show which are most suited to hydroponic farming.

Some of the success stories from experiments so far have included produce which is in desperate short supply back in the UK at the moment, including tomatoes, beans, and peppers.

Speaking on the announcement of the project, ESA materials and processes engineer Malgorzata Holynska said: ""This work is essential for future long-term lunar exploration.

""Achieving a sustainable presence on the Moon will involve using local resources and gaining access to nutrients present in lunar regolith with the potential to help cultivate plants.""

""The current study represents a proof of principle using available lunar regolith simulants, opening the way to more detailed research in future.""

The research project began in December last year, and estimated to last until the end of 2023 with a budget of â‚¬100,000 (£88,000).

A post on the Croppie website, for crop circle enthusiasts, described the new pictogram as a 'reproduction, remaster, even, of the most iconic crop circle of all time'

Cover versions might never quite be as good as the original - but this remaster of a rock classic looks just like the real thing. The Eastfield Pictogram, first spotted in 1990, was the most famous example of the

phenomenon.

It was used by rock legends Led Zeppelin for their Remasters album, released in October that year. Now a copy of the 600ft pictogram has appeared in a field in Rushock, Worcs, 90 miles from the original. The site is close to the grave of the band's drummer John Bonham, who died in 1980 after a drinking binge.

A post on the Croppie website, for crop circle enthusiasts, described it as a ""reproduction, remaster, even, of the most iconic crop circle of all time.""

Photographer Kris Malford, who snapped the new circle, said: ""I find them magical - the happiness they bring to people. They make people think about what's going on in the world around you.""

Crop circles went ""˜viral' long before the creation of social media, thanks to their mysterious origins. They first appeared in southern England in the late 1970s, concentrated in Wiltshire and Hampshire.

Many enthusiasts believed they were caused by UFO landings, while some said magnetic shifts were behind the phenomenon. Others believe their origins come from ley lines - seams of spiritual energy that intersect sacred sites including Stonehenge. But the mystery appeared to have finally been solved in 1991, when two landscape painters came forward to claim responsibility.

David Chorley, 67, and Douglas Bower, 62, said they came up with the idea in 1978 while drinking in a Hampshire pub. The pair spent 13 years sneaking around southern England under the cover of darkness, creating crop circles. At the height of their prank, the men said they were creating up to 30 each summer, using a plank and piece of rope.

They said they stomped down the crop without breaking the wheat shafts and used ropes tied to a central stake to make the circles. They were aided by a piece of wire hanging down from a baseball cap like a gun sight, to make sure their lines were straight. Their story made the front of the Today newspaper under the headline: ""Men who conned the world.""

David and Douglas said they watched in amusement as their antics gripped the country and began being copied around the world. But their confession was not enough to rule out an extra-terrestrial link in the eyes of many people.

Some scientists accepted hoaxers had created intricate circles, but said other simpler versions were formed by magnetic shifts. They claimed magnetic fields gave rise to a current which electrocuted the crops, forcing them to lie flat on the ground. Some UFO obsessives even argued that ""˜fakers' had been instructed to create the crop circles subconsciously by aliens.

In the late 1990s, US billionaire Laurance Rockefeller funded a huge UK survey of crop circles. Scientists carried out aerial research over Wiltshire in the hope of finding out their origins. US companies even advertised week-long tours of UK crop circles for an eye-watering £2,000 per-person.

In the 80s and 90s heyday of the phenomenon, there were five main groups in the UK creating crop circles almost every night during summer.

Some even branched out into lucrative private work, creating logos in fields for companies such as Nike, Pepsi and Greenpeace.

Public interest peaked with the Eastfield Pictogram, which appeared in a field in Alton Barnes, Wilts. Farmer Tim Carson turned a tidy profit by charging people £1 for a look. But while crop circles have long since vanished from news bulletins and front pages, they remain a familiar sight during UK summers.

Data released last week showed Wiltshire remains the county with the most crop circles in England. There have been 380 recorded since 2005, according to the Crop Circle Visitor Centre and Exhibition in Honey Street, near Pewsey, Wilts. Monique Klinkenbergh, researcher and founder of the Crop Circle Visitor Centre & Exhibition who helped with the research, said: ""There are obviously man-made ones out there.

""But if you listen to eyewitness accounts, the unexplained circles have one thing in common. They were formed in minutes, or seconds. There is definitely a mystery going on, but it's very hard to label the source, whether it is extra-terrestrial, paranormal or just nature. Wiltshire is so famous for its sites of heritage, and I believe the crop circles are attracted to those places.""

Nowadays, ""˜croppies' use drones to capture instant images and footage of their latest designs and post them on social media. Crop circle season begins at the end of May, when barley first ripens, and ends with the harvest in September. Last month, two new crop circles appeared in Winterbourne Bassett, near Swindon, and Potterne Hill, near Devizes, within three days of each other - both in Wiltshire.

So it seems to the annoyance of many farmers, crop circles will not be disappearing from the UK countryside any time soon. And each time one appears, the same question will be on everyone's lips: ""How on earth was that made?""

A review of ultra-processed food (UPF), high in salt and sugar and used in popular snacks, found they raise cardiovascular risks by 24%, while 60% of the average UK diet is made up of UPFs

More than half of the British diet is linked to heart attacks and strokes, experts warn.

A review of ultra-processed food, high in salt and sugar and used in popular snacks, found they raise cardiovascular risks by 24%.

It comes as the Mirror reveals healthy, fresh produce is almost impossible to find in poorer areas.

Leon founder Henry Dimbleby said: ""This should be a wake up call.

""If there is something inherent in the processing of foods that is harmful, then that is a disaster.

""Britain is particularly bad for ultra-processed food.

""It is storing up problems for the future. If we do nothing, a tidal wave of harm will hit the NHS.""

UPFs make up 60% of the average UK diet. Only the US consumes more.

UPFs include most supermarket bread as well as shop-bought sandwiches, soups and crisps and are often high in salt and sugar.

""They have unhealthy artificial additives to boost flavour and shelf life including sweeteners, dyes and bulking agents.

These are mostly not used in home cooking but are cheaper in mass produced food.

UPFs are often low in fibre and lack the nutrients present in fresh foods such fruit and vegetables and homemade bread.

British Heart Foundation medical director Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan said: ""There is increasing concern about links shown between UPFs and cardiovascular disease.

""We don't know to what degree this is driven by artificial additives or the high levels of salt, sugar and fat these foods tend to contain.""

Mr Dimbleby was hired by the Tories to conduct an independent review of the food system.

But he quit in March after ministers refused to act on his many recommendations.

Mr Dimbleby added: ""We need a shift in our cooking habits to eat more food cooked from scratch, with more vegetables and fibre.

""That is really hard in practice, it requires a huge cultural shift.""

The finding came in a review of 10 studies involving 325,000 people being presented at the European Society of Cardiology congress in Amsterdam.

A second study of 10,000 middle aged Australian women showed those who ate more UPFs were 39% more likely to develop high blood pressure.

The Department of Health and Social Care said: ""We have introduced legislation to restrict the placement and promotion of certain products in supermarkets to discourage unhealthy choices.""

A small food shop near Liverpool can barely serve the needs of almost 11,500 residents and the nearby Asda is three miles away, which is poorly served by local bus routes

Searching for fresh fruit and veg in a small food shop serving nearly 11,500 villagers, all I can find are a few packs of frozen broccoli, mixed greens and cauliflower. Fresh produce is nowhere to be found.

To buy that I would need to visit the nearest supermarket, an Asda three miles away poorly served by local bus routes, making it hard to access for the thousands of residents without a car.

Welcome to Knowsley, one of the country's worst ""food deserts"".

More than half of the average UK diet is made up of ultra-processed food and it's proven particularly hard to change that for residents of the area.

Some 77% of locals of the borough, just under nine miles from Liverpool city centre, have limited access to affordable nutritious food.

As many as 48% of residents in some parts of the borough do not have a car, according to the 2021 census, meaning they rely more on local services.

Of course the lack of fresh produce is not the fault of small shops doing their best to stay afloat.

Profit margins are generally small, and with rising bills and the increasing cost of buying from farmers and wholesalers, it can be a costly risk to fill shops with food that has a short shelf life.

In 2018 the Social Market Foundation estimated 10.2 million people were living in food ""deserts"", and this has worsened in the cost of living crisis.

Only one in 10 British children and one third of adults are eating enough fruit and vegetables, Food Foundation research found this year. It found healthier foods cost nearly three times as much as less nutritious choices.

Campaigner Henry Dimbleby said this all adds up to a desperate situation for more deprived areas.

The businessman, who quit as the Government's food tsar in March over its inaction against obesity, added: ""Food insecurity and obesity are both on the increase.

""The poorest neighbourhoods have the most junk food available, as it's the easiest way to feed your family cheaply.

""People know what they should be eating. They just find it incredibly difficult on tight budgets to find that healthy food and feed their families.

""However, the Government has been hopelessly slow to get a grip on it. But if we don't, whoever is in power in 10 years' time is going to be crippled by the problems our food system causes.

""It is by far the biggest cause of avoidable disease and early death and it is the biggest drag on the economy.""

He said the official £6.5billion cost of obesity to the NHS is an underestimate.

""It doesn't take into account the health problems caused by poor diets in people who aren't obese,"" he said.

""There's also a bigger, hidden cost to the economy because the major causes of why people are out of work due to long-term sickness are musculoskeletal conditions, type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular conditions, as well as mental health problems.

""Food is the primary cause of those first three things, while it massively exacerbates mental health. If nothing changes we will get sicker and sicker, GDP will stagnate and we will be left in a terrible position.""

Food deserts are more likely to be inhabited by low-income residents with poor access to transport, making them less attractive markets for big supermarket chains.

Instead, the areas are home to smaller convenience stores which tend to be more expensive and less likely to stock fresh and healthier items.

Mr Dimbleby's book Ravenous, co-written with his wife Jemima Lewis, says 3.3 million people live in an area where there are no shops selling fresh ingredients within 15 minutes by public transport.

One Knowsley resident, who did not want to be named, told me: ""There's nothing round here. We desperately need a small local or express store, but the supermarkets don't want to come.""

Dr Naomi Maynard of Feeding Liverpool said: ""We often get asked, ""˜Why don't people just shop online?'.

""But we have quite low levels of digital access and there's often a delivery charge and a minimum spend.

""Low-income households don't shop in that way. They'd never spend £50 on food all at once.""

Community groups have stepped in to ensure residents can get nutritious food. Five days a week, greengrocer Paul Flannery takes his Queen of Greens van to the worst-affected areas of Liverpool and Knowsley. Affiliated with Feeding Liverpool and its partner charity Global Feedback, the scheme brings affordable fruit and vegetables to customers who can use vouchers such as Healthy Start cards.

And at the nearby Hillside Neighbourhood Centre residents can pay £3.50 for 10 items, including fresh fruit and veg, meat and staples such as rice and pasta at the Grub Hub.

One regular at the Grub Hub is retired lorry driver James Kennedy, 86.

He said: ""This is a godsend. Without this, I would be dead, simple as that.""

Margaret O'Mara, who is a volunteer with the Grub Hub, added: ""I never thought this would be the UK in 2023. It's Dickensian.

""At least here, we are offering people the chance to cook their families good, nutritious meals economically.""

Meet those in the know

CAMPAIGNER Henry Dimbleby, Leon founder

""People know what they should be eating. If you look at polling where people are asked ""˜what is a good diet', 95% know what that looks like. They just find it incredibly difficult on tight budgets to find that healthy food and feed their families.""

PARENT Dominic Watters, Single parent from Canterbury, Kent

""The shop on my estate only sells the lowest-quality foods and nothing fresh. The lack of access to nutrition mirrors the other lack of access we have to resources - our aspirations are very much dimmed by the environments we live in.""

EXPERT Dr Hillary Shaw De Montfort University

""Deprivation has continued because people in these areas don't have the money to buy healthy food or for transport to get to these shops.""

The majority of both prospective Labour and Conservative voters are in favour of extending eligibility immediately to all those from families receiving Universal Credit

Jamie Oliver has demanded free school meals are given to more children as research shows the majority of both Labour and Tory voters back this. The celebrity chef, who has long campaigned on child food and nutrition issues, insisted it is ""time to prioritise our children's health"".

Polling shows a whopping 82% of prospective Labour voters and more than half of prospective Conservative voters (53%) are in favour of extending eligibility immediately to all those from families receiving Universal Credit, followed by a future expansion to all school children. Mr Oliver said: ""It's great to see that voters across all parties want to put child health first. It's time to prioritise our children's health. We know that nourishing young minds with nutritious food is an investment in their future, boosts our economy and our health. Sadiq Khan has recognised this by giving all primary school children a free school meal and now we need politicians across all parties to put child health above politics and act now.""

Currently only children from households with an income below £7,400 a year after tax and benefits are eligible. This has not increased since 2018 despite prices rising and means an estimated 900,000 schoolchildren living in poverty are not eligible. Keir Starmer so far has refused to back free school meals for all primary school children. He faces calls from within the party, with leaders in London and Wales committing to the measure.

The polling, which was commissioned by the School Food Review Working Group, found 23% of 2019 Conservative voters and 18% of those who intend to vote Tory at the next election would be more likely to switch to Labour if it adopted a free school meals policy. The survey of 3,011 members also suggested almost two thirds (65%) of prospective Labour voters would be more likely to vote for the party if they committed to extending free lunches.

Anna Taylor, Executive Director of The Food Foundation, said: ""This research has an instructive new finding. People now believe that children eating well in school to support their learning is so important that it would affect which party they vote for in the next election. It's a clear signal that the status quo is both unfair and damaging, and voters want it fixed.""

Anna Garrod, Policy & Influencing Director of Impact on Urban Health, added: ""This research confirms that Free School Meals expansion is a key issue for voters and a move to support it would appeal to swing and undecided voters. We urge policymakers to take this opportunity to create a more equitable school food system across the country - to support all children to access healthy, nutritious food, and in doing so build a healthier society and more resilient economy.""

Welcome to This World Talks - an offshoot of our ground-breaking Britain Talks series, but this time around readers will have the chance to sign up and meet people from all over the globe.

The screen freezes for a moment, and then a connection is made.

""Good morning!"" says Brian Ascroft, 78, from Tarleton Lancashire. ""My name is Brian.""

""Morning!"" says Mustapha Ali, a 25-year-old from Fanteakwa in Eastern Ghana. ""Call me Ali.""

Brian and Ali were born over 50 years and 5,000 miles apart, but one subject immediately unites them - tomatoes.

Within moments the two farmers are talking about soaring inflation, the cost-of-living crisis, climate change - and their love of the sweet red fruit they both make a living from.

""How did you get into tomato farming?"" Ali asks.

""With my father 70 years ago,"" Brian smiles. ""It's a family business, and it's been in the family for over 77 years. I have done nothing else all my life.""

""I'm from a farming family,"" Ali says. ""My dad is a farmer, my mum is a farmer, my entire family are farmers.""

""We are similar!"" Brian says.

Brian and Ali are the very first pair to meet via video call for the Mirror's brand-new project, The World Talks. An offshoot of our ground-breaking Britain Talks series, this time around readers will have the chance to sign up and meet people from all over the globe.

Newspaper and online audiences are taking part from a wide range of countries including Ukraine, South Korea, Brazil, Ghana, South Africa, India, Germany, Italy and Mexico - as part of an initiative by the Berlin-based My Country Talks.

Applications go live today, and the date for meeting up online is Sunday June 25th.

Back on the call, Ali is fascinated to learn that at Croftpak Nurseries, Brian's tomatoes are grown in coconut fibre in glasshouses.

""When we started, we grew - probably like you - on the soil, watered with a pipe,"" Brian says. ""Now it is all grown by computers. All the watering, ventilation and heat is controlled by technology. Our glasshouses are heated by a biomass boiler which runs on wood chip and by solar panels. Whereas presumably outside you don't need any heat, Ali? You get all the heat from the sun.""

Ali laughs. It's 32 degrees in Ghana today, more than twice that of Lancashire. ""Yeah, we get a lot of heat here,"" he says.

Ali's 10 acres of tomatoes are grown using traditional methods. His family collect rainwater, have drilled a borehole, and sometimes dam the local river.

""At this time of year our farmers go to the stream alongside the community and fetch water,"" Ali says. ""Then they manually measure 200ml of water and just put it in the hole they have created.""

Both farmers control pests using natural methods rather than harmful pesticides. Ali grows tomatoes for maximum yield.

""However, many we can grow, people always want more,"" he says. ""You can never grow too many tomatoes for people in Ghana - it's part of people's everyday food. We love tomatoes here a lot!""

Tomato is a key ingredient in the national dish, jollof rice. ""If you want to make jollof rice you have to have a lot of tomatoes so it's one of the most consumed vegetables we eat here,"" Ali says. ""But every December when the water source dries up, we normally have a shortage, so we have to walk to our methods to grow for intense flavour.

He is evangelical about a new variety, Strabena. ""It's strawberry shaped and it's really juicy. It's unbelievable. Everybody who tries it wants more.""

In 1992, Brian produced the first tomato to be harvested on the vine in Britain for Booths, the upmarket northern supermarket. He also grows for Michelin-starred restaurants.

Ali sells mostly to the market women who haggle over prices but also to some nearby eateries.

While Brian left school at 15, Ali went on to study agriculture and animal husbandry. But times for farmers are hard in both countries.

Ghana is suffering a tomato crisis thanks to inflation soaring above 50%, and deep drought caused by climate change. It is seeking a $3billion loan from the IMF to shore up its economy.

Britain is also suffering from inflation, a cost-of-living crisis, and a changing climate. ""Our biggest problems are water and the cost of inputs like the fertilisers,"" Ali says. ""Climate change is affecting us.""

He explains that when he was due to transplant seedlings in January, it didn't rain. Without money to set up irrigation, they just had sit and wait. It didn't rain until the last day of February.

""Water source is quite a problem now,"" he says. Brian says ""market conditions"" are a problem in the UK. ""Plus, the same as you were saying, input costs. Fertiliser costs have doubled in the UK.

""We were paying £10 for calcium nitrate, which goes into the irrigation system. It got as high as £22 per bag. A pallet of 40 was costing us £400, it is now costing us £880. If you cannot get a better price for your produce, you cannot continue. You can't survive.""

Brian's dad established the farm just after WWII, and Brian worked the land from the age of five. Now his two sons are carrying on the family tradition, while his daughter works in education.

""So, basically we're still a family business growing tomatoes,"" Brian says.

""Everything that's harvested here is harvested by family members. You live or die by what you produce."" Both men are passionate about their produce.

""I absolutely adore eating tomatoes,"" Brian says. ""When we're in production, I must eat several kilos a week, trying each variety.""

Ali smiles. ""I love eating tomatoes a lot,"" he says. ""There are a lot of health benefits. It even improves the eyesight. I can't stay away from them.""

After the call, Brian reflects on meeting a man so far away yet with so many things in common. ""It was an interesting chat with Ali,"" he says. ""Even though we're from the same industry, the way we operate is completely different. But we also had things in common. It was really nice to speak to a farmer from a different country who has come from a farming family and community.""

A fifth of dairy cows spend their entire lives in a shed, and never get to graze - but just three in ten Brits are aware of this, research finds

Millions of Brits wrongly believe that all cows live free range - when 20% actually spend their entire lives in sheds.

A poll of 2,000 adults found only three in ten are aware of the zero-grazing practice - where the dairy cow is never allowed to roam free, being kept in a shed for its entire life.

But campaigners claim this affects up to a fifth of UK dairy cows.

After being made aware of the farming technique, 69% of consumers opposed it on ethical grounds, and 49% said they would be unlikely to buy any dairy products that were a result of this indoor process.

Meanwhile, 56% went as far as to say it should be banned completely - as 87% believe cows deserve a nice life.

The research was commissioned by Viva!, whose spokesman said: ""Ignorance about the UK dairy industry is widespread and profound.

""It's not accidental that consumers are ignorant of zero-grazing and other cruelties in the dairy industry - it is purposely camouflaged by constant images of a non-existent rural idyll.

""Zero-grazing is sweeping across the world, and already one in five UK dairy cows are victims, despite overwhelming scientific and public opposition.""

The research also found just 41% of adults were aware cows have to be made pregnant and give birth to a calf before they can give milk.

And only 27% knew all calves are grabbed from their mothers at birth - and either killed, or locked away in isolation.

Once aware of the facts, almost a quarter (24%) claimed they were prepared to change their habits to become more vegan - with 25-34-year-olds most likely to do so (45%).

The thought of animals being poorly treated (58%), and the environmental impacts of the meat and dairy industry (56%), were the main drivers of this change.

Of those willing to change their habits, 53% would try plant milks instead of dairy milk, and 48% would attempt to reduce their consumption of cheese.

Although both of these top the list of things considered hardest to cut out of their diet - alongside chicken and butter, according to the research carried out via OnePoll.

In fact, almost one in ten (9%) consider themselves a ""flexidairian"" - a term coined by Viva! to describe someone that wants to cut out dairy, but finds it hard to do so.

The spokesman added: ""There is a clear lack of knowledge when it comes to how cows are treated, as it is often glossed over.

""But it's encouraging to see people are willing to change their diets and cut back on dairy foods as a result of the inhumane processes used in farming.""

Mountain vineyards - where the popular tipple is produced - are most at risk from soil degradation and drought, say scientists in the latest devastating news about climate change

Prosecco could soon be wiped out by climate change, according to new research.

Mountainside vineyards - where the popular tipple is produced - are most at risk from soil degradation and drought, scientists say. The concern also applies to other famous vintages including Burgundy, Grand Cru and Cabernet Sauvignon, the world's most popular red. Study lead author Dr Paolo Tarolli, of the University of Padova in Italy, said: ""The risk is not only losing an agricultural product or seeing a landscape change, negatively impacting the local economy. The risk is losing entire communities' history and their cultural roots.""

The soils on mountain vineyards are usually thin and eroded and the struggle is massive for grapes which send their roots deep in search of water. Mountain soils also lead to grapes that are small, about the size of a typical blueberry. Small grapes have a higher ratio of skin to juice. Because so much aroma, flavour, and tannin are lodged in the skins, mountain wines often have intense flavours and, for red wines, copious tannin and therefore considerable structure.

Tucked into the hillsides of Italy, Portugal, and Spain, they are also the most difficult to maintain - coining the expression 'heroic viticulture.' Extreme weather and changing socioeconomic conditions are making them even more challenging. They are the most vulnerable to global warming.

Farmers and scientists must work together to save some of the world's most celebrated wines, say the Italian team. Dr Tarolli said: ""The great effort required to manage these areas reinforces the specific human-environment connection. This is why they are recognised as cultural uniquenesses of primary historical and social importance, where traditional knowledge is still the determining element.""

The study lists poor soil and less rain as the biggest threat to the industry. It also cites several significant socioeconomic barriers. Dr Tarolli said: ""The last half past century has been characterised by rural exodus and a gradual abandonment of mountain landscapes. The new generation is unwilling to continue working under extreme conditions if economic benefits are insignificant.""

Mountain vineyards are expensive to farm. Every bit of the work - from planting a vine to harvesting the grapes - is slow and painstaking. And it usually has to be done by hard, because most tractors and mechanical harvesters can't negotiate steep inclines. They are also part of a larger 'polyculture', often ringed by forests and other types of vegetation as well as wildlife. Heroic viticulture sites either have a slope steeper than 30 percent, are located on small islands, higher than 500 metres above sea level or incorporate vines grown on terraces. The name originated from the inherent difficulty of cultivating and harvesting crops in these landscapes.

Centuries-old examples include the Prosecco Hills of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene, Treviso, and the traditional vineyards of Pantelleria Island in the Strait of Sicily, both of which are protected by UNESCO. The growing popularity of Prosecco has seen demand soar by more than a third in five years, the fastest of any sparkling wine with champagne showing only around one percent growth over the same time period.

The researchers suggest strategic communications designed to unite scientists, farmers and consumers to onsite solutions like integrated small water storage systems to prevent runoff. They also underline the importance of educating young people about the benefits of rural communities, preserving cultural heritage, living in equilibrium with the environment and sustainable agriculture.

Dr Tarolli added: ""The key to success lies in combining the traditional knowledge of winemakers with innovation and scientific rigor. In this way, farms can work closely with scientists to optimise investments for a more functional, sustainable, and safe agricultural landscape - a winning alliance to face these diverse natural and anthropogenic challenges.""

The findings were published in the journal iScience.

Apparently, there is one spice in particular that can be found in curries that aids in weight loss. Experts say it controls the system that regulates the way fat is broken and energy is made in the muscles and liver

Instead of sipping on meal replacement shakes and throwing back weight loss pills, there is a much tastier way to lose weight - and it involves eating curry. Recent studies have shown that curries could help to support people's weight loss goals thanks to one special ingredient. According to researchers, eating cardamom in food can play a crucial role in burning calories, reducing inflammation, maintaining weight and curbing appetite.

Cardamom is a spice that can be used in both savoury and sweet dishes, including curries, desserts and chai. It's also present in a number of spice mixtures, including curry powder and garam masala. According to experts, it promotes weight loss by regulating the system that regulates the way fat is broken down and how energy is produced in the muscles and liver. Scientists at the Institute for Advancing Health Through Agriculture at Texas A&M AgriLife evaluated the effects of cardamom in mice and they noted that the ingredient helped the creatures feel less hungry. As well as this, they noticed that the spice made them energetic and helped them burn fat.

The rodents whose diet consisted of more than one per cent of cardamom powder ate more than those who did not eat as much of the spice. Even though they put on weight during the experiment, there was a decrease in fat mass, suggesting that the spice may be effective in treating obesity. The study, which was published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, indicated that the spice could also aid in reducing low-grade inflammation which might contribute to the risk of diabetes, arthritis and heart disease.

Even though these outcomes were shown in mice, it was noted that adults weighing roughly 60kg would require approximately 77mg of cardamom to reap the weight loss benefits. This would mean consuming 10 cardamom pods a day. This isn't the first time the spice's benefits have been spoken about, as it's previously been shown that it can ease inflammation and protect your cells against oxidative stress, which is an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants that can lead to a number of medical issues. The benefits don't end there, as it can also help your body handle insulin better and keep your blood pressure healthy.

That being said, the NHS recommends consuming a varied diet and incorporating exercise in order to lose weight. ""Keeping active has many benefits to your health and wellbeing and when part of a healthy diet, can be an effective way to lose weight. It's recommended that all adults should try to be active every day and should complete at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise per week,"" it states on the website.

After filming in Brazil's Cerrado grassland had ended, the mum Nhorinha and two pups were discovered drowned in one of the drainage ditches

The mother maned wolf and two of the three pups featured in tonight's Planet Earth III were found dead shortly after filming ended.

The tragic discovery came after film-makers and scientific researchers had tracked the shy, fruit-eating mammals in Brazil's Cerrado grassland, and were delighted to achieve a record first by filming inside a den.

But once the BBC crew had left, following a three-year collaboration with local scientists, the mother wolf Nhorinha and two pups were discovered drowned in one of the drainage ditches on neighbouring farmland.

In the story sequence, which also featured in the Making Of""¦ section at the end of last night's Deserts & Grasslands episode on BBC1, viewers saw how the wolves were under intense threat from farmers who use fire to clear the grassland in order to grow huge swathes of crops.

The wolves, which are red in colour and have especially long legs, have already lost 50% of their habitat in Pousada Trijuncao.

Producer and Director Kiri Cashell said: ""The death of our maned wolf, Nhorinha, and her puppies is truly heart-breaking. We spent three years working with scientists to better understand this species, and the footage we were able to capture from inside the den provides such an intimate look into the first few weeks of these puppies' lives.

""Sadly since filming ended, we have discovered that the mother and two of her puppies fell into drainage ditches which are used to feed the crops of neighbouring farmland. Unable to escape, the wolves drowned.""

Kiri said that the deaths were not isolated because a number of the wolves wearing the electronic tracking collars had already been found dead. ""It's a really sad representation of what's going on, and a reflection of the big problem facing the whole species,"" she said.

""More and more, farmland is encroaching onto the Cerrado. This is a vitally important grassland and some predict it could disappear completely in the next thirty years. The death of these maned wolves is an upsetting and poignant reminder of what could be lost.""

In proportion to its size, the Cerrado is being destroyed more than two times faster than the Amazon rainforest to clear land for farming.

In the programme, narrator Sir David Attenborough explained that if the maned wolves disappeared altogether from the region it could trigger the collapse of the entire ecosystem. He warned: ""At the current rate of habitat destruction, these may be some of the last maned wolves to survive in the wild.""

Researcher Barbara Do Conto Peret Dias said that conservationists were working hard to find solutions. ""I feel quite worried but not hopeless,"" she said. ""I grew up here, it's my home, I have to protect it.""

But over half are unaware this could have a catastrophic impact on livestock if they were to become carriers of tapeworm

More than one in ten dog owners (14%) admit they never pick up their pet's poo - and always leave it behind on the ground, according to research.

Nearly three in ten (28%) say there have been occasions where they have turned a blind eye to their pooch doing their business - and, of these, 36% confess it is a regular occurrence that they don't clean up after their four-legged friend.

The poll of 2,000 dog owners found that 36% are more likely to leave their pet's excrement behind in a rural field.

And even when it comes to those who do clean up after their dog, nearly two-thirds (64%) don't think about what they might still have left behind on the ground, even after binning their poo bags.

As a result, 51% are unaware of the catastrophic impact it can have on livestock, were they to become carriers of tapeworm.

The research was commissioned by the makers of Droncit, a tapeworm tablet brand for dogs that kills off the parasite to avoid illness in canines, livestock, and even humans.

Luke Gamble, CEO of Worldwide Vet Service, a veterinary expert speaking on behalf of the brand, said: ""Tapeworm can be a real issue, and can be passed on to livestock, which in turn costs our farming industry millions of pounds each year.

""This is something, understandably, many would have no idea about, and struggle to see how there's an impact. However, there is no doubting the link between owners not picking up after their pets and transmission to livestock - and even, in some cases, humans.

""The solution to this issue for owners is to ensure your dog is given worming tablets, and at the right frequency to ensure there's no issues encountered outdoors or within the home.""

It also emerged 56% of dog owners only ever think of the human implications of not picking up dog poo - such as someone standing in it - rather than how it could impact things like livestock.

But 19% have come across someone else's pet's poop when out on a walk, while 77% have witnessed another dog walker actively not pick up after their pooch.

The study also found 65% let their dog off the lead on a walk - with a quarter rating the chance of missing their dog doing their business at medium or high.

However, 27% incorrectly believed picking up a poo is enough to solve the issue of spreading tapeworm - unaware that residue left behind can have more than enough parasites to still be problematic.

Two-thirds also believed they, and fellow walkers, need to think more about the implications of not worming their dog.

One in six (15%) give their dog worming tablets either annually, or less often, according to the data via OnePoll - and 21% only take their canine chum to the vets if there's an issue, rather than having an annual check-up.

A spokesman from Droncit added: ""It's fair to assume if you pick up your dog's poo that would be enough - but actually it's not the case, particularly if your pet isn't wormed. Ensuring your pet gets its worming tablets on a regular basis ensures such problems aren't encountered.

""But this isn't just something you want to do to protect livestock - if your dog has a tapeworm issue, this definitely isn't a situation you'd particularly enjoy escalating in the comfort of your own home, so a simple tablet as regularly as your vet recommends, benefits everyone, including your canine.""

Vegan activists are calling upon Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to stick to a plant-based diet for one month, in return offering him £1 million to donate to a charity of his choosing

This January, many of us will be trying out 'Veganuary', giving up all meat and dairy products in favour of a completely plant-based diet. Now vegan activists are calling upon Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to follow suit, offering him £1 million to donate to a charity of his choice if he agrees to go vegan for one month.

In an open letter penned to the PM, vegan organisation GenV stated that ""a plant-based diet is one of the best things we can do to champion British farmers and our countryside"". They also went on to emphasise how plant-based eating could help the country meet emission reduction commitments, while 'supporting public health'.

In the letter, GenV CEO Naomi Hallum wrote: ""William Blake famously wrote of England's green and pleasant land. However, according to the researchers at the Natural History Museum, the UK is one of the world's most nature-depleted countries, going so far as to say that due to the expansion of agriculture, ""˜the UK has led the world in degrading the natural environment'.""

She went on to express her hopes that Sunak would consider 'their sincere offer and lead the UK towards a more sustainable and promising future', adding that she looked forward to hearing his response by January 31.

Speaking with vegan publication Plant Based News (PBN), Hallum said: ""It's important that we hold our leaders responsible for delivering the better future they continuously promise us. The UK Prime Minister has regularly spoken about the importance of showing compassion, and of safeguarding our planet for future generations.

""He already abstains from eating beef, so all we're asking of him is to extend his circle of compassion to other animals and to take the necessary steps towards protecting the planet for our children and grandchildren.""

Back in October 2021, Sunak stated 'I'm not telling anyone to eat less meat' during an interview about carbon emissions with Sky News' Kay Burley, filmed at a meat market in Bury, Lancashire. After Burley quizzed him about the optics of the setting, Sunak argued that there were there 'lots of different ways' to fight climate change.

On January 3, PBN reported that Sunak had yet to respond to the letter.

Researchers looked at how specific causes of air pollution are linked to dementia, following a decades-long survey where they regularly checked in with adults about their health

New research has estimated hundreds of thousands of cases of dementia in the US may be caused due to the air we are breathing in.

As we live longer, more and more countries are battling with growing rates of dementia. Almost 188,000 dementia cases in the US each year are thought to be caused by air pollution, with poor air quality due to wildfires and agriculture showing the strongest association with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia later in life.

The research, published Monday, August 14, in the journal JAMA Network Open, contains new estimates which are the latest to underscore a range of health risks long warned to be linked to air pollution.

Studies have already linked poor air quality to a number of health problems, including the risk of developing dementia. However, the new study took a closer look at how specific causes of air pollution seem to be more strongly linked to dementia than others.

For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.

Findings were based on analysis of data collected from a decades-long survey, backed by the National Institutes of Health. Thousands of older adults were checked in with regularly every two years about their health.

Researchers then combined that data with detailed air quality modelling, estimating what people may have been exposed to in the areas where they lived. The focus was on what scientists call PM 2.5 air pollution which is a benchmark for very small particles - less than 2.5 micrometres wide, a fraction of the diameter of human hair - that can be inhaled from the air.

These particles can come from a variety of sources, including vehicle exhausts and wildfire smoke. They are linked to health effects which range from coughing or shortness of breath, to worsening asthma and even an increased risk of death from heart disease.

Associate chair of epidemiology at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health, Sara Adar, said: ""The environmental community has been working very hard for the past 10 to 15 years to be able to predict exposures.""

A range of data was drawn on, including measurements from the Environmental Protection Agency and details about nearby factors that could affect air quality - such as the recent wildfires in Canada which caused air quality warnings to be triggered across major US cities.

""They model all sources at once. Coal-fired power plants, agriculture, wildfires, traffic, all these different emission sources, and then they turn off the source in the model one at a time. And then they can see the difference in what levels are there with the emissions sources, and what are there without them,"" said Dr Adar.

Modelling found the higher risk even after adjusting for a range of potential other factors would could impact results, such as sex, race and ethnicity, educational status and wealth. They were also able to adjust for whether people have previously lived in urban or rural areas.

While they had information about where people moved during the course of the survey, Dr Adar acknowledge they didn't have enough data to model every single exposure or check for every difference throughout the course of their life, such as where people were born, which could have impacted results.

""Dementia takes a long time to develop,"" said Dr Adar. ""It's not something that might be, 'oh you've got a bad exposure last week, and now you have dementia'. It's more likely to build up over a lifetime.""

Beyond direct emissions from wildfires and agriculture, Dr Adar said their analysis was able to take into account other kinds of air pollution that can also be traced back to these sources. When wildfires burn it isn't just the smoke that fills the air people have to worry about.

Other toxic molecules can be carried with the smoke as they burn through communities. Farming can also worsen air pollution, as a result of ammonia released by sources like manure and fertiliser.

""Farms will release a lot of ammonia gas, and then in the air with the sunlight and other pollutants out there, they'll react to make particles, and those particles are what we see are likely toxins for the brain,"" said Dr Adar.

Dr Adar and Boya Zhang, a fellow researcher at the school, say they hope their new findings could help drive more targeted interventions to address dementia risks. The study's authors wrote: ""Unlike many other common risk factors for dementia (eg. hypertension, stroke, and diabetes), exposures to air pollution can be modified at the population level, making it a prime target for large-scale prevention efforts.""

Catacanthus incarnatus, which feasts on crops including cotton and corn, has been renamed Hitler as the design on its back resembles the Nazi dictator's face

A bug renowned for its awful stink has been renamed after Adolf Hitler as the unusual design on its back resembles the evil Nazi dictator.

Native to south-east Asia and India, the insect known as man-faced stink bug is a notorious pest and known to devour fruit, cotton, corn, soybean, and cashew crops.

Now the Catacanthus incarnatus has a new reason for its infamy as it was renamed Hitler.

The New Indian Express said: ""The trend of naming the bugs after popular personalities started recently when Catacanthus Incarnatus was named Hitler as it resembles the face of the German dictator.""

Other species had been named after Bollywood icons like Amrish Puri and AK Hangal, according to the newspaper.

The aim is said to ""to create interest in research students by making the study of bugs easier for identification"".

Wildlife watchers gave a mixed reaction to the comparison.

Photographer Michael Lassle, who spotted the insect in Langkawi, Malaysia, said: ""Arthropods don't need Hitler!

""I guess there is some resemblance with a stylised Hitler as there is with the Napoleon spider and Napoleon.

""But different people might see different things in nature and I therefore prefer 'man-faced stink bug' as a nick-name.

""If I were the bug I would certainly not like to be compared with Hitler.""

David Ong, who photographed the creature in a forest near Kuala Lumpur, said Elvis was a better comparison but added he ""did not mind"" the nickname.

He said: ""It is fine as it is only a common name - it's more accurate to use the scientific name.

""We called it man-faced without referring to any particular person.""

The creature's most important defence is its odour, according to expert Sadashiv Waghmare, an assistant professor of zoology at North Maharashtra

University in Jalgaon, India.

He added: ""It secretes odour smells through its stink gland, which is located on its metathorax, for protection from enemies.

""It is a very common species.""

The Catacanthus incarnatus was discovered in 1778 by British entomologist, Dru Drury, according to Scientific American magazine.

The Mormon cricket - which got its name in the 1800s after ransacking crop fields in Utah - can grow more than two inches long and turn cannibalistic when their food supplies, crops and other vegetation, runs out

A ""biblical"" storm of crickets has descended on a town in Nevada, with one hospital covered with the insects.

Some parts of the state are now overrun by the cannibalistic bugs, with businesses taking to social media to show how they're fighting the Old Testament plague.

In the northeastern city of Elko, roads, crops and walls were covered with the miniature beasts, with one shocking video showing the extent of the infestation.

Hospita' staff have had to resort to grabbing leaf blowers and brooms to blast them out of the way.

Communications officer of the affected Northeastern Nevada Regional Hospital, Steve Burrows, explained: ""Just to get patients into the hospital we had people out there with leaf blowers, with brooms.""

Speaking to KSL TV, he added: ""At one point we even had a tractor with a snowplow on it just to push the piles of crickets and move them on their way.""

The ""Mormon"" cricket is native to the US, and got its name after being discovered first in Utah in the 1800s.

Its population swells and declines in a several year cycle, but many residents of the 20,000-person town are far less than pleased over their return.

Elko resident Precious Drake said: ""They're just gross.

""They look like spiders, and they poop everywhere.""

Researchers at the University of Nevada said the cricket can grow larger than two inches long and are often found in grassland close to the Missouri River.

All the poop comes from their diet of grass, shrubs and crops, and their ravenous appetite has a knock-on effect on the food chain, affecting the amount of feed left over for livestock.

When they gather en masse, their feeding can lead to a number of further environmental concerns like soil erosion, nutrient-depleted soil among other issues.

If the vicious insects can't get their nutrients from vegetation, they will turn on their fellow crickets, eating each other whether dead or alive, says USAToday.

The university said that the creatures aren't actually crickets, but ""shield-backed, short-winged katydids"".

They ""resembled fat grasshoppers that cannot fly"" and feature long antennae, a shiny body and come in a number of different colours, it added.

""[Mormon crickets can cause] substantial economic losses to rangeland, cropland, and home gardens,"" the university said.

""This is particularly true as adults and nymphs of Mormon crickets migrate in a band, eating plants along their paths.""

Similar scenes erupted across Nevada, stretching up to Montana, as local authorities battled the plague last year.

The bugs prefer arid conditions brought on by drought and warming temperatures, which has lead to more devastating outbreaks across the West.

The official definition of an infestation is when at least eight crickets occupy a square yard, Utah State University said.

During the spring, conditions in Utah have been cold and wet, meaning there have only be a few smaller-scale infestations, the state's public radio said.

Val Bourne is an award-winning writer, organic hands-on gardener and committed plantaholic - and here she gives readers the full lowdown on growing your own veg

Among his recent musings about the progress of his allotment, our much loved diarist Paul Routledge revealed his secret weapon.

""There are lots of helpful books,"" he said. ""I swear by Val Bourne's Ten-Minute Gardener's Vegetable Growing Diary."" Val is an award-winning writer, organic hands-on gardener and committed plantaholic, with an allotment in rural Gloucestershire. She says: ""My hundred or so dahlias are not appreciated by my Best Beloved, although he'll take all the plaudits once they're in flower.""

Val manages her third of an acre garden without using chemicals - something she has always believed in. Her latest book The Living Jigsaw, is all about her eco-friendly garden. She has been interested in the natural world since childhood and has actively tried to influence gardeners to be greener in order to help the survival of our planet.

Val, who is an ambassador for The Hardy Plant Society and worked in vegetable research for five years, has been judging RHS plant trials for the past 16 years. In this National Allotment Week, Val has written an allotment guide for Mirror readers and allotmenteers of all levels - with advice for newbies, next level gardeners and even suggested a bit of fine tuning for those so experienced it's not just their fingers which are green...

Advice for Allotment Newbies

If you're at the ""˜shall I or shan't I stage', put your name on the waiting list anyway. Most people wait for years to get one and by the time they're handed on, the new tenants usually have to reclaim them from the wilderness. This can take several years of hard work. Just think of it as productive Pilates with back ache.

Once you've got one, have a good recce round the site, taking special note of the more productive plots. They'll indicate what grows well and what doesn't. Take note of any communal facilities. There may be a shared water supply, a pop-up shop or a shared composting area. Finally, be friendly and chat, because experienced plot holders will be generous with their advice. They may even give you their spare plants!

Assess your soil. Pick up a small handful and squeeze it together in the palm of your hand. Clay soils form a ball and this tells you two things. The ground will compact if you walk on it, so order in some scaffold planks now. Clay soil lies claggy and cold in winter, so you must wait for good weather before doing any planting or sowing. This may well mean ignoring the instructions on the packet! There is some good news: clay retains moisture and nutrients.

Lighter soils won't stick together, but they will always be hungry for nutrients and water, so get the water butts and cans in now. Your light soil is hungry and well-drained, so you'll be able to sow earlier than many. Build your compost heap, whatever your soil, but never add any diseased material, pernicious weeds or seedheads. They'll come back to haunt you.

You are nothing without good tools. The essentials are a spade (and I like stainless steel because it cuts through the soil), a long-handled digging fork, a Dutch hoe, a garden rake and a wheelbarrow. Bulldog Tools (www.bulldoghandtools.co.uk), made in Britain, offer great value and quality. They'll last, as long as you clean and store them. Car boot sales often have gardening tools.

Time to tackle the weeds, but don't go down the chemical route because wildlife's in a parlous state. If you have pernicious weeds with deep root systems, bindweed, ground elder, horsetail or perhaps all three, the best way is to hire a rotavator and chop the roots up, preferably during winter. It sounds counter-productive, but it works. After that, it's consistent spade work, literally worrying the blighters into submission. Hoe off emerging annual weeds, or pull the larger ones up, before they annoy your neighbours. Hoeing creates a fine tilth, which acts as a moisture-saving mulch.

The Next Level - Planting and Sowing

Subdivide your plot into three, so that you use a simple rotation system to reduce diseases and pests. Plot 1 will contain potatoes in the first year. Then there'll be legumes, onions and roots. In the following year it's brassicas. Perennial crops such as rhubarb will also need a place and I'd find room for a New Zealand blackberry named ""˜Karaka Black'. Ripe fruit can be eaten straight off the bush in summer. It will need netting. Always record what's planted, where. The memory plays tricks!

Begin by planting sets of golden-skinned onions and shallots in March, if conditions are favourable. They're more cold-tolerant than red-skinned varieties. Expensive heat-treated sets, which are less likely to bolt, are only worth it in drier areas. Onions need water early on and take 20 weeks to ripen. ""˜Centurion' and ""˜Sturon' are both reliable. Shallots, which need a warmer site, take 26 weeks to ripen. Lift them as soon as the foliage begins to die back. Onions keep until early spring, shallots for far longer.

Broad beans, which crop by June, can also be planted in March. Raise them in modular trays if you can. Form a double row a foot apart and space each bean 9 inches apart. Add a framework of canes and string. ""˜Masterpiece Green' crops well. Pick off any blackfly early on.

Wait for the weather before sowing seeds of carrots, parsnips and beetroot seeds. They need night-time temperatures approaching double figures to germinate. Sow too early and you'll end up having to do it again. Use wide 4-inch drills, half an inch deep, because it saves thinning out.

Water the drill well before sowing and aim to spread the seeds thinly across the drill. Record the sowing date on the label. Start with a fast-maturing carrot such as ""˜Amsterdam Forcing' and then sow ""˜Eskimo' or ""˜Autumn King' for later crops. Carrots should take 10-21 days. Parsnips take 30 days and the F1 variety ""˜Gladiator' is my choice. F1 seeds are more vigorous at every stage, including germination. Sausage-shaped beetroots mature faster so find room for F1 ""˜Alto' as well as a globe like ""˜Boltardy'.

Mid-April's the time to plant potatoes, because you don't want the tops to catch a May frost. Use an early, like ""˜Maris Bard'. Chit the tubers, ie let them develop shoots, before planting them a foot apart in rows two feet apart. Plant ""˜Little Gem' and ""˜Salad Bowl' lettuces between the rows. Dig earlies as and when you need them and pop seeds of dwarf French beans ""˜Safari' or ""˜Stanley' into the empty gaps.

Maincrop spuds, which don't need chitting, are planted 18 inches apart. They store over winter, but need to be harvested before the end of September, otherwise little black keeled slugs spoil the flavour. The disease resistant ""˜Cara' is still popular. Pea ""˜Hurst Greenshaft' provides a June crop. Create a foot-wide trench and zig-zag the seeds across because you'll need ""˜one for the crow, one for the mouse and one to grow'. Add a few mangetout seeds at the ends. They'll crop first.

Going to a Higher Level - Fine Tuning

Select better varieties with the word ""˜flavour'. Ignore exhibition varieties, unless you're planning to enter a vegetable show. Be very wary of the word ""˜new'. Go for AGM (Award of Garden Merit) winners. Essex-based vegetable specialist Kings Seeds give discounts to the National Allotment Society (NAS) and other allotment groups. Contact them directly - www.kingsseeds.com or 01376 570 000.

Everybody plunges into growing summer crops, but they arrive all at once. The most useful, budget-busting crops are those in your winter pantry. Freshly cut cabbages, leeks in white sauce and nutty roast parsnips - picked week after week. Find room for Tuscan black kale, because it can be harvested in autumn and winter. ""˜January King Marabel F1' is a great winter cabbage. Purple sprouting crops in March and April. Cauliflowers are impossible for many - including me.

Grow hybrid runner x French beans. ""˜Moonlight' and the later ""˜Firestorm' both crop heavily in hot or cool weather. If you prefer runners, ""˜Polestar' is my favourite. Borlotti beans, which you harvest and dry, are easy too. If your plot's windy, use tripods rather than rows. Always grow winter squashes. Plant them outside in early June. Harvest them when the stems are corky and leave them for six weeks so that they develop a chestnut flavour. I'm too cold for butternuts, but the grey-skinned ""˜Crown Prince' and the orange-skinned ""˜Sunshine' and ""˜Uchiki Kuri' crop well here.

Sweetcorn, which freezes well, takes up little room because this wind-pollinated crop is planted in a block. ""˜Swift' is my go-to. Find room for some pollinator-friendly flowers. The blue field scabious, Knautia arvensis, lures in lots of bees on my allotment. Plugs and seeds are available. I also grow dahlias.

Make sure you plant Bocking 14 comfrey next to your compost heap. This clump-forming, non-seeding comfrey is adored by bees and the leaves can be used as an accelerant in the compost heap. You can also make comfrey tea, just as good as Tomorite.

Allen Swinbank, 87, got a call out of the blue earlier this year saying: ""I think my grandad is related to you.""!

Two brothers who knew nothing of each other's existence were finally brought together in their 80s.

Allen Swinbank, 87, got a call out of the blue earlier this year saying: ""I think my grandad is related to you.""

It was his half-brother John's granddaughter Natasha, who had been researching her family history.

The men's father John Spence-Swinbank left Allen's mother when Allen was just six months. Allen, of Goole, East Yorks, said: ""We didn't talk about my dad because my mum hated him.

""He then turned up at my door when I was 26. I did learn a bit about him but he never mentioned I had a brother.""

John, 85, was raised in Bridlington, East Yorks, by his grandad and aunts.

They told him his father died in the war but in fact he died in 1980 aged 68.

Captured at Dunkirk, he spent five years as a prisoner of war and later worked as a bus driver. John moved back in with his mum and baby half-sister aged 10 after his grandad died.

At 36 he moved to Scotland to work as an agricultural engineer and had children with wife Jenny, 76. After Natasha connected them, John travelled from his home in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, to see Allen. They are both great-grandads and love motorbikes.

Allen said: ""We hugged and there were a few tears. It's funny this has happened... in the past few years I've started wishing I have a brother or sister to share things with.""

John said: ""A neighbour of Allen's asked me if I was his brother, she said: ""˜I thought you were, you look like him'. That was a great feeling."" A delighted Allen added: ""We have a lot of catching up to do.

""This is a dream come true.""

Mountainside vineyards, where Prosecco is produced, are at risk from soil degradation and drought, researchers said. This has an impact on the local economy, study lead author Dr Paolo Tarolli added

Prosecco lovers could be left disappointed in the future as the popular wine risks being wiped out by climate change, environmental scientists have warned.

Mountainside vineyards - where the popular tipple is produced - are most at risk from soil degradation and drought, say experts.

The phenomenon also applies to other famous wines including Burgundy Grand Cru and Cabernet Sauvignon, the world's most popular red.

Study lead author Dr Paolo Tarolli, of the University of Padova in Italy, said: ""The risk is not only losing an agricultural product or seeing a landscape change, negatively impacting the local economy.

""The risk is losing entire communities' history and their cultural roots.""

Winter downpours are also becoming heavier, which raises the risk of soils and terraces being washed away and the landscape depleted, leaving the vines to grow in virtual bedrock.

Over millions of years, erosion has carried soils and water downhill - and this makes it difficult for grapes to grow as they send their roots deep in search of water. Mountain soils also lead to grapes that are small like blueberries.

The regions under threat include the Prosecco Hills of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene in Italy, a UNESCO world heritage site that is responsible for a high-quality wine called Prosecco Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG).

Small grapes have a higher ratio of skin to juice. Because so much aroma, flavour, and tannin are lodged in the skins, mountain wines often have intense flavours and, for red wines, copious tannin and therefore considerable structure.

Tucked into the hillsides of Italy, Portugal, and Spain, they are also the most difficult to maintain - coining the expression ""heroic viticulture"".

Extreme weather and changing socioeconomic conditions are making them even more challenging - and they are the most vulnerable to global warming.

Farmers and scientists must work together to save some of the world's most celebrated wines, says the Italian team.

Dr Tarolli said: ""The great effort required to manage these areas reinforces the specific human-environment connection.

""This is why they are recognised as cultural uniquenesses of primary historical and social importance, where traditional knowledge is still the determining element.""

Mountain vineyards get a lot of sun because of their elevation - from early in the day - and are usually quite a bit cooler.

Vines are showered in luminosity but the grapes do not bake in heat, which gives the final wine balance and a sense of freshness.

The study lists poor soil and less rain as the biggest threat to the industry and also cites several significant socioeconomic barriers.

Dr Tarolli said: ""The last half past century has been characterised by rural exodus and a gradual abandonment of mountain landscapes.

""The new generation is unwilling to continue working under extreme conditions if economic benefits are insignificant.""

Mountain vineyards are expensive to farm. Every bit of the work - from planting a vine to harvesting the grapes - is slow and painstaking.

And it usually has to be done by hand, because most tractors and mechanical harvesters cannot negotiate steep inclines.

They are also part of a larger ""polyculture"", often ringed by forests and other types of vegetation as well as wildlife.

Heroic viticulture sites either have a slope steeper than 30 percent, are located on small islands, higher than 500 metres above sea level or incorporate vines grown on terraces.

The name originated from the inherent difficulty of cultivating and harvesting crops in these landscapes.

Centuries-old examples include the Prosecco Hills of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene, Treviso, and the traditional vineyards of Pantelleria Island in the Strait of Sicily, both of which are protected by UNESCO.

The growing popularity of Prosecco comes at a high cost with an enormous amount of soil lost across steep hillsides.

Demand has soared by more than a third in five years, the fastest of any sparkling wine with champagne showing only around one percent growth over the same time period.

The researchers suggest strategic communications designed to unite scientists, farmers and consumers to onsite solutions like integrated small water storage systems to prevent runoff.

They also underline the importance of educating young people about the benefits of rural communities, preserving cultural heritage, living in equilibrium with the environment and sustainable agriculture.

Dr Tarolli added: ""The key to success lies in combining the traditional knowledge of winemakers with innovation and scientific rigor.

""In this way, farms can work closely with scientists to optimise investments for a more functional, sustainable, and safe agricultural landscape - a winning alliance to face these diverse natural and anthropogenic challenges.""

The findings were published in the journal iScience.

Although Campi Flegrei last erupted almost 500 years ago, a spate of recent earthquakes has left scientists concerned another catastrophe could be imminent

An Italian supervolcano which last erupted in 1538 is 'on the brink' of doing so again sparking fears of a global winter, scientists say.

According to research published in the journal, Communications Earth & Environment, the crust of Campi Flegrei is weakening and more prone to rupturing making an ""eruption more likely"".

Situated near Naples in the south of the country, Campi Flegrei (or Burning Fields, in Greek), is a broad region of supervolcanic calderas - a large depression which forms after a volcano erupts and collapses.

Should it erupt in a similar fashion to that 16th century occasion, molten rock and volcanic gases would be launched high into the stratosphere and lead to 100-feet high tsunamis.

It would also result in the spread of sulfur and toxic ash, potentially plunging the planet into a lengthy global winter, killing wildlife and crops in its wake.

Despite the site being inactive for such a long period of time, a recent rise in the number of earthquakes in the area - more than 600 in April alone - has left scientists gravely concerned.

Those concerns are mirrored by the half a million residents living in the vicinity and deemed most at risk. An evacuation plan is in place, which would see people moved away within three days, either by their own transport or buses, trains and boats.

Risk levels, which are regularly reviewed, are graded by colour - green, yellow, orange and red. Pozzuoli, which is home to a large proportion of those 500,000 residents, is currently on yellow alert.

Local man Francesco Cammarota told the Guardian: ""Some days there are more than one. It's frightening, especially at night. One day it will just go off.""

Discussing the study, which was carried out by experts at Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) and University College London (UCL), lead author Professor Christopher Kilburn (UCL Earth Sciences) revealed: ""Our new study confirms that Campi Flegrei is moving closer to rupture.""

Since the eruption almost 500 years ago, the area has been gently sinking due to rising magma pushing the ground above it up, with Pozzuoli lifted almost four metres in the last 70 years.

Mauro Antonio Di Vito, director of the INGV's nearby Vesuvius Observatory, said the dense population of the area presents a high risk as there would be a struggle to evacuate people through the narrow streets.

He added: ""These areas have been urbanised without considering the fragility. Buildings need to be better structured and we need a cultural change to really encourage people to do this.""

Scientists are optimistically cautious, however, that a huge scale eruption isn't necessarily inevitable. For that to happen gases would need build up faster than they can escape, whilst magma would need to be able to move at rapid speed through the crust where a crack has formed.

The Observatory's researcher, Stefano Carlino, explained: ""It's the same for all volcanoes that have been quiet for generations. Campi Flegrei may settle into a new routine of gently rising and subsiding, as seen at similar volcanoes around the world, or simply return to rest.

""We can't yet say for sure what will happen. The important point is to be prepared for all outcomes.""

Clarkson's Farm Kaleb Cooper congratulated his co-star Charlie Ireland after the land agent completed an impressive challenge

Charlie Ireland was praised by his Clarkson's Farm co-star Kaleb Cooper after completing the inaugural Rob Burrow Leeds Marathon on Sunday, to raise funds for Motor Neurone Disease research.

The advisor and land agent took to Instagram to thank those who supported him, with Kaleb praising Charlie before adding a cheeky comment about the work ahead on Jeremy Clarkson's Farm.

Charlie, whose dad was diagnosed with MND in 2008, wrote: ""Thank you to everyone who has donated to such a great cause @mndassoc Well done to everyone who ran the Rob Burrow Leeds marathon today, what an amazing experience! Here are a few clips from today! #robburrowleedsmarathon #runcheerfulcharlie #motorneuronedisease.""

""Well done don't forget we are walking crops tomorrow! Hope they legs have got it in them,"" Kaleb commented.

Fans shared their support for the Clarkson's Farm star as one wrote: ""Is there anything that this gentleman can't do? Great job, Charlie! Cheers,"" while another added: ""Amazing effort Charlie!! (hope you can still walk today?!).""

A fellow marathon runner said: ""That was a really tough run yesterday! Well done! (My legs are wrecked!!)""

Land agent and agricultural advisor Charlie, says: ""I'm not sure I really thought this through for my first (and only) marathon - Leeds is horribly hilly it seems - but I am looking forward to the challenge. My Dad was diagnosed with MND in 2008 and the MND Association were amazing.

""Our family met some incredible people who showed so much warmth and kindness which made Dad's life far easier. There is no known cure, but the funds raised will help families like ours to cope a little easier by getting the support they need from the MND Association. It will also enable further research into this terrible disease.""

Meanwhile, Clarkson's Farm stars Kaleb and Charlie visited Downing Street on Tuesday for a summit hosted by Rishi Sunak on securing supermarket supply chains.

Asked about the stars' attendance at the Farm to Fork meeting, the Prime Minister's spokesman told journalists: ""Obviously that programme (Clarkson's Farm) has been important in raising some of the issues that farmers face.

""And I think some of the policies set out today will support the farming sector.""

176,"Worldwide plastic waste has doubled since 2000 - and working animals are suffering","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/working-animals-health-plastic-waste-30230212","Worldwide plastic waste has doubled since 2000 - and working animals are suffering

Heartbreaking new footage shows working donkeys, camels, and cows left to scavenge for food among mountains of plastic waste - with life-threatening results

Worldwide plastic waste has more than doubled since 2000, figures show - but two-thirds of Brits (67 per cent) are unaware of the impact this is having on working animals overseas.

With an estimated 200 million animals working globally - including camels, horses, donkeys, oxen, mules, and even elephants - they are now more at risk than ever of catching a potentially fatal condition from dumped plastic waste.

These livestock are already faced with harsh conditions, in 40°C temperatures in countries like India and Mali, helping their owners transport water and goods for a small income - and even occasionally travelling to dumps, carrying the plastic waste that is threatening their welfare.

And ahead of International Working Animal Day on June 15, this heartbreaking footage has been released showing the animals scavenging for food among heaps of plastic and other waste.

The footage, from rubbish dumps in Mali, India, and Morocco, shows struggling donkeys almost buckling under the weight of the carts they are transporting - before sniffing around among huge mounds of black bin bags and other plastic, trying to find sustenance.

By accidentally ingesting plastic, these animals face severe health risks from internal blockages, and life-threatening conditions such as colic.

But with the global cost-of-living crisis, paired with growing global inequality, making it harder for owners to buy food for their animals, sadly these working animals are faced with little other choice.

The footage was released by working animal charity SPANA (the Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad), which also commissioned research of 2,000 British adults to highlight the lack of awareness about this growing global issue.

The study found that more than seven in ten Brits (71 per cent) are unaware that plastic pollution can have fatal consequences, affecting thousands of innocent animals.

However, 79 per cent said they now feel motivated to reduce how much plastic waste they personally generate, to help alleviate the plight of working animals.

Linda Edwards, Chief Executive of SPANA, which is raising awareness about the problem of plastic pollution this International Working Animal Day, said: ""Working animals have a critical role supporting families in vulnerable communities - but our research shows there is very little awareness about the deadly impact plastic waste has on these animals.

""We are making a lifesaving difference to working animals under severe threat from plastic pollution, by providing vital veterinary treatment and supporting owners with information and guidance on the dangers of plastic waste to their animals.""

The poll of 2,000 adults also found more than three-quarters (76 per cent) would like society to move towards a zero plastic or waste future, to prevent the harm caused to working animals.

Data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development shows 353 million tonnes of plastic waste were generated globally in 2019 - and only nine per cent of plastic waste is recycled.

Worldwide, the amount of plastic waste generated more than doubled from 2000 to 2019, with mismanaged waste - plastic that is either littered, or not disposed of properly - now a huge problem.

While the UK is estimated to produce just under 0.5kg of mismanaged plastic waste per person, Zimbabwe generates 36kg, Tanzania creates 30kg, and Tunisia 25kg by comparison.

Overall, just one in 20 of the adults polled (five per cent) claim to be very knowledgeable about the lives of working animals in low-income countries.

And the vast majority (82 per cent) had no idea about the 2022 UN Nexus Resolution - which recognises the interdependence between animal welfare, the environment, and sustainable development.

Last year, SPANA provided vital care and support to 306,412 working animals across the world - including in Mali, at the rubbish dumps seen in the video.

Colic - a life-threatening condition, which can be caused by eating plastic and foreign objects - is one of the most common problems treated by SPANA's veterinary teams.

In some parts of Morocco, where SPANA works, colic ranks as the second most common problem treated by the charity's vets, after lameness.

Without treatment, working horses, donkeys, and mules can have little chance of surviving colic.

Linda Edwards added: ""Sadly, many working animals in low-income countries live very difficult lives, working in extreme conditions and suffering from poor welfare.

""That is why SPANA's work is so important - offering a lifeline to working animals in desperate need, and transforming their welfare.

""We are providing training in animal care in owners, and bringing about long-term, lasting change through our animal welfare classes for children.

""Plastic pollution is one of the many environmental threats facing working animals, alongside climate change, drought, cyclones, and flooding.

""However, the deadly impact these issues have on working animals is often overlooked. Working animals can no longer be ignored - and it's critical that they receive the recognition and urgent help they need.""

A group of researchers have analysed 11,000 dogs across 300 breeds to come up with a list that reveals which types of pooches are the most and least friendly in the world

We all know that dogs are supposed to be a 'man's best friend' - but is that true of all breeds?

We'd all like to think to think that our furry friend is the best in the world - but truth be told there are some dogs that are less friendly than others. Some experts believe it has a lot to do with which breed they are.

A study has gone out to set the record straight, to find out which are the friendliest dog breeds, and those that are the least. So it turns out that when it comes to being sociable with humans, not every dog is equal.

Researchers at the University of Helsinki in Finland have revealed a list of the dog breeds with the highest and lowest levels of human sociability, and some may surprise you.

Their research shows that bull type terriers, such as the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, is officially man's best friend, closely followed by teacup dogs and golden retrievers.

On the flip side, the least friendly dog types are livestock guardian dogs, Asian primitive breeds, and primitive sighthounds. The full list can be seen below.

Most friendly dog breeds:

Least friendly dog breeds:

The researchers set out to investigate the personality differences between the dogs by analysing 11,000 pooches across 300 breeds, which were then categorised into 52 groups.

Their data showed that there's a strong link between dog breeds and personality traits such as insecurity, training focus, aggressiveness/dominance, energy, dog sociability, human sociability, and perseverance.

Dr Milla Salonen, the lead author of the study, said: ""The breed of the dog is the most important determinant underlying personality differences.

""All dogs are individuals, and all breeds have different traits, but the breeds differ in what kind of personality most dogs within each breed have.""

In addition to breed, they also found that female dogs scored higher than males. Human sociability also decreased with age.

Dr Salonen said.: ""Our findings indicate that new owners should familiarise their puppies as much as possible with unfamiliar people, places, and animals.

""Of course, socialisation must always be done on the puppy's terms, which means that the puppy must not be forced into frightening situations.""

Mother-of-nine Amanda Owen split from husband Clive last June, explaining at the time that it was 'not unique, it's just how things are, pressures, all the rest of it'

She's well-known for her life on Our Yorkshire Farm, but this week Amanda Owen takes a break from her toils for a new adventure in the series Farming Lives.

The 48-year-old mother-of-nine (there's Raven, Reuben, Miles, Edith, Violet, Sidney, Annas, Clementine and Nancy, aged from 21 to five) and her husband Clive announced their separation last June.

Amanda told the Radio Times that the split was ""not unique, it's just how things are, pressures, all the rest of it. But we have nine kids, with associated friends, girlfriends, and we just have to get on with it.""

For this solo series, she heads off to visit other farmers to see how they're making things work during these testing times""¦

Hi, Amanda! Can you tell us about your new show?

I visit different farms and their owners and see what they're up to, how they've diversified and what challenges they're facing. It was good for me as I've been rather confined to my own hill end, so it was nice to get a different outlook.

You stay on each farm for a few nights - how was that?

Eating with them and talking about their lives was important. I keep thinking about having somebody come to stay here with me - I'd have to do some serious tidying!

How are each of the six farms different?

Some of them are first-generation farmers like me, and some are family farms that

have been handed down. They all have different stories. One of the first people I went to was a Ukrainian lady, who was farming pigs. She was inspired by reading the James Herriot books in the Ukraine, just like me, which blew my mind.

You visit two sisters who run their farm in Shetland with their mum. What was their story?

Their dad died suddenly so they were faced with a stark choice, carry on or quit. It was where they were brought up, where their childhood was, so they decided to make things work.

Filming the show meant you spending time away from home. Did the kids cope?

Oh, yes. Years of training means they're fine. The nature of what we do means there's always something to be done, so they can bake, cook, even tidy up - usually when I give them a warning that I'm coming back!

We've watched your family grow up on-screen. Have things got easier as the children have got older?

It's never easy, it's different challenges. But I must admit I do like being a part of their journey as they grow up and seeing them develop. Raven is away at university doing a Masters now, Reuben's working independently and loving it, Miles has left school and is working at home. It brings in new people and keeps you on your toes. I hope it keeps me young.

You've become a well-known face on TV. How has that been for you?

Life has its challenges, whether that's in media-land or on the farm. You have to adapt and change over time, don't you?

We always see you hard at work. Do you enjoy the glamorous part of showbiz too?

Of course I do, although I think at the moment I'd need a very big scrub and a manicure! I enjoy being not what people expect. I hate the idea of stereotyping. I might be 6ft 2in and work on the farm, but I can wear heels, stick on false eyelashes and be totally happy talking to a bunch of hill farmers while I'm doing it!

Research by the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee suggests 'promoting more actively in Albania and elsewhere the provision of short-term work visas in sectors in which the UK needs workers

MPs today call on the Government to recruit Albanians to help tackle staff shortages.

A study by the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee suggests a campaign in Albania ""and elsewhere"" to promote temporary work visas in industries worst hit by short staff shortages.

It could prevent more Albanians crossing the Channel in small inflatable boats and claiming asylum, according to the panel.

""There is no case for special treatment for Albania in provision of work visas: its citizens are as entitled as any others to apply for those available in the UK,"" says the report.

""There may, though, be a case for promoting more actively in Albania and elsewhere the provision of short-term work visas in sectors in which the UK needs workers - seasonal agriculture or construction, for example - with the specific aim of enabling some transfer of wealth to countries from which asylum applications should not normally be countenanced but from which substantial numbers of people seek opportunities elsewhere.""

Committee chairwoman Dame Diana Johnson warned: ""People will continue to be attracted to the UK from Albania while it continues to offer job opportunities and higher wages.

""The UK should look at how access to work visa schemes can be improved to fill our skills or staffing gaps, while offering Albanian nationals a route to higher income, benefiting both nations.""

More than a quarter of the 45,755 migrants who crossed the Channel in small inflatable boats last year came from Albania - and most claimed asylum.

The number arriving in small boats over the Dover Strait - the world's busiest shipping lane - rocketed from 800 in 2021 to 12,301 in 2022.

Publishing its 30-page ""˜Asylum and migration: Albania' report today, the committee says the rise ""was both unexpected and unexplained"".

Dame Diana said: ""Such a substantial sudden increase in asylum claims from a seemingly peaceful country understandably raised concerns.""

Arrivals from Albania have slumped dramatically this year - and the committee ""found little evidence to indicate significant numbers of Albanian nationals are at risk in their own country and require asylum in the UK"".

However, it adds: ""While claims for political asylum should not normally be entertained, there are unquestionably cases of Albanian citizens being trafficked to the UK, from within Albania or from within other European countries, where appropriate safeguards must be in place before they are returned to Albania.""

Women are ""disproportionately at risk from this form of crime"", it says.

Earlier this month, the Home Office launched an advertising campaign to deter Albanians from coming to Britain.

The adverts, running in Albanian on Facebook and Instagram, warn they ""face being detained and removed"" if they make the dangerous journey across the Channel.

The Government claimed the campaign would ""make clear the perils"" faced by migrants on small boats.

Last week, Rishi Sunak said numbers of Albanians heading to Britain had plummeted in recent months.

The Prime Minister added: ""So far this year, the number of Albanian small boat arrivals has fallen by almost 90%.""

He said a returns deal with Tirana had led to 1,800 people being sent back.

Stink bugs have been found in many states and this time of year is when they are seen the most as the temperatures plummet and the insects try to find their way into people's homes

Invasive stink bugs are wreaking havoc across US states.

The unwelcome guests have become an unfortunate sight in the autumn season when leaves are changing and temperatures are dropping. Called the brown marmorated stink bug, the pest has been found in many homes in states across the US before winter sets in.

The critter was first found in Pennsylvania and by 2021 it had been seen every state apart from Alaska, South Dakota, and Wyoming. A study has even suggested their invasion could get worse,

The invasive species has severely impacted states on the east and west coasts, but areas of the Midwest. Central states between Montana and North Dakota and further south have ""no evidence of established populations,"" the US Department of Agriculture said.

The bugs are more annoying in autumn and on warm days multiple insects try come through doors and windows. If you are unlucky to have stood on one the bug gives off an unpleasant smell which can cause allergic reactions. The bugs, however, will not cause damage to your home. University of Wisconsin-Madison says many insect killers have not been updated to tackle the brown stink bug. Pest controllers can provide relief for those who are bothered by them in exterior locations.

Other things that can be done be done to prevent the bugs entering your home include making making sure openings in and around your home are sealed-off.

More pleasant smelling smells can be put on window sills to deter the bugs, Other products such as clove, lemongrass, and spearmint also help keep the bugs away. Experts recommend removing them them with a vacuum which can result in it giving off a bad smell over a period of time They can also be squashed flushed down the toilet or put in a container with soapy water according to insect controllers.

Experts advise against using insecticide inside as a dead bug may attract other insects which feed on the stink bugs. The pests eat as much as they can in autumn and live off stored energy during winter months. They can do without food until spring and will not reproduce.

But the winter months and the cold will not see them die, Thomas P. Kuhar, associate professor in the Department of Entomology at Virginia Tech found the stink bugs could endure temperatures below -4 degrees F.

The Mirror told in 2021 how a 'stink bug' which gives off a sickening smell could be invading homes and ruining fruit crops within ten years. The smelly bug is native to East Asia, but one has been recently found in the Royal Horticultural Society's garden in Surrey.

It is brown in colour and has a speckled pattern on its back, was first discovered in the UK last August at a nature reserve in Essex.

The stink bug has also been spotted in London, Suffolk and Hampshire, which has led scientists to believe it is spreading.

Ever wondered who may need to repopulate the earth in the event of mass extinction? Researchers say Australia and New Zealand have the best fighting chance

If you're terrified of a nuclear apocalypse - head Down Under.

That's according to the latest findings which suggest Australia and New Zealand are the best-placed countries to survive both manmade and natural disasters which would wipe out swathes of the population.

Researchers have looked at 38 different island nations' chances of surviving events like an asteroid strike or nuclear winter, and have revealed those which rank best for repopulating civilisation.

Factors such as how capable the land is of regrowth to produce food and energy, as well as infrastructure, were studied to see which places could survive mass disasters in pockets.

Also making the cut were Iceland, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, a group of islands in the South Pacific.

Indonesia, the Philippines and Mauritius were also outlined as being in with a good chance.

But the UK was not specifically examined among the case studies for its chances of surviving a nuclear apocalypse.

The study, published in the Risk Analysis journal, states that there would likely be a small number of survivors even in the worst case scenario.

New Zealand topped the list but still isn't without risk, the researchers said, as reliance on trade with us here in the UK and the US would be gone.

The study pointed at the Kiwis' nuclear-free status and resilience to abrupt temperature drops - due to being relatively small and surrounded by ocean, the nation is cushioned from the blows of a nuclear winter.

Even in the worst case scenario of 61% of crops destroyed in a nuclear apocalypse, New Zealanders would still have enough to eat, said Prof Nick Wilson, one of the study's authors.

Australia, also topping the list, was meanwhile described as having a ""gigantic"" food supply buffer in the event of animals and crops dying.

Iceland's NATO membership meanwhile puts it at slightly higher risk status, the researchers said, and would also suffer from a lack of trade with the US and Europe.

But the mid-Atlantic Scandinavian island is described as being incredibly self-sufficient, producing its own renewable energy and would be able to rely on fishing for food.

""There will likely be pockets of survivors around the planet in even the most severe ASRS [abrupt sunlight reduction scenarios],"" wrote Prof Wilson and co-author Dr Matt Boyd.

""However, trade in food, energy, components, and expertise is needed to maximise survival chances in the face of severe climate effects and the cascading impacts across many human and ecological systems.

""Collapse of technological society is possible even in locations considered most likely to survive. This may seriously impede cooperation, coordination, and resilient food production.""

Brands like Charlotte Tilbury, Sol de Janeiro and Elemis are big pulls for this year's beauty advent calendars, but some products have been cropping up more than others

When it comes to the countdown to Christmas - 83 sleeps, if you were wondering - beauty advent calendars are one of the most popular ways to mark the days off throughout the festive period. Over the past two months, The Mirror have been taking a look at the biggest and best, from high end hauls to budget beauty buys, as well as the ones that will save you the most money.

But one thing we noticed while reviewing the countless contents of each one was that there are a few brands that crop up time and time again. It's no bad thing, that's for sure, it simply means they're popular with shoppers and are likely to entice you to purchase them.

What's more though, is that on some occasions, the exact same product was cropping up, from TikTok viral purchases to skincare sensations. So, we decided to go through the most popular beauty advent calendars for 2023 and analyse what's inside to see which brands and products are most commonly found.

Some of the brands I saw recurring in a number of calendars were social media approved Color Wow, Mirror reader fave Medik8, Malin and Goetz and Dermalogica, all of which appeared five times in 15 advent calendars, though the products did vary in each one. However, the viral Sol de Janeiro was also spotted five times, and on four occasions, it was of course the coveted Bum Bum Cream, starring in LookFantastic, Harvey Nichols, ASOS and Sephora's beauty calendar. I had expected this to be the most popular throughout, having noticed the name appearing over and over, but there were other brands and products more frequently popping up, including Elemis and OTO both featuring six times, while Aromatherapy Associates and Acqua di Parma appeared seven, the latter across four calendars.

It will come as no surprise that Charlotte Tilbury was one of the most commonly found brands and a real pull for many of the calendars. For example, a £45 eyeshadow palette appears in ASOS's £90 offering, making it a real star of the show. But the Hollywood glam brand also appears in Harrods in the form of a mascara, lipsticks in Harvey Nics and Fenwick, eyeshadow palettes in a further two and setting spray in Selfridges.

I often joke that Philip Kingsley appears in ""˜every beauty box ever' because I always seem to have Elasticizer coming out of my ears, and this year, the brand appears in eight calendars, though only three are Elasticizer products. The brand stars in five advent calendars, with the M&S option containing three bestsellers from the haircare collection alone. Dr. Barbara Sturm also appears in eight calendars, as does Sunday Riley, with four of their products being Good Genes, on par with the Bum Bum cream.

The most popular brand of all was REN Skincare, cropping up nine times throughout across eight calendars, coming in twice in the Boots Premium calendar, boasting overnight spot treatments, eye creams, AHA tonics and cleansing gels.

But the one product that brands seem to be using as a big draw is none other than The Rich Cream from Augustinus Bader. The brand cropped up seven times throughout - almost half of the calendars we looked at - and each and every time it was the exact same product: a 15ml sample of the coveted cream.

Here's every calendar where it features this year:

Liberty

Cult Beauty

Harvey Nichols

Harrods

Space NK

Selfridges

Fenwick

You'll notice that all of the above are what we consider to be the high end beauty advent calendars of 2023, and that's because The Rich Cream bumps up the value of these calendars quite dramatically, with this deluxe sample size being worth an eye watering £71. It's not the kind of money that people can justify spending on one item, least not before Christmas, but when included in a money-saving haul of products, it's a great way to snag it for less.

A revolutionary face cream is said to be inspired by 30 years of research and innovation, that patented 'Trigger Factor Complex' (TFC8) which ""˜unlocks a code' in your skin that repairs tissue. Considered a ""˜holy grail' by many, this formula is best-suited to those with normal to dry skin types and can help visibly reduce the signs of ageing and environmental damage.

The 71-year-old tells the Mirror: ""Not only was there silence but somehow it was cold in my soul. I went out of the house, saw my neighbour and asked her: 'What is it, why aren't the children going to school?' She replied: 'There was an explosion at the nuclear power plant.'""

The Chernobyl disaster forced Mykhaylo, his family and hundreds of thousands of others to leave their homes. Some never returned.

The United Nations believes the radiation caused some 5,000 cases of thyroid cancers. Millions of acres of forest and farmland were contaminated, livestock was born deformed and humans continue to suffer long-term negative health effects.

And now as Russian President Putin's invasion of Ukraine rumbles on, fears are growing about another disaster as forces exchange fire near another plant.

Speaking from Ukraine on International Chernobyl Disaster Remembrance Day, Professor Yevgen Yakovlev told the Mirror that the threat of Russia's occupation of Zaporizhzhya poses a ""very high"" risk.

Before Chernobyl imploded, Professor Yakovlev was researching and analysing contamination of groundwater, vegetation and bottom sediments.

He found that thermal contamination was coming from unit four (the ultimate site of the disaster): ""At the end of 1985, we found that the temperature under the 4th block had risen by about 16 degrees: instead of 12, it was already 28 degrees.""

A month before the disaster, he presented his findings to the Central Committee of the Communistic Party of the Soviet Union in Moscow and was told his data was false.

Professor Yakovlev tells the Mirror: ""Moscow told me that I was an enemy of nuclear power development in the USSR. They said there was 'no time to deal with sh*t like me.'""

This week, the British Ministry of Defence warned that Russian troops have established ""sandbag fighting positions"" on buildings housing reactors at the nuclear plant.

It said: ""The move highly likely increases the chances of damage to ZNPP safety systems if fighting takes place around ZNPP.""

Dr Mark Wenman, Senior Lecturer in the Centre for Nuclear Materials and Department of Materials at Imperial College London, tells the Mirror that the act of taking a nuclear power station and making it a defensive military position is in direct violation of the Geneva Convention.

But he also says the reactors at Zaporizhzhia are of a different kettle of fish to Chernobyl's and there would be no release of radioactive material outside of the containment buildings.

According to Dr Wenman, the worst-case comparable scenario is the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania, US. This disaster saw large portions of the nuclear reactor core melt, which released radiation but caused no deaths or harm.

Dr Wenman says: ""I don't, in my wildest dreams, envisage anything happening on a significant scale [at Zaporizhzhia] that would endanger the lives of even the local inhabitants.""

Radiation from Chernobyl poisoned whole villages and the memories are still painful 37 years later.

Mykhaylo ended up working as the head of the union in Chernobyl for disabled people and in 2021, he was awarded the state order ""For Service"" by the decree of President Zelensky.

He says: ""Every year the date is a disaster for me. It is not the start of spring, but a disaster. Chernobyl is my homeland, my father's house is still there. I don't know what happened to it during the war.""

In March, after the plant first came under attack, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sent a message to the Russians: ""You know the word ""˜Chernobyl'.""

Keir Giles, the author of Russia's War on Everybody, tells the Mirror: ""You've got to wonder what is going through the heads of Russian soldiers preparing to be shot at while sitting on top of nuclear reactors.

""The tragic reality is that, just as with Chernobyl over 30 years before, it is not Russia itself but its neighbours Ukraine and Belarus that would bear the brunt of the devastating consequences of a nuclear accident.

""It's just another sign of how Russia's behaviour in its war on Ukraine is an insult not just to any civilised standards of human behaviour, but to common sense.""

In one prison in Norway, prisoners are provided their very own cottage, as well as farmland to grow their own crops, and if that wasn't enough they can also go horseback riding or take tennis lessons while serving time for crimes as serious as murder and rape

There are a handful of correctional facilities across the globe where murderers and rapists live in prisons likened to boutique hotels and holiday resorts.

In some prisons comfort, prisoner wellbeing and rehabilitation are more important than punishment, even if the crimes committed by their residents are grave. By bucking the trend of the inhumane conditions seen across the world, some of the countries have been rewarded with plummetting reoffending rates.

Inmates at many of these jails have the opportunity to stay in contact with their families on the outside, while one has even allowed relatives to live inside the prison walls in the hopes of keeping familial bonds strong and preventing the trauma of separation.

Other facilities have a myriad of activities on offer to rival any adventure holiday, including horseback riding, tennis lessons, and prison-wide dancing performances. The most lax nick of the lot gives prisoners their own cottage along with a patch of farm land to cultivate.

Here's a list of the world's ten most luxurious prisons...

10. Cebu Prison, Philippines

The Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center, a 1,600-inmate nick in the Philippines' Cebu Province, in a maximum security jail meant for the most hardened Filippino killers and rapists. Though it is meant to house just over 1,500 convicts, in 2020 it was critically congested, raising fears of the rapid spread of coronavirus.

Cebu is one of the rogue mentions in the list, as the conditions aren't particularly pleasant. The reason for its inclusion is the prison's novel approach to rehabilitation, which has offered inmates a number of recreational and creative exercises to keep them occupied. Each inmate is required to participate in singing and dancing numbers and they have put on a series of performances for the paying public.

In February 2023, the so-called Dancing Inmates were said to be preparing for a return to public viewings after a two year break due to Covid-19. Some of their dances have become so popular in the Philippines that they are mobbed for autographs when they finish.

9. Halden Prison, Norway

The crimes committed by the residents of Halden Prison stand in stark contrast to its reputation as one of the world's most humane jails. Rapists, murderers and paedophiles line the wings of the nick, which became the flagship of Norway's justice system after it was opened in 2010.

The £138million minimalist complex sits in a sprawling forest, which has often been compared to a boujee hotel rather than a maximum security prison. Each cell has a flatscreen, an en-suite toilet with a door for privacy, and a shower. The prisoners are also provided with large fluffy towels, their own fridges and unbarred windows for an un restricted view of the stunning forest outside.

Outside of the private, comfortable quarters, each wing enjoys a communal recreation room where prisoners can watch TV, movies, and play video games. There is also a studio for recording music, a state-of-the-art gym and convicts have the choice to undertake classes to build their skills.

8. Sollentuna Prison, Sweden

Similarly to Halden, convicts at Sollentuna are given their own private cells with comfortable beds and joining bathrooms. They also have a fully-equipped gym where they can keep fit, an open kitchen to cook meals, and a simple room where they can kick back and watch TV.

Another high-security prison in the list, it earns its place for its trailblazing eco initiatives. It won the 2019 BREEAM Public Projects In-Use award for installing a massive 1,100 square metre green roof of plants and turf. The greenery ""protects the roof from [solar] radiation, rainfall and temperature changes,"" and helps ""facilitate the run-off of surface water onto the property, while also enabling pollination ""¦ for insects,"" said Sara Jägermo, Vasce's head of property.

They also installed an air-recylcing ventilation system and a room where they can collect multiple different categories of waste. Insulating glass surrounding the entire structure also helps the building regulate its temperature.

7. JVA Fuhlsbuettel Prison, Germany

Hamburg's JVA Fuhlsbuettel prison, which is based in a former Nazi concentration camp, is far cushier than its history would suggest. Swanky cells, washing machines and spotless floors are all available to the long-term prisoners serving their sentences.

The facility has drawn criticism in the past for its approach to punishment, but the prisoners are grateful for the additional telephone nooks that they can use when speaking to family members.

6. Champ-Dollon Prison, Switzerland

The maximum security Champ-Dollon prison was built in 1977 to house just 200 inmates, and being a remand facility with 60 per cent of prisoners awaiting trial, it became critically overcrowded.

Before a major £32million cash injection in 2011 the cells were packed full, with diseases spreading with ease through the prison population. Riots were also regular.

With the money, authorities spruced up the nick, with prisoners now given triple occupancy cells with attached bathrooms. There has also been a major revamp to the outdoor areas, with plenty of activities for them to participate in. Some say it makes prisoners feel as though they're living on a university dorm rather than doing time.

5. Aranjuez Prison, Spain

Aranjuez Prison in Madrid is the first of its kind, a prison designed to keep families together. The nick is said to be the only one in the world with cells specifically for families, where toddlers can go to nursery and play, while locked up with their murdering and drug-trafficking parents.

The spacious units dubbed ""five-star cells"" come with cribs and Disney characters on the walls. Outside there's even a prison playground for the kids.

The idea is for children to bond with their imprisoned parents while young enough not to fully grasp the reality of incarceration, and for inmates seeking rehabilitation to learn parenting skills.

4. Justice Center Leoben, Austria

Nestled in a mountainous part of Austria, the Justice Center Leoben has repeatedly ranked among the world's best prisons and is often compared to a five-star hotel. It differs from the rest of the facilities because it is designed for 205 non-violent offenders.

Each prisoner gets their own ""cell"", along with an adjoining bathroom, kitchenette, TV, and full-size window for a view of the spectacular scenery. In the recreational area outside, cons can play basketball, work out at the outdoor gym or chill at the spa. Others can simply wander around and socialise freely.

3. Otago Corrections Facility, New Zealand

The Otago Corrections Facility in Milton, New Zealand, was opened in 2007 for low to medium-security male prisoners.

The facility is surrounded by a high-security fence, but inside there is plenty of space for prisoners to exercise and mingle. A separate building is used for accommodation, with rooms said to be comfortable.

But where Otago really stands out is its approach to rehabilitation and providing convicts with skills they can use on their release.

Among the education on offer are qualifications in carpentry, hospitality and even engineering.

2. HMP Addiewell, Scotland

HMP Addiewell is similarly focussed on building productive skills for its 700 prisoners and aims to have every single convict turn out of the facility with something to help them succeed on the outside.

According to the Scottish Prisons Service, Addiewell is designed to be a ""learning prison"" where convicts are urged to address their offending behaviour and the ""circumstances which led to their imprisonment"".

The learning element of their stay aims to ""improve their employability prospects"". Each week, prisoners are required to complete 40 hours of what it calls ""purposeful activity"".

1. Bastoy Prison, Norway

Plonked on a deserted island in 1982, the Bastoy Prison sits in one square mile of pine trees, with stunning views of the ocean. It houses a maximum of 100 murderers and rapists, who have access to such thrilling activities as horseback riding, fishing, tennis lessons and sunbathing.

Rather than cells, the convicts get cottages to live in with their own farmland to toil. Rather than the pot noodles found in British nicks, the chef at Bastoy offers up the likes of ""fish balls with white sauce, with shrimps"" as well as ""everything from chicken con carne to salmon"".

Despite its minimum security and the horrendous nature of its prisoners crimes', Bastoy is said to have the lowest reoffending rate in Europe, reported The Guardian.

When interviewed by CNN in 2012, prison governor Arne Kvernvik Nilsen said: ""If we have created a holiday camp for criminals here, so what?""

He added: ""We should reduce the risk of reoffending, because if we don't, what's the point of punishment, except for leaning toward the primitive side of humanity?""

And the numbers speak for themselves. Only 20 per cent of Norwegian convicts reoffended within two years of their release date in 2010, with figures in Bastoy even lower at around 16 per cent.","https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article30922319.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Cebu-Dancing-Inmates.jpg","The Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center, a 1,600-inmate nick in the Philippines' Cebu Province, in a maximum security jail meant for the most hardened Filippino killers and rapists.

246,"Dream expert reveals significant meaning behind common 'teeth falling out' vision","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/dream-expert-reveals-significant-meaning-30648273","Dream expert reveals significant meaning behind common 'teeth falling out' vision

Sleep experts have shared what people's most common dream is - and it's been keeping people up at night Googling what it really means when it crops up at night

As you wake up from a dream, it can feel like a bizarre and surreal moment, trying to convince yourself that what just happened wasn't true. Dreaming is something we all do - but sometimes dreams can reoccur and they're a good telltale as to what's going on in our subconscious mind. Sleep experts and psychologists can spend hours analysing dreams and what they really mean and it can take you a while to shake off the memories of what happened - leaving us wondering what the meaning behind it was.

Sleep experts at MattressNextDay have revealed what the most common dream we have is, and after conducting a large-scale study and analysing dream-related Google searches. They have found that Brits' most common dream is thinking their teeth have fallen out - most commonly to happen in April.

Whilst we might forget most of our dreams once we wake up, thought to be because of what happens to us during the rapid eye movement sleep stage (REM). Dreaming of your teeth falling out has been the one to keep people up and Googling what it can mean. Other common dreams we may have are - falling into a hole, being chased, being naked in public and being chased too.

Commenting on this, the dreams expert Inbaal Honigman explained: ""Teeth are a sign of life's ages and stages. We are born with none, go through two sets in childhood and adulthood, and start to lose them again in old age. Dreaming about losing teeth is natural since it's a rite of passage that we've all gone through. It's a dream that symbolises loss, like leaving a relationship behind or even moving house.""

It's estimated we can dream up to six times a night, for up to two hours a time, and f you're curious about delving deeper into dreams and working out what they might mean, a dream decoder and spirituality expert has shared her top tips for doing just this with The Mirror.

Theresa Cheung has been researching and writing about dreams for the last 25 years and is best known for her book, The Dream Dictionary. She believes that dream 'decoding' can be like a ""free form of therapy"" as it allows you space to understand yourself better.

""The first way to interpret them is to ask yourself how does this scenario make you feel and the purpose of that is to help you understand yourself better. All counselling and therapy try to do is to help you understand who you are - and your dreams are doing that for free every single night.

""The big stumbling block people have is that they don't understand their dreams because dreams speak in a different language and the first task you have to do is try and work it out. The language is very basic to who we are as human beings, it's all symbols and metaphors and figurative language association.""

Looking to buy a loved one a bottle of perfume this Christmas? Here are our top picks as selected by a former employee based on this year's bestsellers and deals

Perfume is usually pretty high up on every woman's Christmas wish list - but without specific brands listed, picking one out or surprising your loved one with something new can be a daunting task. It's an incredibly personal and often intimate gift, so you've got to get it right - but how if you don't know where to start?

I previously worked on the Boots fragrance counter while I was at university, and over the course of four years, helped countless people test scents and find the perfect present for their mum, sister, wife, girlfriends or other lucky lady in their life. So who better to make some solid recommendations than someone who was slinging bottles through the till for four years on the trot?

This December, Boots are predicted to sell more than one bottle of perfume or aftershave every single second throughout the month, which we expect will lead to a lot of happy recipients come the 25th.

When it comes to aftershave, Sauvage has topped the list of Boots bestsellers for a second year running, but as for women's scents, there's one brand - rather than a particular perfume - that crops up a lot more than others.

The health and beauty retailer told The Mirror they have sold one bottle of fragrance every four seconds throughout 2023, and among some of the most popular are various scents from luxury fragrance and fashion house Chanel.

The number one bestselling perfume for women so far at Boots this year has been Chanel Coco Mademoiselle, which is unsurprising as it's a total classic, incredibly elegant and timeless. I actually got my first bottle of this in 2015 for winning a competition at work, and it's remained a firm favourite in my fragrance wardrobe ever since. A 35ml bottle will currently set you bag £71 at Boots, with notes of fresh orange, jasmine and rose, with hits of patchouli and vetiver at the base.

It's racked up a 4.8 star rating on the Chanel website, with one commenting: ""My absolute favourite perfume. Coco mademoiselle is so subtle feminine and fresh.even after a full day people comment on the lovely sent I'm wearing.""

Another added: ""WOW I just love this perfume but having the big one is something else,"" though a third penned: ""The fragrance is light, floral and fresh. It's perfect for summer and daily wear. It stays for quite a long period of time which is an added bonus. Overall it's a beautiful combination of fragrance, but something feels like it's missing from the scent.""

Chanel's Bleu De Chanel made it in at number four of the top 10 bestsellers, proving the brand is popular with the gents, too, but lower down the list, there are two more Chanel scents that remain a hit with shoppers.

In at number eight, Chanel Chance offers an aroma of pink pepper, jasmine and amber patchouli alongside white musks and vanilla. Meanwhile, Chanel No5 sneaks in at number 10, renowned for its powerful ylang-ylang and neroli scent paired with warm vanilla, vetiver and sandalwood.

Other bestselling Boots scents this year so far include Dior's Miss Dior, La Vie Est Belle from Lancome, and Marc Jacobs Daisy, which we named our Mirror Choice best perfume for mums. It has over 1,100 five star reviews from shoppers who say they ""˜get so many compliments' when they wear it. Another wrote: ""Bought this for my mum, her favourite fragrance . Delighted it had £10 off too.""

A third said: ""My mum is in her 50s and also likes this perfume so it is suitable for people of all ages, not a specific ""young"" or ""old"" smell."" While a fourth said it was ""˜not as strong as other Marc Jacobs' but ""˜still beautiful'.

And if your loved one is a fan of Black Opium, might I suggest trying its lighter, fresher sister fragrance - YSL Black Opium Illicit Green Eau de Parfum 75ml. Said to be perfect for both day and nighttime wear, the perfume has been reduced from £105 to £52.50 as part of the retailer's star gifts.

The half-price fragrance offers a ""˜fresh, vibrant take' on the iconic YSL scent, boasting a ""˜captivating floral gourmand scent' with the signature black coffee base that Black Opium is renowned for, infused with zesty green mandarin and creamy fig resulting in a ""˜mocktail-inspired' spritz.

Other fragrances I'd recommend for the women in your life include:

Jo Malone Peony & Blush Suede - £55 for 30ml at LookFantastic

Paco Rabanne Lady Million - £78 for 50ml at Boots

Viktor & Rolf Flowerbomb - £65 for 30ml at Boots

YSL Libre Eau de Parfum - £92 for 50ml at Boots

Prada Paradoxe Eau de Parfum - £55.25 for 30ml at LookFantastic (was £65)

Paco Rabanne OlympÃ©a For Women Eau De Parfum - £56 for 30ml at Boots

ChloÃ© Signature Refillable Eau de Parfum - £22.60 for 20ml on Notino (was £41)

Carolina Herrera Good Girl - £51 for 30ml at LookFantastic (was £60)

If after all that, you're still a bit stumped and still can't choose, Boots actually has a fragrance finder where you can input someone's favourite brands and fragrances, and it will recommend alternatives. Or you can add scent notes and it will tell you which perfumes will appeal.

251,"Global warming is to blame for devastating East Africa drought, scientists believe","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/global-warming-blame-devastating-east-29846429","Global warming is to blame for devastating East Africa drought, scientists believe

Rivers in the Horn of Africa are usually in full flow, but a devastating drought caused primarily by climate change has left villagers without water for drinking, cooking and washing - and killed off crops and livestock

The devastating drought tearing through the Horn of Africa would not have happened if it wasn't for human-driven climate change.

The region has been left completely devoid of water - forcing desperate families to dig several metres into arid river beds to find a trickle - after months of failed rainy seasons delivered the worst drought in 40 years.

The situation has also driven conflict, with more than four million people now in need of humanitarian aid.

A cohort of 19 researchers from seven countries studied if climate change was to blame, ruling that the longer rainy season has become drier, while the short rainy season has become wetter all due to changes in global temperatures.

They branded the drought ""one of a kind"", adding that climtae change had made agricultural drought one hundred times more likely.

They added: ""Ongoing devastating drought would not have happened at all without the effect of greenhouse gas emissions"".

Head meteorologist at the Kenya Meteorological Department Joyce Kimutai said: ""Climate change has made the drought exceptional.""

The study group from the World Weather Attribution group analysed historical weather data - which included changes in the region's two primary rainfall patterns.

The scientists did concede that high temperatures, conflict, fragile statehood and poverty, were also to blame.

The United Nations said more than 20 million people in Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda and South Sudan have been affected by the drought.

In Somalia and Ethiopia there is an added risk to thousands of expectant or breastfeeding women.

Friederike Otto, senior climate scientist at Imperial College London and the leader of the study, said it underscored how climate change's effects ""strongly depend on how vulnerable we are.""

Rod Beadle, head of relief and humanitarian affairs at Food for the Hungry, said almost 15 million children are exposed to acute malnourishment.

""Despite the recent rains in North Kenya, the pressure from previous failed seasons makes for a dire situation. The flooding has impacted livestock and many pastoralists lost their primary livelihoods. The drought conditions have resulted in severely compacted soil that cannot absorb the water; hence the floods are more severe. The country is also facing severe outbreaks of cholera and other diseases as more refugees arrive,"" Beadle said.

Development gains in the countries have been offset by a long history of natural disasters, famine and disease, said Guyo Malicha Roba, a food security expert who heads the Jameel Observatory, which works on food insecurity issues in dryland nations.

Roba said the food situation in the region's drylands has addressed by raising money and with food distributions from governments and humanitarian partners, but more work needs to be done to use early-warning systems to respond more quickly to ""food shocks.""

WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: The unnamed 14-year-old had been experiencing headaches and vomiting for a month before the gruesome discovery in India and reported in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)

A teenager has miraculously escaped death after a parasitic tapeworm was found on his brain.

The unnamed 14-year-old had been experiencing headaches and vomiting for a month before the gruesome discovery.

He was rushed to hospital where doctors performed an MRI scan, revealing a massive cyst.

The schoolboy, from India, was diagnosed with a form of echinococcosis, an infectious disease caused by tapeworms and it's believed he contracted this after being in contact with infected livestock or dog faeces.

After undergoing a craniotomy, where a small hole is cut in the skull, revealing the brain, the large cyst was successfully removed.

Video footage shows doctors gently separating the cyst wall from the brain to avoid rupture.

According to local reports, the boy returned to school and resumed normal activities two weeks after being discharged - but the situation could have been fatal if left untreated.

The case study was published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).

In another horror surgery case, a five-year-old boy complaining of an ""ear infection"" turned out to have a battery lodged in his throat for five weeks.

Luke McMillan, from Arizona, US, was an energetic little toddler who was prone to the odd ear infection as he would often rub his ears.

Mum Erica McMillan took him to the doctors to get checked out and he was given antibiotics and told the infection will eventually clear up.

He seemed to get better and was on the up, however, Luke was struggling to swallow solid foods as he would bring them back up.

Luke's parents decided to switch his diet from solids to liquids to make sure he was still able to eat.

Erica told The State: ""We just assumed it was a side effect because he's kind of done that before where he doesn't really want to eat anything.""

And on Valentine's Day, it was reported that a dad's leg ""snapped in half"" after awkwardly landing on a trampoline.

Ryan Schelin, 30, had taken his kids to DEFY Boise trampoline park in Nampa, Idaho, US, when he challenged himself to bounce high enough to touch the top of a 12ft padded wall.

But in shocking footage, which has since gone viral, the dad-of-three is seen raising his hands during a mid-air celebration as he achieves the feat to the delight of his cheering family.

However, 18-stone Ryan then ""loses concentration"" and lands with all his weight on his right leg - causing it to ""buckle"" under the pressure and ""snap"" with a loud crack.

Ryan said the accident left him able to ""fold his leg in half"" and see the bones sticking out of his flesh.

After being blue-lighted to hospital he was forced to undergo surgery where a metal rod was inserted to hold the two broken bones together for the rest of his life.

Ryan's wife Shandra Schelin, 30, has since banned him and their three children from playing on a trampoline again.

Experts say Britain's rats are becoming resistance to rodenticides, which have been used since the 1950s, and are thriving on the nation's calorie-laden fast food

Up to 300million ""super rats"" are feared to soon be plaguing the UK - after becoming obese eating fatty takeaway scraps.

Experts say the rodents are gorging on leftovers strewn on streets and overflowing bins as the nation's diet has become increasingly unhealthy.

It's believed rats have also grown resistant to rodenticides, which have been used since the 1950s.

Craig Morris, a pest controller with 15 years of experience, said: ""Rats are becoming more of an issue. They are one of nature's amazing survivors. They have exploited everything we do and done it really well.

""What might sound horrific to most people is just an everyday occurrence to me, I'm afraid.""

The 53-year-old man, who operates across Hampshire, Dorset and Wiltshire, told Daily Star poor sanitation and hygiene has also led to the boom in rat population recently.

But the country's dependence on calorie-laden fast food is also behind the surge, Mr Morris said.

Last month, a McDonald's customer was left horrified after spotting up to seven rats climbing in and out of a bin in the car park of a Hull restaurant.

Scenes like this have concerned ecology researchers.

Steve Belmain, a professor of ecology at the Natural Resources Institute at Greenwich University, London, said of the UK's rat numbers: ""I could easily imagine 200 to 300 million rats here.""

Prof Belmain is aiding a project in which rats are being trapped across livestock farms in Norfolk and Essex to test for the prevalence of disease.

It is happening because a study in December last year claimed around 78 per cent of rats had developed genetic resistance to anticoagulants.

The biggest rat on record to have been caught in Britain, by a Bournemouth pest hunter in 2018, measured 21 inches in length - as big as a small dog.

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever is feared to be heading towards Britain and France thanks to climate change and has a high mortality rate, according to experts

A virus running riot across Europe, Africa and the Middle East which is feared to be the biggest threat to the public could soon be found on Britain's shores.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF ) broke out in Iraq and Namibia and there have been cases in Spain as well as deaths recorded in Pakistan. An urgent health warning has already been issued in what has been described as the current biggest threat to public health and is feared to be accelerated by climate change .

Spread through ticks, the disease is caused by Nairovirus and according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and has a fatality rate of between 10 and 40 percent. Last week, insiders speaking to Parliament's Science, Innovation and Technology Committee revealed it was ""highly likely"" there could soon be cases in the UK.

During the hearing, James Wood, head of veterinary medicine at Cambridge University, said CCHF could find its way to the UK ""through our ticks, at some point"". The disease is feared to be expanding out of its usual territories and moving towards the likes of Britain and France because of climate change.

Symptoms of CCHF

Among the virus' symptoms include headaches , high fever, back and joint pain, stomach ache, and vomiting. Red eyes, a flushed face, a red throat, and petechiae (red spots) on the palate are also common.

In severe cases, WHO warns, jaundice, mood swings and sensory perception are encountered. As the illness progresses, large areas of severe bruising, severe nosebleeds, and uncontrolled bleeding at injection sites can be seen, beginning on about the fourth day of illness and lasting for about two weeks.

In documented outbreaks of CCHF, fatality rates in hospitalised patients ranged from nine percent to as high as 50 percent. The long-term effects of CCHF infection have not been studied well enough in survivors to determine whether or not specific complications exist. However, recovery is slow.

How is it spread?

According to the WHO, human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from ""close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons"".

Concerningly, there is currently no vaccine available for either people or animals infected by the disease.

CCHF is transmitted to people by either bites from ticks or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues immediately after slaughter.

Hosts of CCHF include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep and goats.

According to the WHO, the majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians.

Reported deaths

Iraq was reportedly in a major battle with the disease last year, with 212 incidents recorded between January 1 and May 22. Of those, 169 were reported between April and May alone.

Agence France-Presse added in May that almost 100 additional cases - and 13 deaths - were so far in 2023 attributed to the toll in Iraq.

Experts reveal the list of plants to avoid decorating your house with this festive season as they pose serious risks to pets - and the list's common Christmas favourite's may surprise you

As November fast approaches many households will be starting to spruce up their home ready for the festive period but there's a stark warning for pet owners as joyous plants, even as simple as a sprig of decorative Holly, can pose serious health risks to four-legged companions.

It won't be long until farms across the country start selling freshly wrapped trees, a go-to for many who love to fill their house with the smell of pine needles this winter. However, a survey from VetsNow has shown that a staggering 43% of family pets need emergency care after eating plants dotted around at home.

And research compiled by Clear It Waste shows an alarming number of Christmas favourites can be incredibly toxic if ingested. Mistletoe, Holly, and Christmas trees may be popular picks this winter but you may want to sway from using these if you have a curious pet.

Holly

The vibrant red berry classic, Holly has become a favourite pick thanks to its pointy dark green leaves and spots of red. While the points leaves could nick paws the real danger is in the tiny berries.

This is down to the Theobromine packed into the berries and, just like chocolate, it is highly toxic for cats and dogs as specialists say its vomiting, diarrhoea and high blood pressure side effects can even cause death in severe cases.

Yew

Similar to Holly above, when congested yew can cause diarrhoea, vomiting and even serious convulsions, all the same side effects often seen in adults. As stunning as the light green needle and brown coned trees are they are very poisonous, even if the attractive colours scream otherwise.

Again, it all comes down to the berries which contain a chemical called taxines, and even if you avoid these red fruits altogether traces can still be found in the cones and needles. So toxic when congested that they've previously been used in farming to deter livestock.

Winter Cherry

Also given the moniker 'Jerusalem Cherry' the orange-tinted berries on this plant couldn't be further from the juicy sweet forest fruits enjoyed by many. In fact, both humans and animals suffer from headaches, abdominal pain and vomiting if ingested.

The seasonal plants can easily be mistaken for tomato plants, thanks to their similar round fruits, so people are urged to take extra care to avoid dangerous confusion between the two this winter. Its poisonous solanocapsine is found in the unripe fruit and leaves of the plant.

Christmas Trees


For some, popping the Christmas tree up in November is perfect timing but as the needles start to fall it could pose a serious risk to your pets. The pointy pieces of pine can hurt their paws, and eyes and get stuck in the mouth, but the biggest risks come if swallowed.

Although tiny to the eye swallowing the needles can lead to blockages in the stomach and in serious cases even puncture the stomach lining, ouch! Needles aside tree shoppers are also being urged to avoid using fertiliser to keep it alive as the fumes can be dangerous to animals.

Poinsettia

The vibrant poinsettia flowers are everywhere at Christmas but despite being found in abundance at your local supermarket and garden centre they have a reputation for being hugely poisonous to both animals and humans, although it isn't as severe as it may seem.
Its vibrant leaves can leave pets with nausea and vomiting symptoms and the sap of the plant is known to cause mild skin reactions. However, experts including Clear It Waste say that is relatively safe to prop around at home, as long as you keep it away from pets and children.

If you think your pet may have ingested parts of any of these please contact your vet immediately.

The average Brit eats dairy-based butter seven times a week - and just 13% would consider reducing their intake to help the environment

A third of Brits (32 per cent) are actively trying to eat less meat to reduce their carbon footprint - but just 13 per cent

A poll of 2,000 adults found that 53 per cent consider butter a key part of their diet, with the average Brit consuming it seven times in a typical week.

Nearly three-quarters (73 per cent) of those who insist on sticking to regular, dairy-based butter, rather than a plant-based alternative, say this is simply because they prefer the taste - despite the environmental impact.

And Brits would sooner ditch meat - such as beef, pork, turkey, or lamb - as well as cut back on driving, water usage, and buy fewer clothes, before they reduce their dairy intake.

But plant-based butter alternative, Flora Plant, which commissioned the research, revealed that dairy cattle globally contribute the methane equivalent of 3.1 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year.

And as part of its Skip the Cow campaign, Flora Plant - which has 75 per cent less climate impact than dairy butter - also commissioned three life-sized cow sculptures, to raise awareness of the harmful impact of dairy.

The cow installations were made by artist Ptolemy Elrington, using recycled materials including old car parts, water fixtures, and fast fashion.

The sculptures use half a tonne of these scrapped materials, and took 240 hours to pull together.

And they have been placed in locations across London, Aberdeen, and Newcastle, as these are cities which consume the most dairy butter each week.

Perran Harvey, senior global sustainability lead for the plant-based alternative, said: ""Given our research shows 63 per cent of people believe more needs to be done to raise awareness of the impact dairy production has on the environment, we are here to show people there is a really easy way to reduce your environmental impact.

""We've got no issues with dairy cows, we love cows - but the hard truth is that industrial animal agriculture is harmful to our planet.

""Livestock farming is responsible for at least 14.5 per cent of the world's annual greenhouse gas emissions, and therefore we urgently need to reduce the overreliance on dairy in order to tackle climate change.""

It emerged from the research that, while 65 per cent are concerned about the impact of food production, just 35 per cent would actually consider giving up certain foods because of their environmental impact.

And of these, it's meat which would be quicker to go than dairy - with beef, pork, lamb, turkey, shrimps, and prawns all at risk of being ditched because of their negative impact, before a single dairy product.

When asked about what plant-based products they consume regularly, oat and almond milk are the most popular items shoppers are turning to, while 16 per cent are having dairy-free spreads every few weeks.

More than four in ten (42 per cent) are doing so because they believe it to be better for their health, and 36 per cent because of the environmental impact.

To encourage more to make the switch, 63 per cent of those polled, via OnePoll, believe more needs to be done to raise awareness about the environmental impact of dairy farming.

Zero-waste artist Ptolemy Elrington added: ""23 years ago I decided that my sculptures would be exclusively made of recycled and second-hand materials, as I wanted to use art as a vehicle to get people to consider their ethical and environmental responsibilities.

""Right now, the most pressing global issue is climate change - therefore it is all of our responsibilities to make people sit up and listen to the ways they can make a difference, by using art as well as news and action.

""I am proud to team up with Flora Plant on their purpose to create a better planet for us and the next generations to live, breathe, and prosper in.""

The herd of cow sculptures were unveiled this morning at Riverside Grass on London's Southbank, Newcastle's Northumberland Street, and Aberdeen's Hazlehead Park, where they will be on display until June 1, with additional information on how dairy butter-loving locals can reduce their dairy-based emissions.

Neil Parker moved his caravan onto a small patch of rough land in Wales that he says has been neglected for years - but his neighbouring farmer was not so happy about his presence

A man who took over a patch of abandoned land hoping to live there until he can claim it as his own has said his neighbouring farmer dumped rotting silage bales to deter him.

Neil Parker, a self-confessed ""land pirate"", moved his caravan onto a small patch of rough land that he says has been neglected for a long time, with ""no evidence of activity for decades"".

The man, in his 60s, said he has done a lot of research to identify the site on the A487 near Tremain in Ceredigion, Wales, as being available, Wales Online reports.

He added he is entitled to take Adverse Possession - a legal concept meaning that a person who does not have legal title to land and who did not buy it becomes its legal owner.

The law applies when a person possesses a piece of unused land for a long enough period to override the interests of the original owner, according to Property Investments UK.

But Mr Parker, who previously worked in health services, said the neighbouring farmer claimed he owned the land asked him to leave immediately.

The man said he asked for proof of ownership but did not receive it, so he continued living on the site for nearly a year, until the farmer took a ""more direct, heavy handed approach"" and removed Mr Parker's caravan, car and other property.

Mr Parker alleges criminal damage was caused and the farmer also blocked his access by dumping 20 bales of rotten silage in the entrance.

It took a whole week for Mr Parker to clear the bales only for the farmer to turn up and dump some more over the fence. Dyfed-Powys Police said it had received a report of theft in the Tremain area on April 6. A spokesman for the force said enquiries are ""ongoing"".

Mr Parker said it seemed ""remarkable"" that the police hadn't taken any action for what he says is ""criminal damage and aggravated trespass"".

Talking about Adverse Possession, Mr Parker explained: ""I entered the site, having done extensive research including the land registry which showed all the surrounding properties were registered as normal, but this plot, for whatever reason was not.

""Not only was there no evidence of use, but the plot contained one of the worst infestations of Japanese Knotweed I have ever seen.

""You basically have to put yourself on a piece of land and there are various criteria you have to meet according to the Land Registry.

""You have to stay on the land for 12 years before you can claim it and you have to use it, you have to secure it, you have to show that you're acting to possess it.

""The point is if you take adverse possession of a piece of land, the only person who can dislodge you is the genuine owner, somebody who has legal ownership as proved by title deeds.""

He added that he does not intend to leave unless the farmer can show proof of ownership, as he said: ""It would seem that in the absence of evidence, they seem to think that force and bullying will achieve the desired result.""

Planning laws mean he cannot stay there all the time but he is allowed to stay for 28 days in a calendar year. When he is not at the site, he has a house near the coastal town of Aberaeron.

Mr Parker has brought a mini tractor on site to try and clear the dense overgrowth and set about planting trees.

He has also used a dilapidated building to store some of his possessions so that he can ""demonstrate his usage of it"".

He accused his neighbour of ""bullying tactics"" and vowed to remain on the site, adding: ""I'm going to stay here. As far as I'm concerned this is bullying tactics.

""If the farmer had a legal claim on the land, he could easily get me off. I'm not there to cause trouble, I'm there to make a reasonable claim.""

Mr Parker said the site was last used for pigs back in the 1970s but since then it had been left neglected and abandoned.

He also claimed the farmer told him that they had never bothered to register the land because it had no value to them.

Using laboratory ferrets and mice, researchers from China and the UK found that humans could be ""vulnerable"" to infection from the H3N8 strain of bird flu at ""epidemic or pandemic proportions""

Scientists have expressed fears over the emergence of another pandemic amid the outbreak of a new strain of bird flu discovered in Chinese poultry farms.

A team of researchers from China and the UK studied a sample of H3N8, which is one of the most common strains in birds but little is known about how it is transmitted to humans. Using laboratory ferrets and mice, they found that humans could be ""vulnerable to infection at epidemic or pandemic proportions"".

Paper co-author Professor Jinhua Liu, of the China Agricultural University in Beijing, said: ""Importantly, we discovered that the virus had acquired human receptor binding preference and amino acid substitution PB2-E627K, which are necessary for airborne transmission.

""Human populations, even when vaccinated against human H3N2 virus, appear immunologically naive to emerging mammalian-adapted H3N8 avian influenza viruses and could be vulnerable to infection at epidemic or pandemic proportions. Acid resistance of influenza virus is also an important barrier for avian influenza virus to overcome to acquire the adaptability and transmissibility in new mammals of humans.

""The current novel H3N8 virus has not acquired the acid resistance yet. So, we should pay attention to the change in acid resistance of the novel H3N8 virus."" It also found that the virus could be passed between animals through respiratory droplets.

Professor Kin-Chow Chang, of the University of Nottingham, added: ""We demonstrate that an avian H3N8 virus isolated from a patient with severe pneumonia replicated effectively in human bronchial and lung epithelial cells [which line the airways and make mucus]."" The virus was ""extremely harmful in its effects in laboratory mammalian hosts and could be passed on through respiratory droplets"", added Prof Chang, who carried out the study. The findings come as a public health expert warns that preparations are needed for future pandemics.

Professor Devi Sridhar of Edinburgh University, who advised the Scottish Government during the coronavirus outbreak, said action was needed to avoid a repeat of that, describing it as a ""tragedy for lives lost but also the restrictions put in place"". More than 17,000 Scots who died had coronavirus listed on their death certificate, meaning the virus either caused their death or contributed to it.

Prof Sridhar, who has written a book called Preventable: How a Pandemic Changed the World and How to Stop the Next One, was asked about future disease outbreaks when she appeared at the Edinburgh International Book Festival. She said: ""In terms of the next one, we can't say what it is but there are signals.""

Speaking about bird flu, she said it was ""not good"" that the disease was now endemic in the wild bird population, with this resulting in flocks of birds such as chickens and turkeys ""in lockdown because we can't protect them without putting them inside"". Prof Sridhar added: ""We have enough signals to say there is a pattern emerging and that pattern isn't good in terms of the range of mutations we're seeing and it jumping into humans at some point, or other mammals that make the jump easier into humans.

""So we have to prepare - to avoid what happened, which was a tragedy for lives lost but also the restrictions put in place which harmed, as well, many people in terms of their livelihoods, mental health."" Prof Sridha explained she had written her book ""partly for closure for me of what was a very difficult couple of years for the whole world"" but also to capture the experience.

After the 1918 flu pandemic, she said that there had not been ""much written afterwards"", saying that ""people just wanted to move forward"", but she had written her book on the coronavirus outbreak because she ""thought before we move forward we need to remember and capture that"". However, she said that time has been ""wasted"" during Covid with Government leaders and health experts debating if action was necessary.

Prof Sridhar explained this was because coronavirus ""hit that sweet spot"" between being ""innocuous enough to live with"", with some people infected not having any symptoms, while also being ""dangerous enough to kill millions of people and hospitalise tens of millions"" across the globe. ""It had those characteristics of being asymptomatic in some people, and then killing others in their 20s, 30s,"" Prof Sridhar said.

""It was a very tricky one. I felt we wasted so much time in circles debating, 'is the fatality rate 1% or 3% or 0.1%', instead of actually working together and saying, 'how do we contain this until we have vaccines, antivirals (and) doctors understand more about this disease'. That, for me, should have been the focus.""

She continued: ""We spent a lot of debating is Covid worse than the restrictions - they're both bad. The question is how the next time do we reduce the lives lost and the impositions put on people's lives, and the cost to the economy and mental health, that should be where we're at.""

The abandoned Victorian mansion, known as Redlands, last occupied in the 1950s fell into disrepair following a series of devastating fires. It is due to be auctioned later this month

An abandoned Victorian mansion with a rich and intriguing history is set to be auctioned off later this month with bids starting as low as £100,000.

During its glory days, the 16-room mansion boasted grand features such as a large entrance with stone steps, spacious reception areas, intricate mosaic flooring, enormous fireplaces, an expansive cellar, eight bedrooms, and servant's quarters. The exterior was equally impressive, featuring a balcony running the length of the first floor, a full-size tennis lawn, an orchard, gardens, and farmland.

Last occupied in the 1950s, the mansion known as Redlands was subsequently used for agricultural storage before falling into disrepair following several devastating fires. The house, near Cambridge, was originally built for Mr E. Sidney Thoday, a seed merchant, who sold it in 1910 to stockbroker William Stanley Spark.

After various changes of owners, after World War Two it was purchased by banker Mr F. L. Dawson but tragically, in 1956, a massive fire believed to have been started by an electric heater ravaged the home, destroying the interior and most of the roof. Today, the once-grand property stands largely dilapidated, awaiting new owners who are ready to undertake the monumental task of clearing and renovating this piece of history.

The home sits on a whopping 1.12 acres of overgrown gardens and there are a number of outbuildings on the property. Some of the original details that have survived include the building's red brick outer walls, stone flashings, a number of large chimneys and the vast reception room spaces.

The property is now owned by Mr Keith Tyler, who inherited the property from his father who bought it in 1959 for £900. Mr Tyler said his father bought the house to restore and renovate, however, he never got to fulfil his dream. He said: ""My father was a carpenter and joiner by trade with a sideline of rush cutting, and he bought Redlands originally to store boats and to have an area for drying the rushes.

""His dream was to renovate the property and to this end he accumulated a huge amount of building materials, and being an inveterate collector throughout his life, also acquired everything including cars, boats and agricultural machinery, much of which remains at Redlands. Unfortunately, age overtook his ability to complete a renovation of the property, and he died in 2007 aged 100 years, leaving his dream unfulfilled.

""Throughout the years my family maintained the grounds and harvested the fruit from the orchard which was stored in the cellar. I have many fond memories of spending the weekends here as a child, playing in the gardens and throughout the enormous house.""

Unfortunately, the home's bad luck continued with two more fires, the worst of which was in 1996. Mr Tyler, seemingly nostalgic, expressed his hopes for the future of the property: ""I really hope that someone falls in love with the romance of Redlands. It really is time for someone to take it on and bring it back to its former glory.""

Access to the property is granted via a private bridge over a dyke, as the main access has been temporarily blocked due to safety concerns. The sale of the property includes an additional two acres of land adjacent to Redlands, which are also being offered at the same auction with a pre-sale estimate of £50,000 - £60,000.

Ian Kitson, the director of Cheffins who is handling the sale, sees potential in the ruins: ""This is an amazing opportunity for someone to either recreate the stunning property which once stood on the site or alternatively to create something new in a much sought-after location.Despite the site needing some significant clearing, Redlands is a magical property in a fairytale setting, and for the right buyer this will be a truly unique prospect.""

""We are expecting significant interest from both developers and private buyers and are delighted to have the opportunity to offer this incredible property to the market.""

The home is completely private and invisible from the road. It's located just outside of Longstanton, six miles northwest of Cambridge. The village has a number of services including a supermarket, post office, a doctors and dentists surgeries, a recreation ground and a number of pubs.

With September nearly at the halfway point, Brits could be forgiven for thinking that they've seen the back of the sun for one year, but an Indian Summer could be on the way to tear up the script

In the UK, it's fair to say we're not exactly spoiled for sun; with autumn about to hit, millions are resigning themselves to the fact that the colder days and longer nights are here to take over, but an Indian Summer could be on the way to save us all.

That's right, while festival season is done and dusted, we could have one last run of sun before we all get in the Christmas spirit.

The term refers to 'A period of unseasonably warm, dry weather that sometimes occurs in autumn in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere'. It often doesn't even occur until after the 'first frost', or more precisely 'The first 'killing"" frost'.

After extensive research, 19th-century lexicographer Albert Matthews, managed to track the term back as far as an essay scribed in the United States circa 1778 by J. Hector St. John de Crevecoeur. Alas, he couldn't trace it to its original source.

But while its exact origins are uncertain, some theorised it was used in regions inhabited by Native Americans, who may have described it to Europeans. Some speculate that it had been based on the warm and hazy conditions in autumn when Native Americans hunted to survive.

As we all know, the warm weather isn't a permanent gift, thus reaffirming the religious beliefs of the Native Americans, who would view it as a gift from God, allowing them to survive after the loss of their crops.

But irrespective of exactly where the term comes from, in the way we understand it today, most of us are hoping it rolls in to save us from the cold.

At the start of September, we were hit with an almighty heat wave, prompting Brits to head out into the garden to sunbathe and chuck a couple of steaks on the BBQ.

Sadly, the 32-degree temperature on Saturday, which officially stormed in as the hottest day of the year, is a thing of the past for the rest of the month.

But fear not, as experts have predicted our Indian Summer is expected to arrive on October 2 - October 10, giving us eight days of glorious sunshine.

A forecaster for independent team Netweather, Ian Simpson, wrote on its blog: ""It looks probable that we will see one or two relatively settled interludes early on in the period with ridges of high pressure moving in, most likely from the south.

""Temperatures are likely to be above normal early in the period, but trending average to fairly cool late in the period. It will probably be drier than average for most, particularly in the west and north-west.""

To the delight of the public, he confirmed it would be ""sunnier than average"", with Wales, the West, and Southwest of England getting to enjoy the spoils first. Then the weather will move to the North, allowing everybody to enjoy the fun.

However, before we get there, we'll have to endure some pretty brutal conditions.

Speaking in the weekly weather watch Deep Dive on YouTube, Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said: ""That's likely to lead to some intensity, some reactivation, some heavier, more persistent rain for time as we go into Thursday as well.

""On Thursday and Friday, you can even get something (wind speeds) a little bit stronger in some places... Maybe around 60 to 75 miles per hour winds are possible; gusts are possible as we go through the early hours and into Thursday morning, so a really windy spell. It is going to be a windy picture across the UK.""

But once we've made our way through the chill, we'll have our reward, in the form of nine days of beautiful sun.

Republican Senator Rick Scott is calling for an investigation into Chinese garlic imports, alleging they grow the cooking essential with sewage fertiliser and that an 'existential emergency' is brewing

A United States senator has warned Chinese garlic is a national security risk to Americans and called for an investigation into the food item.

Republican Senator Rick Scott has urged members of congress to act against the unsafe Chinese garlic, which he believes the country is ""dumping"" onto Americans. He said garlic products were flagged as in a state of unsanitary conditions.

China has been the biggest exporter of garlic to the US for a number of years in a controversial and ongoing trade deal. But Senator Scott believes it is all part of a heavy tariffs plan from China to freeze the garlic market in the US, with increased tariffs seen under the Trump Administration.

A letter written by the Senator showed his concerns, referring to ""well documented"" practices China allegedly deploys to get their mass garlic trade into the US. He has also called for the Department of Commerce to take action under a specific law which allows the investigation into imports relating to the security of the US, the BBC reported. He wrote: ""All grades of garlic, whole or separated into cloves, whether or not peeled, chilled, fresh, frozen, provisionally preserved or packed in water or other neutral substance.""

Senator Scott argues all types of garlic should be looked into and that there is an ""existential emergency"" brewing in the garlic trade between the US and China. He added: ""Food safety and security is an existential emergency that poses grave threats to our national security, public health, and economic prosperity."" But previous research into the garlic trade found ""No evidence"" of sewage fertilisation being used by Chinese garlic farmers. A scientist has since suggested sewage fertilizer could even be ""safer"" than first thought.

The Office for Science and Society at McGill University explained the use of the sewage fertiliser in a report drafted back in 2017. It read: ""In any case, there is no problem with this. Human waste is as effective a fertilizer as is animal waste. Spreading human sewage on fields that grow crops doesn't sound appealing, but it is safer than you might think.""

Five years ago, a Consumer Reports study revealed the presence of toxic metals in several baby food products. Many of those foods still contain hazardous contaminants, a new study found

The Food and Drug Administration has cracked down on baby food companies for years.

Several studies from 2018 showed that many of their products contained toxic heavy metals like arsenic, lead and cadmium.

The government organisation has been pressuring them to remove the contaminants ""” but a recent Consumer Reports study indicates that their efforts might not have been very successful.

The overall risk of ingestion remains at similar levels compared to five years ago. And the levels of toxic metals in some products actually increased.

Consumer Reports retested 14 of the highest-risk foods from the 2018 study and found that three had decreased levels of harmful contaminants while the levels in the other 11 remained relatively similar or increased.

Gerber's Chicken Rice Dinner and Turkey Rice Dinner flavors and Hot Kid Baby Mum-Mum Teething Wafers had the most notable increases, while Earth's Best Organic Sunny Days Snack Bars strawberry flavour had the most significant decrease.

The products with the highest risk levels were:

For each of those products, Consumer Reports' experts recommend feeding babies less than a half a serving per day to minimise the danger of ingestion.

Collectively, the 14 tested products spanned an array of food types and ingredients, from fruits and vegetables to meals and entrees and snacks like bars, puffs and teething wafers.

Sweet potatoes and rice were common ingredients in most of the highest-risk products, much like the 2018 study found. Carrots were also a high-risk ingredient.

Many of those ingredients absorb the harmful metals from the soil in which they're grown.

Gerber told Consumer Reports that its working with farmers to ""prioritise growing locations for optimal climate and soil conditions"" and to ""approve fields before crops are planted based on soil testing.""

Its also ensuring that crops are rotated and continuing to research soil and varietal variables ""that may reduce uptake of heavy metals from the soil by carrots and sweet potatoes.""

Growing fields can be contaminated near airports and highways where gasoline can seep into the soil. Areas where arsenic pesticides have been used may also be at risk.

In January, the FDA released a set of guidelines designed to lower the allowable levels of heavy metals in baby foods.

It sets action levels of 10 parts per billion for lead in fruits, most vegetables, mixed meals like grain and meat-based mixtures, yogurts, custards and puddings and meat. Dry cereals, ingredient root vegetables like carrots, sweet potatoes and beats have an action level of 20 ppb.

If companies exceed those limits, various enforcement actions can be taken, Consumer Reports stated.

""The FDA estimates that these action levels could result in as much as a 24 to 27 percent reduction in exposure to lead from these foods,"" FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf said in a statement.

Babies and young children who eat large amounts of heavy metals are at a higher risk for behaviour problems, a lowered IQ and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

""Because heavy metals are so pervasive in foods ""” and because they tend to accumulate in the body ""” small exposures from multiple foods can add up,"" said Dr. Eric Boring, a CR chemist who oversaw Consumer Reports' testing.

But he said it's not the end of the world if parents feed their children a serving or two of the highest-risk foods.

""An occasional serving of even one of the foods with the highest levels is generally OK,"" he said. ""Just remember to mix up what your kids eat.""

And parents don't have to necessarily prevent their children from eating sweet potatoes or rice, either, said Consumer Reports Nutritionist Amy Keating.

""These are nutritious foods, so you don't have to eliminate them from your child's diet,"" Keating said. ""Instead, serve them in rotation with many different vegetables and whole grains.""

Locations used in the Harry Potter, Star Wars and Lord of the Rings franchises are all open for visitors, as are the real world sets employed by the likes of The Shining and The Kings Speech

Some of the most iconic film locations in the world aren't actually CGI or sets built for purpose - they're very much real places you can visit.

In the magical world of modern movie making, the trickery of computer designers and set designers allows a simple green screen or warehouse to be turned into a faraway world.

While there are films which existed only in this pretend world of CGI and model making, others use real world backdrops for scenes which have since become iconic.

According to a study of web searches and social media tags conducted by PACasino, the most popular film location in the world is Hobbiton in New Zealand, which was used throughout the Lord of The Rings film trilogy.

Director and Lord of the Rings mega-fan Peter Jackson went to enormous lengths to create as much of Middle Earth as possible in our world, and so went about building the idyllic home of the halflings.

Today Hobbiton is open for tours and is situated on the north island on the farm of the Alexander family.

They moved onto the 500 acre plot in the 70s and turned it into a livestock ranch with 13,000 sheep and 300 Angus beef cattle, before Jackson came along and moulded its grassy hills into the iconic Hobbit holes.

Another very popular film location is Glenfinnan Viaduct in the Scottish Highlands.

Fans of the franchise will recognise the lengthy rail bridge from the Chamber of Secrets Harry Potter film, when Harry and Ron chase after the Hogwarts Express in Mr Weasley's flying Ford Anglia.

Visitors to the real world bridge can witness the impressively curved construction before stopping off for some afternoon tea in the visitor centre and listening to some doleful bagpipe music in the usually drizzle covered car park.

Just a few hour car drive to the south of the viaduct will get you to Alnwick Castle in Northumberland, which was used as a location in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.

The 11th century building starred as the magical Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during the 2001 film, and is open four tourists today.

As is the infamous Timberline Lodge, which is best known for featuring in classic horror The Shining and providing the eerie backdrop for Jack Nicholson's descent into madness.

The Oregon lodge is still a functioning hotel and is a popular tourist attraction that draws two million visitors annually.

On the more glamorous end of the spectrum is Skopelos, the Greek island which was used as the location of the Abba inspired Mamma Mia!

Fans of the Swedish mega-group and of Pierce Brosnan can sign themselves up for a tour of the beautiful island and some of the particularly scenic spots that appear in the film.

Back in the UK, Ely Cathedral is not only a magnificent building in its own right, but the location of one of the most significant scenes in the Colin Firth film The King's Speech.

It was was transformed into the interior of Westminster Abbey for the film which won five gongs at the British Independent Film Awards.

A slightly less obvious location choice is an Irish island that was used as a backdrop in Star Wars.

Skellig Michael is a crag off the south west tip of the island which provided one of the major movie sets used in A Force Awakens.

The rocky formation is a fair way from the mainland but can be reached via boat on a specialist tour.

One filming destination with a slightly more central location is Pike Place in Seattle.

The city centre market has been used in a number of different films, not least the 1993 Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan classic Sleepless in Seattle.

Another one for rom-com fans - albeit of a later generation - is Silver Falls State Park in Oregon.

The forested park is used extensively in the Twilight franchise, although the main actors were represented by body doubles during the four scenes shot here.

Whether Team Edward or Jacob, fans of the film won't be disappointed when making a pilgrimage here, as it has some stunning waterfalls, eight miles of walking trails and a black bear population.

A more recent destination for film fans is Joker Stairs in New York.

Since the Batman spin-off hit screens four years ago, many have flocked to the Bronx stairway to imitate Joaquin Phoenix' iconic and creepy dance.

The New Forest and Lake District are the best national parks in Europe for hiking trails, according to an analysis of the areas by outdoor specialists Cotswolds

Two of the UK's cherished national parks have been judged to be the best in Europe.

The New Forest and Lake District came first and second respectively in an analysis of the best spots to hike across the Continent, carried out by outdoor specialists Cotswold Outdoor.

Securing top spot, the New Forest boasts the best choice of amenities and activities, housing six campsites, 25 viewpoints/historical landmarks and a great choice of hiking trails (216).

The Hampshire-based Park doesn't fall short in the popularity category either, ranking as Europe's sixth most popular, boasting 973,022 hashtags on Instagram, 22,200 average global searches and a 4.8 rating.

Claiming second, the Lake District has the most hiking trails of all European national parks, offering visitors a whopping 1,273 routes for walkers to explore.

It is also something of a social media icon, being beaten by just Teide in Spain for the title of ""Europe's Most Popular"", raking in 74,000 global searches on average and over 438,000 hashtags.

Hiking has become increasingly popular over the last couple of years, possibly fuelled by lockdown which led many people to outdoor activities for the first time.

A 2023 travel study of 24,000 holidaymakers found that 58% of British travellers are increasingly seeking trips that push them to the limits and out of their comfort zone.

The Lake District may be the perfect place to do just that, due to the grandeur and ruggedness of its mountain landscapes.

Routes are more likely to be easy going in the New Forest, where heathland, forest trails and native ponies abound.

The best hiking national parks in Europe

UK law has enshrined certain beautiful parts of the country as national parks since the early 1950s.

Unlike the many areas overseas covered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's definition, UK national parks are generally not made up of publicly owned land, meaning large parts of them are ruled out of bounds by private land owners.

Research by the Campaign for National Parks shows that just 10% of the Pembrokeshire coast land is open to the public, while just over a third of the Peak District is accessible.

Only half of Dartmoor, the New Forest and the Lake District are open to the public.

So if you are planning a trip to one of the UK's 14 National Parks, make sure you plan your route out before hand as you aren't legally allowed to roam freely.

Those who like to hike and make the most of Britain's beautiful landscape were dealt a blow on Friday, when a High Court judged ruled that people do not have a right to wild camp in Dartmoor National Park without landowners' permission.

The decision was called a ""huge step backward"", as disappointed campaigners vowed to ""go to war"" and challenge the decision.

Farmers Alexander and Diana Darwall brought a successful legal challenge over wild camping, claiming some campers cause problems to livestock and the environment.

Mr and Mrs Darwall, who keep cattle on Stall Moor, which forms part of their more-than 3,450-acre estate in the southern part of Dartmoor, secured a finding from a judge that a 1985 law that regulates access to moorland does not provide a right to wild camp.

The Dartmoor National Park Authority (DNPA), which defended the High Court claim, said it was ""really disappointed"" by Sir Julian Flaux's ruling and would be considering whether to appeal.

The Ramblers Association, a walking charity now known as the Ramblers, tweeted: ""This decision is a huge step backward for the right of everyone to access nature.""

It said it supported the ""long-established precedent"" of wild camping on Dartmoor and said it would fight to ""defend our rights of access & overturn this result"".

The charity later said it was concerned the legal case ""could be the thin end of the wedge for people's rights to explore nature"".

""Access to nature helps everyone stay connected to the environment and passionate about protecting it for future generations,"" it added.","https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article28972843.ece/ALTERNATES/n615/0_New-Forest-Ponies-roaming-wild.jpg","Visitors to the New Forest can meet ponies which roam freely there (Image: Getty Images)",5,TRUE,TRUE

The tourist hotspot, Chang Mai, in Thailand, is popular among many travellers around the world, but it is now competing against other cities in having the world's worst air quality

A city has been named the worst polluted in the world as its government remains under pressure to declare it a ""disaster zone"".

Chang Mai, in Thailand, has been ranked the worst for air pollution in over 100 cities by the Swiss air quality company, IQAir.

Pollution levels in Thailand are said to be some of the worst as many people are reported falling ill due to the increasing levels.

Much of the pollution has been caused by a dangerous mix of industrial emissions, agricultural burning, and vehicle fumes.

Calls have now been made by campaigners to create stricter legislation to bring the severity of the pollution down.

Weenarin Lulitanonda, the co-founder of the Thailand Clean Air Network, said she believes the new legislation will help immensely.

""This has to be in place to have any chance of fixing a solution"", she said.

Weenarin and others had drafted the citizen-led bill, the 'Thai Clean Air Act', which was submitted to Parliament over a year ago but has not progressed since.

Earlier this week (Tuesday, March 28), many areas of northern Thailand witnessed apocalyptic scenes as a blanket of a thick fog choked many parts - causing nearly 200,000 hospitalisations.

According to IQAir, the thick haze was over 76.3 times over the World Health Organization's annual air quality guideline value.

Many citizens looked for answers, as some hung signs that read ""Save Mae Sai"" around the country.

Weenarin said some people resorted to purchasing face masks, air purifiers and air control monitors but they are not always affordable to everyone.

She added: ""There's huge inequality""

Wiruch Tanchanapradit, the director of the air quality and noise management division at the Bangkok metropolitan assured citizens that there will be regular patrols to provide those with safety equipment.

He said: ""If the dust level reaches level 3 [Bangkok health staff] will start to patrol, going out to provide masks and check on vulnerable groups.""

According to governmental figures, more than 1.32 million people fell ill because of diseases related to air pollution during the first nine weeks of 2023.

In Bangkok, the Capital of Thailand, pollution watch rooms had been set up to show weather patterns and pollution levels.

On severely bad days in the Capital, warning messages are sent through text messages and on social media warning people to not leave their homes and work from home.

Schools controlled by Bangkok authorities use coloured flags to remind children whether it is safer to be outside again.

But campaigners say the mini solutions have not solved a huge bulk of the overall problem.

Many huge companies continue to add to the severe pollution without facing any consequences.

The country is a major producer of sugar cane and rice and sees many farmers every season burn fields to clear land.

Saroj Dokmaisrichan, a sugarcane farmer in Suphan Buri province says he has no other choice.

""If you burn [sugarcane] you don't have the leaves any more. It's easier for the farmer to cut"", he said.

A machine is available to avoid resorting to burning, But Saroj says it's not only slower but expensive for most farmers.

He added: ""It's impossible for them to even buy a secondhand machine.""

Dr Danny Marks, an assistant professor of environmental politics and policy at Dublin City university, said farmers unfairly faced the brunt of the blame for air pollution in Thailand.

Many are trying hard to meet strict deadlines as they are in contracts with major Thai agribusinesses.

More shockingly, smaller factories are not required to report any of the pollutions they produce.

The emissions database documenting the emission profiles of Thailand's 140,000 factories was scrapped after new laws made it not a requirement to reveal data.

Danny said: ""These factory owners, automobile companies, agribusiness owners are basically perpetuating slow violence, particularly on the poorest segments of society.""

Elon Musk has helped launch a new secretive space craft for the US military. But very few details are available about what the confidential mission actually aims to do

Elon Musk's SpaceX has launched a mystery new space plane for the US military - shrouded in secrecy.

SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket launched into the skies on Thursday night from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The rocket is carrying the X-37B space plane belonging to the military - who aren't confirming where it is going or what it is doing as it blasted off on a secretive mission expected to last several years.

The unmanned space plane is on its seventh mission and this time will be taken into higher orbit than ever before thanks to the capabilities of Falcon Heavy. But lift-off happened two weeks late, with three earlier scheduled countdowns abandoned as a result of unspecified technical issues and poor weather. The reusable plane resembling a mini space shuttle carries highly classified experiments. There's no one on board and it is not clear exactly where the space plane is going.

The X-37B resembles the space shuttles formerly retired by NASA, but they are far smaller at just 29 feet long and do not require an astronaut to man it, due to its autonomous landing system according to ABC7. The spacecraft lands horizontally like planes and can orbit between 150 miles to 500 miles high. The Falcon Heavy which transported the spacecraft is made up of three rocket cores all strapped together.

It has been 13 years since the X-37B was debuted in 2010, with the latest flight lasting a long two and a half years before the spacecraft landed on a Kennedy runway one year ago. The current X-37B mission is being conducted by the US Space Force under the national security space launch programme set out by the military. It is expected the X-37B mission will last until around June 2026 if not longer, if following the pattern of longer flights each time.

It took off aboard SpaceX's hulking Falcon Heavy rocket from NASA's Kennedy Space Centre under the cover of night on Thursday more than two weeks late because of technical issues. It marked the seventh flight of an X-37B, which has logged more than 10 years in orbit since its debut in 2010. The last flight, the longest one yet, lasted two and a half years before ending on a runway at Kennedy a year ago.

But details are scarce on the mission, with the Pentagon not even revealing how high the space plane will be flying. It revealed that there will be tests of ""new orbital regimes, experimenting with future space domain awareness technologies"" - which they revealed in a statement last month.

The space plane is reportedly also carrying an experiment to look at how plant seeds are affected by exposure to radiation in space in order to learn more about cultivating crops in space. This NASA research is vital for future long-term missions to the moon and even Mars.

China recently launched a similarly secretive space mission, sending their own robot space plane known as Shenlong (or ""˜Divine Dragon'). Shenlong is on its third mission since 2020 after being carried into space on December 14 by the Long March 2F rocket, which isn't as powerful as the Falcon Heavy.

Space Force General B Chance Saltzman said it was a competitive move claiming its ""no surprise"" that the Chinese are ""extremely interested in our space plane"", adding that the US is ""extremely interested in theirs"". In quotes given to US aerospace journal Air & Space Forces Magazine, he added: ""These are two of the most watched objects on orbit while they're on orbit. It's probably no coincidence that they're trying to match us in timing and sequence of this.""

Space Force officials would not say how long this orbital test vehicle would remain aloft or what's on board other than a NASA experiment to gauge the effects of radiation on materials.

Built by Boeing, the X-37B resembles NASA's retired space shuttles. But they're just one-fourth the size at 29 feet (9 meters) long. No astronauts are needed; the X-37B has an autonomous landing system. They take off vertically like rockets but land horizontally like planes and are designed to orbit between 150 miles and 500 miles high.

There are two X-37Bs based in a former shuttle hangar at Kennedy.

Kim Ju-ae, believed to be around 10 years old, was photographed with her father Kim Jong-un at Pyongyang International Airport in North Korea in a four-digit priced hoodie

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's daughter wore a velvet hoodie by Christian Dior worth nearly over £1k when she witnessed a missile launch with her dictator dad.

Kim Ju-ae, believed to be around 10 years old, was photographed with her father at the site on March 16, according to footage released by North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency.

Beady-eyed followers noticed her plush patterned hoodie as she watched the launch of the Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile at Pyongyang International Airport.

The South Korean news outlet The Choson Ilbo reported that Ju-ae appeared to be wearing the four-digit priced hoodie but it's unclear whether or not it's a fake.

If it's real Dior, though, Ju-ae would be wearing a jacket that costs over the per capita income in North Korea as it stands at £1,300 on the door UK website.

""The hooded down jacket honours House heritage with the iconic Cannage motif,"" Dior says on the jacket's product page.

Kim Ju-ae's mother, Ri Sol Ju, is known for her taste in luxury and she has been photographed before carrying purses which look like designer brands such as Dior and Chanel.

Consumption by the ruling family is at odds with North Korea's socialist ideology and is officially banned under United Nations sanctions, but members of North Korea's elite continue to defy the sanctions.

""Outsiders tend to think fashion in North Korea is frumpy and outdated, but North Korea's elite are up to date with new style trends,"" Joung Eun-lee, a researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul told the Washington Post.

Since November, Ju-ae has made seven public appearances and North Korea also issued stamps depicting her and her father at the test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile.

Many think this is the leader preparing her to succeed him as head of the world's only hereditary communist dictatorship.

The high price tag of her clothes is a stark contrast to the conditions in which North Koreans are currently living as they face a famine.

Satellite imagery from South Korean authorities shows that the North produced 180,000 tonnes less food in 2022 than in 2021.

In June, the World Food Programme raised concerns that extreme weather conditions like drought and flooding could reduce the production of both winter and spring crops.

The price of corn has risen 20% at the start of 2023 and the country is ranked one of the poorest countries in the world.

Some experts say the country has hit its worst point since a 1990s famine known as the ""Arduous March"" which caused mass starvation and killed hundreds of thousands of people.

The Cordyceps brain infection, which turns humans into mushroom-headed zombies in HBO's The Last of Us, is based on a real-life fungus that takes over its victims' minds

The Last of Us' has been terrifying viewers - but the truly horrifying reality is that the show's deadly zombie fungi does actually exist.

Based on the much-loved video game of the same name, the HBO series transports us to a world where a parasitic fungi has turned most of the world's population into mushroom-headed zombies.

Game of Thrones stars Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey play Joel and Ellie, who are trying to avoid being infected as society collapses around them.

The popular series might be fiction, but the scary Cordyceps brain infection is very much real.

At the start of the very first episode of series 1, John Hannah's character (Dr Neuman) claims that mankind's biggest threat is from a fungal infection.

He's laughed at by the presenter and the audience, but the show then flashes forward to 2003, where a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus is spread to humans through infected crops.

The fungus grows while the human host is still alive and can be spread through biting or disgusting tendrils that emerge from the mouth.

In the video game, it's even bleaker as the infected can burst and release spores that can also get into humans, but this was cut from the TV show so the actors didn't have to wear face masks all the time.

In our real world, the same fungus does turn its victims into zombies, but thankfully it doesn't happen to humans...yet.

The Last of Us' was actually inspired by a clip from BBC's Planet Earth, in which David Attenborough explains how Cordyceps spores infiltrate the bodies and minds of ants.

The disorientated ants are driven upwards by their infected brains, then they grip hold of a steam with their mandibles before a gruesome tendril erupts from their head.

When finished growing, which can take up to three weeks, deadly spores burst out to infect any ants in the vicinity, and can wipe out whole colonies.

It's not just a killer for ants, as there are thousands of different types of Cordyceps fungi - with each specialising on just one species.

The attacks do have a positive effect on the jungle's diversity, as they stop any one group of animal gaining the upper hand.

""The more numerous a species becomes, the more likely it will be attacked by its nemesis, the Cordyceps fungus,"" says Attenborough.

It sounds like humans should be well overdue an attack, but the good news for us is that it's highly unlikely to make the leap from insects.

Dr Charissa de Bekker, a microbiologist at Utrecht University, has studied how Cordyceps creates zombified ants and doesn't think it will ever have the same impact on humans.

""Our body temperature is simply too high for most fungi to nicely settle and grow - and this is the same for this Cordyceps,"" she told the BBC.

""Their nervous system is simpler than ours, so it would definitely be easier to hijack the brain of an insect versus our brain, also their immune systems are very different from ours.

""For this fungus to be able to jump from an insect to us and cause an infection is a very big leap.""

However, it's not all good news, as the World Health Organization (WHO) issued its first list of life-threatening fungi in October last year.

Fungi kill around 1.7 million people a year, about three times as many as malaria, and the WHO has identified 19 types which they think are a significant worry.

Mucormycetes, also known as black fungus, causes the flesh-eating disease mucormycosis which can be fatal or leave humans severely disfigured.

It is rare in humans, but there was an explosion of black fungus in India during the Covid pandemic, with more than 4,000 people dying.

Candida auris is a a yeast-type fungus which has suddenly emerged and is estimated to kill half of the people who are invasively infected.

It's considered a superbug because it naturally shrugs off anti-fungal drugs and some strains are resistant to all of the medicines we have.

Fungal diseases are harder to treat than bacterial infections because they share the same basic cell structures of humans, making it difficult to find a treatment that targets the fungus and not us.

The fungal infection in The Last of Us happens because of global warming - and it is the reason why Candida auris can now be found in more than 30 countries.

""In a warming world, fungi also have to adapt to a warmer climate,"" de Bekker told CNN.

""And you can imagine then, if their optimal growth temperatures therefore become higher and closer to our body temperatures, it might be more likely that in the future, we have more fungal infections in humans than we see right now.""

A warmer future with more fungal infections would especially endanger people with weakened immune systems, Kontoyiannis added

Series showrunner, Craig Mazin, has spoken about how the fungus exists in the real world - and how he doubts it will ever have such a dramatic impact on the human races.

""It's real ""” it's real to the extent that everything he says that fungus do, they do,"" Mazin told The Hollywood Reporter.

""And they currently do it and have been doing it forever. There are some remarkable documentaries that you can watch that are quite terrifying.

""Now his warning ""” what if they evolve and get into us? ""” from a purely scientific point of view, would they do exactly to us what they do to ants? I don't think so. I doubt it.

""On the other hand, he's right ""” LSD and psilocybin do come from fungus. What I told John [Hannah] was, 'What we're doing in this scene is telling people this has always been here.'""

Thankfully, we don't have to worry about mushroom-headed zombies just yet - and fans of the new series will be excited to know it's already been renewed for a second season.

Hollywood has struggled to take games from our consoles and turn them into movies and TV shows, but The Last of Us has managed to buck the trend.

The Last of Us was watched by 4.7 million viewers on TV and HBO Max streaming on the night it premiered, with that number going up to 5.7 million for episode 2.

That 22 percent increase was the largest second-week growth in HBO's history, so it wasn't a tough decision for the network.

Another thing we don't need to be concerned about is the Game of Thrones-esque issues with ending the story.

Executive producer Neil Druckman explained that they already have the full storyline in place thanks to the games - and don't plan to deviate from the plot.

""We have no plans to tell any stories beyond adapting the games,"" Druckmann previously told The Hollywood Reporter.

""We won't run into the same issue as Game of Thrones since Part II doesn't end on a cliffhanger.""

Little Nasro, two, is so dehydrated she cannot produce tears. For seven long days her devoted mother Samiro has kept a bedside vigil at a hospital in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital

Hungry and helpless ...this is Nasro, the baby who is unable to cry.

The two-year-old is so dehydrated she cannot produce tears. Nasro is among four million facing crisis levels of hunger in wartorn Somalia. Her mum Samiro tells us: ""She hasn't smiled in months.""

Helpless Nasro lays a hand across her head and lets out a plaintive cry... yet she physically can't shed a tear. The malnourished toddler is too gripped by dehydration. She hasn't smiled in months. Her gaunt frame tips the scales at barely more than a stone - just twice the weight of an average newborn.

For seven long days her devoted mother Samiro has kept a bedside vigil at the intensive care unit in Banadir Hospital's stabilisation centre in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital. Nasro is fed via a nasal tube. Samiro, 25, tells us: ""Every time when I was with my daughter day and night I was praying for her to recover""¦ I don't sleep. The last time I saw her smiling was June. Since then she was feeling dizzy, sick.""

Nasro's plight encapsulates the pain of an entire nation. The impoverished country in East Africa has been ravaged by decades of war and the Islamist terror group Al-Shabaab controls vast swathes of territory. But an old and equally deadly threat has returned: Drought... leading to crippling hunger.

A catastrophe is unfolding before the world's eyes. Crops have failed, livestock has perished. As countries around the globe grapple with the impact of the climate crisis, Somalia has endured its worst drought on record.

Research has found climate change has increased the severity of drought in the Horn of Africa. It is estimated such droughts have become 100 times more likely. After a summer of wildfires across Europe, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has controversially watered down key UK climate policies.

But wartorn Somalia - responsible for a tiny fraction of global emissions - appears to be bearing the brunt of climate change. And, as the world burns, this fragile nation's children are on the frontline. Somalia has battled three major droughts in the past 12 years. This year's wet season saw above average rain in March and April.

But it dried up in early May and it is the legacy of drought which continues to leave Somalia cruelly exposed. Some 1.5million kids under the age of five are estimated to be facing face acute malnutrition by next July - and some 330,630 could be severely malnourished.

The latest figures come from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a multi-partner initiative. And they make for grim reading. Some 4.3 million people, a fourth of the population, are expected to experience crisis levels of hunger, or worse, between now and December - up from 3.7 million in just one year.

The very worst effects of famine may have been averted but disaster, it seems, is still at Somalia's door. Perched on the hospital bed next to her daughter, mother-of-six Samiro tells how she left Buur Hakaba, in the country's southern bay region, last year. She tells us: ""One of the major reasons I fled was mainly because of lack of water and through hunger.""

Nasro previously had measles as well as acute diarrhoea and vomiting. For two days, she was unconscious. A sibling, aged three, is on another ward being treated for diarrhoea. Yards away, a mum named Yasmin, 23, cradles her critically ill daughter Filsan, aged two-and-a-half.

The poor mite softly cries as a medic checks her over. As well as severe malnutrition, she has sepsis, dehydration and gastroenteritis. Brought to the hospital days earlier, Filsan's health is improving with treatment but her situation remains desperate. Fortunately, the numbers are on her side. The hospital's stabilisation centre, which treats up to 300 kids a month, has a 95% recovery rate.

Yasmin travelled to Mogadishu from Jowhar - farming territory, north of the capital. Drought ruined their livelihood. Armed with just $12, Yasmin made the journey to the capital to seek treatment for her daughter. She has four children and left some of them behind to be cared for by her mother. And Yasmin is so grateful for the help Filsan has received.

She says: ""I feel a lot of stress, a lot of anxiety. I have that worry all the time that she's not feeling well. At the same time, I also think back [about] the children I left. When we came in here, Filsan was in an emergency situation but after a lot of support by the medical staff, she is recovering and her case is becoming now good.""

An estimated 43,000 people died in Somalia last year due to the drought. Half of them were children under the age of five, according to an Imperial College study published in March. The fragile nation has been here before. A famine in 2011 killed more than a quarter of a million people.

Mogadishu has more than 2,000 camps which are home to more than a million internally displaced people. At one camp we met Mulki, a 20-year-old who has endured enough sorrow for a lifetime. Holding her nine-month old close while her three-year-girl stands dutifully by her side, Mulki tells how she has lost two children. A daughter, aged two, had heart issues and died four months ago.

Too poor to afford a burial, the family relied on the generosity of others. Another child died shortly after being born. The family has been at the ramshackle camp for five months. Mulki's husband is with her and home is a dusty clearing with tents - one where they sleep and another with cooking equipment. The family fled from Balcad, north-east of the capital, seeking sanctuary from conflict - a familiar tale. Mulki says: ""[There were] serious conflict issues and also we lost animals because of the droughts.

""We had farms to cultivate... [but they] dried... we could not survive. We used to rent farms. But due to having no money to rent those farms we could not afford to survive and get food. As well, because of too much conflict going on and having nowhere to get food from, we had a lot of hunger.""

Save the Children is channelling funds to stricken countries via its Global Hunger Crisis campaign (inset, above). Mohamud Mohammed Hussain, the charity's Country Director for Somalia, said: ""Yes, rains brought some relief this year and because of sustained humanitarian assistance, the famine was averted last year. But failure of the rains in successive seasons, plus the ongoing conflict in Somalia, plus other things like conflict in Ukraine, this has really slowed down the community recovery.

""Usually when there is a severe drought, it takes not less than two years for the community to even partially recover."" Francesca Sangiori, Humanitarian Director at Save the Children Somalia, added: ""Although we have seen recent rain in Somalia, the crisis is far from over. In fact, the rains led to flooding earlier this year.

""People were killed, hundreds of thousands were made homeless and many more children were left vulnerable to malnutrition and disease outbreaks like cholera. It will take years for families to rebuild their lives. Whether they're fighting for survival now or being forced to miss school in order to work, many children in Somalia are suffering at pivotal moments in their lives.

""Our teams can only be there at those moments if humanitarian funding is sustained. And it's vital the international community, including the UK, work together to tackle the root causes of the climate crisis and child hunger and malnutrition."" Back at Banadir Hospital, Samiro continues to pray for her daughter Nasro's recovery. And soon, God willing, she may see her child smile once more.

Family names have been changed.

395,"Killer virus sweeping through Europe includes spotty rash symptoms in three key areas","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/killer-virus-sweeping-through-europe-30462930","Killer virus sweeping through Europe includes spotty rash symptoms in three key areas

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has been described as the current biggest threat to public health and has already killed people in Iraq, Pakistan and Namibia

An unpleasant rash - which can affect three different parts of the body - is a common symptom of the fatal virus Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF).

The bug is sweeping through Europe, having already killed people in Iraq, Pakistan and Namibia, and last week experts said it is ""highly likely"" there could soon be cases in the UK.

The Mirror highlighted nine symptoms on Monday, which include neck pain and stiffness, and fever. However, a painful rash is a further sign, and it can develop on skin, in the mouth, and in the throat. It is caused by bleeding in these areas, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.

WHO's website states: ""Clinical signs include tachycardia (fast heart rate), lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), and a petechial rash (a rash caused by bleeding into the skin) on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth and throat, and on the skin. The petechiae may give way to larger rashes called ecchymoses, and other haemorrhagic phenomena.""

Petechiae are red dots on the skin, caused by broken blood vessels under the skin.

Last week, James Wood, head of veterinary medicine at Cambridge University, said CCHF could find its way to the UK ""through our ticks, at some point"". Climate change is aiding the spread of the virus as creatures move to new territories, and away from the likes of Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asia.

In documented outbreaks of CCHF, fatality rates in hospitalised patients ranged from nine percent to as high as 50 percent. The long-term effects of CCHF infection have not been studied well enough in survivors to determine whether or not specific complications exist. However, recovery is slow.

Nine other symptoms of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever

Myalgia (muscle ache)

Dizziness

Neck pain and stiffness

Backache

Headache

Sore eyes

Photophobia (sensitivity to light)

Nausea

Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons.

Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites.

WHO's website adds: ""It is difficult to prevent or control CCHF infection in animals and ticks as the tick-animal-tick cycle usually goes unnoticed and the infection in domestic animals is usually not apparent.

""Furthermore, the tick vectors are numerous and widespread, so tick control with acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) is only a realistic option for well-managed livestock production facilities.""

From queues in Dover to rising food prices, Brexit has been blamed for a number of things impacting families. But it has given us Rishi Sunak's 'Brexit pub guarantee' - here we look at the good, the bad and the ugly consequences

It may be seven years since UK voters opted to leave the EU, but new consequences - with a lot more to come.

The Government is working out how to deliver its 'bonfire of EU rules' after angering Tory backbenchers with a screeching U-turn on the timescale. But changes to travel rules - which will see Brits travelling to Europe required to undergo biometric tests - are another headache on the horizon. Bosses in Dover have already warned the move could mean border checks take up to four times as long.

It's also been linked with labour shortages in some sectors, while academics have concluded that leaving the European Union led to average food bills rising by £210. But unsurprisingly this is hotly contested, and the Government has repeatedly said Britain is reaping the benefits of Brexit.

Plenty of economists have picked through the drop in trade with the EU and the impact that's had. In June The Mirror reported just one in five Leave voters thought Brexit had gone well, with two thirds saying politicians had failed to get a good deal.

Here we look at some of the good, bad and ugly impacts it's had on our day-to-day lives.

Delays at borders

One of the most obvious impacts - particularly at this time of year - can be seen at the UK's borders. Peak holiday times have seen long queues at Dover as Brits head over to mainland Europe. This week was no different, with gridlock causing misery for drivers.

The Government has maintained that a ""combination of factors"" is to blame, and said it's wrong to point the finger entirely at Brexit. But Keir Starmer hit back, saying in April it was ""obvious"" there would be problems with more border checks in place.

Meanwhile the Port of Dover's chief executive, Doug Bannister, has also admitted Brexit had led to longer processing times at the border. He told the Observer that he did expect this to improve with time, however, stating: ""People will get slicker at reading passports, get slicker at lodging paperwork and checking paperwork. But we are in a different trading regime.""

But there's another issue on the horizon, with new biometric checks expected to be brought in next year - more on that below.

Meanwhile at airports and international railway stations, British citizens can no longer use the border control lanes for EU citizens. They usually have to have their passport stamped when entering and leaving the EU.

EU biometric checks

Holidaymakers travelling through the Channel Tunnel could be forced to wait FOUR TIMES longer than they are now thanks to new EU border checks, officials warn. Next year the EU is expected to bring in its new Entry/Exit System (EES) system.

This is a requirement for all people entering the union from outside of Europe, but borders chiefs are frank about the fact they expect there to be teething problems. It's now expected to be introduced after the Olympic Games in Paris next summer.

People entering the EU will be required to have their fingerprints scanned and a photograph taken to register them on a database the first time they enter a member state. John Keefe, chief corporate and public affairs officer at Getlink, which operates the Channel Tunnel, told MPs last month: ""The time required to capture all of this data on top of the passport control at the border could add anything between a multiple of two to four times the time required to go through the border today.

""This unresolved could result in significant queues for passengers in cars in particular trying to get through the enrollment process.""

Brexit 'drove food bills up by average of £250'

As mentioned above, the impact of Brexit is the subject of intense debate. But one effect which experts believe it's had is a rise in food prices.

Earlier this year a study by the London School of Economics ruled that food bills had gone up by 6%, adding an extra £250 to household bills, researchers found. Over two years, the study concluded, UK households spent an extra £7billion which they wouldn't have done if the UK hadn't left the EU.

Researchers said that the price of food imported from the EU - including things like tomatoes and potatoes - shot up by around 6%. But on the other hand it could have given a boost to UK producers.

Since 2019 the cost of food has gone up by around 25% - but this would be 17% if post-Brexit trade restrictions weren't in place, LSE concluded. It highlighted trade barriers such as additional paperwork and increased testing on livestock.

...And incoming controls 'could make it even worse'

New post-Brexit controls set to come into effect in January could drive up food prices and the risk of disruption even further, industry chiefs warn.

New checks on food imports, which haven't been fully implemented, will see additional charges of between £20 and £43 on goods. Nichola Mallon, head of trade at Logistics UK, said this is ""very concerning"", adding: ""It is too high and, if introduced, will add to inflationary pressures and is likely to lead to market distortion in the movement of goods.""

LSE report author Nikhil Datta wrote: ""Not everything has been instituted at the border. For instance, not all veterinary checks are being carried out.

""It could be that there will be no adjustment in prices when they do take effect because businesses have already accounted for the extra costs. Or the extra barriers, when they come into effect, do increase prices and householders will face a further increase in their food costs.""

But there's always the 'Brexit pub guarantee'

Rishi Sunak was very enthusiastic this week as he outlined sweeping changes to alcohol duties. Leaving the EU has given the UK increased powers to overhaul the way alcohol is taxed, and the PM claimed his measures make it easier to protect pubs.

Under the new 'Brexit pub guarantee', the rate of duty on draught beer and cider has been reduced by 9.2% - while the standard rate on packaged beer and alcoholic drinks has gone up by 10.1%

However if he thought pub bosses would be jumping for joy, he was sadly mistaken. Firstly he was heckled by a landlord as he pulled a pint on Tuesday, and then Wetherspoons boss - and Brexit cheerleader - Tim Martin warned it would cost his business an extra £8million a year.

He told The Independent: ""The compounding factor is that pubs pay 20 per cent vat in respect of food sales, whereas supermarkets pay nothing,"" he said. Pubs also pay about 25 pence per pint in business rates, whereas supermarkets pay a fraction of this amount - perhaps two pence a pint or so. Supermarkets use this tax advantage to subsidise beer and wine prices. The combo of tax inequality and tax increases is bad news.""

Working or living abroad

As you'd expect with the end of free movement, Brits now have to secure appropriate visas in order to work, study or live in the EU. Although people can still buy homes in European countries, they cannot stay for more than 90 days of every 180 without permission.

British citizens still do not need to apply for a visa in advance of travel to the EU as a short-term visitor. The rules for short-term visits to most EU Member States are set out in the Schengen Borders Code. However their eligibility to live, work or study in an EU Member State depends on the host country's national immigration laws and visa requirements.

Labour shortages and impact of wages

There's been lots of talk about the impact of EU workers leaving the UK, and the supply of labour from Europe drying up. Transport and warehousing was heaviest hit, and in 2021 the shortage of HGV drivers became a real problem.

It did present some opportunities as well as challenges, with companies no longer as able to rely on workers from abroad, raising hopes that it could see packets rise for UK workers. This certainly seems to have happened for lorry drivers and hospitality staff. This has, however, also meant higher bills for customers.

In spite of pressure from the Tory right to bring down net migration, which was at a record high last year, Rishi Sunak was forced to add jobs to the shortage occupation list. This is a list of professions where shortages mean the need for workers is so intense that visa requirements can be relaxed. Builders and construction workers were added last month, while some occupations such as social care workers have long been in place.

Across the labour market there was a shortfall of 460,000 EU workers between January 2021 and June last year, including 103,000 in wholesale and retail, 67,000 in hospitality and food. Knock-on effects of this included businesses such as restaurants reducing their hours because they couldn't find staff.

'Bonfire' questions over workers' protections

The Government was forced into a humiliating U-turn when it announced it would no longer be striking over 4,000 EU laws by the end of the year. Under plans put forward in the Retained EU Law Bill, a 'bonfire' would have seen a massive legislation overhaul.

This might sound pretty abstract, but in order to do this ministers would have to make some serious decisions that could affect us all. As Unison pointed out, many core workplace protections - including holiday pay, maternity pay and equal pay for women and men - come from the European Union. Striking these from the statute books could have some pretty grim consequences unless similar protections were adopted in UK law.

With all these questions remaining, the Government slammed on the brakes, with Kemi Badenoch instead announcing around 600 pieces of EU law will be reviewed this year.

Roaming charges

Since the UK left the European Union, residents are no longer covered by a 2017 bloc-wide law that made roaming, text, and calls free in all Member States. Many people have been caught out by the new rules, returning from their holidays to face a huge bill.

One man recently revealed he wracked up a £200,000 bill during a four-day holiday in Turkey. Phone companies are now allowed to set their own rules, with vastly different approaches.

Cost of ordering goods and receiving gifts from the EU

Leaving the EU has had an impact on ordering goods from Europe - and as you'd expect, they can be pretty complex. Under the new rules import VAT and excise duties apply for all alcohol, tobacco and perfume products ordered from the EU.

For everything else new charges kick in if goods are worth more than £135. If this the case, customers have to pay import VAT and possibly customs duties - with costs varying according to factors including shipping costs.

Another pitfall HMRC has warned shoppers about is making sure sellers do not charge them VAT - as they could be charged twice.

There are also new costs attached to receiving gifts from the EU. If a gift is valued at over £39, the recipient must pay VAT, and if it's over £135 customs duty comes into play well. And there could be a 'handling fee' to pay as well.

For space-tight Brits, miniature breeds have been winning our hearts and they are rapidly starting to catch up on dogs'm status as 'man's best friend'

Dogs have hogged the ""man's best friend"" title for centuries, but a growing number of people now think that is just hogwash, insisting that miniature pigs make better pets. A study has found that little porkers are just as likely to shower humans with affection and - as the big bad wolf from the fairy tale knows - they are far more intelligent than dogs to boot.

One owner whose pig is definitely her best friend is Joanne Lefson, 50, who this week revealed that her sow Pigcasso is bringing home the bacon, having made £1million with her ""pork-traits"". The painting pig's clients include tennis ace Rafael Nadal, making her snout to sniff at, especially as she was rescued en route to the abattoir.

While globe-trotter Pigcasso now lives in South Africa and weighs 1,000lbs, for space-tight Brits, miniature breeds have been winning our hearts. Little piggies Smokey and Bandit live a life of luxury in Rainbow Lagdale Smith and John Beresford's Cheshire home, liking nothing better than cuddling up with them on the sofa.

John, a police officer who jokes he is a ""pig with a pig"", says: ""They have free range on the bottom floor of the house. They're in the lounge. The fires are on and the pigs will sleep in front of the fire. There are patio doors, so they'll get up or eat outdoors or use the toilet outside. Smokey's never tried to go upstairs, but Bandit enjoys going upstairs - but can't get down again.""

Rainbow and John have a pig walking licence from the Animal and Plant Health Agency, which allows them to walk them on a pre-approved route as it is still classed as transporting livestock. Rainbow says: ""We could never get Smokey into a harness. She just wasn't interested, but we're training Bandit so that we can take him on walks.""

The two pets have very different personalities. Bandit, a castrated male, is still very young compared to older female Smokey. Rainbow says: ""He's way more cuddly and soppy."" Victoria Wiseman, an actress from Colchester, Essex, has loved pigs since she was a child, and her decision to get Peanut and Noodle was five years in the making. She says: ""I did a lot of research.""

Before buying Peanut and Noodle, she built an enclosure with a water feature. She says: ""The main thing that I do with mine is teach them agility and tricks, so I've got a big course outside. They've got an agility bridge and they've got an agility seesaw. They've got jumps and hoop jumps as well.""

Victoria trains them every day if she can, for 20 minutes to half an hour. She says: ""Peanut will do almost anything when it comes to daredevil stuff. I've got crash mats next to the agility bridge. He went on it and jumped off the thing, just for fun. I knew it was for fun as he went on and did it again.""

Noodle is scared of heights, but has other talents. She says: ""He has a big amount of focus, but is calmer. I have started doing heel-to music with him like they do with dogs, so he will weave between my legs.""

David Sansom has two, 10-month-old micro pigs called Polly and Poppy. With a background in agriculture David, 63, from Ibstock, Leics, used to have a commercial pig herd, which inspired him to get his adorable pets. He says: ""I always loved having pigs. I got soft as I aged so couldn't ever send them to slaughter. That's why I got back into them with micro pigs.""

The two little porkers live in a big enclosure with David's two miniature Shetland ponies. He says: ""I've got a Labrador as well and the whole lot all get on brilliantly They all seem to respect each other."" Like his dog, David's pigs love being petted. He says: ""They are very similar in wanting attention. Of course, with a dog you should be going out and walking each day. For the lazy pet owner, a micro pig is probably ideal.""

David hangs out with his pigs as often as he can. ""I spend ages chatting with them, the locals must think I am mad. When I'm up there, sitting with the micro pigs, and just chatting, and rubbing them, it's very relaxing. It's quite therapeutic, really.""

Katie Mason fell in love with micro-pigs while working with them at a farm in Devon and it wasn't long before she had two of her own, Rupert and Penny. Rupert was once snouted, sorry, scouted, by a producer to audition on Britain's Got Talent. Katie, 41, who helped breed pigs at Pennywell Farm, Buckfastleigh, Devon, before turning to teaching, taught him the names of things using positive reinforcement, and in front of the judges Rupert played a keyboard, filed some paperwork, pulled levers, used a mobile phone, and went through tunnels.

Sadly he was given the chop before the live semi-finals. Rupert's pen pal Penny wasn't as easy to train. Katie says: ""Penny was really naughty. She opened all the cupboards, the fridge, the oven, the lot and took everything out. Rupert wouldn't do a thing wrong. He used to hate me telling Penny off, he took it personally and would go in the corner all upset.""

The pigs could go outside when they wanted, but preferred sitting on the sofa. They also got on well with Katie's Labrador and Border Collie. She says: ""They used to sleep on top of the old Lab when they were smaller. They're very intelligent, very clean, and very easy to train. You don't need to toilet train them as they are naturally toilet-trained.""

Sadly they've both gone to the big stye in the sky, but Katie would highly recommend pigs as pets. She says: ""They will probably be the most intelligent pet you could have. Studies have shown they understand consequences and they understand their own reflection, the only other animals that understand mirrors are dolphins, chimps... and humans.""

Three North Korean nationals communicated in secret to reveal the post-Covid disaster inside what has become the most secretive and closed-off state in the world

A North Korean mother and her son starved to death after she was sentenced to hard labour for violating Covid rules, a new investigation has revealed.

People in the highly controlled state have risked their lives to tell the BBC how food is now so scarce that their neighbours have starved to death.

Three North Korean nationals communicated in secret to reveal the post-Covid disaster inside what has become the most secretive and closed-off state in the world.

A construction worker, using the fake name Chan Ho, who lives near the Chinese border said food supplies were so low that five people in his village had already died from starvation.

One mother was sentenced to hard labour for violating quarantine rules, and soon after she and her son starved to death.

Another mother and child died after she had become too sick to work.

""Her children kept her alive for as long as they could by begging for food, but in the end, all three died"", the BBC wrote.

Chan Ho said he used to be afraid of dying from Covid but now he has ""begun to worry about starving to death"" instead.

Under the guise of shielding themselves from Covid, the state's decision to close borders has enabled authorities to stop importing grain from China, as well as the fertilisers and machinery needed to grow food, leading to the starvation of many.

People fear history repeating itself and unsettling memories of the devastating famine that ravaged the country in the 1990s, killing around three million, are haunting.

One woman, Ji Yeon, said she is haunted by the week she had to eat puljuk - a mash of vegetables, plants and grass, ground into a porridge-like paste.

Lucas Rengifo-Keller, a research analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CNN in March that trade data, satellite images and assessments by the United Nations and South Korean authorities all suggest the food supply has now ""dipped below the amount needed to satisfy minimum human needs.""

Even before the Covid pandemic, nearly half of the North Korean population was undernourished, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation.

Instead of spending money on bolstering the country's waning food supply, brute leader Kim Jong-Un has instead carried out a record number of missile tests.

Chan Ho said his friend's son had recently witnessed several closed-door executions. In each one, three to four people had been killed for attempting to escape the country.

He said: ""Every day it gets harder to live. One wrong move and you are facing execution.""

When the BBC put the accusations to the North Korean government, they claimed that their people's ""well-being is our foremost priority"".

They also said the information was ""not entirely factual"", claiming it had been ""derived from fabricated testimonies from anti-DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] forces.""

""The North Korean borders need to open and they need to restart trade and they need to bring these things in for agriculture to improve and they need food to feed the people.

But right now they are prioritising isolation, they are prioritising repression"", Lina Yoon, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch told CNN.

423,"Dust storms are killing hundreds of people and climate change to lead to more deadly storms","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/dust-storms-killing-hundreds-people-29956347","Dust storms are killing hundreds of people and climate change to lead to more deadly storms

Deadly gusts that lift soil and sand up in the air can lead to massive tragedies, such as the one of last week in Illinois. Dust storms were believed to be rare, but scientists say they are becoming increasingly frequent and deadly

Up to 60 vehicles, including tractors piled up on an Illinois highway last Monday due to high spring winds resulting in seven people dying and 40 more getting injured.

The deadly winds stirred up a wall of dust from nearby farm fields, causing a visibility blackout which led to several collisions on a busy stretch of Interstate 55.

The ""horrific"" scene, as described by the state's Governor, J. B. Pritzker, was a rare occurrence in the area, Illinois State Police said at the time.

But across the country, dust storms are occurring more frequently than ever and are claiming hundreds of lives - far more than is currently being reported, scientists claim.

Dust storms are a natural phenomenon that occurs when strong winds lift up dry soil and sand particles into the air, creating a dense cloud that can stretch for miles.

These storms can have a profound impact on the environment and human health, and in recent years, they have become an increasingly common occurrence in certain parts of the US.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the frequency and intensity of dust storms in the region have increased in recent years due to a combination of factors, including drought, climate change, and land-use practices.

The phenomenon can also have a significant impact on transportation and infrastructure.

When a dust storm hits, visibility can be reduced to near zero, making driving and flying extremely hazardous.

A research paper from NOAA's Air Resources Laboratory has found that dust storms are contributing to more traffic fatalities in the US than are currently recorded.

The research found that dust events caused life losses comparable to hurricanes and wildfires in some years, and greater awareness could reduce crashes and save lives.

Specifically, the report found that dust storms caused an estimated 232 deaths between 2007 and 2017, compared to the 10 officially reported.

The report also calls for more consistent reporting methods and proposes modifications to current reporting classifications to more accurately capture the impact of dust storms, which have been previously assumed to be rare and isolated to specific regions.

One of the areas most affected by dust storms is the southwestern United States, particularly the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.

In these regions, dry and arid conditions, combined with strong winds, create the perfect conditions for dust storms to form.

The impact of dust storms on the environment can also be significant, as, when soil and sand are lifted into the air, they can cause damage to crops, vegetation, and wildlife habitats.

In addition, dust particles can contribute to air pollution, leading to respiratory problems and other health issues for people and animals.

The dust particles can also damage buildings, power lines, and other structures, causing disruptions to daily life.

In recent years, there have been several high-profile dust storms in the southwestern United States that have caused significant damage and disruption.

In 2011, a massive dust storm, known as a haboob, swept across the Phoenix metropolitan area, causing power outages and grounding flights.

In 2020, a similar storm hit Lubbock, Texas, causing widespread damage and prompting local officials to declare a state of emergency.

To combat the impact of dust storms, researchers and government agencies are working on several fronts.

Some are focused on improving land-use practices, such as reducing the amount of bare soil and planting vegetation to help stabilize the soil.

Others are exploring new technologies, such as dust suppression systems that can be used to reduce the amount of dust that is lifted into the air.

Despite these efforts, the frequency and intensity of dust storms are likely to continue to increase in the coming years.

What to do during a dust storm

The National Weather Service advises motorists to exercise caution and take appropriate safety measures when driving during a dust storm.

If dense dust is observed approaching or blowing across a roadway, motorists should pull off the pavement as far as possible, stop, turn off lights, set the emergency brake, take their foot off the brake pedal to be sure the tail lights are not illuminated, and wait until visibility improves before proceeding.

If a motorist cannot pull off the roadway, they should proceed at a speed suitable for visibility, turn on lights and sound the horn occasionally, use the painted centre line to help guide them and look for a safe place to pull off the roadway.

It is also advised that motorists should never stop on the travelled portion of the roadway and should ensure that all of their lights are off when parked off the roadway to avoid collisions with other vehicles.

'I really can't handle it for some reason.'

A man has been praised for walking out on a woman mid-date because her eating habits were ""unbearable"" to watch. The 20-year-old, who struggles to put himself out there, agreed to go on a date with a woman, called Maria, from his friend's study group.

He made reservations at a ""somewhat fancy restaurant"" - and made sure he was dressed to impress, wanting to make a good first impression. While the initial hellos were a bit ""awkward"", he started to feel more comfortable in her company as time went on.

Taking to Reddit, he said: ""I got a new haircut, got some new clothes and was pretty excited. It started off awkward, then we both slowly let loose and became more comfortable. All in all, she seems like a nice girl to talk to.""

But his opinion on his date completely changed as soon as their server brought over their main course. ""Once the main course arrives, it all goes down hill,"" he added. ""I realised she chews with her mouth open. That's been my biggest pet peeve as a kid, I really can't handle it for some reason.""

For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.

He went on to explain how his dad would chew with his mouth open, causing him to flee from the dining table to escape the sight and sound of it. With her, it wasn't just chewing with her mouth open. It was also loud smacking noises, she was eating like she hadn't eaten in three weeks, was slurping her food and making aggressive 'nom nom' sounds.

""I don't have any issues with a girl chowing down her food. I acknowledge that there is some sort of weird ick if a girl eats a lot or something. That wasn't it at all. I can eat a lot in one sitting, and I'm not going to judge anyone else for doing so. But, I had a problem with her absolute lack of manners. It was brutish.

""I politely asked her to chew with her mouth closed, and that she was making a lot of noise. She looked upset, but apologised. I told her it was fine, but that it was just a pet peeve of mind and I find it hard to ignore, and apologised back.

""Not 30 seconds later, she starts doing the same thing. I looked up at her, and told her 'you're doing it again', but she got more upset this time and told me to mind my own business, and let her enjoy her food."" With that, he got up from the table, paid for his share of the meal and left the restaurant.

""The day after, the friend who set me up blew up my phone saying that I was a horrible person, and how Maria was crying all night because of me. I told her what happened, but she started yelling so I just cut the call. Maria also naturally blocked me on Instagram.

""I still stand firm with my actions though. Perhaps I did a bit much by leaving so soon, but I also expect a date to have some sort of etiquette."" Wanting to know whether he was too harsh on his date, he has taken to social media to ask users for their thoughts.

In response, one user said: ""I once went on a blind date where she chewed with her mouth open. While I didn't bolt mid-date, there was no second date."" Another user added: ""Your date was eating with less manners than barn yard livestock. I don't blame you. People are going to see/hear that and look poorly at both of you.""

A third user said: ""I broke up with an otherwise lovely guy for exactly this reason. He liked to take me out to nice restaurants, but I could never enjoy them due to his horrible table manners. He told me he'd done it since he was a kid and that his grandma used to make him eat in the other room because he could or would not learn not to do it. It was a deal-breaker.""

Brits venturing into Europe are being warned about Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) which is spread through ticks after a 27-year-old patient died from the disease

British holidaymakers venturing into Europe this month are being warned after a woman died of an eye-bleeding disease.

The patient, aged 27, contracted Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in North Macadonia, which is spread by ticks. It kills up to 40% of those infected, according to the World Health Organisation. Authorities have worked to track down 67 of the victim's contacts already, with CCHF able to pass between humans via blood or bodily fluids.

It is suspected the unnamed woman caught the infection after being bitten on July 19 while visiting Å tip in the country's eastern regions. The Institute of Public Health of the Republic of North Macedonia said she was hospitalised four days later.

She had developed flu-like symptoms which then escalated. CCHF symptoms include fever, muscle aches, dizziness, light sensitivity and sickness. This can lead to organ failure and internal bleeding. The woman died on July 27. The disease was first identified in Crimea in 1944 and is now endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and some Asia nations.

Experts believe it could be spreading outside its usual territories and getting closer to the UK as a result of climate change. Seven cases have been reported in Spain, including three deaths, since 2016.

As of May, CCFC has been identified by the WHO as one of nine ""priority diseases"" in terms of its threat to the public. Scientists at a Science, Innovation and Technology Committee meeting last month said it is ""highly likely"" it could reach Britain in the near future.

During the hearing, James Wood, head of veterinary medicine at Cambridge University, said CCHF could find its way to the UK ""through our ticks, at some point"".

Symptoms of CCHF

Among the virus' symptoms include headaches , high fever, back and joint pain, stomach ache, and vomiting. Red eyes, a flushed face, a red throat, and petechiae (red spots) on the palate are also common.

In severe cases, WHO warns, jaundice, mood swings and sensory perception are encountered. As the illness progresses, large areas of severe bruising, severe nosebleeds, and uncontrolled bleeding at injection sites can be seen, beginning on about the fourth day of illness and lasting for about two weeks.

In documented outbreaks of CCHF, fatality rates in hospitalised patients ranged from nine percent to as high as 50 percent. The long-term effects of CCHF infection have not been studied well enough in survivors to determine whether or not specific complications exist. However, recovery is slow.

How is it spread?

According to the WHO, human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from ""close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons"".

Concerningly, there is currently no vaccine available for either people or animals infected by the disease. CCHF is transmitted to people by either bites from ticks or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues immediately after slaughter.

Hosts of CCHF include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep and goats. According to the WHO, the majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians.

Reported deaths

Iraq was reportedly in a major battle with the disease last year, with 212 incidents recorded between January 1 and May 22. Of those, 169 were reported between April and May alone. Agence France-Presse added in May that almost 100 additional cases - and 13 deaths - were so far in 2023 attributed to the toll in Iraq.

A woman has won her share of a fortune after complaining she was written out of her dad's will due to 'sexism'. Julie Mate' 62' watched as her brothers in West Yorkshire made huge profits off the land their father left them

A woman has won a share of £9million fortune after her dad favoured her brothers in his will.

Farmer's daughter Julie Mate, 62, went up against brother Andrew and Robert Mate in court when the pair were given the whole of their parent's West Yorkshire dairy farm.

She has now received a £652,000 payout from her brothers' fortune after the land that was left to them went from £300,000 to £9 million.

Julie was told by Robert ""you're not coming back"" after she left the home to go to university.

Growing up, she helped to run the farm, even sacrificing her school and social life to help out. She called the the farm work as a child ""forced labour"" in a letter to her mum in 2014.

Julie was left devastated and dumbfounded"" when her dad Donald Mate died in 1992 and left his share of the farm to his wife Shirley and sons, with Shirley, now 89, later also giving her share to the boys.

She believes she and her two sisters being left out of the farm fortune - they left £12,000 each - was down to sexism where the women in the family were left ""nowt.""

In a letter to her sister Virginia, Julie complained about a ""male-dominated farming tradition.""

She wrote: ""To be extremely blunt, given the value of the farm - when dad died, but particularly now - we three have been extremely badly done to.

""You can call it the outcome of a male-dominated farming tradition, bloody mindedness, or simply male chauvinism - whatever it was, and with no disrespect to dad, it really doesn't wash nowadays.""

Donald and Shirley Mate had been partners in a milk bottling and retail business, run from Fold Farm in Netherton, near Huddersfield, the court heard.

Julie worked to get the land removed from the Green Belt so that it could be built on. This dramatically increased the value of the land but Julie did not get a major share of the rewards.

The farm was struggling at the beginning of the 2000s and Julie began to look at ways it could make money.

She said she was encouraged by her mum from 2007 and looked at the potential for the development of 40 acres of farmland.

Julie said she worked on the project between 2008 and 2015 with a planning consultant and was under the impression that, if it was profitable, she would see an equal share of the rewards.

The local council approved it for housing in 2012, and Julie called Andrew to update him.

She told him she had done the work ""on behalf of the girls,"" to which Andrew is said to have asked angrily: ""What's it got to do with you?""

""She described it as 'his typical rant,' which she understood to mean 'push off, you silly woman',"" Judge Andrew Sutcliffe KC said.

The judge added the brothers had been ""unjustly enriched"" as a result.

Julie said the brothers made it clear to her that she should not return to the business after university, even though she wanted to.

She said she has not always had the best relationship with her brothers Robert, now 65, and Andrew, 60, and recalled an incident when a 17-year-old Andrew had driven a Land Rover at her in the farmyard.

Julie also claimed Robert once put his hand around her throat and told her ""you're not coming back.""

Both brothers deny the incidents occurred.

""Although Robert and Andrew denied or did not recall these incidents, I accept that they occurred,"" said the judge in his ruling on the case.

""I also accept that from at least this time, and probably before then, the relationship between Julie and her brothers was strained, caused in part by the interest which Julie had shown in the farm and the brothers' determination that she should not be involved.""

The judge added he thought the original will gave the daughters only ""token recognition"" for their work.

""In her view, it meant the sisters were subsidising their brothers so that they could have a life on the family farm, which was something she was not given the opportunity to pursue,"" he continued.

The land Julie had worked to get valued was included in the council's Local Plan in 2015, but her mum and brothers agreed a £9million sale to developers Persimmon Homes without telling her.

In response, she executed a deed of trust, giving her son's beneficial interest in the land and then brought forward a High Court appeal in 2020.

Mum Shirley did not contest.

The judge added: ""I accept Julie's evidence that at no time did she tell either of her brothers or Shirley that she would work on this project for nothing, without expectation of any reward.""

He continued: ""Shirley, Andrew and Robert obtained the benefit of Julie's services, at Julie's expense, in circumstances where they had notice of the services, they knew that Julie expected a reward for her services, and they could have rejected the benefit, but did not.""

Julie, who studied animal science at university, worked as an agricultural journalist and then as a senior executive in dairy companies and farming organisations.

She now lives in North Shropshire with her partner Tom Biggins.

Dima Bushnak was shot dead near her home after shunning the traditional life of her Bedouin village in Galilee, northern Israel. She had been working at a local business to support her family while studying

A 19-year-old woman who shunned a traditional Bedouin lifestyle and opted to work at a local business, study and wear western clothes has been shot dead close to her home.

Dima Bushnak had wanted to support her family while she studied and did not want to follow the usual path for women in her village which mainly involved agricultural work with little interaction with men.

On Sunday just before midnight, CCTV footage showed Dima desperately trying to escape her killer as she reverses her car at speed.

But in her terror, she crashes the vehicle into wall and man with a handgun runs towards her.

As the gunman gets to the driver's window he fires once and runs away before turning back to fire a second shot into Dima.

Moments later a second car's headlights are seen fleeing the shooting, close to the Bedouin village of Sallama, in Galilee, northern Israel.

Dima was rushed to hospital in critical condition where she was later pronounced dead.

She and her family had previously received death threats and her over her choice of lifestyle, family members told local media.

Her mother's car had been set on fire but police had been unable to find out who had done it.

One unnamed family member told local media: ""Just because Dima wanted to get ahead in life, there are some people that decided to threaten her life and in the end killed her.""

The family member added: ""They did not want her to work or study.""

Police did not say if there were any suspects or what they believe might have been the motive.

Dima's murder has become the 78th violent killing in the Arab community this year, a significant increase from the 30 cases reported at this time last year, as reported by the Abraham Initiatives anti-violence watchdog.

Among the victims, she is the sixth Arab female to be killed and the fifteenth woman killed in Israel in 2023.

The WHO has listed nine pathogens they believe are the most 'urgent' threat to humanity. Concerned scientists are urgently researching them, but have excluded one key threat

Covid-19 may no longer be a threat but World Health Organisation bosses are keeping close tabs on infections that pose a risk of sparking another pandemic.

The WHO has listed nine pathogens they believe are the most 'urgent' threat to humanity.

Concerned scientists are urgently researching them, but have excluded one key threat.

Despite the biggest ever outbreak currently sweeping the world, bird flu is not listed.

Avian influenza is not know to transmit easily between humans currently, mutations to the virus that makes mammal-to-mammal transmission easier could change that, some experts fear.

British scientists have also modelled worst-case scenarios under which the virus kills up to one in 20 people it infects, if it ever manages to take off in humans.

Officials said the figure was for 'planning purposes' and not a prediction.

The list of 'priority diseases' on the WHO's website states: ""This is not an exhaustive list, nor does it indicate the most likely causes of the next epidemic.

""WHO reviews and updates this list as needs arise, and methodologies change.""

Professor Francois Balloux, an infectious disease expert based at University College London, told MailOnline : ""I don't know why they chose to exclude flu and bird flu from the list.

""However we look at it, the chance that the next pandemic will be caused by a lineage of influenza is high.""

He added: ""One possibility may be that they wanted to draw attention to some less well-known zoonotic threats, for which preparedness should be stepped up, whereas for flu contingency plans are in place.

""The problem with that explanation is that it doesn't fit with SARS-CoV-2 being on the list.""

Here is the full list of the nine infections that could cause the next pandemic.

Covid

Covid shut down the world in 2020, with lockdowns happening across the globe.

The key symptoms of the infection include breathlessness, a dry cough and a fever, as well as loss of taste or smell.

The virus attacks the lungs and as the body fights back to kill the infection, experts say it can destroy lung tissue and cause inflammation.

This can cause pneumonia, as well as limiting oxygen supply to the blood which causes a variety of life-threatening issues.

The virus is now considered an 'established and ongoing health issue', after the WHO downgraded the threat level earlier this month.

Lassa fever

Lassa fever is a rodent-borne disease thought to cause no symptoms in 80 per cent of patients and kill just one per cent of those it infects.

People usually become infected with Lassa fever after exposure to food or household items contaminated with urine or faeces of infected rats.

Last year, a person in Bedfordshire died after catching the disease.

The unidentified individual was the third member of a family who recently returned to the UK from West Africa to become infected with the virus.

A total of 11 cases of Lassa fever have ever been detected in the UK, and is instead endemic in Nigeria, as well as Liberia and Guinea.

Zika

A flavivirus, a type of RNA virus, Zika is transmitted through the bite of infected female mosquitos.

The NHS says it can also be very rarely transmitted through sex.

For most people, the infection is mild and not harmful but it can cause problems for pregnant women.

The first recorded outbreak was in 2007, from the Island of Yap - Federated States of Micronesia.

Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific have also seen outbreaks,

The mosquito-borne virus sparked global panic in 2016, after millions were infected, causing scores of babies to be born with birth defects such as microcephaly.

Yet since 2016 more than 80 countries have faced Zika outbreaks.

Common symptoms include a high temperature, headaches, sore, red eyes, swollen joints and joint and muscle pain.

'Disease X'

Disease X is the mysterious name given to the very serious threat that unknown viruses pose to human health. Disease X is on a short list of pathogens deemed a top priority for research by the WHO.

We have no idea what Disease X can do, because we don't know what Disease X is after it first appeared on the list in 2018.

Disease X, which first appeared on the WHO's list in 2018, represents a hypothetical, currently unknown pathogen.

The UN agency adopted the placeholder name to ensure that their planning was sufficiently flexible to adapt to a disease.

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne virus which can prove fatal in up to 40 per cent of cases.

People can also become infected after contact with blood or tissue of infected livestock.

It can spread between humans through bodily fluids or among hospital patients if medical equipment is not properly sterilised.

The disease shares similar symptoms to Ebola at the start of infection including muscle aches, abdominal pain, a sore throat and vomiting.

It can also trigger bleeds, usually from the nose or from broken capillaries on the eyes and skin.

Other symptoms of the virus, which come on suddenly, include fever, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and sensitivity to light.

The WHO warns that CCHP outbreaks are a 'threat to public health services' and 'potentially results in hospital and health facility outbreaks'.

Nipah and henipaviral diseases

The incurable virus can be caught from pigs or by people eating fruit or drinking palm wine contaminated by infected bats. It can also be transmitted between people.

Nipah has killed more than 260 people in Malaysia, Bangladesh and India in the past 20 years, according to the World Health Organization.

The first known outbreak, in Malaysia in 1998, killed more than 100 people after they contracted the disease from infected pigs.

Nipah symptoms - which can include fever, headache, drowsiness and confusion - usually appear between five and 14 days after contracting the virus and may last for two weeks.

However, in serious cases people can progress into a coma within 24 hours of symptoms starting, and some people have breathing problems.

There is no treatment for the virus so people receive supportive care to try to relieve their symptoms.

Rift Valley Fever

Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral disease most commonly seen in domesticated animals in sub-Saharan Africa, including cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and camels.

People can get RVF through contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals, or through bites from infected mosquitoes.

Most who contract RVF either experience no symptoms or a mild cold-like illness with fever, weakness, back pain and dizziness.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, however, up to one in ten who contract RVF can develop severe symptoms which may include eye disease, excessive bleeding or even encephalitis ""” swelling of the brain.

It does not knowingly transmit between humans.

Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus disease

Ebola, which kills around half of those it infects, also made the list, alongside Marburg.

Both are haemorrhagic fevers ""” where organs and blood vessels are damaged, causing bleeding internally or from the eyes, mouth and ears.

These viruses can be spread by touching or handling body fluids of an infected person, contaminated objects or infected wild animals.

Ebola causes vomiting, diarrhoea, a rash, yellowing of the skin and eyes and bleeding from multiple orifices.

Marburg, one of the deadliest pathogens ever discovered, with a case-fatality ratio of 88 per cent, also causes similar symptoms to Ebola.

Infected patients become 'ghost-like', often developing deep-set eyes and expressionless faces. This is usually accompanied by bleeding from orifices.

Earlier this year, Equatorial Guinea and the United Republic of Tanzania were both hit by surges of the untreatable virus.

The outbreak saw 17 laboratory confirmed cases and 12 deaths in Equatorial Guinea as of May 1, with neighbouring countries Cameroon and Gabon restricting movement along their borders over concerns about contagion.

Nine cases and six deaths were recorded in Tanzania, as of April 30.

462,"Fuming Snowdonia visitors demand 'self-righteous' locals give a 'warmer' welcome","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/fuming-snowdonia-visitors-demand-self-30203642","Fuming Snowdonia visitors demand 'self-righteous' locals give a 'warmer' welcome

A row has broken out between locals and visitors to the Eryri National Park as some feel rules around parking are too stringent whereas others believe tourists think they are owed too much

Furious Snowdonia visitors have demanded that ""self-righteous"" locals give them a ""warmer"" welcome.

Some walkers and climbers to Eryri National Park have been left fuming after scenes emerged of cars being towed from the roads.

But it has sparked a debate as some seasoned visitors have admitted mixed feeling as the national park soars in popularity and locals have been left suffering, they claim.

The honeypot area tends to attract visitors from across the country, especially when the weather turns warmer, but some of whom park illegally or dangerously.

This has become such a problem the national park instituted a zero-tolerance policy.

But some have said this has gone too far.

A blogger accused rural communities of being too quick to condemn anyone who wants to visit the countryside.

He said: ""The root cause of the parking issues is not hundreds of insensitive louts being lazy or ignorant - the vast majority are decent people stuck with nowhere to park and poor alternative provision.

""It should not be beyond the national park and local authority capability to anticipate peak crowds and make appropriate provision that make's visitors welcome and well catered for.

""Instead we are presented with a self-righteous, insular, let's-tow-away-their-cars-and-that'll-show-em type attitude, which is counterproductive and, most of all, ungenerous. Let's see more constructive and generous proposals rather than this biting of the hand that feeds.""

The numbers of visitors to Eryri surged from 2017 to peak pre-Covid pandemic, and locals believe numbers have rocketed once again since.

But, North Wales Live reported how locals are left bearing the brunt of the problems including the indiscriminate parking, littering, off-lead dogs, and disposable barbecues left around the place posing a fire risk.

Tensions appear to be rising, the outlet said, but for regular visitors, there is some sympathy for locals. Writing on Facebook, one man said ""99% of the people.... are friendly and welcoming"".

But he added: ""I've been climbing and hiking in North Wales for nearly 20 years and whilst ascending the Llanberis path (on Yr Wyddfa) recently, I was told by a local in Llanberis to ""go back to where I belong"". Wherever that is!

""Inconsiderate parking and littering infuriates me as it does most other people. Unfortunately, the minority once again ruin it for the majority.""

Over Easter, almost 40 vehicles were towed from Pen-y-Pass on Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon) and the A5 in the Ogwen Valley.

Eryri National Park has a long-term goal of greater sustainability, and a key part of that is reducing reliance on cars.

The national park is now ringed with park-and-ride sites and an app has been launched to guide visitors to car parks with free spaces, and shuttle buses run continuously to places like Yr Wyddfa and Llyn Ogwen.

For locals blighted by inconsiderate parking it's a bitter pill to swallow. In April, the A5 was closed for several hours as police battled to clear double-parked vehicles.

Locals were stuck at home and farm livestock went untended.

Heading into the summer season, when visitor numbers traditionally peak, there are fears of more to come.

Snowdon Mountain Railway is this month resuming summit services and reopening its long-closed Hafod Eryri cafe - a move expected to bring more people to the already crowded peak of Wales' highest mountain.

Vehicles causing a hazard should be removed, insisted one local. ""I wouldn't expect anything else if I parked up on Manchester ring road and went shopping for the afternoon,"" he said. Another questioned: ""So people will risk being towed and putting others lives at risk for the sake of £20 per car? Unbelievable!""

A local woman accused some visitors of a lack of consideration for the communities into which they enter. ""There seems to be a post-Covid attitude of entitlement that they can do what they like, when they like and how they like,"" she said. ""Abuse by some visitors is on the increase - not all, but the numbers are rising.""

The preference by some visitors to park at the foot of mountains, rather than use park-and-ride facilities, is a challenge facing the park authorities. Walkers complain that, after a tiring day on the mountains, the last thing they want is to ""wait an hour for a bus"".

However, Eryri National Park believes its approach is bearing fruit. ""Only a small minority of visitors are not following the guidelines, said a spokesperson. ""We are very grateful for everyone's cooperation in this regard.""

The grassy expanse at Balmer Lawn in the New Forest, which became a National Park in 2005, has become bumpy, which led to recent research by experts at Forestry England

The enigma surrounding a peculiar lunar-like landscape in a popular National Park has finally been solved by an ecology expert.

When a grassy expanse at Balmer Lawn in the New Forest became bumpy, mystery shrouded the change in appearance. Some speculated the involvement of a hyperactive colony of moles, while others wondered if yellow meadow ants were the culprits, as they're known for their penchant for crafting ant hills in grassland habitats.

But now Leanne Sargeant, a senior ecologist from Forestry England, said the agency believes the landscape has changed because an area of moor grasses has dried out, likely as a result of climate change.

She said: ""There has been some debate in the past about what caused the bumpy lawn but we believe that this is an area of old molinia tussocks that have dried out over the years causing the peat around the molinia to shrink, as the ground has lowered, the molinia tussocks have vegetated over with other species that can cope in the drying ground.""

The unusual topography was captured by photographer Matt Pinner, who himself took to social media to solicit theories about its cause. Forestry England, though, has studied the grassy expanse on land it manages near Brockenhurst, Hampshire, for some time.

Tourists in New Forest had been baffled by the hundreds of odd lumps recently. Photographs show the lumps peppering the vast stretch of grassland, which is heavily grazed by livestock including ponies, donkeys and cattle.

New Forest, designated a National Park in 2005, receives more than 13 million visits from tourists each year, figures show. Total spending associated with leisure visits to the New Forest is estimated at around £107.6 million. Approximately 30 per cent of jobs in the New Forest are provided by the tourism industry.

Nicola's Bulley's disappearance has been in headlines across the UK, and the case has brought back memories for the brother of a student who died in the area back in 1978

The family of a boy who died in a brook near where Nicola Bulley has gone missing have said they ""know her family's pain"".

Student Roger Jones was thrown into a fast-flowing brook that fed into the River Wyre in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, back in 1978 following a motorcycle crash.

It was near the River Wyre that Nicola, 45, was last seen walking her beloved springer spaniel Willow on January 27.

Police launched an extensive search of the area and said their ""main working hypothesis"" was that she fell in a river but a body has not yet been found.

Nicola's disappearance has been in headlines across the UK since late January, and the case has brought back harrowing memories of the loss of the Jones family's youngest son.

Roger's brother Don Jones, who now lives in Caton, Lancashire, said: ""We feel so much for Nicola's family and friends. We know just what they must be going through"".

Roger was a pupil at the former Fulwood High School, where he was working to go to Myerscough College to study agriculture and follow his dream of becoming a farmer.

The 16-year-old had been returning home one night as a passenger on a friend's motorbike when they crashed into a car on a narrow bridge in Woodplumpton, near Preston.

The bike rider was badly injured and unconscious when emergency services arrived, and was unable to tell them he had a passenger.

It was 3am before police were alerted that someone was missing and returned to the bridge.

While a massive police search was launched, that included dog patrols, divers, and mounted police , Roger's body was not discovered until two months later, when it washed up on a sandbank at low tide seven miles from St Michael's, the town where Nicola was last seen.

Don, a journalist for Granada TV, said that his family were ""exhausted"" by the time his younger brother's body was found, adding: ""It was just a case of waiting for what seemed inevitable"".

He said that the river conditions when Roger went missing 45 years ago were ""pretty similar"" to the conditions Nicola may have faced in the River Wyre, adding: ""He was obviously swept over the weir and into the tidal part of the river.""

Don said that he and his family didn't have to deal with social media trolls and conspiracy theorists chiming in, adding that it ""must be a nightmare for [Nicola's family] to deal with"".

He added that he and his family also had to deal with ""clairvoyants and spiritualists"", which he said ""proved very upsetting, especially for our mum"".

Lancashire Police renewed their appeal for dashcam footage of St Michael's on the morning of Friday January 27 when Nicola was last seen at around 9.20am.

Sixty officers are working to locate the 45-year-old mortgage advisor, with the National Crime Agency on hand to review Lancashire Police's investigation to see if any clues slipped through the net.

Yesterday the county force again rejected suggestions that Nicola could have been a victim of crime, with detectives believing she has ""most likely"" fallen into the river.

As another victim is mauled to death by an XL Bully, The Mirror takes a look at the sinister world in which innocent animals are turned into brutal killing machines in the name of making money

The UK has been plagued by a terrifying spate of XL Bully attacks in recent months, with a man in his 50s killed by an ""out of control"" XL Bully in Sunderland. A murder probe has been launched after neighbours told how paramedics fought to save the life of the man following the traumatic attack in Shiney Row at around 6.55pm yesterday. A woman found him on a field near Maple Terrace and shouted at the first police officer to arrive: ""Please help me! His throat is hanging out.""

Police have since arrested a 44-year-old man on suspicion of murder, while the dog was ""destroyed at the scene to ensure the safety of the public"". In recent years, extreme dog breeding has become big business and profit-driven breeders are continuing to put their wealth over animal welfare in order to cash in - with dealers earning up to £250k salaries. Devastatingly, this often means mating and selling untrained crossbreeds that have the power to kill. They are trained on treadmills and left alone in dark rooms in a bid to turn them into violent status symbols.

When not looked after properly, these poorly bred yet powerful dogs can attack other pets and people, as we've increasingly seen in recent times. Of the 10 fatal dog attacks in the UK last year, more than half of them involved the controversial American XL bully. It seems a cult has formed around bull breeds online, with an increasingly close relationship highlighted between organised crime and dog dealing. Careless and uneducated dealers are breeding dangerous dogs, and little is being done about it.

With American XL bullies making headlines after another viciously attacked an 11-year-old girl last month, and Home Secretary Suella Braverman pushing for an urgent ban on what looks like an uncontrollable breed, the Mirror takes a look into the depraved and dark world of dangerous backyard breeders...

Criminal gangs cashing in

Last year, a Mirror investigation found that new dog dealers were being encouraged to make ""monsters"" out of powerful dogs to earn up to £250,000. The RSPCA said it had seen animals kept in ""medieval"" conditions, with ""breeding bitches kept in darkness or living in their own faeces"" by money-grabbing breeders, making hundreds and thousands of pounds.

The dog breeding craze, which erupted during the pandemic, has caused the ""perfect storm for dog bites"". It prompted the arrival of pet 'fertility clinics', offering training on how to become a DIY breeder at home; and dog semen was found being posted with artificial insemination (AI) kits sent by post. Illegal ear cropping was also discovered being offered by crooks online, specifically to give XL bullies the American 'look'.

A gang from Stoke-on-Trent was jailed in 2022 after puppies were found in a semi-comatose state after cropping their ears. RSPCA chief vet Caroline Allen said at the time: ""Ear cropping has absolutely no positive effect on the dog themself and is done purely for cosmetic reasons because someone wants a specific 'tough' look for their dog. Sadly, it's a trend that, despite being illegal, seems to be growing in popularity.""

Ian Briggs, from the RSPCA's special operations unit, previously spoke out about the so-called cottage breeders ""churning out puppy after puppy after puppy and charging thousands with it with no real knowledge"". He explained: ""There are criminal gangs involved - certainly around the Bully XL market - that have obviously seen a way of coining in a huge amount of cash. They are operating outside the licensing rules.

""If you are looking at between £2,000 to £5,000 for a puppy and you get four puppies out of a dog, it's a lot of money. They are making hundreds of thousands of pounds. It's not just the XL Bullies though, there are the high value Frenchies too. It's all about turning over vast profits. But with the Bully XL if they bite you it is likely you will be seriously injured.""

Mr Briggs explained that the new market for puppy bull breeds has attracted a new wave of sellers that lack knowledge and care. ""What it's done is attract certain people to the breeding market that weren't there before because they can see so much money to be made. You can just see it coming. It's almost coming in slow motion, a tsunami of welfare issues,"" he said. He explained that these dodgy dealers are ""exploiting animals and the buyer for financial gain"".

Social media money craze

In recent years, the American XL bully business has been garnering popularity on social media platforms, with breeders swapping tips about how to 'market' your pack to make the maximum amount of money from puppies. In one YouTube video, viewers are told the UK is ""smashing"" the XL bully market and you can get puppies younger than eight weeks - which is against the advice of Lucy's Law in the UK.

A dealer online says: ""We've been in the bully game for over a year now and have got a bit of knowledge that we can guide you and help you on your way to raise monsters and make ker-ching."" His sidekick adds: ""Step One is picking your right stud, knowing what you are buying... do your research."" The dog dealers say that marketing is ""super important"" and ""it's all about status"" - rather than the welfare of the animal.

Sickening fighting pits

Dog fighting was banned along with all other animal fighting in 1835, and yet illegal dog fights have soared by almost a half since Covid, fuelled by a sickening stream of online videos. The RSPCA was called to 330 fights last year compared to 226 in 2019. And this year, numbers are on track to be even higher with 149 savage encounters recorded up to May.

The RSPCA runs stings to take down the violent and disturbing groups at the top level of this disgusting spectacle. The fights - some reported to be worth up to £50,000 - pit dog against dog until one dies or can no longer fight. They are said to attract heavy betting and guns and drugs are often found at the secret venues. Ian Muttitt, a chief inspector with the RSPCA, said earlier this year that technology now allows these fights to be organised easily and discreetly.

The charity believe backyard breeding and an explosion in demand for bully-type dogs is feeding lower-level fighting, such as chain contests in parks. And they say this is directly linked to the growing number of aggressive ""status"" dogs on the streets. Mr Muttitt said youngsters often start with an interest in ""status"" dogs and progress to the top levels of fighting. Coupled with the rising number of violent videos it was causing a ""perfect storm"".

He was also concerned about algorithms fuelling interest in fighting after it had been viewed once online. He advised: ""If you see a fight in a park or a public place contact the police and the RSPCA but do not get directly involved. Other tell-tale signs would be a lot of dogs coming and going from a property. If people are keeping dogs locked up and away from public view, or if people hear reports of dog fighting going on in their area, they can report things anonymously to Crimestoppers or to the RSPCA.""

Dog treadmills for training

Before pitting them against each other, dog breeders are forcing their dogs onto makeshift treadmills and forcing them to run for their life - training to either kill or be killed in the brutal fighting bloodsport. This hideous set-up was discovered in a raid this week, when the Mirror joined the RSPCA and police on the covert operation to take down a suspected dog fighting ring.

West Midlands Police said two men, aged 30 and 32, were arrested under section 8 of the Animal Welfare Act and five dogs were seized from a property in Saltley, Birmingham on Tuesday. Dogs, drugs and a machete were pulled from the house on a quiet residential road, and a huge medieval-type contraption was also wheeled onto the street.

As daylight broke, it became clear it was a dog treadmill. Such treadmills are commonly used to train fighting dogs, building both strength and stamina. A spokesperson for West Midlands Police said: ""Along with the dogs, officers found dog training equipment and books about dog breeding as well as a machete and a quantity of suspected Class A drugs.""

'Vicious' behavioural problems

American bullies and their variants can fetch as much as £6,000 on online marketplaces, and thousands of them are currently being listed across the UK for anybody to buy without checks. There are currently 1,303 American bully dogs and puppies for sale on Freeads, while on Pets4Homes, there are 866 puppies being sold. Meanwhile, on gumtree there are 85 XL Bullys available. Gumtree has noted the number of listings has decreased since the announcement of the ban.

Several people currently selling bully-type dogs online allude to the animals having behavioural problems. And while some sellers don't stipulate the breed, many use the term 'not good with kids' on the listing as a codeword for a bully. One owner selling her American bully 'urgently' for £300 on Freeads described her pup, which is just 10-months-old, as being already a ""big heavy boy"". She added: ""Unfortunately my boy wasn't the right choice for my family. A big hyper dog and three young children. This isn't what I want to do but it just isn't fair on him or the kids right now.""

Another, who had originally paid £6,000 for their pocket bully - a smaller version of the American bully, said she had listed the dog on Freeads for £1000 to £1,500 after it had a fight with her other dog. One dog listing in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, for a male 15-month-old American XL bully going for £850 said it was not neutered as the vet was unable to get him upstairs to sedate him. The owner added: ""Looking for an only-dog home as can be vicious towards other dogs, hence the reason for rehoming. My older boys are 10 and he's attacked both of them mainly over food. You will need to be able to handle him as he is strong.""

Animal behaviourist Zoe Willingham told the Mirror: ""We need to look at the reasons why these dogs have attacked. Unscrupulous breeders are breeding them to be guard dogs and having these aggressive tendencies. But then they are falling into family homes as pets, which is how you end up with this situation of people trying to sell them on because they can't control them and don't know what they are taking on and not seeking advice about how to look after these dogs or keep themselves safe.""

Joseph Rindsland, head of trust and safety at Gumtree, said: ""At Gumtree, nothing is more important to us than the safety of our users and the welfare of the animals listed on our site. We pride ourselves on being a responsible platform and as a member of the Pets Advertising Advisory Group (PAAG) - the UK's trade body covering online animal sales made up of 25 welfare organisations including the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Dogs Trust, and the RSPCA among others - we will always follow Government advice and legislation. Should the Home Office move forward with a ban, our dedicated safety team would make sure that it was reflected in our posting policies. In the meantime, we would ask that all our users seriously consider the characteristics of a dog, and their needs, before agreeing to rehome a pet. We have comprehensive educational material about different breeds on our site which we would strongly recommend users read carefully.""

A spokesperson for Pets4Homes said: ""Pets4Homes takes our commitment to the safe rehoming of pets seriously. We work with responsible and vetted breeders, provide detailed breed guidelines to those considering rehoming a dog, and work closely with authorities to ensure that we adhere to all UK laws. We do not feature breeds that Defra or PAAG (the Pet Advertising Advisory Group) have a recommendation against rehoming. Should the law or recommendations change on this specific breed, we will update our policies.""

Dangerous dog capital

Figures released last year by NHS England revealed that you are almost 10 times more likely to be bitten by a dog in Knowsley, Merseyside, than the rest of Britain. Doctors in the area see more than 24 people each year with dog bites, 60 percent higher than the national average of 15. Coined the country's 'dangerous dog capital', owners are claimed to parade their XL bullies around the park and use public spaces as illegal breeding grounds at night.

Locals speak of being too frightened to walk down the street, and of being wary of taking young children out for the day. In Knowsley, one resident, who wished to remain anonymous, described the number of dangerous dogs roaming her community, including Stadt Moers Park, as ""appalling"". She said: ""There's been at least four dog-on-dog attacks recently in this park. Only the other day a dog had its throat ripped out and was left with 500 stitches. It's a miracle it survived.

""This is my fear all the time. What scares me is that it could be a child next. It's macho-ism, it's young men who own these dogs. You have all these bullies going around, all these pitbull crosses, and they rule the roost, they do what they want to do."" The resident added: ""They have even been here breeding the dogs of a night.""

Resident Kathy Brogan, 71, said the situation made her reconsider where she can take her three-year-old grandson, Finn, and pet dog. She said: ""It makes us wary of where we walk. You do hear about dogs attacking kids and dogs attacking other dogs in Knowsley. There was a child attacked just the other day. We get a lot of people with powerful dogs, some of them off the lead, and it's frightening."" Less than five miles away, in St Helens, attacks average 19 per year. Two children have lost their lives.

One St Helens woman told of being attacked by a Rottweiler last year. The 47-year-old, who did not want to be named, said: ""The girl had to punch her own dog in the head several times to get it off me. It was trying to rip my arm off. I thought I was going to bleed out."" The woman, who had to have surgery, said she was haunted by physical and mental scars. She said: ""The number of powerful breeds in the area is scary. The scales are heavily tipped towards the larger breeds and I think it's incredibly irresponsible. I have no issue with specific breeds but know how to handle it if you are going to get one, don't put us all at risk.""

Danger Dogs - our demands

The Mirror is calling for these changes:

1. The overhaul of the Dangerous Dogs Act . An urgent review of the law is needed and tougher penalties should be considered.

2. Enforce the rules to stop the illegal and irresponsible breeding and selling of dogs.

3. A public information campaign to promote the importance of responsible dog ownership and the need for training.

The threat of atomic warfare continues to feel scarily real in 2023 and the consequences would be devastating for our planet and its population if red buttons were pressed worldwide

With Russian president Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine and North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong-un's continued penchant for missile launching, the threat of World War Three often seems scarily real.

And, with both regularly keen to flex their atomic potential, the menace of nuclear warfare is becoming a constant cause for concern too.

Should that ever happen, then the implications for the whole planet would be disastrous, with scientific research, dating back almost 40 years, suggesting our world would be plunged into a long, dark and cold nuclear winter.

Economical devastation on a seismic scale would be caused by the damaging after effects of the light, heat, blast and radiation from hundreds of nuclear explosions, according to the experts.

Early studies into the global impact of nuclear war, conducted between 40 and 50 years ago, speculated that significant volumes of dust kicked up into the air by nuclear blasts would block sunlight from reaching Earth and result in a temporary cooling of the air.

In 1983, the respected TTAPS study (named after the first initials of the surnames of its five authors) then first coined the term ""nuclear winter"", which it theorised would be a consequence of the many immense fireballs caused by exploding atomic warheads.

According to its findings, huge uncontrollable fires would break out across cities and forests, leading to engulfing plumes of smoke and soot that would form a thick band of black cloud encircling the Northern Hemisphere and block out all but a glimmer of the sun's light for several weeks.

Temperatures on earth would consequently drop by an estimated 11C to 22C - the equivalent of turning a hot summer's day into a cold winter morning at the extreme end of that scale.

Much of the planet's animal life and vegetation, meanwhile, would be destroyed, as per the scientific research into the ramifications of semi-darkness, deep frosts, subfreezing temperatures and rocketing radiation levels.

The large-scale destruction of food supplies and crops, as well as industrial, medical, and transportation infrastructures, would also, it is forecast, trigger a horrific death toll from starvation, exposure, and disease, with the global population plummeting in numbers.

Former Emmerdale actor Kelvin Fletcher is documenting his life running a 120-acre farm in the Peak District with his wife and four kids despite having no experience

Former Emmerdale star Kelvin Fletcher is set to return to ITV seven years after leaving the soap.

The 39-year-old - who also wowed fans with his moves on Strictly Come Dancing which he won in 2019 - has landed his very own reality show.

Kelvin, who played Andy Sugden on Emmerdale for 20 years, revealed the new show is called Fletcher's Family Farm.

It will follow the adventures of Kelvin, his actress wife Liz and their four children, Marnie, six, Milo, four, and one-year-old twin boys, Maximus and Mateusz.

Sharing the news on Instagram, he told his 486,000 followers: ""A brand new ITV1 series this Autumn bringing you inside our lives as we celebrate and explore this wonderful farming life!

""With more animals, more laughs, more mistakes and even more children! This adventure really has only just begun. We can't wait to share it with you! Let the fun begin!""

The documentary-style programme is set at Kelvin's 120-acre farm in the Peak District, which he moved into in 2021. Prior to that, the family lived in Manchester.

It is being made by Leeds-based Daisybeck Studios and commissioned for weekday daytime for ITV and ITVBe in the first co-commission between the two channels.

Viewers got a glimpse into Kelvin's life on the farm when he starred in a six-part series on the BBC last year.

Kelvin's Big Farming Adventure followed Kelvin as he learned how to run a farm, just like his former Emmerdale character Andy.

With the help of a next-door neighbour, Gilly, who has experience in the industry, Kelvin and his family got stuck into all that farm life brings.

But the show was slammed by some, who called it a ""˜rip off Clarkson's Farm'.

One viewer tweeted: ""How much does Kelvin Fletcher want to copy Jeremy Clarkson with his new farm."" While another said: ""Clarkson's Farm it ain't.""

Unlikely farmer Jeremy Clarkson became a lockdown smash hit after documenting his attempts to farm the 1,000-acre Diddly Squat Farm in Oxfordshire.

Clarkson's Farm went on to break Amazon Prime viewing records as the most highly watched show on the platform.

Addressing the comparison to Clarkson's Farm, Kelvin said there is still a huge appetite for this sort of show and they're all very different in their own ways.

He revealed their original plan was to move to the US, but this was thwarted by the lockdown.

Speaking exclusively to The Mirror at the end of last year, Kelvin said : ""It may seem like we have a showbizzy life, but every top I've got has baby sick on the shoulder.

""That's just the way it is, as any parent will tell you. There have been so many highlights this year.

""We're still only in our second year on the farm with a lot to learn, but it's great.""

Wife Liz, who starred in BBC One drama In The Club, says: ""It's been an amazing reaction. Farmers have welcomed us into the community and want to give us advice.""

Kelvin and Liz knew each other as children and became a couple after Liz finished university. They married in London in 2015 after Kelvin proposed on a beach in Wales.

512,"Potatoes and carrots are most popular Christmas veggies - but the worst for greenhouse gases","https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/food-drink/christmas-dinner-vegetables-greenhouse-gases-31683715","Potatoes and carrots are most popular Christmas veggies - but the worst for greenhouse gases

The two vegetables are each responsible for almost a fifth of the GHG emissions needed to produce an entire Christmas meal

Potatoes and carrots are the two most popular vegetables to serve up with a Christmas Day dinner - but are also the two worst culprits of the meal when it comes to the greenhouse gases emitted during their production, research has found.

A survey of 2,000 adults, who celebrate the holiday season, found that over three-quarters (78%) will sit down to a traditional Christmas meal on December 25 - with 88% of these serving up potatoes, while 81% will have carrots on their plate.

However, individually, these two veggies are each responsible for almost a fifth (18%), of the greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), that come from producing an entire festive dinner.

Other popular vegetables that rank highly in terms of GHG emissions include peas, which are enjoyed by 43% of Brits on the big day, and produce 15% of emissions from the meal.

Meanwhile, parsnips and sprouts are each responsible for 14% of Christmas dinner GHG emissions - but are enjoyed by 64%, and 75%, respectively.

Overall, scientific modelling revealed that around 14,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases are emitted each year in the UK, just to produce the vegetables on our plates on Christmas Day.

However, the research estimates these emissions could be cut by up to a fifth, by using smart, 5G-enabled technologies in farming and food distribution - the equivalent of saving enough energy to power Christmas tree lights in 7.3 million UK households on the big day.

The data, commissioned by Vodafone, conducted by WPI Economics, and modelled by Development Economics, used a survey of 2,000 adults to find out what vegetables people will tuck into during Christmas dinner.

It then looked at several aspects of UK food and drink manufacturing - including the average GHG emissions created by ""traditional"" approaches to producing Brits' favourite vegetables (per kg of output).

This revealed the average UK GHG emissions from the production of our favourite vegetables in a festive dinner is 0.842 kg - meaning those who will enjoy the dish on Christmas Day will produce an estimated 13,803 metric tons of GHG.

Research found the combination of 5G-enabled precision technology, used to apply seeds, pesticides, and fertilizer; Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, which reduces food wastage on farms; and vehicle-to-everything technology, to make transporting food to retailers more efficient, could amount to an estimated overall saving of 3,302 metric tons of GHG emissions.

Andrea Dona, CTO at Vodafone, which is proposing a combination with Three UK to enable an £11billion investment to create better 5G networks over the next decade, said: ""While this is a light-hearted way of looking at the energy that can be saved by the deployment of proper 5G technologies, the message is a serious one, and there are genuine time, money, and carbon savings that can be achieved.

""The Christmas Dinner and farming example is a topical illustration - but 5G really has the power to supercharge many UK industries, and so the roll-out of the infrastructure in the UK is critical for helping us meet our climate goals quicker.""

The research also found that other popular vegetables to serve up on the big day include broccoli (41%), cauliflower (36%), and cabbage (21%). Meanwhile, kale was at the bottom of the list, being dished up by just 3% of respondents.

Where possible, 54% were likely to seek out British or locally grown veggies, in support of UK farmers (78%), and to make sure their veggies are as fresh as possible (58%).

However, a fifth of those surveyed didn't realise the vegetables on their Christmas Dinner plate could have a negative impact on the environment.

It also emerged that over half (52%) of those polled, via OnePoll, will use up their Christmas leftovers in turkey sandwiches, bubble and squeak (29%), or a turkey curry (23%).

Doug Inglis and his long-time partner Jenny Gusse were camping in Banff National Park with their border collie Tris when they were attacked and killed by a female grizzly bear

Two campers who were mauled to death in a grizzly bear attack have managed to send one last desperate message before they died from their injuries.

Doug Inglis and his longtime partner Jenny Gusse, both 62, were camping in Banff National Park in Canada in late September with their dog when the attack happened. At some point during or after their horrific attack, the pair were able to send a final chilling text along with an SOS signal.

""Bear attack, bad"", read the message, according to Doug's uncle, Colin Inglis. The message was sent using a Garmin inReach satellite communicator on Friday, September 29. The message was sent with an SOS signal, which was triggered by someone holding the device's emergency button for three seconds.

""So one of them had entered that [text] into the inReach"" manually, explained Colin. The spine-chilling message serves as evidence of the moment a hiking trip to enjoy the spectacular fall foliage became a tragedy.

But the attack raised questions. How did two veteran hikers, known for doing everything correctly and by the book, become the victims of a rare grizzly bear attack?

""This incident is the first grizzly bear-caused fatality recorded in Banff National Park in decades"", explained Parks Canada. Park authorities received an alert of a bear attack on their GPS system at around 8pm on the Friday.

The alert came from the Red Deer River Valley inside the park. A Parks Canada WIldlife Human Attack Response Team was sent to the location on the ground as the weather did not allow a helicopter response. The team made it to the location at around 1am on the Saturday where they found the two bodies as well as a grizzly bear exhibiting aggressive behaviour.

The bear was euthanised on-site ""to ensure public safety"", said the park. Police got to the scene at 5am on Sunday where the victims were transported to Sundre, Alberta. In a statement after the attack, the park said: ""This is a tragic incident, and Parks Canda wishes to express its sincere condolences to the families and friends of the victims.""

Doug and Jenny were prepared for their trip to the park, as the Wildlife Human Attack Response Team found a bear-proof food bag hanging in a tree, as recommended. They also found a discharged can of bear spray was also found at the site, indicating the pair had tried to force the animal to leave.

""They hiked in this area several times a year on an extended trip,"" said Colin. ""They've been in this area in the spring.""

The couple were on a weeklong trek through Banff and used their inReach device to send regular updates to Colin and Jenny's mother. They were detailed when it came to planning their adventures. They were known to be careful by nature, with the couple working together in laboratories carrying out agricultural research.

""Doug and Jenny were highly experienced. They did everything right,"" said Colin. ""This is an unusual circumstance - they ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time.""

Earlier in the day, the couple had hit a delay during their hike but messaged Colin to say they were alright. He said they had likely made it to a campsite and were making dinner when the message was sent, just before 5pm. But just hours later, things went terribly wrong.

Doug and Jenny made camp in a permitted area, along with their border collie, Tris. At the time, there was no active bear warning or areas closed according to Parks Canada.

The agency says it got the same message from an inReach device that Colin did at around 8pm local time, alerting them to the bear attack. But it took them hours to reach the site of the violent attack as they were forced to travel over ground instead of by helicopter.

According to Parks Canada, the area is very remote and there were no witnesses to the attack. It said: ""We will never know the full details of what led to the attack and will not speculate.""

""Jenny and Doug were [found] close by each other not far from the tent in their stocking feet,"" Colin said, relaying what Parks Canada had told him, noting that it was strange as it was wet outside. ""Their boots and booties were in the tent, which suggests that something happened that one or both of them exited the tent.""

When the response teams got to the scene, they found the bodies of the two campers and their dog. They also caught sight of the bear which ""displayed aggressive behaviour and proceeded to charge towards the response team"".

The bear was shot and killed for public safety. An investigation found it was a ""non-lactating older female"" more than 25 years old. They said while she was in fair condition, her teeth were in bad shape and she ""had less than normal body fat for this time of year"".

The bear wasn't tagged or wearing a collar. Overall, bear attacks are very rare, with Parks Canada saying: ""Over the last 10 years, there have been three recorded non-fatal, contact encounters with grizzly bears in Banff National Park.""

Colin agrees that it's pointless to speculate about exactly what happened to his nephew and his partner. But, he added: ""You know, if they hadn't been delayed, they would have been in a different spot"".

""These were real special human beings,"" said Colin. While he's Doug's uncle, he also views the couple as his close friends. Adding: ""I've known Doug since the day he was born. He is more like a little brother than a nephew.""

Doug was a scientist, while Jenny was a research technician in his labs. The pair worked for Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. They were partners in everything.

""They have been together almost entirely since they went to university,"" explained Colin. ""They've been a team, completely, in all aspects of their lives, whether it be work, at home, gardening, or canoeing or hiking.""

The couple were environmentally conscious and loved Canada's national park system, seeing themselves as stewards of the wilderness. Colin said: ""They were wonderful people. They were very gentle people.""

Colin said the tragedy is also a reminder of the things that are beyond our control when we head out into the wilderness. He said: ""Being outdoors people ourselves. it's a nightmare that doesn't go away, you know? That's just the reality.""

517,"'We were scared of dying of Covid and now we are frightened we will starve to death'","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/north-korean-residents-secretly-lift-30242280","'We were scared of dying of Covid and now we are frightened we will starve to death'

Civilians trapped inside North Korea say they have watched mothers, unable to work due to sickness, die of starvation and watched whole families perish from hunger

North Korean citizens have secretly spoken out from the regime-controlled country to share the horror of starvation they currently face.

Civilians trapped inside the country say they have watched mothers, unable to work due to sickness, die of starvation and watched whole families perish from hunger.

A construction worker, using the fake name Chan Ho, who lives near the Chinese border told the BBC that food supplies were so low that five people in his village had already died from starvation.

North Korea remains one of the most repressive countries in the world which is shrouded in secrecy under its rule by authoritarian leader Kim Jong Un.

By using the pandemic as its excuse, the regime has shuttered borders and empowered authorities to stop importing grain from China, as well as the fertilisers and machinery needed to grow food.

This has led to the starvation of its people while its dictator continues to spend hundreds of millions of pounds on developing his nuclear weapons programme.

""The North Korean borders need to open and they need to restart trade and they need to bring these things in for agriculture to improve and they need food to feed the people.

""But right now they are prioritising isolation, they are prioritising repression"", Lina Yoon, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch said to CNN.

One market trader from the north of the country, with the pseudonym Myong Suk, told the BBC that almost three-quarters of the products in her local market used to come from China, but that it was ""empty now"".

Another woman living in the capital Pyongyang said she knew a family of three who had starved to death at home.

""At first, I was afraid of dying from Covid, but then I began to worry about starving to death,"" Chan Ho said.

Three people spoke to the BBC via an organisation in South Korea which leaks information out of the country. At secure locations that could not be bugged, the source relayed the BBC's questions to the citizens to build a picture of what has been happening in the country.

The painstaking process took many months and once the testimonies could be corroborated it built a horror picture of a disaster unfolding.

All three people said since the border closure, they are afraid they will either starve to death or be executed for flouting the rules.

Myong Suk used to provide for her family by selling goods smuggled across the border, so now her income has vanished.

She said her family has never had so little to eat and now other villagers knock on each other's doors begging for money.

In the late 1990s, an infamous famine in North Korea killed as many as three million people.

These stories and other warnings from aid agencies have prompted fears the country could be on the brink of another catastrophe.

Lucas Rengifo-Keller, a research analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CNN in March that trade data, satellite images and assessments by the United Nations and South Korean authorities all suggest the food supply has now ""dipped below the amount needed to satisfy minimum human needs.""

520,"El NiÃ±o is officially BACK threatening intense floods, droughts, wildfire and PLAGUE","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/el-nio-officially-back-threatening-30208492","El NiÃ±o is officially BACK threatening intense floods, droughts, wildfire and PLAGUE

The United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has officially declared El NiÃ±o is underway and scientists warn it could bring record hot temperatures and contribute to extreme events including droughts, cyclones and infectious diseases

Blistering climate phenomenon El NiÃ±o has officially begun and threatens torrential rains, drought and horrific spikes in diseases spread by moquitoes.

Only occuring every three to seven years, the cyclical warming of the world's oceans and weather sparks tropical cyclones in the Pacific, and gave the world its hottest year on record in 2016.

And scientists are worried that this year could see El NiÃ±o return evern stronger, with the impact felt across the globe, sparking forest fires, intense rainfall, floods, and surges in infectious diseases including malaria and even plague.

On Thursday, the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) declared that an El NiÃ±o was now underway, after the past three years were dominated by the cooler La NiÃ±a climate pattern.

Already in Peru, the country's worst outbreak of horrid dengue fever has killed more than 200 people this year, with more than 130,000 recorded cases - the highest since 2017.

And it is feared El NiÃ±o will make the outbreak of the mosquito-borne tropical disease even worse.

Dengue fever can be fatal, and hits sufferers with a high fever, headache, vomiting and muscle and joint pain.

Increased rainfall and flood risk causes mosquitoes to mass reproduce due to the build of water in cities.

It also forces rats to move to higher ground and into towns and villages, where they come into contact with humans more often - sparking explosions of plague and leptospirosis.

El NiÃ±o appears to have formed early this year, and is likely to be strong, warp weather worldwide and give an already warming Earth an extra kick of natural heat, meteorologists announced.

The NOAA issued an El NiÃ±o advisory, announcing the arrival of the climatic condition and warning it may not be like the others.

Head of NOAA's El NiÃ±o/La NiÃ±a forecast office, climate scientist Michelle L'Heureux, revealed it formed a month or two earlier than most El NiÃ±os do, which ""gives it room to grow.""

She said there's a 56% chance it will be considered strong and a 25% chance it reaches supersised level.

Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Brown University, said: ""If this El NiÃ±o tips into the largest class of events...it will be the shortest recurrence time in the historical record.""

Such a short gap between El NiÃ±os leaves communities with less time to recover from damages to infrastructure, agriculture, and ecosystems like coral reefs.

Usually, an El NiÃ±o mutes hurricane activity in the Atlantic, giving relief to coastal areas in states from Texas to New England, Central America and the Caribbean, weary from recent record busy years.

But forecasters don't see that happening this time, because of record hot Atlantic temperatures that would counteract the El NiÃ±o winds that normally decapitate many storms.

Hurricanes strengthen and grow when they travel over warm seawater, and the tropical regions of the Atlantic Ocean are ""exceptionally warm,"" said Kristopher Karnauskas, associate professor at the University of Colorado Boulder. So this year, NOAA and others are predicting a near-average Atlantic hurricane season.

In the past, a strong El NiÃ±o has led to record global warmth, like in 2016 and 1998. Scientists earlier this year had been saying next year is more likely to set a record heat, especially because El Ninos usually reach peak power in winter. But this El NiÃ±o started even earlier than usual.

University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd said: ""The onset of El NiÃ±o has implications for placing 2023 in the running for warmest year on record when combined with climate-warming background.""

An El NiÃ±o is a natural, temporary and occasional warming of part of the Pacific that shifts weather patterns across the globe, often by moving the airborne paths for storms.

The world earlier this year got out of an unusually long-lasting and strong La NiÃ±a - El NiÃ±o's flip side with cooling - that exacerbated drought in the US West and augmented Atlantic hurricane season.

What this in some ways means is that some of the wild weather of the past three years - such as drought in places - will flip the opposite way.

""If you've been suffering three years of a profound drought like in South America, then a tilt toward wet might be a welcome to development,"" added Michelle L'Heureux said. ""You don't want flooding, but certainly there are portions of the world that may benefit from the onset of El NiÃ±o.""

For the next few months, during the northern summer, El NiÃ±o will most be felt in the Southern Hemisphere with ""minimal impacts"" in North America, Michelle L'Heureux said.

El NiÃ±o strongly tilts Australia toward drier and warmer conditions with northern South America - Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela - likely to be drier and Southeast Argentina and parts of Chile likely to be wetter, she said. India and Indonesia also tend to be dry through August in El NiÃ±os.

While traditionally El NiÃ±o means fewer hurricanes in the Atlantic, it often means more tropical cyclones in the Pacific, Michelle L'Heureux said.

El NiÃ±o hits hardest in December through February, shifting the winter storm track farther south to the equator.

The entire southern third to half of the United States, including California, is likely to be wetter in El NiÃ±o.

For years, California was looking for El NiÃ±o rain relief from a decades long megadrought, but this winter's seemingly endless atmospheric rivers made it no longer needed, she said.

The US Pacific Northwest and parts of the Ohio Valley can go dry and warm, Michelle L'Heureux said.

She added that some of the biggest effects are likely to be seen in a hotter and drier Indonesia and adjacent parts of Asia.

Also look for parts of southern Africa to go dry.

On the other hand, drought-stricken countries in northeast Africa will welcome beneficial rainfall after enduring drought conditions for several years due to prolonged La NiÃ±a events, said Azhar Ehsan, associate research scientist at Columbia University.

Some economic studies have shown that La NiÃ±a causes more damages in the United States and globally than El NiÃ±o.

One 2017 study in an economic journal found El NiÃ±o has a ""growth-enhancing effect"" on the economies of the United States and Europe, while it was costly for Australia, Chile, Indonesia, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa.

But a recent study says El NiÃ±o is far more expensive globally than previously thought, putting damage estimates in the trillions of dollars. The World Bank estimated that the 1997-1998 El NiÃ±o cost governments $45 billion.

The United States also faces hazards from El NiÃ±o despite some benefits.

Azhar Ehsan noted that the increased rainfall in California, Oregon, and Washington heightens the risk of landslides and flash flooding in these areas. ""

While El NiÃ±o brings benefits in terms of water resource recharge, it poses certain hazards that need to be considered and managed,"" he added.

Jeremy Clarkson's Diddly Squat Farm Shop is selling a large sourdough for £5.95 a pop, which is over 200% more expensive than a comparable loaf in Aldi

Jeremy Clarkson's Diddly Farm Squat Shop is over 200% more expensive for essential items than the nearest supermarket.

The shop - which reopened on February 10 to launch the second series of Clarkson's Farm - is reportedly selling a large loaf of sourdough bread for £5.95 a pop.

This is 274.21% more expensive than a comparable loaf costing £1.59 at Aldi supermarket, which is just a six minute drive away in nearby Chipping Norton.

Meanwhile, a box of eggs at Jeremy's shop is £3.20 which would cost £1.19 in Aldi.

But his milk - or ""˜cow juice' as he calls it - is £1.20 - only 1p more expensive than the same in the supermarket.

Of course, big brands have the advantage of selling to stores in bulk and there's no denying the work that goes into making farm produce.

But it will cost you a pretty penny and if you want to plump for a pot of pesto at Jeremy's you'll be parting with £7.99 compared to just 95p at the local supermarket.

Honey is also a lot more expensive at a whopping £15 compared to just 75p at the supermarket, according to research by the Evesham Journal.

Jeremy's Farm Shop reopened earlier this month after his comments about Meghan Markle sparked a global backlash.

The father-of-three, 62, suggested people 'throw excrement' at the duchess, who he said he dreamt of being 'paraded around the streets naked'.

The presenter shut the shop after many people, including his own daughter, condemned his comments.

However, as the second series of his farming adventures airs on Amazon this month, Jeremy flung open the farm shop's doors again.

Just 14 customers were seen visiting the shop, which is a far cry from the massive crowds and queues of cars, which flooded the farm last year.

But while visitor numbers were visibly down compared to previous years, the store has raised its prices.

The price hike comes after Jeremy called on the government to increase the prices of food as he believes its currently ""far too cheap"".

The former Top gear host made his comments in a a discussion about the farming industry, ahead of Clarkson's Farm returning for its new series on Amazon Prime.

Speaking out about difficulties the industry faces, Jeremy said that one issue for cereal farms like his is the increased cost of fertiliser, stating: ""Fertiliser is now costing £1,000 a tonne rather than £200 like last year.""

He added that farmers in various areas are experiencing a ""nightmare,"" before conceding he was in a more fortunate position as he has other ways of earning an income.

Starfield launched this week and the game will keep you busy for weeks. But the best way to explore the universe is at a high a level a possible and this XP trick will guarantee to get you there.

This Starfield XP exploit has the potential to net you as much as 20k XP per minute, but you'll need to lay the groundwork if you want to get to level 100 in as little as 20 minutes.

If you're not a stranger to Bethesda games, you'll be familiar with the dagger spamming exploit in The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim. This Starfield XP exploit is basically that but on a much larger scale. You'll want to look at prepping your ship so shipyard locations might come in handy because you're going to want a lot of storage capacity, and you can upgrade or buy new ships at the yards.

This method of farming Starfield XP involves setting up extraction and storage for specific minerals by building outposts, making time pass to fill up on them, and spam crafting an item that will give you the XP boost you're after. This is fully broken down in YouTuber Kibbles Gaming's 20 minute video, but we've crammed all the info into bitesize sections below for you.

This Starfield XP exploit is scalable so you can focus on more extraction and more storage, or start small and work your way up - whatever works for you. But the potential to boost your XP gains is there. You will need a decent amount of credit to do this trick, so be sure to check out the Starfield infinite money glitch to get a leg up before it's patched out.

Step 1: buy resources

Go to the UC Distribution Centre on Jemison in the Alpha Centauri system to buy the resources needed to kick things off. Speak to vendor Tseng and buy the following:

If anything on the list is unavailable, you can sit on a chair and wait for 24 hours. You'll need to do this anyway, as we're stocking up big time, and Kibbles Gaming recommends repeating this resting and purchasing cycle at least two to three times to save yourself the trouble of having to come back for more later on. But you can always revisit the vendor later on if need be. You can also make adaptive frames with iron and aluminium so you can always buy surplus of those minerals to craft them yourself.

Step 2: upgrade your ship

You can upgrade your ship at Starfield at shipyards and the objective is give it more cargo slots. Kibbles Gaming has a giant freighter on the go, but you don't need to go that hard. Conveniently, there's a shipyard on Jemison so head over there and get your ship kitted out to hold cargo. Bear in mind you'll be sacrificing mobility and interior space so I'd use this ship exclusively for this Starfield XP exploit and make sure it can carry at least a few thousand cargo.

It's advisable to store all of the resources you just bought aboard your ship, and you can keep coming back to fill it up. The Weight Lifting trait will also help you lug all this heavy stuff around so consider investing in that. And if you're a hoarder in Bethesda games, you'll likely want to invest in that anyway.

Step 3: mine Iron and aluminium for adaptive frame

We need to start extracting iron and aluminium next so you need to locate planets rich with these resources. Kibbles Gaming suggests Kurtz (Jemison's moon) for aluminium and Zamka (Olivas's moon) for iron. Both of these locations are in the Alpha Centauri star system. Zoom in on the planets or moons you've chosen and scan for resource locations. We want to head down and land on a spot full of the resource and make an outpost.

Now that an outpost has been established, we want to place extractors down to suck up the minerals we're after. You'll either have the basic version available, or if you've been doing research, you can use the more advanced variants. Extractors require tungsten, aluminium, and iron to build and need power to run. Put down around five to start off with, and then start placing solar arrays or wind turbines for the power needed for the extractors. There's no atmosphere on Kurtz of Zamka so you'll need solar arrays, but use whichever method works best for the planets you've chosen.

Next you need storage containers for the resources you're extracting, and they require aluminium, iron and an adaptive frame to construct. Again, you may have better variants depending on the research you've done. Put a whole bunch down and connect them to one another. Then connect your extractors to the storage containers and you've got a planet dedicated to mining aluminium.

The final touches are a transfer container that requires tungsten, lubricant, and iron, and a landing pad which you need zero wire, iron, adaptive frame, and beryllium to build. Attach your storage containers to your transfer container. Meanwhile, your ship should appear on the landing pad once it's built. Now you can transfer resources from the outpost to your ship's cargo hold.

It's also worth setting up an industrial workbench at outposts so you can craft anything you might need on the fly. Repeat these steps on Zamka - or your other planet of choice - so you have an iron mining planet all set up. Drop a chair down and rest so that your containers full up and then craft adaptive frame at your workbench. We'll need these to make storage in the later steps.

Step 4: setting up Starfield XP farming

Our next destination is the Rasalhague system and the planet Rasalhague 2 which is rich in nickel and cobalt. Of course, you can choose a different planet but those are the resources we need now. Kibbles Gaming suggests making an outpost in an area that straddles both nickel and cobalt deposits for efficient extraction of the two resources. You'll be able to choose a good spot once you've scanned.

Set up your extractors and power generators as usual, as well as storage containers and an industrialworkbench. Connect one set to nickel extractors and one set to your cobalt extractors. We don't need the landing pad or transfer container here. Bear in mind that if there are animals on the planet, you might want to set up some defences as the last step is going to involve a time transition, in case your equipment gets damaged and you won't be around for repairs.

Step 5: Starfield XP exploit time

Resource gathering in Starfield works off of UT (universal time) so waiting around on a chair on your mining planet isn't going to get the output we want. We have to travel to somewhere familiar to get the time transition we're after to make this Starfield XP exploit worthwhile. Head to the Sol star system where you'll find our very own solar system. It's next to Alpha Centauri. Land on Venus, which mimics the real thing to some extent, with one full rotation (a day) taking hundreds of days elsewhere. In this case, 24 local hours on Venus is equal to 2,400 hours UT.

Take a seat and wait for 24 hours - 100 days will pass on Rasalhague 2 in the meantime. Your extractors will have filled up your storage during this time. Revisit Rasalhague 2 (or your nickel/ cobalt planet) and your containers should be stuffed.

Use the industrial workbench to rustle up some of the isocentered magnet which need nickel and cobalt to build. Spam-make this item, producing 99 (the max available) at a time. You get 100XP every time you do this, so if you can do this process quickly, you'll be clocking up around 20k XP per minute.

The Mirror takes a look at the sinister world of dodgy dog breeding as bully-type puppies are being poorly bred and kept in a semi-comatose state trapped in darkness, trained on treadmills and forced to fight for social media

Extreme dog breeding is big business and profit-driven breeders are continuing to put their wealth over animal welfare in order to cash in - with dodgy dealers earning up to £250k salaries. Devastatingly, this often means mating and selling untrained crossbreeds that have the power to kill after putting them through their paces with treadmill training and leaving them alone in dark rooms.

When not looked after properly, these poorly bred yet powerful dogs can attack other pets and people, as we've increasingly seen in recent times. Of the 10 fatal dog attacks in the UK last year, more than half of them involved the controversial American XL bully.

It seems a cult has formed around bull breeds online, with an increasingly close relationship highlighted between organised crime and dog dealing. Careless and uneducated dealers are breeding dangerous dogs, and little is being done about it.

With American XL bullies making headlines after another viciously attacked an 11-year-old girl last weekend, and Home Secretary Suella Braverman pushing for an urgent ban on what looks like an uncontrollable breed, the Mirror takes a look into the depraved and dark world of dangerous backyard breeders - from training puppies on treadmills to forcing them to fight against each other.

Criminal gangs cashing in

Last year, a Mirror investigation found that new dog dealers were being encouraged to make ""monsters"" out of powerful dogs to earn up to £250,000. The RSPCA said it had seen animals kept in ""medieval"" conditions, with ""breeding bitches kept in darkness or living in their own faeces"" by money-grabbing breeders, making hundreds and thousands of pounds.

The dog breeding craze, which erupted during the pandemic, has caused the ""perfect storm for dog bites"". It prompted the arrival of pet 'fertility clinics', offering training on how to become a DIY breeder at home; and dog semen was found being posted with artificial insemination (AI) kits sent by post. Illegal ear cropping was also discovered being offered by crooks online, specifically to give XL bullies the American 'look'.

A gang from Stoke-on-Trent was jailed in 2022 after puppies were found in a semi-comatose state after cropping their ears. RSPCA chief vet Caroline Allen said at the time: ""Ear cropping has absolutely no positive effect on the dog themself and is done purely for cosmetic reasons because someone wants a specific 'tough' look for their dog. Sadly, it's a trend that, despite being illegal, seems to be growing in popularity.""

Ian Briggs, from the RSPCA's special operations unit, previously spoke out about the so-called cottage breeders ""churning out puppy after puppy after puppy and charging thousands with it with no real knowledge"". He explained: ""There are criminal gangs involved - certainly around the Bully XL market - that have obviously seen a way of coining in a huge amount of cash. They are operating outside the licensing rules.

""If you are looking at between £2,000 to £5,000 for a puppy and you get four puppies out of a dog, it's a lot of money. They are making hundreds of thousands of pounds. It's not just the XL Bullies though, there are the high value Frenchies too. It's all about turning over vast profits. But with the Bully XL if they bite you it is likely you will be seriously injured.""

Mr Briggs explained that the new market for puppy bull breeds has attracted a new wave of sellers that lack knowledge and care. ""What it's done is attract certain people to the breeding market that weren't there before because they can see so much money to be made. You can just see it coming. It's almost coming in slow motion, a tsunami of welfare issues,"" he said. He explained that these dodgy dealers are ""exploiting animals and the buyer for financial gain"".

Social media money craze

In recent years, the American XL bully business has been garnering popularity on social media platforms, with breeders swapping tips about how to 'market' your pack to make the maximum amount of money from puppies. In one YouTube video, viewers are told the UK is ""smashing"" the XL bully market and you can get puppies younger than eight weeks - which is against the advice of Lucy's Law in the UK.

A dealer online says: ""We've been in the bully game for over a year now and have got a bit of knowledge that we can guide you and help you on your way to raise monsters and make ker-ching."" His sidekick adds: ""Step One is picking your right stud, knowing what you are buying... do your research."" The dog dealers say that marketing is ""super important"" and ""it's all about status"" - rather than the welfare of the animal.

Sickening fighting pits

Dog fighting was banned along with all other animal fighting in 1835, and yet illegal dog fights have soared by almost a half since Covid, fuelled by a sickening stream of online videos. The RSPCA was called to 330 fights last year compared to 226 in 2019. And this year, numbers are on track to be even higher with 149 savage encounters recorded up to May.

The RSPCA runs stings to take down the violent and disturbing groups at the top level of this disgusting spectacle. The fights - some reported to be worth up to £50,000 - pit dog against dog until one dies or can no longer fight. They are said to attract heavy betting and guns and drugs are often found at the secret venues. Ian Muttitt, a chief inspector with the RSPCA, said earlier this year that technology now allows these fights to be organised easily and discreetly.

The charity believe backyard breeding and an explosion in demand for bully-type dogs is feeding lower-level fighting, such as chain contests in parks. And they say this is directly linked to the growing number of aggressive ""status"" dogs on the streets. Mr Muttitt said youngsters often start with an interest in ""status"" dogs and progress to the top levels of fighting. Coupled with the rising number of violent videos it was causing a ""perfect storm"".

He was also concerned about algorithms fuelling interest in fighting after it had been viewed once online. He advised: ""If you see a fight in a park or a public place contact the police and the RSPCA but do not get directly involved. Other tell-tale signs would be a lot of dogs coming and going from a property. If people are keeping dogs locked up and away from public view, or if people hear reports of dog fighting going on in their area, they can report things anonymously to Crimestoppers or to the RSPCA.""

Dog treadmills for training

Before pitting them against each other, dodgy dog breeders are tethering terriers to makeshift treadmills and forcing them to run for their life - training to either kill or be killed in the brutal fighting bloodsport. This hideous set-up was discovered in a raid this week, when the Mirror joined the RSPCA and police on the covert operation to take down a suspected dog fighting ring.

West Midlands Police said two men, aged 30 and 32, were arrested under section 8 of the Animal Welfare Act and five dogs were seized from a property in Saltley, Birmingham on Tuesday. Dogs, drugs and a machete were pulled from the house on a quiet residential road, and a huge medieval-type contraption was also wheeled onto the street.

As daylight broke, it became clear it was a dog treadmill. Such treadmills are commonly used to train fighting dogs, building both strength and stamina. A spokesperson for West Midlands Police said: ""Along with the dogs, officers found dog training equipment and books about dog breeding as well as a machete and a quantity of suspected Class A drugs.""

'Vicious' behavioural problems

American bullies and their variants can fetch as much as £6,000 on online marketplaces, and thousands of them are currently being listed across the UK for anybody to buy without checks. There are currently 1,303 American bully dogs and puppies for sale on Freeads, while on Pets4Homes, there are 866 puppies being sold. Meanwhile, on gumtree there are 163 XL Bullys available.

Several people currently selling bully-type dogs online allude to the animals having behavioural problems. And while some sellers don't stipulate the breed, many use the term 'not good with kids' on the listing as a codeword for a bully. One owner selling her American bully 'urgently' for £300 on Freeads described her pup, which is just 10-months-old, as being already a ""big heavy boy"". She added: ""Unfortunately my boy wasn't the right choice for my family. A big hyper dog and three young children. This isn't what I want to do but it just isn't fair on him or the kids right now.""

Another, who had originally paid £6,000 for their pocket bully - a smaller version of the American bully, said she had listed the dog on Freeads for £1000 to £1,500 after it had a fight with her other dog. One dog listing in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, for a male 15-month-old American XL bully going for £850 said it was not neutered as the vet was unable to get him upstairs to sedate him. The owner added: ""Looking for an only-dog home as can be vicious towards other dogs, hence the reason for rehoming. My older boys are 10 and he's attacked both of them mainly over food. You will need to be able to handle him as he is strong.""

Animal behaviourist Zoe Willingham told the Mirror: ""We need to look at the reasons why these dogs have attacked. Unscrupulous breeders are breeding them to be guard dogs and having these aggressive tendencies. But then they are falling into family homes as pets, which is how you end up with this situation of people trying to sell them on because they can't control them and don't know what they are taking on and not seeking advice about how to look after these dogs or keep themselves safe.""

Joseph Rindsland, head of trust and safety at Gumtree, said: ""At Gumtree, nothing is more important to us than the safety of our users and the welfare of the animals listed on our site. We pride ourselves on being a responsible platform and as a member of the Pets Advertising Advisory Group (PAAG) - the UK's trade body covering online animal sales made up of 25 welfare organisations including the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Dogs Trust, and the RSPCA among others - we will always follow Government advice and legislation. Should the Home Office move forward with a ban, our dedicated safety team would make sure that it was reflected in our posting policies. In the meantime, we would ask that all our users seriously consider the characteristics of a dog, and their needs, before agreeing to rehome a pet. We have comprehensive educational material about different breeds on our site which we would strongly recommend users read carefully.""

A spokesperson for Pets4Homes said: ""Pets4Homes takes our commitment to the safe rehoming of pets seriously. We work with responsible and vetted breeders, provide detailed breed guidelines to those considering rehoming a dog, and work closely with authorities to ensure that we adhere to all UK laws. We do not feature breeds that Defra or PAAG (the Pet Advertising Advisory Group) have a recommendation against rehoming. Should the law or recommendations change on this specific breed, we will update our policies.""

Dangerous dog capital

Figures released last year by NHS England revealed that you are almost 10 times more likely to be bitten by a dog in Knowsley, Merseyside, than the rest of Britain. Doctors in the area see more than 24 people each year with dog bites, 60 percent higher than the national average of 15. Coined the country's 'dangerous dog capital', owners are claimed to parade their XL bullies around the park and use public spaces as illegal breeding grounds at night.

Locals speak of being too frightened to walk down the street, and of being wary of taking young children out for the day. In Knowsley, one resident, who wished to remain anonymous, described the number of dangerous dogs roaming her community, including Stadt Moers Park, as ""appalling"". She said: ""There's been at least four dog-on-dog attacks recently in this park. Only the other day a dog had its throat ripped out and was left with 500 stitches. It's a miracle it survived.

""This is my fear all the time. What scares me is that it could be a child next. It's macho-ism, it's young men who own these dogs. You have all these bullies going around, all these pitbull crosses, and they rule the roost, they do what they want to do."" The resident added: ""They have even been here breeding the dogs of a night.""

Resident Kathy Brogan, 71, said the situation made her reconsider where she can take her three-year-old grandson, Finn, and pet dog. She said: ""It makes us wary of where we walk. You do hear about dogs attacking kids and dogs attacking other dogs in Knowsley. There was a child attacked just the other day. We get a lot of people with powerful dogs, some of them off the lead, and it's frightening."" Less than five miles away, in St Helens, attacks average 19 per year. Two children have lost their lives.

One St Helens woman told of being attacked by a Rottweiler last year. The 47-year-old, who did not want to be named, said: ""The girl had to punch her own dog in the head several times to get it off me. It was trying to rip my arm off. I thought I was going to bleed out."" The woman, who had to have surgery, said she was haunted by physical and mental scars. She said: ""The number of powerful breeds in the area is scary. The scales are heavily tipped towards the larger breeds and I think it's incredibly irresponsible. I have no issue with specific breeds but know how to handle it if you are going to get one, don't put us all at risk.""

Danger Dogs - our demands

The Mirror is calling for these changes:

1. The overhaul of the Dangerous Dogs Act . An urgent review of the law is needed and tougher penalties should be considered.

2. Enforce the rules to stop the illegal and irresponsible breeding and selling of dogs.

3. A public information campaign to promote the importance of responsible dog ownership and the need for training.

The Mirror is demanding more robust sanctions as part of its Time for Action on Dangerous Dogs campaign. We want a new Jack Lis Law to end the maulings - named in honour of the boy killed in November 2021. The Mirror is calling for an urgent review of the law on dangerous dogs and tougher penalties, as well as proper enforcement of rules to stop the illegal and irresponsible breeding and selling of dogs. We also want the Government to launch a public information campaign to promote responsible dog ownership and the need for training.

Our Yorkshire Farm fans were concerned when shepherdess Amana Owen shared snaps of her children playing on a frozen river at Ravenseat as the country battles sub-zero temperatures

Amanda Owen worried some of her fans after posting pictures of her kids playing on a frozen lake.

The Yorkshire Farm star, 48, shared snaps of her brood out on the river at Ravenseat as the country battles sub-zero temperatures.

In the pictures, her daughters look like they're having a whale of a time, skating along the frozen stream, wrapped up against the cold.

But some fans thought the ice was too dangerous for them to be playing on.

However, taking to Twitter, Amanda told her 200k followers: ""Been slipping & skating around all week, but these lot have been doing it for fun.

""The water is incredibly shallow, only wet feet would result if the ice broke.""

Other fans praised Amanda for letting her children have fun, saying: ""Looks like they're having a fabulous time! I'm sure you wouldn't let them skate on anything that looks remotely unsafe"".

The pictures come after a tough start to the year in which Amanda gets used to life without Clive after the couple announced they'd split last year.

The mother-of-nine shares Raven, Reuben, Miles, Edith, Violet, Sidney, Annas, Clementine and Nancy, aged from 21 to five with her estranged-husband and admitted farming life had its challenges.

Speaking to us about her new show Farming Lives in which she visits farm across the country, she said: ""Life has its challenges, whether that's in media-land or on the farm. You have to adapt and change over time, don't you?

""It's never easy, it's different challenges. But I must admit I do like being a part of their journey as they grow up and seeing them develop.

""Raven is away at university doing a Masters now, Reuben's working independently and loving it, Miles has left school and is working at home. It brings in new people and keeps you on your toes. I hope it keeps me young.""

With her stunning looks and outdoor lifestyle, Amanda looks years younger than her age.

She's usually seen in wellies and without a scrap of make-up - but did confess she loves a false eyelash.

""I enjoy being not what people expect,"" she revealed.

""I hate the idea of stereotyping. I might be 6ft 2in and work on the farm, but I can wear heels, stick on false eyelashes and be totally happy talking to a bunch of hill farmers while I'm doing it.""

563,"Baked beans could be grown in Britain for first time after scientists' discovery","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/baked-beans-could-grown-britain-30252834","Baked beans could be grown in Britain for first time after scientists' discovery

Thousands of tonnes of dried haricot beans are imported to the UK each week by the major brands - but all that could change with new hope for growers

Farmers and scientists are optimistic Britain can start growing our own baked beans.

Until now, it has been impossible for farmers to grow the haricot variety used for baked beans in the UK because of our climate.

But scientists have developed a seed they hope will allow the plants to thrive after a 12-year project.

""It's crazy shipping a bean halfway around the world,"" Prof Tim Lang said.

Thousands of tonnes of dried haricot beans are imported to the UK each week by the major brands, coming from the US, Canada, Ethiopia and China.

""It's the first commercial scale planting of a variety of haricot beans that could end up in a can on everybody's supper table,"" said Andrew Ward, the farmer growing the beans in Lincolnshire.

""At the moment we don't have any beans that are grown here that are suitable for baked beans, our climate isn't right for producing this type of bean.""

The seeds sown mark the latest phase of the research by the University of Warwick who developed seeds which can be sown in early May and harvested as a dry grain before mid-September, matching the UK's warmer months.

Prof Eric Holub, from the university's Life Sciences department, said: ""The work that I have been involved with started in 2011, but actually it was inherited material that had been used here on the university farm in the 1970s and 80s.

""It was put into storage, and it was 2011 that I realised that there was some valuable material and I started reviving it.""

A smaller scale trial in 2022 failed due to the summer heatwave, with hopes this current crop being grown in Leadenham near Lincoln will be ready to harvest in late August.

""We've seen empty supermarket shelves over the last few months"", said Mr Ward.

""That's down to the problem that we don't grow enough of our food, ourselves, here.""

Some health food brands have attempted to market British-grown fava beans as ""˜baked beans', but they have lacked mass appeal due to the difference in taste to haricots.

Prof Lang from City, University of London, said it was ""very important"" the project succeeded.

""It has been a desperate desire of the British food industry and baked bean manufacturers to have a British baked bean for decades,"" he said.

""When I started in food policy 40 years ago, people were wanting this.

""It's crazy shipping a little bean halfway round the world just to put it in a tin can with some tomato sauce.""

Today in the UK we get through more than two million cans of baked beans every day...more than the rest of the world.

The Heinz factory in Wigan - the largest baked bean factory in the world - makes more than three million cans of beans every 24 hours.

They were first introduced in 1901 by an American man, Henry Heinz, owner of the Heinz food company.

In 1905, Mr Heinz started to advertise his baked beans as the perfect pre-cooked meal at the end of a long day in a factory. They were instantly popular.

Baked beans get their name because the raw haricot beans are baked in tomato sauce while inside the can.

Originally the recipe included small pieces of pork, however during World War 2, they became vegetarian because of meat rationing.

Joe Thompson had been a classic yo-yo dieter for most of his life but when he was too big to be able to do up his seatbelt on a rollercoaster and told to get off he knew he had to do something - now the 35-year-old has been named Slimming World's Mr Sleek

A former yo-yo dieter who was once too big to ride a rollercoaster has finally lost weight for good after joining his local Slimming World group.

Joe Thompson is now 5st 3.5lbs lighter and has been named Slimming World's Mr Sleek 2023.

The 35-year-old from Essex said: ""I'd struggled with my weight for most of my life. I was adopted at birth, so I found it hard looking different to the rest of my family - I convinced myself that I had the ""˜fat gene'.

""Leaving home for university meant I was away from my mum's healthy cooking, relying heavily on takeaways and drinking more than I ever had before. During this time, I was also figuring out my sexuality and realised I wasn't straight. I struggled to come to terms with this and sought comfort in food.

""I had many embarrassing moments over the years - one that sticks in my head was an incident at Thorpe Park where I couldn't fasten the safety harness on the Colossus ride. I had to get off and walk past a queue of people, who I'm sure all knew exactly why I couldn't ride. I tried to brush it off, but inside I was completely mortified.""

Joe, who lives in Buckhurst Hill with his husband Gareth, continues: ""I also suffered from chronic podagra. I'd have a flare-up every four to six weeks - during which time I'd be in a

lot of pain and sometimes unable to walk for a couple of days. Gareth also used to complain about my very loud snoring, which must have been linked to my weight because he doesn't mention it anymore!""

Although Joe was worried about his weight and wanted to change, he found himself trapped in a cycle of yo-yo dieting.

He said: ""For about two years I cut out all carbohydrates and while I did lose a lot of weight I found it really restrictive, and I was miserable.

""I also put all of the weight back on when I started eating normally again. I felt like I was always on or off a diet, and I'd never found a way to lose weight sensibly and sustainably. I was a classic yo-yo dieter.""

Joe's turning point came when he saw photographs of himself after attending a number of back-to-back weddings.

He said: ""I really hated having photographs taken by other people. I'd become quite good at angling the camera so I looked slimmer or cropping out my body so you wouldn't notice my weight as much.

""I even used apps to edit my photographs to appear slimmer. So, when the photos came back from my friends' weddings, I was shocked. I couldn't believe it was me in the pictures and I just felt terrible. I think I'd become so used to editing my photographs that it really hit home to see the ""˜real' me.""

Joe had heard a lot about Slimming World but was sceptical about the plan, especially given that it was a lot more flexible than methods he had tried in the past.

He said: ""I joined my local Slimming World group just a few days after I'd seen those photographs from the weddings. I have to say when I learned about the eating plan I was pretty cynical - I couldn't see how I'd be able to lose weight without cutting carbs or counting calories.

I decided the only way to find out was to put my faith in the plan and I was soon eating my words - I lost 11½lbs in my first week! From that day forward I haven't had any more reservations, and I'm living proof the plan works.""

With Slimming World's Food Optimising eating plan, members can choose freely from more than 350 healthy foods, including lean meat and poultry, eggs, fat-free dairy, pasta, rice, grains, fruit and veg - without weighing, counting or measuring. By satisfying their appetite

with this Free Food, which forms the basis of hundreds of everyday meals, slimmers can reduce calories without counting them, lose weight without feeling hungry, personalise the plan to their dietary requirements and enjoy the foods they love.

Weighing almost 20 stone, Joe felt nervous about joining his local Slimming World group, though soon realised he had nothing to fear.

He said: ""I texted my Slimming World Consultant Lorna in advance and she was so lovely, so that made me feel better. After a few weeks I really threw myself into the group setting and soon found the support of my fellow members to be fundamental to my success. It was like nothing I'd ever experienced before.

I wasn't alone anymore and that was such a wonderful feeling. I'm now help out each week at group and have made some lifelong friends.

""I love that the plan allows me to eat to satisfy my appetite. I had tried calorie counting before, so being able to lose weight without measuring and weighing everything is so freeing.

Before, I'd panic about ""˜running out' of calories and ending up hungry. With Slimming World that never happens because there's always something substantial to eat when you are hungry. It was totally revolutionary for me.""

As Joe began to lose weight, he found that his mobility and energy levels increased, which encouraged him to start thinking about getting more active.

He said: ""I used to be quite sporty as a kid, but my podagra meant that I'd become really sedentary over the years. As my symptoms started to ease and the flare ups became less frequent, I started to do more exercise.

""I love walking - I find it's as good for your mental wellbeing as it is fo your physical health.""

Joe soon got on board with Slimming World's Body Magic physical activity support programme.

He said: ""I loved that it gave you a framework to build up your activity levels gradually and there wasn't any pressure. As I became fitter I started walking with a 30kg weighted vest. It's amazing to think I used to carry extra weight around like that every day!""

Now that he's transformed his own health, Joe's next mission is to inspire other people to follow in his footsteps by sharing his journey on social media.

He said: ""I love when someone tells me that they have joined Slimming World because they have been inspired by my success. I wish I could tell everyone that losing weight doesn't have to be miserable and boring - and that by joining a group you'll always have the support you need to achieve your goals. I'm done with the yo-yo diets because I've finally found a way to live healthily, for the long term.""

Amanda Owen, who rose to fame starring on her farming reality show Our Yorkshire Farm, debuted her glam new look on ITV's Lorraine today as she opens up about co-parenting with her estranged husband Clive

Amanda Owen debuted her glam new look on Lorraine today, as she opened up about co-parenting with Clive.

The Our Yorkshire Farm star appeared on the ITV morning show today as she discussed her split from her husband and how they manage to co-parent and continue to look after the farm. She confirmed Clive is still living nearby.

However, fans of the show were left distracted as they noticed Amanda's very glam look as she chatted about the importance of taking time for herself and making sure she was able to practice self-care and focus on herself alongside raising her large family.

Speaking about co-parenting with Clive, she confirmed he was living next door, before adding: ""It's not a big story. I feel there's so many people in similar situations. That's the reality, we all have to get on with it. There's the animals to look after, the childcare.""

Amanda looked very glamorous during her appearance on the ITV morning show today, as she also chatted about her self-care and how she prioritises herself despite looking after the whole farm and juggling parenting too.

""I am content. You do have to take a little time for yourself. Even if I'm going to be feeding the sheep, I put my moisturiser on and mascara on, it's self-care,"" she said of her new routine following her split.

Amanda previously explained to The Mirror that her kids coped fine when she was away as she opened up about the ""different challenges"" she has faced as a parent over the year, joking she hopes parenthood keeps her young.

She said: ""Years of training means they're fine. The nature of what we do means there's always something to be done, so they can bake, cook, even tidy up - usually when I give them a warning that I'm coming back!

""It's never easy, it's different challenges. But I must admit I do like being a part of their journey as they grow up and seeing them develop. Raven is away at university doing a Masters now, Reuben's working independently and loving it, Miles has left school and is working at home. It brings in new people and keeps you on your toes. I hope it keeps me young.""

She also insisted she loves getting glammed up, but is happy to balance both parts of her life.

Asked if she enjoys the showbiz side of her life aswell, she added: ""Of course I do, although I think at the moment I'd need a very big scrub and a manicure! I enjoy being not what people expect. I hate the idea of stereotyping. I might be 6ft 2in and work on the farm, but I can wear heels, stick on false eyelashes and be totally happy talking to a bunch of hill farmers while I'm doing it!""

A city has been named the 'stinkiest' place after receiving 1000 smell complaints every year.

The place with the most complaints about stenches last year was has been revealed as Stoke-on-Trent City Council

It notched-up 860 complaints about smell last year and has the honour of being the stinkiest authority in England.

The complaints average almost two and a half per day, and the Staffordshire city helped make it a one-two for the West Midlands, joined by Birmingham, with the second city receiving a total of 649.

In the top 10 of all the locations which were the 'stinkiest places' in England, the cities also included Westminster, Leeds and Swindon were also listed in the chart.

Claire Watson, an odour expert at Airmatic which carried out the study, said bad smells can affect our health.

She said: ""Odour complaints are a direct result of air pollution in an area.

""This can have a negative effect on the health and well-being of the residents in such areas with them breathing in air pollutants.

""These can enter our bloodstream and contribute to coughing or itchy eyes and cause or worsen many respiratory conditions.

""Aside from the physical health impacts, there are also the negative mental effects on residents living day to day exposed to such odours.""

Other cities which also took a place on the list included the cities of Portsmouth, Bradford and Nottingham,.

Three London boroughs were also represented in Westminster, Kensington, Chelsea and Bexley - which gathered 1,694 complaints in total

There were other areas, however, which scored low in smell complaints.

The fewest number of odour complaints were recorded in Yorkshire which had 42, followed East Riding in Yorkshire with just 66 complaints.

There was one location, Norwich, which had the honour of being the nicest-smelling location with zero reports of bad smells.

Businesses need Environment Agency permits if their work falls into manufacturing, agriculture and energy sectors and have any activity which can pollute air, water or land.

The top two places with the highest number of complaints about businesses in these areas were the West Midlands and London.

For every 28 businesses operating there was one complaint in three sectors in the West Midlands area and one for every 54 in London.

In 2021 The Mirror reported how residents in 'Britain's smelliest village' claimed the stench coming from a landfill site is causing an ""off-the-scale environmental disaster"".

In February, locals reported a nauseating eggy stench like ""rotting flesh"" or ""dirty nappies"" coming from Walleys Quarry in Silverdale, Staffordshire.

Angry residents have been forced to tape up their doors and put bags over their windows to try to stop the vile smell getting into their homes.

Some say the so-called The Silverdale Stink is so unpleasant it burns the back of their throat.

Others have reported headaches, asthma attacks, stress, anxiety and sleeplessness and are demanding something is done about the problem in Newcastle-under-Lyme.

Joe Thompson weighed 19 stone when he was told to get off the Colossus ride at Thorpe Park. The 35-year-old man has now lost five stone and eight inches off his 40-inch waist

A man has said he was inspired to lose weight after being told to get off a rollercoaster at Thorpe Park as he was ""too big"" to ride on it.

Joe Thompson, 35, lost five stone and eight inches off his 40-inch waist. after making a drastic lifestyle change.

The former yo-yo dieter weighed 19 stone when he was told to get off the Colossus ride at the theme Park in Surrey as the safety harness wouldn't close around his belly.

Mr Thompson said he had to get off the rollercoaster and walk past a queue of people, which initially made him feel ""completely mortified"" - but then motivated him to lose weight.

He said: ""I couldn't fasten the safety harness on the Colossus ride. I had to get off and walk past a queue of people, who I'm sure all knew exactly why I couldn't ride.

""I tried to brush it off, but inside I was completely mortified.""

His motivation pushed him to swap a bacon and sausage bap breakfast for poached eggs on wholemeal bread and instant noodles for lunch with a healthy veg soup.

Joe also replaced his sedentary lifestyle, made worse by gout, by going on long walks with a 30kg weighted vest to keep off the pounds.

Gout is a type of arthritis that causes sudden, severe joint pain, explains the NHS.

Getting to a healthy weight and eating a balanced diet can help manage the condition.

Before his diet Joe's chronic gout meant he suffered from ""flare-ups"" every month and on some days he couldn't even walk.

But now, Joe has been dubbed Slimming World's 2023 Mr Sleek after joining the Woodford Green group in London to help him with his weight loss challenge.

He understood he needed to lose weight after seeing photos from back-to-back weddings he had attended in the summer of 2021.

He had taken to using photo editing apps to create the illusion of a slimmer man.

Joe said: ""I really hated having photographs taken by other people.

""I'd become quite good at angling the camera so I looked slimmer or cropping out my body so you wouldn't notice my weight as much.

""So, when the photos came back from my friends' weddings, I was shocked. I couldn't believe it was me in the pictures and I just felt terrible.""

He joined Slimming World weeks later in November 2021, saying: ""I struggled with my weight for most of my life. I was adopted at birth, so I found it hard looking different to the rest of my family - I convinced myself that I had the ""˜fat gene'.

""Leaving home for university meant I was away from my mum's healthy cooking, relying heavily on takeaways and drinking more than I ever had before.

""During this time, I was also figuring out my sexuality and realised I wasn't straight. I struggled to come to terms with this and sought comfort in food.""

Joe had tried cutting carbs for years which he found too restrictive, making him ""miserable"", whilst calorie counting caused panic as he ran out of calories and went to bed hungry.

He continued: ""With Slimming World that never happens because there's always something substantial to eat when you are hungry.

""I love that the plan allows me to eat to satisfy my appetite. It was totally revolutionary for me.""

He is now inspiring others by documenting his journey on social media. Follow him on Instagram at @joeyjoejoe__sw

Breakfast: Bacon and sausage sandwich with butter and ketchup

Mid-morning: Tube of crisps

Lunch: Pack of instant noodles topped with extra cheese

Location Location Location star Phil Spencer was left devastated back in August when his beloved dad Richard, 89, and mum Anne, 82, died when their car careered into a river

An inquest has opened into death of TV presenter Phil Spencer' s beloved dad Richard David Edward Spencer, 89, who died on August 18 2023 at Queen Elizabeth Queen Mother hospital in Margate, Kent.

Richard died from a lung injury after his car overturned in a river, a coroner has said. The farmer was rushed to hospital after he nearly drowned, but he never regained consciousness, the inquest heard.

In August, Location Location Location star Phil's parents were killed in a car crash after a tragic accident on the family farm saw them career into a river. The TV presenter's dad Richard, 89, and mum Anne, 82, died when their car careered into a river. They were on their way to a pub for lunch when their car veered off the access road into a shallow tributary river running through their estate in Littlebourne, near Canterbury, Kent.

At the time, emergency services attended the scene, including an air ambulance. Richard and Anne were pulled from the car and taken to hospital. Sadly Richard was pronounced dead and Anne died later. A woman, in her 60s now revealed by Phil to be a carer for the couple, was also in the car and suffered minor injuries.

At Maidstone County Hall on Monday, Sarah Clarke opened the inquest into the death of Richard David Edward Spencer and said he died of aspiration pneumonitis, which is a lung injury.

Mr Spencer and his wife Anne Spencer both died after the crash as they were on their way to lunch on August 18, 2023, Phil Spencer previously said.

Ms Clarke said at around 12.20pm on August 18, Mrs Spencer was driving her Toyota car with Mr Spencer in the front passenger seat, and their full-time live-in carer sitting in the rear of the car.

They drove from their house towards a river and as their vehicle approached the bridge, it tipped over the edge and overturned, Ms Clarke said.

The trio were submerged in around three feet of water, she added. Paramedics arrived at around 12.57pm and took Mr Spencer and Mrs Spencer to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother hospital in Margate.

Phil remained silent online as the tragic news of his parents' passing broke. However, a week later, he took to his Instagram page to share a sweet photo of the pair as he paid a heartbreaking tribute to his beloved parents while candidly sharing further details of the tragic accident.

The emotive photo of Phil's late parents showed his beloved mother and father matching in blue striped tops as his mum Anne and dad Richard posed behind a half-opened stable door and smiled at the lens. The lengthy and heartfelt tribute in the caption began: ""Very sadly both of my amazing parents died on Friday. As a family we are all trying to hold onto the fact Mum and Dad went together and that neither will ever have to mourn the loss of the other one. Which is a blessing in itself.""

Phil explained his mum and dad had been on ""extremely good form"" before the tragic accident - despite his mum Parkinson's diagnosis while his dad had dementia. In a poignant and tear jerking comment, Phil said how his mother had commented the week before their death that they will ""probably go together"".

He wrote: ""Although they were both on extremely good form in the days before (hence the sudden idea to go out to lunch), Mums Parkinson's and Dads Dementia had been worsening and the long term future was set to be a challenge. So much so that Mum said to me only a week ago that she had resigned to thinking ""now it looks like we will probably go together"". And so they did. That was what God had planned for them - and it was a good plan.""

Phil then shared details of the tragic accident as he said the car had been travelling 'very slowly' but 'toppled over a bridge on the farm drive' and landed 'upside down into the water'. He added how his beloved parents had 'no physical injuries' and said he thinks the pair 'quietly slipped away'.

""The car, going very slowly, toppled over a bridge on the farm drive, upside down into the river. There were no physical injuries and I very much doubt they would have even fought it - they would have held hands under the water and quietly slipped away,"" he said. ""Their carer was in the car and managed to climb out of a back window so the alarm was raised quite quickly.""

Phil added how, after the alarm was raised, his brother, Robert, 'pulled them out of the river' but they were unable to be saved. He said: ""As many farmers do - my brother had a penknife and so was able to cut the seat belts - he pulled them out of the river but they never regained consciousness. Although desperately sad and shocked beyond all belief - all family are clear that if there can ever be such a thing as having a ""good end"" - this was it.""

Speaking of his grief and shock over the heartbreaking incident, he added: ""It feels horrendous right now, but after almost 60 years of marriage - to die together on the farm they so loved will, I know, be a comfort in the future. Mum Dad are together which is precisely where they would have wanted to be.""

Richard and Anne first locked eyes at a New Year's Eve party in Canterbury in the early 1960s and tied the knot at Canterbury Cathedral on November 4, 1964. David studied engineering at Loughborough University, and after working in finance in London for a while, decided to opt for a different life altogether, buying Upper Garrington Farm.

In recent years, Richard was living with dementia, while Anne suffered from mild Parkinson's disease. The couple continued to enjoy village life in their late years, however, and were both dedicated supporters of Littlebourne's St Vincent's Church. David had also been president of Littlebourne Scouts, while Anne had only recently given up her passion for riding horses following a fall.

Four teenagers from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, Jevon Hirst, 16, Harvey Owen, 17, Wilf Fitchett, 17, and Hugo Morris, 18, travelled to Eryri (Snowdonia) National Park for a camping trip but tragically never returned home

The owner of a farm where four teenagers tragically died in a car crash described the ""brutal"" conditions that saw them leave the road and smash into a water-filled ditch.

Farmer Rhys Williams lives at Garreg Hyll Drem Farm, just 25 metres from the ditch where four bodies were found at 10am on November 21, earlier this week. Jevon Hirst, 16, Harvey Owen, 17, Wilf Fitchett, 17, and Hugo Morris, 18, all studied at the same college and lived in Shrewsbury, Shropshire.

They had headed out on a camping trip in the picturesque Eryri (Snowdonia) National Park, but failed to return home, leaving loved ones raising the alarm. This led to a desperate manhunt as family and friends feared the worst before a passing binman spotted the silver Ford Fiesta they had been travelling in.

Mr Williams described the ""brutal"" conditions the teenagers were driving through when they went missing and their car plunged off a windy country road and overturned in a flooded ditch. It is not known when the fatal accident took place. Mr Williams said they were ""so unlucky"" to have left the road on a sharp bend, flipping their vehicle into a ditch that was flooded by two days of rain.

He told The Mirror: ""It was brutal on Sunday. There's always a foot or two of water in the ditch but it can come up to six feet, the level of the car. It was bad on Friday and Saturday, the river had gone high quickly. But by Tuesday morning the level had come down. They were so unlucky. They could have hit a tree or a fence and gone in another way.""

The farmer continued: ""They were found by the recycling lorry at 10 that morning. They were higher up, that's why they could see them. The binman told us they had phoned the police. It is only 25 metres around the corner from here. I could see the car but I didn't see anything else.

""They must have been going from Harlech north towards Snowdonia. This is one of two roads they could have taken. There are no tracks on the road, nothing to be seen. It's a sharp bend, it narrows. There were lots of leaves on that corner. There have been one or two accidents there before.""

The Fiesta was removed from the scene on Tuesday evening. But officers returned to search the area by torchlight on Wednesday morning. Mr Williams explained how at least two buses and possible other cars would have driven past the crash site, none the wiser. He added: ""They were so unlucky, the way the car went in. It has gone into the ditch, low into the ditch. It's a small car. I went past and didn't see anything. Two buses would have gone past before 10am and not seen anything.

""They would have been there all Monday. You have got to be in a high vehicle to see anything and you have got to be looking, a passenger. The driver would have been looking at the road. The binman who saw it said that something caught his eye. He was on his phone and he looked over. You would struggle to see from a car. Some networks have no signal here. EE is good, but Vodafone is not good. On Sunday the water was high.""

Doug Inglis and Jenny Gussee, both 62, emptied a bottle of bear spray while out with their dog in Banff National Park in Canada when all three were horrifically killed

A harrowing final message sent by a couple just moments before they were mauled to death by a grizzly bear has been revealed by devastated family members.

In their final moments, Doug Inglis and Jenny Gusse, both 62, emptied an entire bottle of bear spray as they were mauled by the massive bear while out with their dog in Banff National Park in Canada. All three were horrifically killed. The couple, who were seasoned backcountry campers, sent an alarming message at around 8pm on Friday to Doug's uncle, Colin Inglis, which said ""bear attack bad.""

Parks Canada was made aware of the alert straight away but they were unable to send a helicopter due to hazardous weather. However, when they eventually arrived at 1am, they tragically found Doug, Jenny, and their Border Collie, Tris, lying dead next to two empty cans of bear spray.

The grizzly old female bear, who was discovered nearby, was shot dead after charging at park officials. Banff National Park, which attracts more than four million tourists every year, is home to both grizzly and black bears. Heartbroken Colin told CBC the couple were simply ""in the wrong place at the wrong time"", he said: ""That night was a start, obviously, of what's continuing to be a grieving process. You have that notification, you know that something bad is happening. You don't have a lot of information.""

Colin said he was informed that the couple had tried to scare off the bear, according to signs left at the site. He was told that a bear spray canister had been fully emptied. Officials at the parks report the couple had hung their food in the appropriate manner so as to not attract bears, and two cans of bear spray were found at the scene.

Colin added: ""There was a struggle and the struggle didn't stay in one place. But, in the end, both bodies were back together.""

Colin paid tribute to the pair, who loved being in the outdoors and had a real passion for adventure. The couple met at university and studied to be scientists before working together at the same lab for Agriculture Canada. He added: ""I was hiking in Waterton with Doug in June and we were looking forward to many more adventures. As were lots of his friends.

""One of his friends told me one of the things they were looking forward to was taking their son out with Doug because he was so knowledgeable. And Jenny, she was the botanist. She could identify all these wonderful plants that were out there, this berry or this flower. And so that's the kind of love they had for the environment that they were out in.""

Kim Titchener, a bear expert and a friend of the family, revealed there are about 60 grizzly bears in Banff National Park, with fatal attacks extremely rare. ""It's really just the reason why we're seeing more attacks, which is more people heading outdoors and unfortunately not being educated on this,"" she said, adding that only 14 percent of grizzly bear attacks worldwide lead to fatalities.

""'Often when people have encounters with grizzlies, usually the grizzly goes one direction and the people go in the other,'"" Titchener added. During the last 10 years, there have been three recorded non-fatal encounters with grizzly bears in the Park.

Schoolgirl Vilte was talking to her friends when she spotted the coin in the dirt at Winstanley School in Leicestershire, which has since been dated back to 1069

A schoolgirl has made an astonishing discovery of a 1,000 year old coin from the time of William the Conqueror - right in her school playground.

Vilte, a Year 9 pupil, initially thought she had found a 5p coin but was amazed to learn she'd stumbled upon a medieval treasure dating back a millennium. The 13 year old was enjoying breaktime with friends at Winstanley School in Braunstone, Leics, when she spotted the coin on a strip of grass.

With the help of her history teacher, she discovered it was a penny from around 1069, during the reign of William the Conqueror. It's thought that the historic coin may have been unearthed when workmen replaced a lamppost on the school grounds last summer.

Vilte noticed the coin was lighter than a regular 5p and had unfamiliar markings, so she took it to her teachers. She told the BBC : ""I was just talking to some friends and it caught my eye on the floor so I sort of picked it up. I took it to my history teacher's room and said 'do you know anything about this coin, because it looks really strange, and is definitely not your ordinary coin?'""

After some research, they discovered the coin's true age. ""It was really shocking. You don't expect to find that in your school, you know. It was just a little bit of a surprise,"" Vilte added.

Headteacher Dave Bennett confirmed that experts at Leicestershire County Council had verified the coin's identity. He said: ""When Vilte found it we knew it was some interest and then when we did some more research it was verified it was from that time.

""Then we tried to work out why it was there and why Vilte had found it and nobody else had noticed it. We had just had some building work done, with a telegraph pole lifted out and back in, and it must have come from that.

""But for Vilte to find it, most people would have just ignored it I think. You think maybe you'd find something from the 1960s but to find something 1,000-years-old is just amazing. At the moment its in the safe, but we don't think it should stay there. We'd like it to be displayed in a museum with Vilte's story.""

Samantha Curtis, from the school, added: ""We believe that the coin was disturbed by some construction work which had been carried out, and was probably unearthed with some of the mud. Vilte found the coin in amongst the grass which makes finding it even more remarkable.

""We have spoken to various agencies for advice, [the] Team Manager for Heritage at Leicestershire County Council said that the coin would have been a considerable loss for whoever had dropped it, probably from a pocket or coin purse, for a farm labourer or worker at the time it would have been of high value.

""At the time when the coin was in circulation the school site would have been agricultural land or forest not far from the ancient settlement of Braunstone. Our location is close to the Fosse Way, a popular route for people travelling from Leicester to other locations.

""We hope that a local museum might be interested in the coin for one of their collections, with Vilte being credited for its discovery. But we are still currently seeking the best outcome so that the coin can be preserved in the correct atmospheric conditions to prevent corrosion.""

An interactive map that looks into the future has predicted big swathes of the UK, including parts of London, will soon be under water unless significant effort are made to try and stop climate change

Conversation around climate change has drastically shifted over the years, as its devastating impacts start to show.

Once dismissed as eco-warrior scaremongering, more and more Brits are started to get concerned about the state of the planet. In fact, figures from the Office for National Statistics show a staggering 74 per cent of adults in Great Britain aged 16 or over are worried about the current climate crisis.

A new interactive map that shows what the country could look like in 2050 has ramped up the fear. Created by climate Central, the map predicts huge parts of the country will be totally underwater in less than 30 years time, unless there is significant action to combat global warming.

Areas shaded red on the map are those lower than predicted local sea water and coastal flood protections. In a scenario in which 'moderate' reductions are made to the amount of human made pollution, and in which a 'medium' amount of luck keeps weather events on our side, great swathes of the country will be enveloped.

The worst affected parts of the UK are the east and north-east of England. A huge area of land stretching from above Cambridge all the way up the coast to Hull will be underwater.

Across the country Liverpool, Southport, Blackpool and Morcambe will also be swamped. In the south-west the River Severn will play havoc, with stretches on either side of the estuary - from Taunton up to Tekesbury and then back down to Cardiff on the northern bank - at risk of being lost to the waves.

London also looks to be in trouble. A band roughly two miles thick along The Thames will be flooded. Mercifully, Scotland and Northern Ireland look to be less seriously affected, with only small areas along rivers and in the Hebrides underwater.

The conclusion that should be drawn from viewing the map is clear: if we don't stop releasing green house gases into the air, large parts of Britain will be underwater. The data was put together in a 2020 October report entitled 'Flooded Future: Global vulnerability to sea level rise worse than previously understood'.

It revealed coastal elevation levels across wide areas are actually significantly lower than previously thought. The findings of the study by Dr Scott Kulp and Dr Benjamin Strauss, senior computational scientist and chief scientist respectively at US-based climate change research group Climate Central, were published in a peer-reviewed paper in the scientific journal 'Nature Communications'.

They said in the report: ""As humanity pollutes the atmosphere with greenhouse gases, the planet warms. And as it does so, ice sheets and glaciers melt and warming sea water expands, increasing the volume of the world's oceans. The consequences range from near-term increases in coastal flooding that can damage infrastructure and crops to the permanent displacement of coastal communities.""

There is still a huge amount to play for however. By current projections, sea levels could rise between 2ft and 7ft by the end of the century. If the world moves to drastically cut the amount of pollutants dumped into the atmosphere that figure could be on the lower end of the scale.

A new frog species has been discovered deep in the mountains of Ecuador, and it was named after the author of Lord of the Rings, JRR Tolkien, because its colours make it look similar to an orc

Scientists named the cute frog Hyloscirtus tolkieni , in honour of JRR Tolkien - creator of the Middle-Earth world that features in the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.

The amazing colours of the stream frog reminded the scientists of a creature from Tolkien's world, which is famously known for its terrifying depiction of orcs.

The new species has a greyish/green back with yellow spots, as well as pale pink eyes with a black iris.

The underside of its body is largely golden yellow with black spots, while its fingers and toes have broad black and yellow stripes.

Diego F. Cisneros-Heredia, director of the Museum of Zoology of the Universidad San Francisco de Quito USFQ, said: ""The new species of frog has amazing colours, and it would seem that it lives in a universe of fantasies, like those created by Tolkien.

""The truth is that the tropical Andes are magical ecosystems where some of the most wonderful species of flora, funga, and fauna in the world are present.

""Unfortunately, few areas are well protected from the negative impacts caused by humans. Deforestation, unsustainable agricultural expansion, mining, invasive species, and climate changes are seriously affecting Andean biodiversity.""

Hyloscirtus tolkieni is a type of stream frog; a group of ambient that live in the Andes of Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia.

They tend to live most of their lives close to fresh running water in the mountains, hovering around the rocky shores' plants.

Their young tadpoles also grow up among the rocks of rapid rivers - although there's not a great deal scientists know about this particular species of stream frog.

Hyloscirtus tolkieni has only ever been spotted by one research group, which means there's only one set of information about it.

In fact, the national park where the scientists found the species was so vast, that they were trekking for weeks to find one Hyloscirtus tolkieni .

The RÃ­o Negro-Sopladora National Park in Ecuador - and the Andes in general - could hold numerous undiscovered animals. But, human-induced destruction increases the risk of these species becoming extinct before they're even spotted for the first time.

More than half of all amphibian species in Ecuador are already threatened with extinction.

Key Events

Beauty advent calendars are kind of a big deal. A luxury alternative to chocolate (although, I'll take one of those too, please), they not only add excitement to the most wonderful time of the year, but some can even save you hundreds of pounds.

I've spent the last two months researching release dates, analysing contents and working out which of this year's beauty advent calendars offer the biggest savings and best deals. Throughout the day, I'll be letting you in on everything I know about these coveted Christmas countdowns from brands like LookFantastic, ASOS, Harvey Nichols and Boots.

Speaking of Boots, it's October 4, right? That means TODAY'S THE DAY. The health and beauty retailer are launching their No7 beauty advent calendars today, and customers are sure to go wild for them. As a former Boots employee, I've seen people queuing down the street the day that they launch.

But they're not the only retailer who's calendar goes live today, with John Lewis also launching their calendar, which contains brands like Charlotte Tilbury, REN and Nars. It's some really exciting stuff, let me tell you.

As well as the latest launches, I'll be sharing some of my top shopping tips, our top picks from this year's offerings, reviews from our team of experts and much more, so let's not waste any more time and get straight into it.

Best beauty advent calendars of 2023

I could go on - there's still SO many beauty calendars we didn't get around to chatting about today, but alas they'll have to wait for another day.

In the meantime, we've wrapped up our favourite beauty advent calendars of 2023 in his handy round up. Have any of this years' Christmas countdowns caught your eye? Let us know which one you're buying and why.

The Body Shop launch THREE beauty advent calendars

This year, The Body Shop is selling three advent calendars which are each filled with a selection of its cult-favourite goodies. Beauty fans can look forward to head-to-toe skincare, beauty and wellness treats, perfect for pampering over the holidays. Prices start at £59, so you needn't spend a fortune to get a beauty-filled advent for the Christmas countdown.

Inside the £59 Advent Calendar of Change are £119 worth of The Body Shop treats - 24 of them, in fact - including a vitamin E sheet mask, mango hand balm and so much more.

While we love the goodies inside, the delightful packaging of these calendars is also worth mentioning. The pop-up beauty advents all feature little drawers, perfect for storing your favourite bits and bobs after Christmas.

Meanwhile, the £95 Advent Calendar of Wonders has earned an average rating of 4.7 stars, with many beauty fans impressed with its contents and presentation.

The most expensive countdown of the bunch has a value of £250, but it can be yours for £145. The Body Shop's Advent Calendar of Wishes & Wonders includes the Edelweiss Liquid Peel, Moringa Shampoo and Conditioner, Shea Body Butter and more beautifying wonders.

Take a look at the full contents here.

What about Space NK?

There are few retailers who know their way around luxury beauty as well as Space NK,and now the premium retailer has revealed their sixth annual Christmas countdown, rivalling the likes of Cult Beauty and Harrods.

It’s definitely one of their best value calendars to date. Back in 2018, their calendar cost £250 but was worth over £600, then in 2020, the price dropped to £195, but so too did the value, coming in at over £480. Last year, it retailed at £215 with a value of £770 - but this season’s calendar is worth over £1,000, and will be priced at £235, saving shoppers over 75 per cent on the value of the products tucked inside.

Worth over £1,000, the calendar is priced at just £235,which is essentially £7.12 per item. Some retail over £50 alone, such as the Medik8 Crystal Retinal 6 (usually £66) so you can see just how easily the value racks up.

A 100% vegan beauty advent calendar? Go on then

Back by popular demand the Holland and Barrett advent calendar features 25-days of affordable beauty products - of which 16 are full sized - that will allow customers to pamper themselves over the festive-period.

The festive calendar has been beautifully designed, with every product being 100 per cent vegan, including some of the newest launches from brands including Faith in Nature, Q+A, Ethique, VitaSkin and WILD, in addition to a host of popular Holland and Barrett products.

Inside the Holland and Barrett Beauty Advent Calendar 2023:

This year’s Beauty Advent Calendar boasts its highest value to-date and is available for a budget pleasing £45 , but is worth a whopping £179, saving customers £134 (75%) on the RRP of all included items.

The most popular beauty product in advent calendars this year is worth £71

But one thing we noticed while reviewing the countless contents of each one was that there are a few brands that crop up time and time again. It’s no bad thing, that’s for sure, it simply means they’re popular with shoppers and are likely to entice you to purchase them.

What’s more though, is that on some occasions, the exact same product was cropping up, from TikTok viral purchases to skincare sensations. So, we decided to go through the most popular beauty advent calendars for 2023 and analyse what’s inside to see which brands and products are most commonly found.

It turns out that the most frequently recurring product this year is none other than The Rich Cream from Augustinus Bader. The brand cropped up seven times throughout - almost half of the calendars we looked at - and each and every time it was the exact same product: a 15ml sample of the coveted cream.

Here’s every calendar where it features this year:

Liberty

Cult Beauty

Harvey Nichols

Harrods

Space NK

Selfridges

Fenwick

You’ll notice that all of the above are what we consider to be the high end beauty advent calendars of 2023, and that’s because The Rich Cream bumps up the value of these calendars quite dramatically, with this deluxe sample size being worth an eye watering £71. It’s not the kind of money that people can justify spending on one item, least not before Christmas, but when included in a money-saving haul of products, it’s a great way to snag it for less.

A revolutionary face cream is said to be inspired by 30 years of research and innovation, that patented 'Trigger Factor Complex' (TFC8) which ‘unlocks a code’ in your skin that repairs tissue. Considered a ‘holy grail’ by many, this formula is best-suited to those with normal to dry skin types and can help visibly reduce the signs of ageing and environmental damage.

I unboxed the ASOS beauty calendar and these are my top five picks

Already we’ve taken a peek behind the doors of the PrettyLittleThing and Revolution both having ones for under £50, as well as mid-range festive offerings from LookFantastic and M&S, while others are a little more expensive like Liberty. But if you consider yourself a fan of Charlotte Tilbury, Elemis, Sol de Janeiro and the likes, then ASOS’s beauty advent calendar might be the one to find its way into your online basket this year.

The 25-day advent calendar is priced at £90, joining the likes of Glossybox and Boots Macmillan as those under the £100 mark. The products inside are worth a whopping £397, which is around four times the price you pay, with treats spanning the self-care sphere from cosmetics and skincare to candles and hair products.

ASOS have included a great mix of best loved brands, viral sensations and newbies to discover, packaged it in a fun and exciting way, striking the ultimate balance between price and products, making ASOS’s one of the most exciting beauty advent calendars money can buy this Christmas.

The Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Dreams Luxury Palette is worth £45 alone - with this single product being worth half of the total price of the box. If that’s not enough to convince you, I don’t know what will. In fact, the value of my top five products alone exceed the price you pay for the box, rendering the other 20 items - which include the likes of Rituals, Elemis and MAC completely free.

Here are my top five picks:

REN Radiance Brightening Eye Cream mini

NEOM Travel Candle Bedtime Hero

However, when shoppers spend over £120 on the ESPA website, they also qualify for the Evening Serenity gift, worth £54, which stars a further four ESPA favourites. But it doesn’t end there because when you spend over £70 you also get to select two miniatures for free, and if you opt for the highest value ones, you can get another £45 worth of skincare for free.

We recommend choosing the Optimal Skin Pro-Serum 10ml, worth £20 and the Tri-Active Regenerating Calming CICA Cleansing Balm 50ml, worth £25, but ultimately, choose what you’re most likely to use as the other samples are still worth £10 each.

This means that in purchasing the £175 ESPA calendar , shoppers can get £99 worth of extra goodies, making the total value £518, saving 66 per cent.

My verdict on the PrettyLittleThing calendar

I'm a big fan of this calendar and consider it to be one of the best budget beauty options out there.

There are some seriously impressive brands tucked inside the PLT beauty advent calendar this year - I’m talking about the kind we’d expect to see in the likes of Cult Beauty, Space NK or LookFantastic. While the overall value is lower than these calendars at £198, it’s still almost four times the price you pay at under £50, offering shoppers the chance to get a taste of luxury without the huge price tag. I feel like £48 is a really accessible price point, and when you do the girl maths, it works out at £2 per item inside, which is incredible.

While I may have had some complaints about some duplications, there isn’t actually a single product in the PLT calendar that I wouldn’t use, and will certainly help generate excitement throughout December and ensure I have everything I need to be party ready come the 25th.

Whether you are treating yourself, or looking for the ultimate Christmas gift, the PrettyLittleThing beauty advent calendar is definitely one of the best value calendars for under £50 this year, offering more variety than some of the single-brand options available like Revolution, Soap and Glory or Ted Baker.

Bethan's top picks from the PrettyLittleThing beauty calendar:

Aroma Active Universal Repair Cream

Stila Stay All Day Smudge Stick Waterproof Eye Liner

Bondi Sands Pure Concentrated Self Tan Drops

Pixi Hello Kitty Limited Edition Glow Tonic

PrettyLittleThing pink beauty advent calendar that's under £50

Coming in at £48, PrettyLittleThing's calendar is one of the most affordable on the market, alongside Revolution, Soap & Glory and Ted Baker, with its products totalling £198.

If you're looking to stock up on products for yourself ('with love from me, to me'), your family, your friends as a pre-Yuletide treat PLT's advent calendar has a whole bunch of fun size and full size products to last you the 24 days leading up to Christmas that'll really amp up your beauty routine for a fraction of what they would cost just in time for party season. Cheers to that.

We're talking cleansers, clay masks, make-up must-haves, essential lip balms, the lot. One product, the Plump It! hyaluronic lip plumper, costs £22.99 alone which is almost half of what the calendar itself costs.

Now, you may notice that this calendar is £3 more than its price last year. But its content is worth a lot more compared to 2022 where the calendar cost £45 but was worth £141. Pretty sweet deal if you ask us. Find it here.

Here's everything you can expect to find inside:

Mario Badescu Hyaluronic Dew Cream

Premium Eyelash Curler

Land Of Lashes Girl Boss False Eyelash

Starskin Dream Kiss Lip Mask

Charlotte Tilbury's £160 beauty advent calendar

Charlotte Tilbury’s viral beauty advent calendar has made a return for 2023, after selling out in 2021 and 2022. The theme of this year’s calendar is Charlotte’s Lucky Chest of Beauty Secrets, and boy would we feel lucky to find this under the tree on December 1, that’s for sure.

At £160, it doesn’t come cheap, though the products inside are worth £223. That said, last year the calendar was £150 and worth £244, so the savings don’t seem to be quite as lucrative in 2023. The contents work out at just over £13 per product, with two full-size treasures inside, including Charlotte's Magic Lip Oil Crystal Elixir, which is usually £28, and the Hot Lips 2 lipstick in Glowing Jen, usually £29.

What Martin Lewis' Money Saving Expert has to say about No7 Beauty Calendars

Martin Lewis' Money Saving Expert site has done a deepdive on the new No7 beauty advent calendars that launched this morning, and have totted up what they believe to be the total value. Some of them are said to be worth more than the Boots website states, however, some of them have been valued at slightly less.

Here's the comparison

No7 Lift and Luminate calendar

No7 Protect and Perfect calendar

No7 Restore and Renew calendar

No7 Ultimate Beauty calendar

The team added: ""Beauty Advent calendars are a way of bagging your wish list products at a fraction of the normal cost. While they’re intended to be opened daily throughout December, they're also great for dividing up as gifts in festive hampers or as birthday presents throughout the year.""

“When I tell you how excited and thrilled I was to see a beauty brand think outside the box this year with a sustainable beauty advent calendar concept… Naturally M&S were always going to be the ones to nail it, right? I mean not only is the vegan leather case practical, it’s so big too! I mean I’m either going to keep it for myself or give it to someone in my family this year - filled with some beauty treats.

""“I personally love a beauty advent calendar for having handy travel sized products for when I’m on the go, staying back at my parents house over the holidays or weekends away - but they are also really good for giving something a go I’ve never wanted to purchase full price. I also really love giving the miniatures away as stocking fillers to my cousin’s too - so they can also try something new out!

“For just £40, after spending £35 in store and online, I can put my hand on my heart and say that the beauty advent calendar is really worth it. Aside from the vanity case, it has some big name brands included like PIXI, Benefit, Murad, This Works, NUXE and REN to name a few - plus the L’Occitane, Shay & Blue and Philip Kingsley.""

Aries (Mar 21 - Apr 20)

Let other people offer advice if that's what they want to do. Some will not realise you do actually know what you are doing. Continue with what you feel instinctively is the right way. A new source of income will be discovered. It's getting easier to make money.

Taurus (Apr 21 - May 21)

The key question about going ahead with something completely new is: how ready for this are you? If there might be some big challenges ahead, how resilient are you? Some important decisions come under the spotlight but you can expect to receive useful help and advice.

Gemini (May 22 - June 21)

Worries and uncertainties that have been on your mind will be but a memory today. You may even wonder why you ever doubted your decisions, plans or actions in the first place when everything has turned out better than you could even have anticipated.

Cancer (June 22 - July 23)

It won't be difficult to put your ideas to work. It shouldn't take long before others start to realise that improvements can be made by following your suggestions. Not only this but they will be happy to make an extra effort to achieve a mutual aim.

Leo (July 24 - Aug 23)

A small windfall or bonus may have you itching to hit your favourite online stores but before you do, consider the demands the future might bring. You've known what it is like to struggle financially and this could be the chance you have been dreaming of to build your savings.

Virgo (Aug 24 - Sept 23)

Begin to make secret dreams a reality. If you sense someone in your world has written you off as being stuck in your ways, they may have to think again. A bold mood is starting to take hold of you and you're ready to break through barriers that have been holding you back.

Libra (Sept 24 - Oct 23)

If there's anything in your life that could benefit from some behind the scenes research then get started today. You will do well in any area involving investigation, research or restoration. In fact any kind of work that requires detailed focus will be good for you.

Scorpio (Oct 24 - Nov 22)

With you having been so helpful towards others recently, they are looking for ways to show their appreciation. An invitation to a splendid social event could be just one of the pleasant surprises this day will bring your way.

Sagittarius (Nov 23 - Dec 21)

Offers and opportunities that will bring new life experiences are starting to pour in now. Look upon the world as being your oyster. This is your chance to broaden your experience of life through travel and study or by tackling challenges head on.

Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 20)

Everyone is trying their hardest. You want to do everything properly. You are doing this for good reasons but you're being over-critical of yourself and others. This is making you irritable while putting them on the defensive. Instead of complaining, offer compliments and notice the difference.

Aquarius (Jan 21 - Feb 19)

Delays and transport problems will cause frustrations. If you are on the move, be willing to take a detour. There are worse things that can happen than being late for a meeting or appointment. Contact anyone who is expecting you and once you explain the situation, they will understand.

Pisces (Feb 20 - Mar 20)

Losing yourself in daydreams and fantasy can make you happy but it will be necessary to take a logical and realistic approach to matters that are cropping up today. Close relationships of every description, whether they are platonic, romantic or of the business variety may undergo a shakeup.

703,"Scientists urge companies to stick graphic 'cigarette-style' health warnings on meat","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/scientists-urge-companies-stick-graphic-31351093","Scientists urge companies to stick graphic 'cigarette-style' health warnings on meat

Researchers have suggested that graphic warning labels should be added onto meat-based products - they said the alarming stickers should be introduced as national policy

Health warnings similar to cigarette-style stickers could persuade Brits to cut down on meat consumption, according to scientists.

Researchers at Durham University said authorities should consider adding graphic imagery on meat products to help the environment. They suggested the move should be introduced as a national policy.

It comes after a study found that warnings around future pandemics, health concerns, and climate change discouraged people from picking a meat-based meal.

The experts believe that by highlighting the impact that meat farming has on global warming consumers could be more likely to make healthier food choices and take steps to decrease their carbon footprint. According to the Climate Change Committee, which advises the Government, reducing meat and dairy consumption by one-fifth could help the UK meet its environmental commitments.

The study split 1,001 adults who eat meat into four groups and showed them pictures of hot canteen-style meals, which had either a health warning label, a pandemic warning label, a climate warning label or no label at all. One label showed a deforested area, with factory smoke in the distance, and text saying: ""Eating meat contributes to climate change"". Interviewees were then asked several questions about how anxious the warnings made them feel, how believable they were, what they would choose and if they would support these types of labels being implemented as policy.

Psychology PhD student Jack Hughes, who carried out the food label research with supervisors, said: ""Reaching net zero is a priority for the nation and the planet. As warning labels have already been shown to reduce smoking as well as drinking sugary drinks and alcohol, using a warning label on meat-containing products could help us achieve this if introduced as national policy.""

Senior author on the paper Dr Milica Vasiljevic, from Durham University's Department of Psychology, said: ""We already know that eating a lot of meat, especially red and processed meat, is bad for your health and that it contributes to deaths from pollution and climate change. Adding warning labels to meat products could be one way to reduce these risks to health and the environment.""

The experts shared three ways to become a more sustainable meat eater

Cutting down

""If your focus is on sustainability and the environment, less meat is generally always better than sustainable meat,"" explained Ed Steele, co-founder of Hoxton Farms. You can take steps towards eating more plant-based meals - perhaps by doing meat-free Mondays, or only eating meat when you're out.

Eating consciously

Reid stressed how important it is for people to be more responsible in the way they consume meat. ""The best way is to know where your meat comes from. It's not the consumers' fault that the majority can only purchase their meat from supermarkets, which provides a more cost-effective offering to customers. So there's no judgment on the consumer. But the cheaper something is - across the entire food chain - the more corners have been cut. It's never usually good for you.""

He recommends buying from a butchers, and said: ""It could sometimes be cheaper. Or you can also buy great meat online, too. It's not easy to eat consciously, so it is about planning, just like anything in life.""

Choosing wisely

""When choosing animal proteins, eat more chicken, eggs and pork, which are generally more environmentally friendly than dairy, beef, and lamb,"" Steele said - or better yet, swap out ""with other protein sources, like peas and legumes"".

Reid added: ""We need to look beyond beef and the prime cuts such as rump, fillet, sirloin and rib eye. We also have the skirt and shin, great for slow braising,"" he said. Reid grew up in a Caribbean home where he learnt to ""respect the whole animal"". He said: ""We had our own chickens and we ate every bit of it. I think we've lost that bit in society.""

The mcr-1 gene has built up a resistance to certain life-saving drugs - but there's an easy way to stop it from being transmitted from domesticated animals to humans

Sharing a bed with your dog may improve your sleep quality - but it can negatively impact your overall health. Experts are urging dog owners against regularly sharing a bed with their pets following a spread of an ""untreatable superbug"".

The mcr-1 gene, believed to be transmitted from animals to humans, has built up a resistance to certain life-saving drugs. With drug-resistant infections killing an estimated 700,000 people a year worldwide, the UN warns this could rise to 10 million by 2050 if nothing is done.

Its research team has warned of an instance where humans can pick up the bug, which was first identified in China in 2015. Dogs can harbour mcr-1 in the their gut before it's transported via microscopic feacal particles.

A study at the University of Lisbon found that in two of the households where dogs had tissue infections, the gene was present in the dog and the owner.

Faecal samples were taken from 126 healthy people that were living with 102 cats and dogs in 80 households over a period of two years up to February 2020.

It was found that eight of the dogs and four humans were hosting bacteria including mcr-1.

The results also showed that three of the dogs appeared to be healthy and the others had tissue or urinary tract infections.

The findings were presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Conference.

Experts told attendees that agricultural regions particularly in southern European countries that use colistin will be less likely to contract the mcr-1 gene.

Dr Juliana Menezes, who led the research, said: ""Colistin is used when all other antibiotics have failed, it is a crucial treatment of last resort.

""If bacteria resistant to all drugs acquire this resistance gene, they would become untreatable, and that's a scenario we must avoid at all costs.

""We know that the overuse of antibiotics drives resistance and it is vital that they are used responsibly, not just in medicine but also in veterinary medicine and in farming.""

Scientists have suggested that palm oil could cause a pandemic as deforestation has a part to play in its mass production - they believe it could make the world prone to outbreaks of zoonotic disease

Peanut butter could trigger the next global pandemic after scientists found an alarming connection to zoonotic disease, it has been revealed.

Researchers discovered the mass production of the nutty spread could make the world more open to outbreaks of zoonotic disease, which is an infectious disease that can be transmitted between humans and animals. The study, published in the journal Frontiers in Veterinary Science, highlighted a strong link between pandemics and deforestation - which sees dozens of trees destroyed so the land can be used for other reasons.

This has a devastating impact on animals as they are forced to escape their natural habitat and find a home nearer to human dwellings such as forests or jungles. But in doing so, it can increase the chances of spreading the disease, much like the cross-species jump thought to have sparked the Covid-19 pandemic in a Wuhan market, China, in 2019.

One of the leading causes of deforestation is the obtaining of palm oil found in palm trees. This oil is used to produce a huge number of goods including cosmetics, cleaning products and, yes, peanut butter. In fact, palm oil can be found in approximately 50% of all packaged household products.

The new study, the first to examine the cause-and-effect relationship on a global scale, suggests deforestation due to palm oil plantations increases the likelihood of zoonotic disease transmission because it destroys the habitats of animals such as bats that are known to be carriers of new diseases, reports Daily Star.

What's novel about the findings is the discovery that, counterintuitively, reforestation (meaning an increase in forest cover) may also spark more disease. ""We don't yet know the precise ecological mechanisms at play, but we hypothesise that plantations, such as oil palm, develop at the expense of natural wooded areas, and reforestation is mainly monospecific forest made at the expense of grasslands,"" lead author Serge Morand said.

The planting of the same crop to cover a large area reduces biodiversity and is ultimately unsustainable, despite being perceived as a positive counterweight to deforestation. ""Both land use changes are characterised by loss of biodiversity and these simplified habitats favour animal reservoirs and vectors of diseases,"" Prof Morand explained. The study found a quarter of global forest loss has been due to an increased demand for products like beef and palm oil. Cutting down one hectare of forest for palm oil also emits 174 tonnes of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of a jetliner's carbon output. The authors conclude that rapid deforestation and the increase in palm-oil plantations between 1990 and 2016 are inherently linked to the increasing spread of zoonotic diseases, as well as vector-borne disease spread by insect bites.

Data from 47 countries suggests this connection while reforestation may have been responsible for the loss of animal biodiversity and increased zoonotic disease outbreaks in 27 countries. ""Reforestation can increase biodiversity loss when forest expansion is made at the expense of grasslands, savannas, and open-canopy woodlands,"" the study team writes. Our result shows that oil palm plantations may also constitute a threat to global health by favouring zoonotic and vector-borne diseases."" Now that the relationship between deforestation and disease has been backed up by more data, the researchers warn we must act quickly to prevent another pandemic.

They have proposed three key recommendations for policy-makers:

""We hope that these results will help policymakers recognise that forests contribute to a healthy planet and people, and that governing bodies need to avoid afforestation and agricultural conversion of grasslands,"" Prof Morand said.

Brain health scientist Professor Michael Crawford says 'we are heading for an idiocracy' if the nation doesn't improve their diets, as we're currently deficient of one staple ingredient

Advancements in modern-day living have changed how humans interact, work, and importantly, the type of food put on the table. But what we now eat could be to blame for our declining brain health, according to a leading scientist, with a key ingredient missing from many day-to-day diets.

Professor Michael Crawford, who is Director of the Institute of Brain Chemistry and Human Nutrition, and author of a new book The Shrinking Brain, argues that the size of the human brain has shrunk by an alarming 20 per cent, and as a result, IQ scores have steadily declined while cases of mental illness have increased exponentially.

Currently, one in five of the world's children and adolescents have a mental health condition, according to World Health Organisation statistics. In one study, Norwegian researchers, headed by Ole Rogeberg, a senior research fellow at the Ragnar Frisch Center for Economic Research in Norway, analysed the IQ scores of Norwegian men born between 1962 and 1991 and found that scores steadily decreased among those born after 1975. ""Similar studies in Denmark, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Finland and Estonia have demonstrated a similar downward trend in IQ scores,"" notes Rogeberg.

And it's all down to our diet, he says. ""The decline is due to environmental factors"". Another study in the US showed IQ test scores dropped during a 13-year period. Researchers say the trend coincides with a change in the Western diet away from fat and towards carbohydrates and sugar, based on the mistaken belief that it was fat, not sugar, that was causing heart disease and that we should all eat a low-fat diet. They claim IQ scores have been dropping by about seven per cent per generation.

""We are heading for an idiocracy,"" says Professor Crawford, who is also a visiting professor at Imperial College London. He believes modern-day diets are to blame, saying they are 'dumbing us down'. ""Our genome is adapted to eating the wild foods we ate during our species' evolution.

""Today's diet bears no resemblance to this."" In his book, The Shrinking Brain, he says ""Our ancestors evolved a unique 1,600cc brain evolving from our ancestral 350cc brain of the chimpanzee, despite our genome only differing by 1.5 per cent. This could only have happened with the provision of brain-specific building nutrients from land and sea.

""There is incontrovertible evidence of early Homo sapiens exploiting the marine food web in coastal Africa."" In other words, he says we were waterside apes - a theory championed by David Attenborough - who got smarter and grew bigger brains, by eating mussels, oysters, crabs and fish. The professor discovered in 1971 that the brains of all mammals are rich in omega-3 DHA (Docosahexaenoic acid). The size of their brain varied according to their dietary supply of DHA found in seafood, his study states.

A dolphin, for example, has a 1,700cc brain, slightly larger than ours, while a lion has a 320cc brain about that of a chimpanzee, he notes. ""The mix of wildland and aquatic foods powered by the encephalization of the brain from the 340cc of the chimp to the 1,500-1,700 of cro-magnon. DHA is not only involved in signalling but it stimulates gene expression in the brain so the rich aquatic food sources constantly, every day, would have powered the increase in brain size and function,"" says Crawford.

Patrick Holford, CEO of the FoodfortheBrain.org charity, adds: ""Today's diet contains less than a tenth of the omega-3 fats that our ancestors ate and this is having dire consequences on mental health. Increased rates of depression, autism, ADHD and dementia are all strongly linked to lack of seafood. Increased intake from eating fish or supplementing omega-3 fish oils reduces dementia risk by 20 per cent.

""While a plant-based diet has many benefits, those who eat no fish, are especially vulnerable and must supplement omega-3 DHA, derived from algae. The only way to be sure you have enough is to get a blood test to specifically test your levels."" The charity has launched a simple pin-prick test that can give you a clear indication of your Omega-3 levels, alongside a Cognitive Function Test, that can help identify what's driving future risk and show you how to dementia-proof your diet and lifestyle.

Canadian neuroscientist and brain expert Professor Stephen Cunnane, at the University of Sherbrook in Canada, agrees: ""A shore-based diet, i.e., fish, molluscs, crustaceans, frogs, bird's eggs and aquatic plants, provides the richest known dietary sources of brain selective nutrients. Change in diet away from marine foods is the likely explanation for this decrease in brain size.""

Today, less than five per cent of children achieve the basic requirement for omega-3, according to studies. Professor Crawford, who is also a science advisor to the charity foodforthebrain.org, claims that if a pregnant woman lacks omega-3 DHA, she produces a substitute fat, oleic acid, to fill the baby's brain. However, he says that levels of oleic acid in a pregnant woman's blood predicted preterm birth, which carries the highest risk of developmental brain problems, as well as a risk of learning and cognitive disabilities.

Brain size is worked out from skull capacity. Homo sapiens skulls dating back to 29,000 years ago had a brain capacity of 1,660cc. By 10,000 years ago it was around 1,500cc or 1.5 kilograms. Average brain size today is a fifth smaller, at 1,336cc. Brain size may have started to shrink from 10,000 years ago, coinciding with mankind developing more land-based agriculture and eating less marine food along rivers and coasts, according to reports.

The Mirror's Ariane visited Jeremy Clarkson's Diddly Squat Farm Shop to buy supplies for a fry-up breakfast. It cost more than double than a normal supermarket, but she was impressed by one item in particular

Thousands of people have been flocking to Jeremy Clarkson's Diddly Squat Farm Shop after it reopened in early February.

Following the success of The Grand Tour presenter's Amazon Prime series Clarkson's Farm, people from all over the country have been swarming to pay a visit to the shop on the edge of his 1,000 acre property.

The Farm Shop itself is tiny, and sells items produced at the farm as well as at nearby places in the Cotswolds - but it's notoriously pricey.

It's estimated that the prices there are 200% more expensive than the nearest supermarket Aldi, according to the Evesham Journal.

I wondered if the expensive price tag was reflected in the taste of the products, so I decided to travel to his Cotswolds farm to buy the items I needed for a fry-up breakfast.

I joined the back of the queue at 10.30am on a Thursday morning, and it took an hour to get to the front.

Finally inside, I picked up some bacon, sausages, eggs and a loaf of bread and before I paid I had no idea what the total would be as some of the costs weren't displayed.

I could only see the price of the bacon and sausage on the shelf, so had to ask about the bread and eggs. It was surprising that the shop didn't have its prices clearly listed, and is something to consider if you're planning a visit. After finally figuring out what each item would set me back, I paid a total of £17.25.

Here is the price breakdown:

According to research company Kantar, picking up all the supplies for a fried breakfast costs on average £6.83. This means picking up the items from the Farm Shop cost 152% more than at a supermarket, and that's without the baked beans.

Back at home, it was time to cook the breakfast and test out the products themselves. It's worth noting that this isn't your average supermarket run for necessities, and many people don't mind paying extra if it's reflected in the quality of the produce, if finances allow for it.

With that said, a full fry-up normally includes other items like tomatoes, mushrooms and baked beans, but these are the only goods I could find in the shop.

While cooking the sausages, I realised that not as much fat and water came out as usual, which is a good sign in my book as it suggests the meat is good quality.

I then completed my breakfast plate by adding a fried egg and toasted sourdough - and it was finally time to taste.

After tucking into all the produce, there was no doubt one winner that stood out from the rest - the eggs.

They were deliciously rich and creamy, and although significantly tiny, I don't think they are comparable in terms of price to regular free range eggs in supermarkets.

Costing £3.20, they are a lot more expensive than a six-pack of medium free range eggs at Aldi (£1.29), but you can taste a big difference.

Cacklebean eggs come from a rare breed of Arlington chickens and have a vivid orange yolk. You can definitely pick them up cheaper elsewhere, but you probably won't find them in your local, big chain supermarket.

In terms of bacon, which cost £4.30 for six slices, I would have expected a bit more meat for the price. In Aldi you can pick up 10 slices of unsmoked back bacon for £1.75.

While there's no doubting the flavour, there was quite a bit of fat on the side that I cut off while eating, so I felt like quite a lot of the product was wasted.

The sausages are definitely different to ones you can pick up in the shop, because they are flavoured with Clarkson's own Hawkstone lager, which has a growing fanbase.

While this might be to some people's taste, personally I don't think it added a particularly strong or enjoyable flavour to go together with a fry-up.

With a £3.80 price tag for six sausages, I would expect them to be bursting with flavour. That being said, they might be better for use in a sandwich with some ketchup or brown sauce because. I could tell they were good quality - and they were very filling.

The most expensive item was the sourdough loaf, which you could normally get for under £2 at a local supermarket.

The large loaf is made a bakery in Lechlade, a town at the southern edge of the Cotswolds. It tasted great, but I personally think that's too much to pay for a loaf of bread.

In terms of the whole meal, one of the things I noticed was how filling it all is. I couldn't finish it all, and I didn't eat lunch that day.

There's no doubt that you're paying for the quality of the locally grown food that fills you up, and it's also great to support hard-working farmers.

However, this isn't something that most people could afford to buy regularly - particularly not now, during the cost of living crisis.

Also, with the queue to the farm shop more than tripling within the hour it took me to get to the front, I don't think it's feasible for a regular visit.

However, if I was nearby and there was no queue, I would definitely return to buy some of those delicious eggs - they were undoubtedly the star of the show.

Colombian-born Katherine Paola Santos is being quizzed by police as it emerged UK intelligence services are assisting in the hunt for the 78-year-old who was abducted by more than 15 armed gangsters

The girlfriend of British millionaire Colin Armstrong, 78, who has been kidnapped in Ecuador, has been questioned by detectives.

The UK intelligence services are said to be assisting in the hunt for Mr Armstrong, who was abducted by more than 15 armed gangsters. He was taken from his ranch early on Saturday along with his partner, Katherine Paola Santos. She is believed to have been rescued in a secret -operation and quizzed after her release. Video footage of Mr Armstrong has emerged which appears to show him partying with Ms Santos and her friends on a boat. He is seen accompanying her on several occasions, including for her 30th birthday party, while in fancy dress as a pilot.

Cesar Zapata, who was appointed as general commander of the National Police force earlier this year by former President -Guillermo Lasso, has reportedly taken personal charge of the probe along with a specialist anti-kidnap and extortion unit called UNASE. Immediately after the kidnapping, the force said: ""Following an apparent criminal act against a businessman in the early hours of this morning in Los Rios, specialist police units are carrying out -operative and investigative work on the ground."" No update has been given since.

Ecuadorian lawyer and former MP Ricardo Vanegas has said in a tweet: ""It's become known -Katherine Paola Santos was born in the Colombian city of -Barranquilla and began having surgery to look more feminine
and her birth name is Alberto Santos. It appears she is now being investigated by prosecutors and police in Ecuador over the kidnap.""

He could not be reached to elaborate on his claims. His son, also called Ricardo, told reporters he was busy teaching at a local university. He said: ""You'll have to speak to my father, but here in Ecuador, the initial stages of an investigation are always conducted in secret. It may be he has received leaked information from sources."" Mr Armstrong was the former UK honorary consul in the city of Guayaquil until his son Nick took over in 2016. As well as founding and owning a large agricultural supply company in the South American country, he is a director along with his son of the 500-acre Tupgill Park Estate near Leyburn in North Yorkshire, which has been the family home for more than 45 years.

The kidnap took place around 2.45am on Saturday at his ranch, called Rancho Rodeo Grande, near the town of Baba in Los Rios -province, a two-hour drive north of Guayaquil. Mr Colin, as he was known affectionately by staff at the ranch, is understood to have been forcibly bundled into a black BMW he owned, which was found -abandoned near the scene. No official comment has been given about video footage that has emerged on social media purporting to show Ms Santos having an -explosives vest removed by police experts on Saturday afternoon at a property on a private gated estate in Samborondon near Guayaquil, which is said to belong to a relative of Mr Armstrong.

The town is the same locality where ex-MP Mr Vanegas's office is based. It is understood Mr Armstrong's son has flown to Ecuador to help police locate his father. Mr Armstrong's daughter Diana Armstrong-Bruns, an estate agent based in California, said: ""This is a critical time. We've been told not to say anything to anyone. We just want my father back."" No ransom demand has yet been made.

The millionaire, thought to have previously been married to an Ecuadorian woman, has long been associated with the South American country. He founded Agripac in 1972. He and Ms Santos were pictured enjoying a jet-set lifestyle together before their kidnapping. The images, posted as a montage by a local news organisation on TikTok, showed them on board a cruise ship and beneath the -Hollywood sign in Los Angeles, California. There are also images of the smiling couple riding on horseback and posing in front of the -pyramids in Egypt.

The businessman's adopted son Leo Morris, 47, helps run a -restaurant at the family's Yorkshire estate. The estate welcomes more than 150,000 visitors a year to an attraction known as the Forgotten Corner, which was initially built as a private folly. A spokesman for the Tupgill Park Estate said yesterday that ""everything is being done"" to ensure his safe release. And added: ""Tupgill Park Estate wishes to express their sincere devastation at the situation and that all of our thoughts and prayers are with the Armstrong family."" Mr Armstrong was awarded an OBE and CMG by the Queen in 2011. Footage that is claimed to show the aftermath of the kidnap was posted online shortly after it happened.

A woman thought to be a member of staff took close-up shots of broken plates on the floor and a man who appeared to be holding a bandage to his head. She then walked into one of the bedrooms where there was blood over the bed and said as she focused in on the stained sheets: ""This is where they hit him. My God, what is this!"" The woman appeared to be referring to the man she had filmed sitting on the stairs nursing what looked to be a head wound. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office confirmed: ""We are in contact with -Ecuadorian authorities following the disappearance of a British man and are supporting his family.""

Yesterday, local media questioned why police had failed to provide any updates after only speaking out on Monday to rule out Mr Armstrong's death amid rumours he had been killed. National newspaper Expreso quoted a member of the Police Communication Department of Zone 8 saying: ""The units continue -investigating, I reiterate when there are results, we will announce them on our official networks.""

The newspaper provided more detail about the abduction, saying the businessman was taken in ""a high-end black vehicle with -diplomatic licence plate"". The police reportedly managed to activate the car's satellite tracking device, which resulted in it being found. According to local reports, the men who took Mr Armstrong were ""hooded individuals dressed in clothing similar to that of the National Police"".

Neighbour Luis Carpio said the farm was fitted with a powerful alarm that, when triggered, could be heard from afar. However, he said the alarm had not been activated. Of the kidnappers, Mr Carpio said: ""I hope God touches the hearts of those people so that they release him soon and we have him back.""

Mr Armstrong's extended family admit they are ""in the dark"" as to why he was abducted. Adopted son Leo was yesterday running the family business in the Dales as his relatives continued to attempt to secure his release. His uncle said: ""Leo is busy at the estate. We only know what has been reported. No more than that.""

Despite an offshoot of the World Health Organization saying there is a 'possible' link between aspartame and cancer, the recommended daily limit remains unchanged

An artificial sweetener used in thousands of products including diet fizzy drinks, ice cream and chewing gum has been ruled a ""possible"" cause of cancer by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

In a report released late on Thursday, a WHO body classified aspartame as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"", but it still ruled as safe to drink.

Aspartame is found in popular drinks like Diet Coke, Muller Light yoghurts, Wrigley's Extra chewing gum and many more. So how concerned should you be?

What is Aspartame and does it cause cancer?

Aspartame is an artificial, low-calorie sweetener used as a sugar substitute in various food and beverage products. Aspartame is made up of two amino acids: aspartic acid and phenylalanine. It is about 200 times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar) and provides a similar taste without the same caloric content.

Aspartame is authorised as a food additive in Europe and the US and is used in numerous foods, drinks such as Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Diet Snapple, Fanta Zero, Sprite Zero, Crystal Light and Wyler's Light; desserts, sugar free chewing gum including Trident, Extra, Wrigley's and Mentos gum; gelatin-based products, including sugar-free Jell-O and Royal Gelatin; syrups, including Mrs. Butterworth's Sugar Free Syrup and Log Cabin Sugar Free Syrup; medications including cough drops and foods intended to help with weight loss.

It is also in tabletop sweeteners sold as Equal, Sugar Twin and NutraSweet.

An offshoot of the WHO - the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) - has categories for substances based on their risk of causing cancer, based in the strength of evidence.

In 2023, for the first time, WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) announced that aspartame should be categorised as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"" due to a potential link to liver cancer. But it is in the lowest category - reflecting the weak evidence link.

The IACR's decision on aspartame was based on three studies in humans that found a link between the consumption of artificially sweetened beverages and hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common type of liver cancer.

How is it ""possibly"" linked to cancer but still safe to drink?

The seemingly conflicting statements from the WHO ""” that aspartame may possibly cause cancer but is safe to consume ""” came from two separate groups within the organisation.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), said aspartame is a ""possible carcinogen"". The Joint Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), who review the evidence, maintained its advice that it remains safe to consume within current recommended daily limits.

Dr Mary Schubauer-Berigan, of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, said the ""evidence was not of sufficiently high quality or convincing enough"" and ""this is really more a call to the research community"" to study the sweetener more.

The American Cancer Society said they hope people use the latest evidence as an opportunity to ""reflect"" on their use of aspartame, but also an opportunity to review their overall dietary intake, including processed meat and alcohol, known carcinogens associated with increased risk of cancer.

Experts have said the current 'limit' of aspartame is high, and therefore would be difficult to exceed.

How much is safe to drink?

The Food and Agricultural Organisation's Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives, who carried out a complementary study, retained its advice that it is safe for a person to drink 0-40mg per kilogram of body weight each day.

The WHO said a person weighing 70kg would need to consume more than between nine and 14 cans of diet soft drink per day to exceed the daily guideline.

Since each type has varying levels of sweetness, the FDA has done the maths (PDF) for you: Consume no more than 75 packets a day of Equal or NutraSweet (aspartame); 23 packets a day of Splenda (sucralose), Sweet One (acesulfame potassium) or Newtame (neotame); and 45 packets a day of Sweet'N Low or Sweet Twin (saccharin).

The different types of carcinogen

Aspartame does have some known health concerns for certain people, the FDA noted. The sweetener should not be used by anyone with the genetic disorder phenylketonuria, certain rare liver disorders or pregnant people with high levels of phenylalanine in their blood, because it doesn't metabolise properly in those individuals.

Dr Francesco Branca, the director of the WHO's Department of Nutrition and Food Safety said if people are unsure whether they're consuming too much aspartame, there's always an alternative.

""If consumers are faced with the decision of whether to take cola with sweeteners or one with sugar,"" he said, ""I think there should be a third option considered, which is to drink water instead.""

Dr Branca added: ""Cancer is one of the leading causes of death globally. Every year, one in six people die from cancer. Science is continuously expanding to assess the possible initiating or facilitating factors of cancer, in the hope of reducing these numbers and the human toll.

""The assessments of aspartame have indicated that, while safety is not a major concern at the doses which are commonly used, potential effects have been described that need to be investigated by more and better studies.

""We're not advising consumers to stop consuming (aspartame) altogether. We're just advising a bit of moderation.""

Research from the Common Wealth think-tank found Britain's privatised energy network has handed £28 billion since it was sold off by the Tories in 1990

National Grid has paid out billions to shareholders while being slow to upgrade its network to fully harness renewable energy, a new report has claimed.

Research from the Common Wealth think-tank found Britain's privatised energy network has handed £28 billion since it was sold off by the Tories in 1990. But it still takes an average of 13 years to connect renewable projects like wind farms to the grid.

And when wind farms create more energy than the grid can handle, National Grid pay them to shut down - at an eye-watering cost of up to £62 million a day. The researchers argue renationalising the grid would save the nation billions - allowing the government to use the money that would have been handed to shareholders to invest in infrastructure.

Adrienne Buller, Director of Research at Common Wealth, said: ""The best time to reverse privatisation of the grid was before it happened. Since then, the public has endured substantially higher costs than are necessary, while our infrastructure is creaking under the demands of the current electricity system ""” let alone investing anywhere near enough to keep pace with the urgent transformation to clean energy, and the complex planning and strategy that will involve.

""The second best time to reverse privatisation of the grid is now - through public ownership we can accelerate our transition to net zero while cutting costs and ensuring our future energy system guarantees clean, affordable and secure energy for all.""

A spokesperson for National Grid said: ""National Grid is a global business and we are proud to be one of the largest FTSE investors in the transition to net zero. Our transmission network represents around £20 a year on the average bill but enables GB's energy transition.

""We have committed £29bn of green investment between 2022 and 2026 to fund the infrastructure that will deliver a clean, fair and affordable energy future. Britain's stable regulatory environment enables this huge scale of investment at low cost, with the support of our shareholders, and close alignment with Britain's national energy strategy.""

Izaurino Alves had never heard of carbon credits when the ­strangers arrived at his remote Amazonian home a few years ago.

The grandad, 59, was also unaware they were part of an alleged multimillion-pound scheme using land where he lives that links to Kenneth Noye. Izaurino is a member of the ribeirinho, the ""river people"" who make their living by fishing, farming and harvesting forest products.

His wooden home is a long way from Noye's one-bedroom flat in Kent which shares same address as the headquarters of the Amazon Forest People carbon credit scheme. A 2020 AFP brochure says it is protecting the area where Izaurino lives from deforestation and fighting for ""social, economic and environmental justice"".

Alongside pictures of smiling children, it says they ""own and protect"" 368,000 acres of forest, an area almost as large as Greater London, and have been working with the 6,200 ribeirinho since 2008 in an area that is being logged ""rapidly and illegally"".

But Izaurino is one of many ­residents we spoke to living within the footprint of the AFP project who say they have not been helped by it. Standing on his smallholding in the north-eastern Brazilian state of Para, a two-hour boat ride from any road, Izaurino said scheme representatives offered him a loan that never materialised.

""They came here with beautiful words, saying their interest was in preserving the forest, in keeping the trees up because it's important for oxygen,"" he said. ""They said they were going to lend us money for equipment but we never heard back from them. What am I supposed to do?""

Izaurino and his wife Maria, 49, live on a plot the size of 600 football pitches, small by Amazonian ­standards. They are one of hundreds of families inside the scheme area who live in government settlements that give them rights over the land. The smallholding supports their eight children and 22 grandchildren.

A source involved in the project denies the claims, saying they have sought to behave correctly. They claim to have funded a school for 180 children and adults, provided solar power facilities and clean water. We made the three-day journey from the UK to this remote corner of the Brazilian jungle.

Our trip involved 20 hours on a boat, overnighting in hammocks. The project, called Pacajai Redd+, is funded by an offshore company called Avoided ­Deforestation Project (Manaus) Limited (ADPML), a mystery to most people we spoke to. The 40-year scheme is due to end in 2048 and has sold 10 million carbon credits.

It is not known how much money it has raised or invested in the land and its inhabitants - the figures are not publicly available. The venture is one of four separate controversial carbon credit schemes in the state. A report by the charity the World Rainforest Movement published last year raised concerns, saying they lack transparency about who owns the schemes and how much money they have raised.

It also questioned the claims being made by the projects about the levels of reductions in CO2 emissions. ADPML is being sued as part of a case being taken against the scheme by Andreia Macedo Barreto, a lawyer representing the local people. The writ claims the scheme is illegal because rather than being based on private land, it includes two government settlement projects, on which 1,151 families live.

Odivan Ferreira CorrÃªa, ­president of the Portel Rural Workers' Union, said his colleagues met four representatives of ADPML in 2020. He said one was armed with a pistol when they offered the union around £80,000 to help their work. He said the money was rejected after the representatives refused to reveal who was financing the project.

""It's us who protect the forest, we the people who live here. When this company came they talked about helping us but we haven't seen anything happen,"" Odivan explains from his office in the city of Portel. An ex-vice president of the union, who we are naming only as GraÃ§a, said: ""This project should be cancelled.

""Our people should be compensated because these companies are making money out of their lands without telling them who will have the money."" Land ownership is often disputed in the region, due to a poor registration system and claims on public areas using altered documentation.

We visited one settlement where around a dozen men were awaiting our arrival. Everyone had a similar story, involving a visit from people claiming to be from the project who made promises they allegedly failed to keep. Flanked by his wife Helena, Manoel Correia Dos Santos, 67, shows us a stove given to him through the scheme, saying: ""I want the money to come back.""

Antonio De Pinho, 46, father of two, said: ""This money would mean our ­children could go to school."" Sebastiao Gibson Ramos, 52, said representatives from the project said they were from an NGO. ""We need this money to help preserve this area and bring healthcare and education,"" he said.

""Money is in their pockets while we are still in need of the basics. Please tell the world what is happening here."" Asked who was behind the project, he said: ""It's a big mystery, a big secret."" Grandfather Antonio Valente Da Silva, 71, added: ""I believe that there's something really wrong going on.""

How Noye laundered cash from 'Heist of the Century'

At 6.30am on 26 November 1983, six armed men entered a warehouse on the edge of Heathrow Airport. They left with 6,800 gold bars worth £26 million. It would be dubbed the Heist of the Century but the most audacious part of the crime was yet to come. The groundbreaking methods employed by the villains to keep the proceeds of the robbery changed the face of modern organised crime and policing.

Old Kent Road armed robbers ""Mad"" Micky McAvoy and Brian ""The Colonel"" Robinson teamed up with Noye and John ""Goldfinger"" Palmer to convert the gold into cash. Noye later told his trial that he had set up offshore companies with shares held by trusts, though he claimed the huge sums of cash invested were not from the robbery.

Gordon Parry and Michael Relton, a public school-educated solicitor ""Chancellor of the Exchequer"" to the robbers, were also behind the money laundering plot. Three months after the robbery, Parry flew to Jersey where he met a banker to discuss setting up a company in the UK's Channel Islands whose beneficiaries would remain anonymous.

In February, 1984, Selective Estates (Jersey) was established. At the same time Melchester Holdings was set up in Panama City, where similar secrecy laws applied. In both cases the undisclosed beneficiaries were Relton, jailed for 12 years, and Parry, a Kent property dealer played by Sean Harris in the BBC's The Gold, who got 10 years.

The money was then funnelled back into the UK and invested in property including in London's Docklands, turning £7.5 million into £18 million in just over a year, and cottages belonging to Cheltenham Ladies' College. Then Met Commissioner Sir Kenneth Newman criticised banks at the time, saying they had allowed the Brink's-Mat gang to become ""robber barons"". MPs said in 2018 that they were prepared to look at ways of forcing Jersey and Guernsey to introduce public registers of company ownership. It hasn't happened.

What are carbon credits?

Carbon credits sell customers the dream of buying their way out of the environmental crisis.

The idea is that green investments can cancel out the effects of polluting through projects like tree planting or stopping the deforestation of the Amazon. It is based on the concept that the ""polluter pays"" according to how much carbon they generate. This is sometimes known as carbon offsetting.

Some of the biggest companies in the world have used carbon credits as a way of trying to make up for the pollution they have created. The unregulated market was worth £1.6billion in 2021 with firms like Shell,

Disney and Gucci buying them as a way of trying to be ""carbon neutral"". But there is increasing evidence suggesting that many projects exaggerate the environmental benefits.

Larry Lohmann of the Corner House campaign group said: ""By allowing companies to buy offsets instead of reducing their emissions, government are allowing years of inaction before the industries in question begin to do what they have to do to deal with global warming. Worse, these credits do not always even represent verifiable reductions. They come from projects that merely claim to be saving carbon over what would have happened without the credit sales.""

Recent research into Verra, the leading certifier for carbon credits, found 90% of the rainforest credits do not represent genuine carbon reductions. Verra has questioned the methodology used and does not agree with the conclusions. They say their work since 2009 has seen billions of dollars channelled into preserving forests.

But today's Mirror investigation shows the lack of transparency in the market, with project owners hiding their identities behind offshore companies. Meanwhile, it is often not known how much money the projects generate, where the cash has gone and how much is invested in the land and those living on it.

Groundbreaking 7 Up! documentary star Nick Hitchon has died after sharing that he had been given a throat cancer diagnosis in 2019 and was told he would have a year to live

7 Up! documentary star Nick Hitchon has died after revealing he had a year to live following a throat cancer diagnosis in 2019.

Nick was one of the original stars of the programme in 1964. It followed the lives of a group of seven-year-olds as they all grew up across the UK - both rich, poor, rural and urban. Nick was a farmer's son and grew up in the Yorkshire Dales. He went on to become a nuclear fusion scientist and was a professor at the University of Wisconsin until retiring in June.

The documentary star sadly died in July aged 65 after a throat cancer diagnosis, which he shared with viewers when appearing on 63 Up in 2019. Nick said he was unlikely to live beyond the end of 2020. In Seven Up! Nick was first introduced to viewers when he was walking along a road near his home. He was quizzed about if he had a girlfriend, and gave the memorable response: ""I don't want to answer that. I don't answer those kind of questions.""

Nick clearly had an inkling of where his future career might take him, as he told cameras: ""When I grow up, I'd like to find out all about the moon and all that."" Seven Up! was originally planned to catch up with its 14 cast members in the year 2000, however it was decided they would check in with the stars ever seven years. 11 of the cast appeared in the latest follow up in 2019, on from 56 Up in 2012 and 49 Up in 2005.

TV and film director Michael Apted chose Nick to appear in the show, but initially found it hard to recruit a rural child who would talk on camera. Michael chanced upon Nick at his primary school, and he featured in the programme despite only being six when the show aired. Nick was the eldest of three boys and son of farmer Guy Hitchon and his wife Iona. In the first follow-up, Nick was a teenage boarder at a Yorkshire grammar school and had no interest in following his father into farming.

In 21 Up, Nick was studying physics at Merton College, Oxford. He hit out at how some viewers perceived him as a seven-year-old, saying: ""One of my friends had me pointed out to him as being destined to run the farm and being educationally pretty inept."" He shared that he had made a ""conscious effort to be more outgoing"". By the time the next documentary came around, Nick had made the move over to America.

He was working as assistant professor at Wisconsin University, which he had joined in 1982. Nick remained at the university until the end of his career. He married fellow Oxford student Jacqui Bush in 1979. On 28 Up, he shared: ""Trying to become a reasonably well-adjusted person was for me a bit of a struggle for a while and I was given a fantastic opportunity when I went to university, and that really saved my bacon.""

Nick later revealed he had welcomed a son, got divorced from his first wife, married a second time and shared the ailing health of his parents. By the time of 63 Up, both of his parents had passed away. In that series, Nick said: ""I'm still the same little kid, really. I think I can relate to that little guy who was all eager and all earnest trying to answer all the questions."" Nick was the second death among the original group, after when Lynn Johnson passed away in 2013. Michael Apted died in 2021, aged 79.

Faba beans, typically fed to animals, are believed to offer humans more enhanced nutritional benefits than soya beans

Beans ""in"" toast could revolutionise the British diet.

A new project has been set up to slip more UK-grown beans into our daily bread.

The 'Raising the Pulse' project plans to encourage consumers and food producers to switch to bread that contains broad beans to make it healthier and less damaging to the environment.

Unlike imported soya beans currently used in bread, broad beans, also known as fava or faba beans, grow in the UK.

They are high in easily digested protein, fibre, and iron, which are all nutrients that can be low in our diets.

However, despite it being an excellent alternative, the majority of faba beans grown in the UK are currently given to animals.

Five teams of researchers at the University of Reading, along with members of the public, farmers, industry, and policy makers, are working together to bring about one of the biggest changes to UK food in generations.

They hope to encourage farmers to switch some wheat producing land to grow faba beans for human consumption.

Professor Julie Lovegrove, who is leading the ""˜Raising the Pulse' research programme, said: ""We had to think laterally, ""˜What do most people eat and how can we improve their nutrition without them having to change their diets?' The obvious answer is bread.

""96 per cent of people in the UK eat bread, and 90 per cent of that is white bread, which in most cases contains soya.

""We've already performed some experiments and found that faba bean flour can directly replace imported soya flour and some of the wheat flour, which is low in nutrients.

""We can not only grow the faba beans here, but also produce and test the faba bean-rich bread, with improved nutritional quality.""

Matt Tebbit, who runs the University's catering service and leads the University's ""˜Menus for Change' research programme, said: ""Students will be asked to rate products made or enriched with faba bean, such as bread, flat bread, and hummus.

""They will be asked questions about how full they felt, for how long and their liking of the foods.

""It is hoped that faba bean will improve satiety, as well as providing enhanced nutritional benefits in products that are enjoyable to eat.""

The ""˜Raising the Pulse' project is estimated to cost £2 million and run over three years.

The project began on the 18 January and was published in the journal Nutrition Bulletin.
